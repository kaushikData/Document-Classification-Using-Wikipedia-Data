He taught for several years in France and produced a landmark book about the Cathedral of Notre Dame, \"Notre Dame of Paris,\" in 1955. He wrote architectural criticism for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" from 1961 to 1993. He also taught city planning and the social sciences at the University of California, Berkeley and California State University, Hayward (now California State University, East Bay).\n\nFollowing Finnish-born architect Eero Saarinen's death in 1961, Temko published \"Eero Saarinen\" (1962), a critical examination of Saarinen's most famous works from the General Motors Technical Center to the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial and its Gateway Arch (still in the planning stages at the time), as a volume in George Braziller's \"Makers of Contemporary Architecture\" series.\n\nTemko was an activist critic who defended the urban character and texture of San Francisco from, in his words, \"a variety of villains: real estate sharks, the construction industry and its unions, venal politicians, bureaucrats, brutal highway engineers, the automobile lobby, and – in some ways worst of all – incompetent architects and invertebrate planners who were wrecking the Bay Area before our eyes.\" One of these villains, an architect named Sandy Walker, famously sued Temko over his 1978 description of Walker's Pier 39 project which began, \"Corn. Kitsch. Schlock. Honky-tonk. Dreck. Schmaltz. Merde.\"\n\nTemko was instrumental in the removal of the Embarcadero Freeway and memorably described the 1971 Vaillancourt Fountain on the Embarcadero as a thing \"deposited by a concrete dog with square intestines.\"\n\nHe described the City Center Building in Hayward in the early 1970s, calling it a \"toaster\", due to its slightly elongated rectangular shape, which strongly influenced public opinion of the building.\n\nTemko, who met Jack Kerouac when they were both undergraduates at Columbia, appears in Kerouac's novel \"On the Road\" as the model for the character \"Roland Major\". Temko also appeared in Kerouac's \"Book of Dreams\" as Irving Minko and in \"Visions of Cody\" as Allen Minko.\n\nHe called for an international design competition for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, saying that both the single-tower cable-stayed scheme (favored by T.Y. Lin) and the single-masted self-anchored suspension design ultimately chosen were incapable of being \"a world-famous work of engineering art.\"\n\nTemko was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1990. He died of apparent congestive heart failure at the Orinda Convalescent Hospital in Orinda, California, in 2006.\n\n"}

Chartered in 2004, AUAF offers an MBA program, four undergraduate degree programs, and continuing education and professional development training (the Professional Development Institute).\n\nThe idea for AUAF began in 2002 with Dr. Sharif Fayez, then Afghan Minister of Higher Education. During his time as minister, he proposed the creation of Afghanistan’s first-ever private university. The following year in an address before UNESCO, United States First Lady Laura Bush announced her support of educational initiatives in Afghanistan. The United States Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, likely inspired from his own experience at The American University of Beirut, encouraged the establishment of The American University of Afghanistan.\nThe Afghanistan High Commission for Private Investment offered leases on two parcels of land totaling in the Darulaman area of Kabul until 2103. In addition, the non-profit American University of Afghanistan corporation was chartered in the State of Delaware, under the leadership of Dr. Jacob van Lutsenburg Maas, who later became the non-profit corporation's President, to receive these leases. (In 2007, the non-profit corporation became a tax-exempt 501(c) 3 organization).\n\nA charter for the establishment of The American University of Afghanistan was granted on July 26, 2004 by the Afghan Ministry of Higher Education, under Article 46, Chapter 2 of the new Afghan Constitution and Article 445 of the Civil Code. A feasibility study was initiated by the Coordinating Council of International Universities, based in the United States, to recommend an institutional framework.\n\nIn December 2004, the inaugural meeting of the Board of Trustees convened in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where Dr. Fayez was elected president pro tempore, serving in this capacity until April 2007, when he was named “founder” by the new president. He continues to lobby the Afghan government on the university's behalf, serves as an adviser to the current president, and maintains an office on campus.\n\nIn March 2005, then United States First Lady (and former teacher) Laura Bush visited the site and announced a substantial grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to launch the institution. USAID continues to be the primary financial backer of the organization as it pursues sources of private funding.\n\nThe first students of the American University of Afghanistan enrolled in March 2006. They began with classes to improve their English language and study skills. The university that September began offering its first credit-bearing undergraduate courses. In 2006 the Professional Development Institute was also launched, providing adult professional courses and adult professional level programs.\n\nOn June 8, 2008, Mrs. Bush announced an additional $40 million (USD) in funding for the subsequent five years. Funding will cover more than half of the university's operating expenses during that period, leaving the university to pursue private funding for the remainder of its operating expenses and for the development of its new campus.\n\nThe university held its first commencement ceremony on May 26, 2011, awarding undergraduate degrees to 32 graduates. It held its fourth, and largest, graduation on December 5, 2014, where 180 undergraduate and graduate students graduated. On May 22, 2015, the university held its sixth commencement ceremony, honoring the class of 2015, at the university’s International campus. The highlight of the ceremony was the presentation of the Doctorate of Humane Letters Honorary Degree to distinguished guest H.E. Hamid Karzai, the former president of Afghanistan, who also delivered the commencement address. Currently, more than 2,000 full and part-time students from all 34 provinces of Afghanistan are now enrolled in the university, including 1,190 students in undergraduate and graduate program, and 950 students in certification courses. About 35.9% of students for Spring 2015 are women, and more than 85% of the students receive financial assistance. In an interview with Film Annex, Dr. C. Michael Smith, former President of the American University of Afghanistan stated that for the 2012-13 school year over 50% of the entering students were women.\n\nTwo employees were killed as a result of a Taliban gun and bomb attack on a popular restaurant in Kabul where the employees were dining in January 2014. Some 21 people reportedly died in the attack.\n\nLexie Kamerman, 27, of Chicago, was one of the American University employees killed in the 2014 attack in Kabul.\n\nAn American and Australian professor were kidnapped on 7 August 2016, by men dressed in Afghan National Police uniforms. American special forces later failed in an operation to try and rescue them.\n\nOn the evening of August 24, 2016, two gunmen opened fire and detonated explosives on campus killing eight university students, three policemen, three security guards at the university, two university professors, and a guard from a neighboring school. Fraidoon Obaidi, chief of Kabul police's criminal investigation department, said police were able to kill the attackers. No group has yet claimed responsibility.\n\nAll programs are conducted entirely in English. The university runs on the U.S. semester system with the academic year starting in August, and in other respects also operates in the style of American universities.\n\n\nAUAF in fall 2011 began its first graduate program, offering the master of business administration degree. This program builds on the success of the university's undergraduate business program, which is the most popular major among AUAF students. A total of 29 students were admitted in the first MBA class. The program is offered with a world-class curriculum taught by internationally qualified faculty with expertise in global business practices. It is now offering students an opportunity to pursue an optional bi-annual concentration program in Finance or Management. This special addition to the core curriculum gives students a unique opportunity to experience an enriched MBA program and gain additional knowledge. The program comprises 14 credit courses that provide a comprehensive view of general business management. Classes are admitted on a cohort basis. Each cohort progresses through an established sequence of courses that first develop the concepts, tools, and techniques used in “best-practices” organizations. The MBA program begins each fall. The first cohort graduated in May 2013. On May 22, 2015 a total of 59 students graduated from MBA.\nMasters of Arts in Education program was launched at AUAF in March 2014. It was a collaborative effort with Afghan Ministry of Education Teacher Training Directorate, and with funding from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and the World Bank. On April 17, 2015, AUAF held the graduation ceremony for the inaugural cohort of students in this program. The program included 318 students (23% female), representing all of the country's 34 provinces.\n\n\nThe American University of Afghanistan currently offers four-year undergraduate degree programs in business administration with concentrations in management, accounting, finance and marketing, information technology and computer science, and political science and public administration. Through required general studies in their first two years of undergraduate study, all students acquire knowledge in English composition, mathematics, the natural sciences, arts and humanities, and the social sciences. The department of Business provides students with theories and concepts related to international, world-class business practices, and seeks to graduate students who will be competitive in domestic and international firms. Students gain in-depth knowledge of information systems, software design, development and scientific approaches in ITCS. A combination of political science and public administration exposes students to the subfields of political science in addition to field of public administration. The law program provides in-depth exposure to all major areas of law. Graduates will be qualified to enter the court system, private legal practice, government and business. To graduate from the Undergraduate Program, students must complete a total of 120 credits, from both General Education and Major-specific requirements. AUAF held its sixth commencement ceremony of class 2015, on May 22, 2015.\n\nIn fall 2008, Stanford Law School's Afghanistan Legal Education Project was launched at the university. It provides introductory legal training that features the first new text in decades dedicated to the legal system in Afghanistan. In September 2012, AUAF and Stanford University received a $7.2 million grant for this program from the US State Department.\n\n\nThe American University of Afghanistan’s Professional Development Institute was established in 2006 to meet the training needs of professionals in Afghanistan and the region. It offers an array of high-impact, high-value training courses, workshops, and seminars to professionals from private sector, government, and non-governmental organizations working in Afghanistan and the region. PDI’s specialized, non-degree courses are designed to improve both language and workplace skills, including management and leadership training. PDI offers a broad range of training and education courses throughout Afghanistan to private business, non-profit organizations, NGOs, government agencies and individuals. The institute draws on the expertise of the world-class faculty at the American university of Afghanistan and others to provide courses tailored to specific needs as well as courses offered on an open enrollment basis. The English Language Center within the institute provides a comprehensive range of English language training for non-native speakers. PDI administers short-term courses in accounting, finance, project management, human resources management, and information technologies. The Business unit now offers training and exam prep courses in ACCA and FIA. The institute is the only ACCA golden member in Afghanistan. The IT program offers a variety of technology training: Cisco, Comp TIA, ICDL, Microsoft, Oracle, and Redhat among others.\n\nThe PDI currently has four regional centers in Herat, Kandahar, and Balkh and Nangarhar provinces. The Centers are fully equipped with state of art facilities.\n\nThe overall governance and management of AUAF is overseen by the Board of Trustees. The board has fiduciary responsibility for the university and makes all policy decisions to achieve its vision and mission. The board consists of leading members of the academic, business, and political communities in Afghanistan and the United States.\n\nThe president is responsible for implementing the policies of the board and for the overall administration of the university.\n\nThe first president of the university was president pro tempore Sharif Fayez, Afghanistan's Minister of Higher Education from 2002 to 2004. In January 2015, Dr. Mark A. English assumed leadership of the university as President. Dr. C. Michael Smith stepped down after nearly six years of exceptional service. The university's provost is Dr. Timor Saffary.\n\nThe campus of the American University of Afghanistan is located on Darulaman Road in Kabul, Afghanistan. The current campus operates on the site of the former American International School of Kabul. A large tract of land immediately across the road from the current campus, and running south to the Dar-ul-Amman Palace is currently being developed for campus expansion.\n\nPrincipal academic buildings on the campus are the Azizi Building, which houses classrooms and faculty offices; the Bayat Building, which houses administration offices and classrooms; and the Multi Purpose Academic Building, which houses the Bernice Nachman Marlowe Library, science and computer labs, and classrooms. This building also contains the Abdul Madjid Zabuli real-presence videoconferencing system. Other buildings on campus include the Michael Bayat Gymnasium, the Faculty Office Buildings, two Masjids (for men and women), Yummy fast food, and the AUAF Cafeteria.\n\nThe International Center for Afghan Women’s Economic Development (ICAWED) also known as the Women's Center, a $5 million, state-of-the-art facility designed coordinate and incorporate women in Afghanistan’s economy. The Women’s Center is a pioneering institution dedicated to advancing the role of women in Afghanistan’s economy, located at the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) in Kabul. ICAWED was established in 2013 with the aim to empower women in the economic sector and with the belief that women in Afghanistan hold the key to unlocking new economic growth and opportunity.\nThe Women’s Center’s mission is to promote, collaborate, connect, and catalyze so that the idea of empowering women through economic development continues to become a reality to secure the region’s future.\n\nBusiness Innovation Hub (BIH) was founded in November 2013 as an initiative of the American University of Afghanistan. BIH is located at the International campus of AUAF. BIH is a business accelerator that provides a variety of business and transaction advisory services designed to help Afghan businesses in all sectors to reach their full potential. BIH is staffed by a team of Afghan and international consultants who have extensive local and international business experience.\n\n"}

It is based on the Columbine High School shootings of which Robinson is a survivor. The film was shot at Plattsmouth High School in Plattsmouth, Nebraska in May 2008.\n\nIn the aftermath of a school shooting, several survivors have evacuated to the elementary school to wait for more survivors to arrive. A senior named Sean Ryan calls his friend Vicki at a coffee shop, who tells him that the shooter is Ben Harris, a friend of Sean's. Sean is left speechless.\n\nThat morning, before the massacre begins, a student named Jason is being bullied and is struggling to pick up his books, but then Sean helps him. Sean reminds Jason that school is almost over and that he shouldn't let the bullying get to him. The two then go into their school, Jefferson High School; both are seniors there. It is a Monday, and Sean, his best friend Nick, and a few other students, are working on the school play. Sean learns that his friend Ben Harris, who works the lights, is absent, so Jason substitutes for him.\n\nLater, during a lunch period, Sean talks to his math teacher, Martin Blackwell, about the crush he has on his friend, April Lauren. Mr. Blackwell tells him to let her know how he feels about her. Suddenly, the fire alarm rings, and everyone assumes that it is a senior prank. However, as they leave, they hear low rumbling. Mr. Blackwell and Sean then see a group of students, running for their lives and screaming. Three gunshots are heard, and everyone immediately realizes that someone is shooting a gun inside the school. Mr. Blackwell takes a group of students back into his classroom to hide, while Sean and Nick decide to flee for their lives, taking a panicked girl named Samantha (\"Sam\") with them.\n\nMeanwhile, Jason is left to fend for himself, but he does manage to make it out of the school, carrying out the body of a dead girl in the process. Mr. Blackwell eventually decides to take his group of students and flee, but as they do, the shooter shoots him in the back from behind. Mr. Blackwell tells the students to run, but one student, Jonathan, instead drags Mr. Blackwell back into the math classroom. Jonathan attempts to save his life, but after several minutes, Mr. Blackwell tells him to wait in the closet until help arrives. Sean, Nick, Sam, and a few other students including their friend Mike, stumble upon a suburban area where the injured have evacuated. While searching for April, Sean runs into April's best friend, Jessica, who tells him that the police are having survivors congregate at an elementary school. Sean, Nick, and Mike then decide to go with Jessica.\n\nMeanwhile, a SWAT team enters the school through the main entrance. A single gunshot is then heard, implying that the shooter has committed suicide. While searching, the police find Jonathan, but Jonathan is shocked to learn that Mr. Blackwell has died of his wounds. Jonathan goes into hysterics and blames himself for not doing anything to save him. The film then returns to the beginning scene, where Sean learns that the shooter is Ben. Sean is shocked after learning this, but Nick takes it the hardest, refusing to believe that Ben would cause any trouble. The last group of survivors then arrives, and Sean searches frantically for April. However, a teacher, Sally Reedman, comes in and informs Sean that April is dead.\n\nSean struggles to cope with April's death, and Jason learns that the security cameras at school captured him carrying the dead girl out, and that he is being hailed as a hero. Later, Sean learns that fourteen people, including Mr. Blackwell, April, and Ben, are dead. April's car is turned into a memorial, and a TV executive, Helen Mann, tries to help Jason cope with his dilemma by introducing him to Sam, believing she was the girl that Jason carried out, but Jason says that it wasn't her. The next night, as everyone learns Ben's motives for the shooting, Sean has a flashback about how when he was unable to tell April about his feelings for her. This flashback causes him to break a mirror, cutting his hand in the process. Sean's father later takes him home.\n\nMeanwhile, Jason's situation spirals out of control, causing him to have a mental breakdown in the middle of a grocery store. He later reveals to Sean that he doesn't believe himself to be a hero because he feels that he is responsible for the death of Matt, a student who bullied him. Later, Nick is released from police custody after falsely being suspected of helping Ben plan the shooting. He says goodbye to Sean and he and his family move away. Meanwhile, Jason commits suicide, unable to take any more of his \"fame.\"\n\nAt April's funeral, Jessica gives Sean April's diary. After Sally, Jessica, and Sean perform eulogies for their fallen friend, Sean goes to April's grave and starts crying.\n\nDuring the credits, the list of several school shootings from the past (including Columbine and Virginia Tech) are shown, along with the victims of the massacres. A message is then displayed about how officers are now trained to set up a perimeter and move toward gunfire in a school shooting situation since Columbine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "412481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=412481", "title": "Christina Hoff Sommers", "text": "Christina Hoff Sommers\n\nChristina Marie Hoff Sommers (born September 28, 1950) is an American author and philosopher. Specializing in ethics, she is currently a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Sommers is known for her critique of contemporary feminism. Her work includes the books \"Who Stole Feminism?\" (1994) and \"The War Against Boys\" (2000), and her writing has been featured in a variety of media outlets, including \"The New York Times\", \"Time\" magazine, and \"The Atlantic\". She also hosts a video blog called \"The Factual Feminist\".\n\nSommers' positions and writing have been characterized by the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" as \"equity feminism\", a classical-liberal or libertarian feminist perspective holding that the main political role of feminism is to ensure that the right against coercive interference is not infringed. Sommers has contrasted equity feminism with \"victim feminism\" and \"gender feminism\", arguing that modern feminist thought often contains an \"irrational hostility to men\" and possesses an \"inability to take seriously the possibility that the sexes are equal but different\".\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers was born September 28, 1950 in Sonoma County, California. She is Jewish. She earned a BA at New York University in 1971, and a PhD in philosophy from Brandeis University in 1979.\n\nSommers said in 2014 that she is a registered Democrat \"with libertarian leanings\". She describes equity feminism as the struggle based upon Enlightenment principles of individual justice for equal legal and civil rights and many of the original goals of the early feminists, as in the first wave of the women's movement. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy categorizes equity feminism as libertarian or classically liberal. She characterizes gender feminism as having transcended the liberalism of early feminists so that instead of focusing on rights for all, gender feminists view society through the sex/gender prism and focus on recruiting women to join the struggle against patriarchy. \"Reason\" reviewed \"Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women\" and characterized gender feminism as the action of accenting the differences of genders in order to create what Sommers believes is privilege for women in academia, government, industry, or the advancement of personal agendas.\n\nSommers is a longtime critic of Women's Studies departments, and of university curricula in general. In an interview with freelance journalist Scott London, Sommers said, \"The perspective now, from my point of view, is that the better things get for women, the angrier the women's studies professors seem to be, the more depressed Gloria Steinem seems to get.\" While some authors have called her works and positions anti-feminist, Sommers rejects such claims.\n\nAccording to \"The Nation\", Sommers explains to her students that statistically challenged feminists in women's studies departments engage in \"bad scholarship to advance their liberal agenda\" and are peddling a skewed and incendiary message: \"Women are from Venus, men are from Hell.\"\n\nSommers has written about Title IX and the shortage of women in STEM fields. She opposes recent efforts to apply Title IX to the sciences because \"Science is not a sport. In science, men and women play on the same teams. ... There are many brilliant women in the top ranks of every field of science and technology, and no one doubts their ability to compete on equal terms.\" Sommers writes that Title IX programs in the sciences could stigmatize women and cheapen their hard-earned achievements. She adds that personal preference, not sexist discrimination, plays a role in women's career choices. Sommers believes that not only do women favor fields like biology, psychology, and veterinary medicine over physics and mathematics, but they also seek out more family-friendly careers. She has written that \"the real problem most women scientists confront is the challenge of combining motherhood with a high-powered science career.\"\n\nSommers supports legally recognizing same-sex marriages, and has called abortion \"a fundamental moral dilemma\".\n\nFrom 1978 to 1980, Sommers was an instructor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. In 1980, she became an assistant professor of philosophy at Clark University, and was promoted to associate professor in 1986. Sommers remained at Clark until 1997, when she became the W.H Brady fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nDuring the mid-1980s, Sommers edited two philosophy textbooks on the subject of ethics: \"Vice & Virtue in Everyday Life: Introductory Readings in Ethics\" (1984) and \"Right and Wrong: Basic Readings in Ethics\" (1986). Reviewing \"Vice and Virtue\" for \"Teaching Philosophy\" in 1990, Nicholas Dixon wrote that the book was \"extremely well edited\" and \"particularly strong on the motivation for studying virtue and ethics in the first place, and on theoretical discussions of virtue and vice in general.\"\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, Sommers published a series of articles in which she strongly criticized feminist philosophers and American feminism in general In a 1988 \"Public Affairs Quarterly\" article titled \"Should the Academy Support Academic Feminism?\", Sommers wrote that \"the intellectual and moral credentials of academic feminism badly want scrutiny,\" and asserted that \"the tactics used by academic feminists have all been employed at one time or another to further other forms of academic imperialism.\" In articles titled \"The Feminist Revelation\" and \"Philosophers against the Family,\" which she published during the early 1990s, Sommers argued that many academic feminists were \"radical philosophers\" who sought dramatic social and cultural change - such as the abolition of the nuclear family - and thus revealed their contempt for the actual wishes of the \"average woman.\" These articles would form the basis for \"Who Stole Feminism?\"\n\nSommers is a member of the Board of Advisors of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. She has served on the national advisory board of the Independent Women's Forum and the Center of the American Experiment. Sommers has written articles for \"Time\" magazine, \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Atlantic\", \"Slate\", and \"The New York Times\". At the AEI she currently makes the weekly \"Factual Feminist\" video blog. Sommers has created several short videos for the conservative website Prager University. Her videos focus on feminism and gender equality.\n\nIn \"Who Stole Feminism\", Sommers outlines her distinction between \"gender feminism\", which she regards as being the dominant contemporary approach to feminism, and \"equity feminism\", which she presents as more akin to first-wave feminism. She uses the work to argue that contemporary feminism is too radical and disconnected from the lives of typical American women, presenting her equity feminism alternative as a better match for their needs. In criticizing contemporary feminism, Sommers writes that an often-mentioned March of Dimes study which says that \"domestic violence is the leading cause of birth defects\", does not exist, and that violence against women does not peak during the Super Bowl, which she describes as an urban legend, arguing that such statements about domestic violence helped shape the Violence Against Women Act, which initially allocated $1.6 billion a year in federal funds for ending domestic violence against women. Similarly, she argues that feminists assert that approximately 150,000 women die each year from anorexia, an apparent distortion of the American Anorexia and Bulimia Association's figure that 150,000 females have some degree of anorexia.\n\nMelanie Kirkpatrick, writing for \"The Wall Street Journal\", praised the book for its \"lack of a political agenda\", and said \"Sommers simply lines up her facts and shoots one bull's-eye after another\". In contrast, Laura Flanders of the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), panned Sommers's book as being \"filled with the same kind of errors, unsubstantiated charges and citations of 'advocacy research' that she claims to find in the work of the feminists she takes to task ...\" Sommers responded to FAIR's criticisms in a letter to the editor of FAIR's monthly magazine, \"EXTRA!\"\n\nIn 2000, Sommers published \"The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men.\" In the book, Sommers challenged what she called the \"myth of shortchanged girls\" and the \"new and equally corrosive fiction\" that \"boys as a group are disturbed.\" Criticizing programs which had been set up in the 1980s to encourage girls and young women - largely in response to studies which had suggested that girls \"suffering through neglect in the classroom and the indifference of male-dominated society\" - Sommers argued in \"The War Against Boys\" that such programs were based on flawed research, arguing that it was just the other way around: boys were a year and a half behind girls in reading and writing and less likely to go to college.\n\nShe blamed Carol Gilligan as well as organizations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) for creating a situation in which \"boys are resented, both as the unfairly privileged sex and as obstacles on the path to gender justice for girls.\" According to Sommers, \"a review of the facts shows boys, not girls, on the weak side of an education gender gap.\"\n\nSommers wrote, \"We are turning against boys and forgetting a simple truth: that the energy, competitiveness, and corporal daring of normal, decent males is responsible for much of what is right in the world.\" Australian cultural studies professor Tara Brabazon wrote that with these words, \"Sommers becomes the ventriloquist's dummy for male educational professors.\"\n\nThe book received mixed reviews. In conservative publications such as the \"National Review\" and \"Commentary\", \"The War Against Boys\" was praised for its \"stinging indictment of an anti-male movement that has had a pervasive influence on the nation's schools.\" and for identifying \"a problem in urgent need of redress.\" Writing in \"The New York Times\", opinion columnist Richard Bernstein called it a \"thoughtful, provocative book,\" and suggested that Sommers had made her arguments \"persuasively and unflinchingly, and with plenty of data to support them.\" Joy Summers, in \"The Journal of School Choice\", said that 'Sommers’ book and her public voice are in themselves a small antidote to the junk science girding our typically commonsense-free, utterly ideological national debate on “women’s issues.' \"Publishers Weekly\" suggested that Sommers' conclusions were \"compelling\" and \"deserve an unbiased hearing,\" while also noting that Sommers \"descends into pettiness when she indulges in mudslinging at her opponents.\" Similarly, a review in \"Booklist\" suggested that while Sommers \"argues cogently that boys are having major problems in school,\" the book was unlikely to convince all readers \"that these problems are caused by the American Association of University Women, Carol Gilligan, Mary Pipher, and William S. Pollack,\" all of whom were strongly criticized in the book. Ultimately, the review suggested, \"Sommers is as much of a crisismonger as those she critiques.\"\n\nIn a review of \"The War Against Boys\" for \"The New York Times\", child psychiatrist Robert Coles wrote that Sommers \"speaks of our children, yet hasn't sought them out; instead she attends those who have, in fact, worked with boys and girls--and in so doing is quick to look askance at Carol Gilligan's ideas about girls, [William] Pollack's about boys.\" Much of the book, according to Coles, \"comes across as Sommers's strongly felt war against those two prominent psychologists, who have spent years trying to learn how young men and women grow to adulthood in the United States.\" Reviewing the book for \"The New Yorker,\" Nicholas Lemann wrote that Sommers \"sets the research bar considerably higher for the people she is attacking than she does for herself,\" using an \"odd, ambushing style of refutation, in which she demands that data be provided to her and questions answered, and then, when the flummoxed person on the other end of the line stammers helplessly, triumphantly reports that she got 'em.\" Lemann faulted Sommers for accusing Gilligan of using anecdotal argument when her own book \"rests on an anecdotal base,\" and for making numerous assertions that were not supported by the footnotes in her book.\n\nWriting in \"The Washington Post,\" E. Anthony Rotundo stated that \"in the end, Sommers ... does not show that there is a 'war against boys.' All she can show is that feminists are attacking her 'boys-will-be-boys' concept of boyhood, just as she attacks their more flexible notion.\" Sommers's title, according to Rotundo, \"is not just wrong but inexcusably misleading... a work of neither dispassionate social science nor reflective scholarship; it is a conservative polemic.\"\n\nThe National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) awarded Sommers with one of its twelve 2013 Exceptional Merit in Media Awards for her \"The New York Times\" article, \"The Boys at the Back\". In their description of the winners, NWPC states, \"Author Christina Sommers asks whether we should allow girls to reap the advantages of a new knowledge based service economy and take the mantle from boys, or should we acknowledge the roots of feminism and strive for equal education for all?\"\n\nSommers married Fred Sommers, the Harry A. Wolfson Chair in Philosophy at Brandeis University, in 1981, and was widowed in 2014. She has two sons.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many schools use these games as a fun way to teach their students about the states, provinces, territories, and cities. The game is published by Ingenuity Works, a Vancouver-based company originally known as Didatech Software.\nIn most of the games, the player will drive an 18-wheeler to pick up and deliver commodities to the cities assigned, while making decisions about the best route, when to eat, sleep, fill up gas, etc.\n\nThis was the first game in the series, released in 1985 by Didatech Software (later renamed to Ingenuity Works). Educational Software Reviews deemed it \"the type of game you can play for a full hour without getting tired.\" Developed for the PC, the purpose of the game is to pick up commodities from one city and deliver them to another by driving across the country. Players interacted with the game through a command line using commands such as \"turn on truck\".\n\nThis was the second game in the series, released in 1986 for the Apple II by Didatech Software, and later ported to DOS in 1991. Home of the Underdogs deemed it \"One of the best edutainment titles ever made\".<br>\nThis title has since been made available on several websites, free-to-play.\n\nAs titled, players of this game are restricted to the boundaries of California. The gameplay was similar to Crosscountry USA.\n\nThe game was the first geography simulation to be designed specifically for Texas schools. The game contained simulated travel from city to city throughout Texas. The game sees players travel to 135 cities and collect up to 55 commodities; the game requires 128K to run, and the school version includes a back-up disk and a teacher 's manual. This version was created without the state's involvement, similar to California, and in contrast to North Dakota. According to Paul Melhus, president of Didatech, the simulation of Texas was designed to be as realistic as possible. The game was not used in Del Rio, as school officials noted the limited use of computers within education. The title was released onto DOS and the Apple II. The paper \"Technology: Window to the Future. Proceedings of the Annual State Conference of the Texas Computer Education Association\" noted that the game was more attractive to Texan teachers than Crosscountry USA due to the \"proximity and familiarity with the content\".\n\nIn October 1992, Didatech announced a deal with the North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction to create a state-specific version of the software for the state's schools.The state would provide statistical data to adapt Cross Country USA to a North Dakotan edition. Didatech estimated a production schedule of 100 hours, much quicker than the year taken for the USA version. This came off the heels of the targeted versions Canada, California, and Texas. The game was unique in that Didatech worked with the state's officials directly in production, while the Texas and Californian versions were created without the states' input. At the time of the announcement, Didatech was arranging deals similar to the North Dakotan one with Illinois, Virginia, Ontario, and British Colombia. the game was released onto the Apple II, while a DOS version was being worked on for release the following year. The Computer Paper felt the project \"makes the most of what the small firm has\".\n\nThat game had turned out to be cost-effective; the state invested $45,000 and supplied information for the software maker to use, while Didatech produced the game and manual. Didatech sold a school version of the software to the state, which then sold it directly to schools; meanwhile Didatech would sell a separate retail version through its traditional retail channels. The cost per school was only $65, verses $350 for the site license of a national title. Didatech president Paul Melhus asserted that this type of collaboration was better suited to smaller states due to them being less bureaucratic, more flexible, and more open to innovation.\n\nThis formula was later followed with \"Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?\".\n\nThe game was added to incorporate the new territory of Nunavut and the Confederation Bridge in Prince Edward Island.\n\nThe game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works.\n\nThis game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works.

{"id": "7015560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7015560", "title": "English Education Act 1835", "text": "English Education Act 1835\n\nThe English Education Act was a legislative Act of the Council of India in 1835 giving effect to a decision in 1835 by Lord William Bentinck,then Governor-General of British India, to reallocate funds the East India Company was required by the British Parliament to spend on education and literature in India. Formerly, they had supported traditional Muslim and Hindu education and the publication of literature in the native learned tongues (Sanskrit and Persian); henceforward they were to support establishments teaching a Western curriculum with English as the language of instruction. Together with other measures promoting English as the language of administration and of the higher law courts (replacing Persian), this led eventually to English becoming one of the languages of India, rather than simply the native tongue of its foreign rulers.\n\nIn discussions leading up to the Act Thomas Babington Macaulay produced his famous Memorandum on (Indian) Education which was scathing on the inferiority (as he saw it) of native (particularly Hindu) culture and learning. He argued that Western learning was superior, and currently could only be taught through the medium of English. There was therefore a need to produce - by English-language higher education -\" a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect\" who could in their turn develop the tools to transmit Western learning in the vernacular languages of India. Among Macaulay's recommendations were the immediate stopping of the printing by the East India Company of Arabic and Sanskrit books and that the Company should not continue to support traditional education beyond \"the Sanscrit College at Benares and the Mahometan College at Delhi\" (which he considered adequate to maintain traditional learning).\n\nThe Act itself, however, took a less negative attitude to traditional education and was soon succeeded by further measures based upon the provision of adequate funding for both approaches. Vernacular language education, however, continued to receive little funding, although it had not been much supported before 1835 in any case.\n\nWhen the British Parliament had renewed the charter of the East India Company for 20 years in 1813, it had required the Company to apply 100,000 rupees per year \"for the revival and promotion of literature and the encouragement of the learned natives of India, and for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences among the inhabitants of the British territories.\" This had gone to support traditional forms (and content) of education, which (like their contemporary equivalents in England) were firmly non-utilitarian.\nBy the early 1820s some administrators within the East India Company were questioning if this was a sensible use of the money. James Mill noted that the declared purpose of the Madrassa (Mohammedan College) and the Hindu College in Calcutta set up by the company had been \"to make a favourable impression, by our encouragement of their literature, upon the minds of the natives\" but took the view that the aim of the company should have been to further not Oriental learning but \"useful learning.\" Indeed, private enterprise colleges had begun to spring up in Bengal teaching Western knowledge in English (\"English education\"), to serve a native clientele which felt it would be more important that their sons learnt to understand the English than that they were taught to appreciate classic poetry.\nBroadly similar issues (‘classical education’ vs ‘liberal education’) had already arisen for education in England with existing grammar schools being unwilling (or legally unable) to give instruction in subjects other than Latin or Greek and were to end in an expansion of their curriculum to include modern subjects. In the Indian situation a complicating factor was that the 'classical education' reflected the attitudes and beliefs of the various traditions in the sub-continent, 'English education' clearly did not, and there was felt to be a danger of an adverse reaction among the existing learned classes of India to any withdrawal of support for them.\nThis led to divided counsels within the Committee of Public Instruction. Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was Legal Member of the Council of India, and was to be President of the Committee, refused to take up the post until the matter was resolved, and sought a clear directive from the Governor-General on the strategy to be adopted.\n\nIt should have been clear what answer Macaulay was seeking, given his past comments. In 1833 in the House of Commons Macaulay (then MP for Leeds), had spoken in favour of renewal of the Company's charter, in terms which make his own views on the culture and society of the sub-continent adequately clear:\nI see a government anxiously bent on the public good. Even in its errors I recognize a paternal feeling towards the great people committed to its charge. I see toleration strictly maintained. Yet I see bloody and degrading superstitions gradually losing their power. I see the morality, the philosophy, the taste of Europe, beginning to produce a salutary effect on the hearts and understandings of our subjects. I see the public mind of India, that public mind which we found debased and contracted by the worst forms of political and religious tyranny, expanding itself to just and noble views of the ends of government and of the social duties of man.\n\nFinishing with a peroration holding it a moral imperative to educate the Indians in English ways, not to keep them submissive but to give them the potential eventually to claim the same rights as the English:\n\nWhat is that power worth which is founded on vice, on ignorance, and on misery—which we can hold only by violating the most sacred duties which as governors we owe to the governed—which as a people blessed with far more than an ordinary measure of political liberty and of intellectual light—we owe to a race debased by three thousand years of despotism and priest craft? We are free, we are civilized, to little purpose, if we grudge to any portion of the human race an equal measure of freedom and civilization.\n\nAre we to keep the people of India ignorant in order that we may keep them submissive? Or do we think that we can give them knowledge without awakening ambition? Or do we mean to awaken ambition and to provide it with no legitimate vent? Who will answer any of these questions in the affirmative? Yet one of them must be answered in the affirmative, by every person who maintains that we ought permanently to exclude the natives from high office. I have no fears. The path of duty is plain before us: and it is also the path of wisdom, of national prosperity, of national honour.\n\nThe destinies of our Indian empire are covered with thick darkness. It is difficult to form any conjecture as to the fate reserved for a state which resembles no other in history, and which forms by itself a separate class of political phenomena. The laws which regulate its growth and its decay are still unknown to us. It may be that the public mind of India may expand under our system till it has outgrown that system; that by good government we may educate our subjects into a capacity for better government, that, having become instructed in European knowledge, they may, in some future age, demand European institutions. Whether such a day will ever come I know not. But never will I attempt to avert or to retard it. Whenever it comes, it will be the proudest day in English history. To have found a great people sunk in the lowest depths of slavery and superstition, to have so ruled them as to have made them desirous and capable of all the privileges of citizens would indeed be a title to glory all our own.\n\nThe sceptre may pass away from us. Unforeseen accidents may derange our most profound schemes of policy Victory may be inconstant to our arms. But there are triumphs which are followed by no reverses. There is an empire exempt from all natural causes of decay. Those triumphs are the pacific triumphs of reason over barbarism; that empire is the imperishable empire of our arts and our morals, our literature and our laws.\n\nTo remove all doubt, however, Macaulay produced and circulated a Minute on the subject. Macaulay argued that support for the publication of books in Sanskrit and Arabic should be withdrawn, support for traditional education should be reduced to funding for the Madrassa at Delhi and the Hindu College at Benares, but students should no longer be paid to study at these establishments. The money released by these steps should instead go to fund education in Western subjects, with English as the language of instruction. He summarised his argument:\n\nTo sum up what I have said, I think it is clear that we are not fettered by the Act of Parliament of 1813; that we are not fettered by any pledge expressed or implied; that we are free to employ our funds as we choose; that we ought to employ them in teaching what is best worth knowing; that English is better worth knowing than Sanskrit or Arabic; that the natives are desirous to be taught English, and are not desirous to be taught Sanskrit or Arabic; that neither as the languages of law, nor as the languages of religion, have the Sanskrit and Arabic any peculiar claim to our engagement; that it is possible to make natives of this country thoroughly good English scholars, and that to this end our efforts ought to be directed.\n\nMacaulay’s comparison of Arabic and Sanskrit literature to what was available in English is forceful, colourful, and nowadays often quoted against him.\n\nI have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. ... I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia. Honours might be roughly even in works of the imagination, such as poetry, but when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded, and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable.\"\n\nHe returned to the comparison later:\n\nWhoever knows [English] has ready access to all the vast intellectual wealth, which all the wisest nations of the earth have created and hoarded in the course of ninety generations. It may be safely said, that the literature now extant in that language is of far greater value than all the literature which three hundred years ago was extant in all the languages of the world together.\n\nThe question now before us is simply whether, when it is in our power to teach this language, we shall teach languages, by which, by universal confession, there are not books on any subject which deserve to be compared to our own; whether, when we can teach European science, we shall teach systems which, by universal confession, whenever they differ from those of Europe, differ for the worse; and whether, when we can patronise sound Philosophy and true History, we shall countenance, at the public expense, medical doctrines, which would disgrace an English farrier, --Astronomy, which would move laughter in girls at an English boarding school,--History, abounding with kings thirty feet high, and reigns thirty thousand years long,--and Geography, made up of seas of treacle and seas of butter.\n\nMass education would be (in the fullness of time) by the class of Anglicised Indians the new policy should produce, and by the means of vernacular dialects:\n\nIn one point I fully agree with the gentlemen to whose general views I am opposed. I feel with them, that it is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.\n\nBentink writing that he was in full agreement with the sentiments expressed. However, students at the Calcutta Madrassa raised a petition against its closure; this quickly got considerable support and the Madrassa and its Hindu equivalent were therefore retained. Otherwise the Act endorsed and implemented the policy Macaulay had argued for. \nThe Governor-General of India in Council has attentively considered the two letters from the Secretary to the Committee of Public Instruction, dated the 21st and 22nd January last, and the papers referred to in them.\n\nFirst, His Lordship in Council is of opinion that the great object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of European literature and science among the natives of India; and that all the funds appropriated for the purpose of education would be best employed on English education alone.\n\nSecond, But it is not the intention of His Lordship in Council to abolish any College or School of native learning, while the native population shall appear to be inclined to avail themselves of the advantages which it affords, and His Lordship in Council directs that all the existing professors and students at all the institutions under the superintendence of the Committee shall continue to receive their stipends. But his lordship in Council decidedly objects to the practice which has hitherto prevailed of supporting the students during the period of their education. He conceives that the only effect of such a system can be to give artificial encouragement to branches of learning which, in the natural course of things, would be superseded by more useful studies and he directs that no stipend shall be given to any student that may hereafter enter at any of these institutions; and that when any professor of Oriental learning shall vacate his situation, the Committee shall report to the Government the number and state of the class in order that the Government may be able to decide upon the expediency of appointing a successor.\n\nThird, It has come to the knowledge of the Governor-General in Council that a large sum has been expended by the Committee on the printing of Oriental works; his Lordship in Council directs that no portion of the funds shall hereafter be so employed.\n\nFourth, His Lordship in Council directs that all the funds which these reforms will leave at the disposal of the Committee be henceforth employed in imparting to the native population a knowledge of English literature and science through the medium of the English language; and His lordship,\n\nOn the news of the Act reaching England, a despatch giving the official response of the Company's Court of Directors was drafted within India House (the company's London office). James Mill was a leading figure within the India House (as well as being a leading utilitarian philosopher). Although he was known to favour education in the vernacular languages of India, otherwise he might have been expected to be broadly in favour of the Act. However, he was by then a dying man, and the task of drafting the response fell to his son John Stuart Mill. The younger Mill was thought to hold similar views to his father, but his draft despatch turned out to be quite critical of the Act.\n\nMill argued that students seeking an 'English education' in order to prosper could simply acquire enough of the requisite practical accomplishments (facility in English etc.) to prosper without bothering to acquire the cultural attitudes; for example it did not follow that at the same time they would also free themselves from superstition. Even if they did the current learned classes of India commanded widespread respect in Indian culture, and that one of the reasons they did so was the lack of practical uses for their learning; they were pursuing learning as an end in itself, rather than as a means to advancement. The same could not reliably said of those seeking an 'English education', and therefore it was doubtful how they would be regarded by Indian society and therefore how far they would be able to influence it for the better. It would have been a better policy to continue to conciliate the existing learned classes, and to attempt to introduce European knowledge and disciplines into their studies and thus make them the desired interpreter class. This analysis was acceptable to East India Company's Court of Directors but unacceptable to their political masters (because it effectively endorsed the previous policy of 'engraftment') and John Cam Hobhouse insisted on the despatch being redrafted to be a mere holding statement noting the Act but venturing no opinion upon it.\n\nBy 1839 Lord Auckland had succeeded Bentinck as Governor-General, and Macaulay had returned to England. Auckland contrived to find sufficient funds to support the English Colleges set up by Bentinck's Act without continuing to run down the traditional Oriental colleges. He wrote a Minute (of 24 November 1839) giving effect to this; both Oriental and English colleges were to be adequately funded. The East India Company directors responded with a despatch in 1841 endorsing the twin-track approach and suggesting a third:\n\nWe forbear at present from expressing an opinion regarding the most efficient mode of communicating and disseminating European Knowledge. Experience does not yet warrant the adoption of any exclusive system. We wish a fair trial to be given to the experiment of engrafting European Knowledge on the studies of the existing learned Classes, encouraged as it will be by giving to the Seminaries in which those studies are prosecuted,the aid of able and efficient European Superintendence. At the same time we authorise you to give all suitable encouragement to translators of European works into the vernacular languages and also to provide for the compilation of a proper series of Vernacular Class books according to the plan which Lord Auckland has proposed.\n\nThe East India Company also resumed subsidising the publication of Sanscrit and Arabic works, but now by a grant to the Asiatic Society rather than by undertaking publication under their own auspices.\n\nIn 1861, Mill in the last chapter ('On the Government of Dependencies') of his 'Considerations on Representative Government' restated the doctrine Macaulay had advanced a quarter of a century earlier – the moral imperative to improve subject peoples, which justified reforms by the rulers of which the ruled were as yet unaware of the need for,\n\n\"There are ... [conditions of society] in which, there being no spring of spontaneous improvement in the people themselves, their almost only hope of making any steps in advance [to 'a higher civilisation'] depends on the chances of a good despot. Under a native despotism, a good despot is a rare and transitory accident: but when the dominion they are under is that of a more civilised people, that people ought to be able to supply it constantly. The ruling country ought to be able to do for its subjects all that could be done by a succession of absolute monarchs guaranteed by irresistible force against the precariousness of tenure attendant on barbarous despotisms, and qualified by their genius to anticipate all that experience has taught to the more advanced nation. Such is the ideal rule of a free people over a barbarous or semi-barbarous one. We need not expect to see that ideal realised; but unless some approach to it is, the rulers are guilty of a dereliction of the highest moral trust which can devolve upon a nation: and if they do not even aim at it, they are selfish usurpers, on a par in criminality with any of those whose ambition and rapacity have sported from age to age with the destiny of masses of mankind\"\n\nbut Mill went on to warn of the difficulties this posed in practice; difficulties which whatever the merits of the Act of 1835 do not seem to have suggested themselves to Macaulay:\n\nIt is always under great difficulties, and very imperfectly, that a country can be governed by foreigners; even when there is no disparity, in habits and ideas, between the rulers and the ruled. Foreigners do not feel with the people. They cannot judge, by the light in which a thing appears to their own minds, or the manner in which it affects their feelings, how it will affect the feelings or appear to the minds of the subject population. What a native of the country, of average practical ability, knows as it were by instinct, they have to learn slowly, and after all imperfectly, by study and experience. The laws, the customs, the social relations, for which they have to legislate, instead of being familiar to them from childhood, are all strange to them. For most of their detailed knowledge they must depend on the information of natives; and it is difficult for them to know who to trust. They are feared, suspected, probably disliked by the population; seldom sought by them except for interested purposes; and they are prone to think the servilely submissive are the trustworthy. Their danger is of despising the natives; that of the natives is of disbelieving that anything the strangers do can be intended for their good.\n"}

Whatever the weather, children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a forest or natural environment. The adult supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. It is also known as \"\" (in German), \"outdoor nursery\", \"nature kindergarten\", or \"nature preschool\". \n\nA forest kindergarten can be described as a kindergarten \"without a ceiling or walls\". The daycare staff and children spend their time outdoors, typically in a forest. A distinctive feature of forest kindergartens is the emphasis on play with toys that are fashioned out of objects that can be found in nature, rather than commercial toys. Despite these differences, forest kindergartens are meant to fulfill the same basic purpose as other nurseries, namely, to care for, stimulate, and educate young children.\n\nEach forest kindergarten is different, partly because the organisations are independently minded. But typical activities and goals may include:\n\nForest kindergartens operate mainly in woodland, although some other sites can be equally inspiring, for example beaches and meadows. There should be a building where children can shelter from extreme weather. They may also spend a small part of each day indoors, although that is more likely to be for administrative and organisational reasons, such as to provide a known location where parents can deliver and collect their children. If the woodland is too far away to walk, a vehicle might reluctantly be used for transport.\n\nChildren are encouraged to dress for the weather, with waterproof clothes and warm layers, according to the climate.\n\nThere are some forest schools that take children of various ages to woodland less frequently, and with a stronger focus on environmental topics themselves. For example, the \"Woods for Learning\" strategy of the British Forestry Commission proposes \"regular\" access, for example once a week for eight weeks.\n\nIn rural areas, and historical times, access to nature has not been a problem. Over the last century, with increasing urbanisation and \"nature deficit disorder\", there have been many changes in stance on outdoor education. \n\nThe first forest Kindergarten was created by Ella Flautau in Denmark in the early 1950s. The idea formed gradually as a result of her often spending time with her own and neighbors' children in a nearby forest, a form of daycare which elicited great interest among the neighborhood parents. The parents formed a group and created an initiative to establish the first forest kindergarten. \n\nIn Sweden in 1957, an ex-military man, Goesta Frohm, created the idea of \"Skogsmulle\". \"Skog\" means wood in Swedish. \"Mulle\" is one of four fictional characters he created to teach children about nature, along with \"Laxe\" representing water, \"Fjällfina\" representing mountains and \"Nova\" representing an unpolluted nature. Forest schools based on Frohm's model, called \"I Ur och Skur\" (Rain or Shine Schools) moved the idea from occasional activities to formal nursery schools, being set up by Siw Linde in 1985. Juliet Robertson's review of Skogsmulle is a valuable modern-day summary.\n\nForest kindergartens have existed in Germany since 1968 but were first officially recognized as a form of daycare in 1993, enabling state subsidies to reduce the daycare fees of children who attended Forest Kindergarten. Since then, the forest kindergartens have become increasingly popular. As of 2005 there were approximately 450 forest kindergartens in Germany, some of which offer a mix of forest kindergarten and traditional daycare, spending their mornings in the forest and afternoons inside. By late 2017, the number of forest kindergartens in Germany surpassed 1500.\n\nIn Britain in 2005, a Swedish early years educator, Helena Nilsson, started Wildflowers Kindergarten, where preschool-aged children spend each morning in nature, throughout the year.\n\nChildminder Cathy Bache opened the Secret Garden in Scotland in 2008 with support from funding authorities and private donors.\n\nFrom 2018 on all forest kindergartens are invited to celebrate the every year on the 3rd of May.\n\nThe fact that most forest kindergartens do not provide commercial toys that have a predefined meaning or purpose supports the development of language skills, as children verbally create a common understanding of the objects used as toys in the context of their play. Forest kindergartens are also generally less noisy than closed rooms, and noise has been shown to be a factor in the stress level of children and daycare professionals.\n\nMerely keeping sight of natural features improves self-discipline in inner-city girls. Visiting a forest school regularly is desirable for schools although still not widespread; some aim to spend one day a week out.\n\nPlaying outside for prolonged periods has been shown to have a positive impact on children's development, particularly in the areas of balance and agility, but also manual dexterity, physical coordination, tactile sensitivity, and depth perception. According to these studies, children who attend forest kindergartens experience fewer injuries due to accidents and are less likely to injure themselves in a fall. A child's ability to assess risks improves, for example in handling fire and dangerous tools. Other studies have shown that spending time in nature improves attention and medical prognosis in women (see Attention Restoration Theory). Playing outdoors is said to strengthen the immune systems of children and daycare professionals.\n\nWhen children from German \"s\" go to primary school, teachers observe a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas. Boys may be less intellectually able than girls at typical school tasks such as reading and mathematics, so forest kindergartens have been recommended in the early years.\n\nRoland Gorges found that children who had been to a forest kindergarten were above average, compared by teachers to those who had not, in all areas of skill tested. In order of advantage, these were:\n\nHelicopter parenting is becoming more clearly recognised in the culture of fear of today's risk averse society. While some parents rush to 'wrap their children in cotton wool', others see outdoor play and forest kindergartens as a way to develop a mature and healthy outlook on life, as well as practical skills and health. Doing this at a young age is hoped to bring lifelong benefits to the child. It is consistent with the notions of \"slow parenting\", the \"idle parent\" and \"free range kids\".\n\n\n"}

A platform that allows users, mostly students and educators to combine text, images, video, and audio to create an interactive, Web-based poster called glogs on a virtual canvas. Glogster facilitates the conveyance of social information in many different fields such as art, music, photography. Users also have access to a library of engaging educational content posters created by other students and educators worldwide. Glogster enables interactive, collaborative education and digital literacy.\n\nGlogster a. s., Inc, was founded in 2007 by Martin Santorcl, Patrik Prepsl, Roman Smola, Stanislav Šrámek and Tomáš Plojhar, with offices in Prague and Boston. They launched the first platform, Glogster.com also in 2007. This platform was initially promoted as a visual network, allowing users to express themselves via “graphic blogs” or “glogs”. However, in response to needs of educators incorporating Glogster into lessons and assignments, Glogster EDU (or edu.glogster.com) was set up alongside Glogster.com in 2009, offering a more secure and educational specific platform. Glogster EDU, has an annual subscription cost but gives educators a dashboard to provide instructions, templates and a private area for their class (es).\n\nThe regular Glogster.com, the social network platform, was closed for new registrations and account access ceased in Feb 2015. After this the company focused solely on the Glogster EDU platform. There is, however, a personal type license available for single users. The platform has grown into a worldwide community in over 200 countries, with over 1.9 million teacher accounts with over 17 million student accounts who have created more than 25 million educational glogs, out of 45 million total glogs on the service.\n\nGlogster's online editor allows users to arrange images, graphics, audio, video, and texts on a single page to create multimedia posters. It also provides access to 10,000 original graphic elements such as backgrounds, text boxes, frames and more. Media can be imported from around the web via URL or uploaded from users’ own files.\n\nThe Glogpedia library is a constantly-growing collection of over 40, 000 glogs, selected based on accuracy and presentation, and categorized into 80 subjects under 9 disciplines according to the K-12 curriculum. Glogster users can nominate glogs to be considered for inclusion in the library by clicking a button at the top of any public glog.\n\nGlogpedia content is intended for use in place of, or alongside, conventional curriculum texts, for example as interactive research material or to engage learners with a new topic. Users can also save editable copies of glogs to their own dashboards, and adapt them to their own needs.\n\nGlogster released an iOS application for iPad in September 2014, bringing an updated version of the editor and the content library to iPad. The Glog interface incorporates a built-in browser known as the Web Picker, allowing users to search for media directly from the app, and drag it onto their glog canvas. The app is also synced with the iPad's built-in camera and mic, allowing users to record video, audio and photos directly onto their glogs.\n\nThe iPad application expands learning beyond the traditional classroom, allowing users to create glogs based on events as they happen, and giving them freedom to learn and create in their own time.\n\nIn early 2015, Glogster released a Glogpedia library browser application for Android, with the announcement that full editing functionality for Android would be made available within the year. In October 2015 Glogster released an Android app for tablet devices with full editing functionality.\n\nGlogster EDU is used as a learning and teaching tool to foster higher order thinking skills. Creating posters or glogs allows learners to engage closely with a subject, exercising critical thinking and research skills in selecting appropriate media and creative skills in structuring and arranging the finished piece. Glogster is being used in place of traditional poster assignments and demonstrates how versatile such a poster-creation tool can be when partnered with solid teaching pedagogy and teacher creativity. The use of Glogster, motives and excites students to do their work. A study showed that the usage of the Glogster EDU educational platform develops necessary competences, such as, communication skills, creativity and intellectual curiosity, critical and systematized thinking, information and media skills, collaborative and interpersonal skills, problem identification, formulation, and solving and social responsibility.\n\nIn 2015, Glogster launched the GATE (Global Ambassadors for Technology in Education) program, focused on offering Glogster educators training materials and certifications, as well as recruiting a small group of representatives to assist in promoting Glogster online and in their local areas.\n"}

It is now common there and in some other countries.\n\nThe philosophy behind HighScope is based on child development theory and research, originally drawing on the work of Jean Piaget and John Dewey. Since then, the HighScope Curriculum has evolved to include the findings of ongoing cognitive-developmental and brain research. In its teaching practices, the HighScope Curriculum draws upon the work of developmental psychologist and educator Lev Vygotsky, especially the strategy of adult scaffolding — supporting children at their current developmental level and helping them build upon it — in a social setting where children have opportunities to choose materials, ideas, and people to interact within the projects they initiate. The adults working with the children see themselves more as facilitators or partners than as managers or supervisors.\n\nAs director of special services in the Ypsilanti, (Michigan) public school district, David Weikart became increasingly interested in the academic performance of a number of at-risk children from poor neighborhoods. He found that these students tend to do poorly on district-wide, standardized tests and also receive low scores in IQ assessments.\n\nWeikart brought together, and collaborated with, a committee of elementary education leaders that included Perry School's Charles Eugene Beatty, Michigan's first African-American principal. Known as the Perry Preschool Project (1962), members discussed possible changes to teaching methods and curriculum choices. Even though they did not expect to radically change Ypsilanti's teaching core (which mostly worked), they explored why it seemingly failed a certain population of students.\n\nWhile searching for better teaching methods and programs, Weikart (now also part of a special services committee tackling the same issue), zeroed in on programs for three- and four-year-olds. Outside the normal organization of the school district, Weikart hired four teachers and began operation of a preschool at Perry Elementary School. \n\nWeikart and Perry School's teachers and staff chose to differ from traditional nursery school settings by designing a program that focused on a child's intellectual maturation rather than a child's social and emotional advances. They wanted a program that: \n\n\nThe HighScope Perry Preschool Project was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of 123 children (58 were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the program and a control group of 65 children that did not). Prior to the program, the preschool and control groups were equivalent in measures of intellectual performance and demographic characteristics. After the program the educational and life outcomes for the children receiving the program were much superior to outcomes for the children not receiving the program. Many of the program outcomes were significant or approaching significance.\n\n\"Educational outcomes for preschool group (versus control group):\"\n\nAt age 27 follow-up\n\n\n\"Pregnancy outcomes for preschool group (versus control group):\"\n\nAt age 27 follow-up\n\n\n\"Lifetime criminal activity for preschool group (versus control group):\"\n\nAt age 40 follow-up\n\n\n\"Economic outcomes for preschool group (versus control group):\"\n\nAt age 40 follow-up\n\n\nOverall, a study documented a return to society of more than $16 for every tax dollar invested in the early care and education program. Heckman et al 2010 finds a lower benefit of $9.2 back on the dollar, mostly due to lower benefits from less crime (table 8). See also Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, & Yavitz (2010a, b).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17701372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17701372", "title": "History of the University of Bristol", "text": "History of the University of Bristol\n\nThe history of the University of Bristol can be said to have begun in 1909 when the university gained a royal charter which allowed it to award degrees. Like most English universities, Bristol evolved from earlier institutions, most notably University College, Bristol (founded 1876), Bristol Medical School (1833) and the Merchant Venturers' Technical College (founded as a school 1595 and which became the university engineering faculty.\n\nAs early as 1906 Conwy Lloyd Morgan had stated his intention to give up the principalship of University College, Bristol. Sir Isambard Owen, nephew of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, became the first vice-chancellor of the university and worked upon the detail of the university's charter. Owen is also credited with the design of the university gowns, with the colour said to have been based upon the colour of the rocks of the Avon Gorge after rain. One area of early controversy was the re-advertising of some chair positions and the decision not to give one, Cowl, a reappointment. This caused the resignation of the Chair of Physics, Arthur P. Chattock.\n\nHenry Overton Wills became the first chancellor of the university. On Wills' death, Haladane was invited to succeed him. The installation of Haladane was used to honour all those who had been involved in the creation of the university and 70 honorary degrees were awarded by the university. This act, coming from a university not yet three years old caused some controversy and led to public criticism of the university in \"The Observer\".\n\nAfter the death of their father, Henry Wills and George Wills donated money for the building of a university building in memory of their father. He met with George Oatley (later Sir George Oatley) to plan the building of what was to become the Wills Memorial Building which the brothers requested would be built to last for 400 years. When the Wills family acquired Royal Fort gardens as a site they were given to the university and were to be the site of a castle like building which became the physics department.\n\nIn 1911 George Wills acquired the athletic ground at Coombe Dingle and in 1920 he bought the Victoria Rooms which became the Student’s Union building. World War I caused a financial crisis with the university losing around 20% of its fee income but the government agreed to make up this loss because of important contributions which Bristol made to the study of poison gas and explosives. Economic problems continued after the war when it was announced that government funding of universities was to be cut. On 9 June 1925 the Wills Memorial Building was officially opened by King George V and Mary.\n\nIt was during the interwar years that Bristol’s reputation as a university began to increase. In 1920 Helen Wodehouse was appointed as Chair of Education, the first woman to be appointed in such a role, and in 1928 Winifred Lucy Shepland was appointed as the first woman registrar of any British university. The growing strength was exemplified by the \"poaching\" of academics from other universities and the award of a Nobel Prize to Bristol graduate Paul Dirac for his work on quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom the early years of its formation the university brought higher education to working people, with H. G. Leonard, a lecturer in history, becoming president of the Bristol branch of the Workers' Educational Association. After the war, government grants allowed the setting up of departments of extramural adult education. Bristol University also began to have an effect on the city of Bristol, when the university laboratories and the city laboratories combined to train health visitors at Canynge Hall. This had a pronounced effect on the City of Bristol’s health, with death rates halving to 11 per 1,000 and the infant mortality rate falling from 165 per 1000 to 57 per 1000. However, the state of the medical school was described by the Ministry of Health described it as being at \"sixes and sevens\". The problem was the continuing rivalry between the General Hospital and Bristol Royal Infirmary, Sir George Wills had offered to build a new university hospital if the two could resolve their differences but this failed to create an agreement between them.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw great scientific breakthroughs in the chemistry and physics departments. Sir Nevil Mott arrived from the University of Cambridge . His work on \"solid state physics\" led to the development of the transistor and the growth of industry around solid state electronics. The physics department became home to the Sutton Group, which worked on klystron and magnetron valves (the latter important in the development of radar). A \"future physics\" professor, Peter Fowler, used his scientific knowledge to destroy German radar jamming devices during the war.\n\nAfter the war Tomas Lovejoy succeeded Isambard Owen as vice-chancellor after a short interim period. Lovejoy was responsible for the creation of a system whereby the appointment of professors was made by joint senate and council committees after the two organisations disagreed over his replacement as Chair of Physics.\n\nDamage occurred to the Wills Memorial Building during the war caused then chancellor to give a defiant speech. Loveday remained as vice-chancellor despite being past retirement age until the end of the war when he was replaced by Phillip Morris.\n\nDuring the 1950s new buildings for the medicine and engineering departments were provided on St Michael’s Hill. The geography department were able take over the old. A new chemistry building was also planned on the slopes of St Michael’s Hill but the project ran into difficulty when Bristol City Council’s compulsory purchase orders displaced some local residents. New buildings to be built in Berkeley Square caused similar complaints. These would become home of the Department of Education as it was clear that Royal Fort house would prove too small.\n\nIn the 1950s the government indicated that it would give support to the idea that students could pick any university to study at within the national system. This loss of local students caused some to see the university as a kind of alien \"intellectual colony\" disconnected to the university. This move made it important for the university to invest in student accommodation. Clifton Hill House had already been opened soon after the gaining of the charter and it operated as a girls' hall of residence and Wills Hall was opened in 1929. To cope with increasing student numbers Churchill Hall, Hiatt Baker Hall and Badock Hall were built.\n\nThe 1960s saw a large increase in the number of British universities built after Harold Wilson was elected prime minister. Many of these new institutions received criticism but Bristol was now seen as an older more established institution and was able to embark on a period of academic expansion. There was a new Department of Inorganic Chemistry and a Department of Biochemistry. However the greatest expansions occurred in the arts with the creation of the drama, theology, sociology, politics, and social and economic history departments.\n\nSir Phillip Morris retired in 1966 but during his time as vice-chancellor the university tripled in size and witnessed the building of many departments such as the School of Veterinary Science and the School of Architecture.\n\nIn 1968 the first large scale student protest occurred when students staged a sit in over allegations that they were unable to control their own union. The protest lasted over the weekend. At this time the vice-chancellorship had passed to John Harris who was said to be nonplussed by the protest. However, he died one week later after collapsing in his office. Further disagreement between the university and the union occurred over the issue of \"reciprocal membership\" of the union meaning that any students from Bristol would be able to use the union. This escalated into an 11-day sit-in at Senate House which gained Bristol national headlines, although it has been argued that the protest enjoyed little student support.\n\nSeveral protests occurred in Bristol in 2010 in response to government spending cuts in education, including the increasing of tuition fees, and the scrapping of Education Maintenance Allowance in England. On 24 November, approximately 2000 students from the university and nearby schools gathered outside of the university and marched through the streets of Bristol. This was followed by an occupation of the Students Union building by students who criticised the union for failing to represent them on these issues. (Main article: University of Bristol Union#2010 Occupation) On 7 December a second occupation occurred, this time in the central university building of Senate House. The students occupying the building made a list of demands, including \"greater student representation in Senate meetings\" and \"That the Vice-Chancellor, Eric Thomas, write and send an open letter to the Government condemning cuts in the education budget and appealing to them not to implement these policies, and to publicly call for Vice-Chancellors across the country to unite against these cuts, any rise in tuition fees and the removal of Educational Maintenance Allowance and Aimhigher.\" The occupiers received a considerable amount of support from members of staff. The occupation ended on 17 December 2010, with students leaving voluntarily and stating: \"Although the occupiers’ main demand [...] was not met, the occupation has, in many ways, yielded much more meaningful outcomes than being granted particular requests by senior management.\"\n\nUnder the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, funding for universities was cut and Bristol's income was reduced by some 15%. This resulted in the selective closure of some departments, including Russian, education and architecture. A compromise agreement was eventually found but this episode damaged the research strength of the university.\n\nIn May 2009, Bristol celebrated its centenary. As part of the celebrations degrees were bestowed upon individuals who had given extraordinary service to the Bristol community.\n\nThird-oldest university in England debate\n"}

Harrington (born c. late 1930s) is an American business manager. He was the CEO of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe graduated from Boston College in 1957, and received his MBA from Boston College in 1966. After college, he was an officer in the U.S. Navy, then worked for both the General Accounting Office and NASA. He eventually became an accounting professor at BC until 1970, where he was hired by Joe Cronin, president of the American League, to be the league's controller.\n\nAfter Cronin retired, Harrington was hired by Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey as treasurer of the Red Sox. Yawkey died in 1976 and was eventually replaced by his wife Jean, who sold the team in 1977 to a syndicate headed by general partners Buddy LeRoux and Haywood Sullivan. To gain approval of the sale by the American League, Mrs. Yawkey joined the ownership group in 1978 as its third general partner and club president. Harrington left the team to work for Governor Edward King of Massachusetts and then for a Lloyd's of London Insurance affiliate. But he eventually returned to the Red Sox in the mid-1980s, during a period of strife between LeRoux and his partners, and became an important advisor to Mrs. Yawkey.\n\nAfter Jean Yawkey's death in 1992, as trustee of the JRY Trust, Harrington arranged for the Trust to buy out the shares of Sullivan, the last remaining general partner. He completely overhauled the front office, bringing in general manager Dan Duquette from the Montreal Expos. Under Harrington's leadership the team compiled one of the best records in baseball; The team won the 1986 ALCS; won the AL East in 1988, 1990 and 1995; and won the Wild Card in 1998 and 1999.\n\nHarrington was instrumental in acquiring Pedro Martínez, Manny Ramírez, Jason Varitek, Tim Wakefield, Johnny Damon, Derek Lowe and other stars. Harrington built a new spring training facility in Fort Myers and broadened the reach and popularity of Red Sox majority Owned NESN – New England Sports Network. He was responsible for bringing the All-Star Game to Fenway Park in 1999. He also played key roles within Major League Baseball. He was the lead negotiator for baseball owners during the strike of 1994, and led the development of both interleague play and the creation of the Wild Card playoff format.\n\nDuring Harrington's tenure, the Red Sox were also embroiled in several controversial episodes. In 1997 legendary pitcher Roger Clemens acrimoniously left the team to sign as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays, where he won a fourth Cy Young Award.\n\nAlso in 1997, after infielder Wil Cordero was arrested on domestic assault charges, a half-dozen Red Sox front office members made a show of support on Cordero's behalf by appearing in court at his arraignment. Weeks later, Harrington initially refused to accept the terms of a negotiated settlement between the players' union and the owners' Player Relations Committee to allow Cordero to return to the team. However Harrington relented after the union threatened to file a grievance and owners' counsel advised him he was unlikely to prevail in court. Cordero's return drew criticism from women's rights advocates, and Cordero would ultimately plead guilty to the charges after the season.\n\nIn December 1997, Harrington and the club faced charges of racial bias and harassment after a black former employee of the team claimed a framed photo of himself and his fiancee was defaced with a racial epithet. The following month, a civil rights advocate who offered to mediate a settlement for the club abandoned those efforts, accusing Harrington of rebuffing him and failing to deal in good faith. The case led to a hearing before the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and was ultimately settled.\n\nIn 1999, Harrington proposed the idea of moving the Red Sox into a new ballpark that was scheduled to be built adjacent to Fenway and even named \"New Fenway Park\", (similar to what happened to Yankee Stadium in 2008). This idea was wildly controversial, as many Red Sox fans consider Fenway \"a national treasure\" of sorts. Harrington was quoted as saying that, \"It would be easier to fix the Leaning Tower of Pisa than Fenway\". The team set aside $415 million of $545 million allotted for the new ballpark, with the public financing the rest, estimated at $130 million. The baseball world had seen the closure of Tiger Stadium that same year, and many hoped Fenway would avoid the same fate. After much outcry from the public, Harrington sold the team to their current ownership group headed by John Henry, Tom Werner and Larry Lucchino. Under Henry's group, the Red Sox celebrated the 100th anniversary of Fenway on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe is currently Chairman of the Yawkey Foundation.\n"}

In January 2013, Graham spoke at the TEDxPSU symposium. His talk is available for streaming through YouTube.\n\nLonnnie Graham is a Professor of Visual Art at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, near State College, Pennsylvania. He studied graphic design and commercial photography at the Ivy School of Professional Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1976 he studied fine art photography and drawing at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia where he attended private sessions with photographer Robert Frank and critiques by art critic Donald Kuspit. In 1977 he traveled to the San Francisco Art Institute, and studied with Linda Connor, Jack Fulton, Regan Louie, and Henry Wessel. He was assistant to Larry Sultan and pioneering visual anthropologist John Collier Jr. Graham was mentored in large format photography by Pirkle Jones, close friend and colleague to Ansel Adams who made frequent visits to the Art Institute.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1997 Graham was director of Photography at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an urban arts organization founded by William Strickland, Jr. dedicated to arts and education for at risk youth. Graham developed innovative pilot projects including the Arts Collaborative, which merged an art and academic curriculum. This program attracted the attention of First Lady Hillary Clinton who visited the site, and honored it as a National Model for Arts Education. Professor Graham has served as a panel member and site visitor to the Commonwealth for the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. He also served in a similar capacity at the national level for National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, DC.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2003 he held the post of visiting instructor of graduate studies at San Francisco Art Institute, in San Francisco, California. In 2002, Kimberley Camp, Executive Director of the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania invited Graham to conduct an oral history of the Barnes. He was later made instructor of special programs and continued to teach at the Barnes until 2007. From 2007 until 2009 Graham was the acting associate director of the Fabric Workshop and Museum.\n\nBeginning in 2003 Graham began collaborative photographic expeditions to India, Ethiopia, and Iceland with photographer Linda Connor. He traveled with Jack Fulton to India, Nepal and Tibet in 2007.\n\nGraham initiated a number of funded and self-funded trips to Africa and Asia that relate to artistic and cultural work he had undertaken in Philadelphia with the Fairmount Park Art Association and in Pittsburgh with the support of the Three Rivers Arts Festival. These projects were meant to prove that substantive change could be achieved in people's lives by making the arts a viable solution to common problems.\n\nToward this end, Graham was awarded a number of major commissions. In 1997, from Jeanne Pearlman at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, commissioned the \"African/American Garden Project.\" This was part of a larger series of an exhibition called \"Points of Entry\" which included installations from artists, Ann Carlson, Group Material, Michelle Illuminato, Daniel J. Martinez, and Fred Wilson.\n\nThe African/American Garden project provided a physical and cultural exchange of urban single mothers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and farmers from a small farming village in Muguga, Kenya. As a result of this project, Graham built a series of urban subsistence gardens as a component to other projects.\n\nIn 2001, Mary Jane Jacob invited Graham to participate in the Spoleto Arts Festival in Charleston, South Carolina. She and Tumelo Mosaka curated \"Evoking History,\" which included Graham’s \"Heritage Garden Project.\" Because Graham had visited traditional cultures in Africa and Asia he constructed larger projects including a number of artists and community members. The goal was to establish a method for modern artists to work in a traditional way, addressing the basic needs of a community.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010 Graham worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with artists John H. Stone and Art Sanctuary director Lorene Cary on a project commissioned by the Fairmount Park Art Association, for Project H.O.M.E. in north Philadelphia. In addition to installations, projects and neighborhood events, the result of the commission was a mediation park, which was dedicated and gifted to the community in 2010.\n\nIn 1997 Lonnie was honored with a major commission for travel to Papua New Guinea to document the harvest of the Woowoosi tree used by the Maisen tribe to produce ceremonial tapa cloth. He later collaborated with curator Lawrence Rinder on an exhibition of photographs and artifacts produced from that expedition.\n\nIn the 1995 Colliers Encyclopedia yearbook, Graham was cited as an encyclopedic point of reference for his research and creative accomplishments in the field of installation art. He was also the recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts / Pew Charitable Trust travel grant for travel to Ghana. Graham is a four-time Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship winner. He has been nominated as a DuPont Fellow, and for the Cal Arts-Alpert Award, a Joan Mitchell Foundation Fellowship, and a USArtist Fellowship. He was awarded the Creative Achievement Award by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Graham received a Pew Fellowships in the Arts. The Pew is one of the largest individual artist fellowships in the United States. In 2005, he was awarded the Hazlett Memorial Award, conferred the distinction of as Artist of the Year in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and was presented with the Governor’s Award by Governor Edward Rendell.\n\nGraham designed the catalogue entitled \"Countdown to Eternity,\" a collection of photographs of Dr. Martin Luther King by Benedict Fernandez, as well as a traveling exhibition of photographs. He also designed the catalogue for Carrie Mae Weems’ \"Kitchen Table Series,\" exhibited at Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia and is known to have worked with Weems collaboratively on other projects at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, including the Adam and Eve folding screen entitled the \"Apple of Adam’s Eye,\" produced in 1992. He collaborated with David Lewis to produce a book about sculptor Thaddeus Mosley, \"Thaddeus Mosley, African American Sculptor.\" Pyramid Atlantic, in Silver Spring, Maryland published his own \"Friendship, Strength and Vitality\" as a limited edition photogravure edition which resides in the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC and the collection of the Schomberg Center in New York City.\n\nThe catalogue accompanying the exhibition \"A Conversation with the World\" has been widely disseminated by Light Work in Syracuse, New York. This project was conceived by Graham and photographer Kevin Martin in 1986, and combines elements of social anthropology and fine art as it utilizes an interview component to engage participants who sit for a large format 4\"x5\" portrait made using polaroid type 55 positive/negative film. Graham was documented using this process in Houston, Texas at Rick Lowe’s Project Row Houses in artist Round 19. \"A Conversation with the World\" has also been conducted and exhibited in San Francisco. He was commissioned by the San Francisco Art Commission for a public art project that was installed at the San Francisco City Hall and exhibited in public spaces around the city. The project was commissioned and presented in Calgary, Alberta, Eatonville, Florida and Oulu, Finland. In 2005 he was awarded a Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation Artists in Communities Grant under the auspices of the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to produce \"A Conversation at the Table.\" This project invited over 50 artists and four arts organizations to collaborate on a project based on essential aspects of humanity. The project was completed and presented in 2006.\n\nThe Queens Museum in New York also commissioned him to produce an international garden project as part of their \"Down the Garden Path\" exhibition presented in 2005. Other exhibitions include an exhibition of photographs at Goethe Institute, Accra, Ghana. La Maison de Etat-Unis, Paris, France produced a full-scale reproduction of one of the educational galleries he photographed for the Barnes Foundation. Graham has shown at the Toyota City Museum in Aichi, Japan. He exhibited a room-sized installation at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Graham's work is included in the permanent collections of the Addison Gallery for American Art in Andover, Massachusetts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2005 he collaborated with MacArthur Fellow Deborah Willis on \"Framing the Diaspora\", which resulted in an international conference of artists, photographers, and filmmakers held in Accra, Ghana.\n\n"}

{"id": "11491634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11491634", "title": "Multilingualism in Luxembourg", "text": "Multilingualism in Luxembourg\n\nMultilingualism is a part of everyday life for the population of Luxembourg. Legally and socially, different sectors of Luxembourg use French, German, and Luxembourgish, which is a variety of Moselle Franconian with a large number of loanwords from French. Additionally, most citizens learn English and may study other languages as well. A substantial immigrant population has brought numerous immigrant languages to the small state, notably Portuguese, which is spoken by more than one-fifth of the population. However, the different languages are used in different social situations.\n\nThe use of languages for legal and administrative purposes is regulated by a law promulgated in 1984, including the following provisions:\n\nArticle 1: The national language of the Luxembourgers is Luxembourgish.<br>\nArticle 2: The laws are in French.<br>\nArticle 3: The language of the government: Luxembourgish, German and French can be used.<br>\nArticle 4: Administrative questions: If a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.\n\nIn many other multilingual countries, such as Belgium, Switzerland and Canada, the distribution of the languages is geographic, but in Luxembourg it is functional—that is, the choice of language depends on the situation.\n\nAt school, all students are taught in all three official languages, although divided by age group and subject matter. At primary school, the courses are taught in German and explanations are often given in Luxembourgish. In general, at secondary school, up until the 9th grade, every subject is taught in German, except for mathematics and sciences (which are taught in French). From 10th to 13th grade, the language use depends on what level the students are in: In the more difficult level, as well as at the commerce and administrative division, the courses are mostly in French, but throughout the whole of secondary school, explanations are often given in Luxembourgish. The easier level on the other hand tends not to switch to French.\n\nGovernment websites are primarily written in French, also there are parts are written for foreigners in other languages such as English and German. In Luxembourg's parliament the Chamber of Deputies, bills are first written in German. Then the language of debate is in Luxembourgish, but sometimes also in French (e.g., when laws are cited). Laws are voted and codified in French. The country's head of state, the Grand-Duke's website is in French, however his personal Christmas speech is done in Luxembourgish \"(although a French translation is provided ).\"\n\nIn the written press, most newspapers such as \"Tageblatt\" and \"Lëtzebuerger Journal\" are in German, while there are a few such as \"Le Quotidien\" that are in French. On the other hand, the newspaper of record \"Luxemburger Wort\" is trilingual with most articles written in German, but also sometimes written in French and Luxembourgish, often on the same page.\n\nOn TV and on the radio, Luxembourgish is mainly used, for example the main news programme RTL's \"de Journal\". Spoken Luxembourgish used in news broadcasts tends to be strongly influenced by standard German in pronunciation and idiom. Radio broadcasters are under pressure to translate news releases sourced from German press agencies in real time and have no special training in the prose style of Luxembourgish. As a result, news tends to be superficially translated into Luxembourgish. Syntax mostly follows standard German and many words and idioms from standard German appear unmodified. Phonology is also affected with the resulting use of intonation phrases alien to Luxembourgish.\n\nIn terms of advertising, which language is used depends on three factors; media, audience and origin. In written advertisements like billboards, newspaper and magazine adverts, catalogues and posters, the usual language of communication is French. On occasion to give a local flavour, it is written in part in Luxembourgish. Public signage is usually in French, with occasional markings in Luxembourgish, German and/or English.\n\nFor television commercials broadcasting on RTL, if the advert is for an international product or service like a car or a television, it is entirely in French. However, if it is a domestic product or service like for example like mineral water or Luxair, the spoken language is in Luxembourgish with the taglines in French, or less frequently in Luxembourgish or English. \n\nGenerally, in everyday life, when talking to a foreigner, Luxembourgers will attempt to respond in the language they have been addressed in (mainly French, standard German or English). Due to the large number of foreigners in Luxembourg, locals now expect to use foreign languages in daily life, and as far as they are able, will use the foreigner's native language. For example, American students who have learned standard German are often spoken to in English.\n\nBy custom, French is used in restaurants and brasseries to the point that Luxembourgers assume that the service staff will be French speaking and make no attempt to use Luxembourgish. In rare cases when foreigners attempt to speak Luxembourgish in these establishments staff will rebuff them in French with \"\" (\"What do you say?\"). In less formal drinking establishments though, Luxembourgish remains normal.\n\nLuxembourgish has a literary tradition that began in the 1820s with the development of serious forms of poetry, followed by drama and eventually narrative prose. However, the average Luxembourger finds Luxembourgish texts difficult to read. Schoolchildren do not read Luxembourgish until the age of 11 or 12. Even then not all teachers adhere to the curriculum requirement to teach written Luxembourgish, some preferring to teach standard German instead, and consequently some students may not be taught written Luxembourgish. As a result, only a minority of literary-minded intellectuals find reading Luxembourgish easy or enjoyable. The majority of Luxembourgers regard their language as a spoken one only.\n\nFor private correspondence, language choice tends to reflect social class. Members of the upper middle and upper classes tend to prefer French, although Luxembourgish may be used to convey a sense of close identification with one's nationality. German tends to be viewed negatively among the upper class, with the assumption that anyone writing in German has a poor mastery of French. Despite this, a minority of members of the upper class do prefer standard German when corresponding with close relatives. Use of German becomes more prominent the lower down the social scale one goes, followed by Luxembourgish, with French tending to be the least popular among the lower classes.\n\nGenerally speaking, for correspondence between people who are related, standard German is preferred, followed by French and Luxembourgish equally, although social status has an influence. When people who are unrelated correspond, use of Luxembourgish drops off dramatically, and it tends not to be used at all between strangers. The choice of Luxembourgish therefore appears to reflect the closeness of the ties between the two people corresponding.\n\n\n"}

It has affiliates in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, South Korea, China, South Asia, and Central America. It started as a local program in Cleveland, Ohio, headed by Dr. David Van Tassell, a history professor at Case Western Reserve University. It grew from 129 students in 1974 to over 500,000 students in 48 states in 1991, and 700,000 students and 40,000 teachers in 2001. Today more than half a million students enter through local contests. They construct entries as an individual or a group in one of five categories: Documentary, Exhibit, Paper, Performance or Website. Students then compete in a series of regional contests with top entries advancing to state/affiliate contests. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to compete at the National Contest.\n\nThe contest started in Cleveland in 1974. Members of the History Department at Case Western Reserve University developed the initial idea for a history contest akin to Science Fair. Students gathered on campus to devote one day to history calling it \"National History Day.\" Over the next few years, the contest expanded throughout Ohio and into surrounding Midwestern states. By 1980, with the help of the National Endowment for the Humanities, National History Day had grown into a national non-profit organization and in 1992 National History Day moved its headquarters from Cleveland to the Washington, D.C., area. National History Day now runs multiple educational programs but the National Contest is still the largest of these. The national finals take place each June during a week-long event held at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nThe annual theme is usually a phrase ending with \"in history\" and is often an alliteration, such as, \"Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History.\" The theme frames students’ research within a historical theme. The theme is chosen for the broad application to world, national, or state history and its relevance to ancient history or to the more recent past. The 2018 theme was \"Conflict and Compromise in History,\" and the 2019 theme is \"Triumph and Tragedy in History\". \"The intentional selection of the theme for the National History Day Contest is to provide an opportunity for students to push past the antiquated view of history as mere facts and dates and drill down into historical content to develop perspective and understanding.\" Themes are rotated each year and prior themes are often used after approximately seven years.\n\nNational History Day participants are judged on three deciding factors: Historical Quality, Relation to Theme, and Clarity of Presentation. Research should include primary and secondary sources. Additionally, sources need to be clearly cited with the inclusion of an annotated bibliography. There is also a required process paper that needs to be included with the project, describing your process and struggles in creating an NHD project. \n\nIn some regions, students who reach enough points in their judging advance to states, and any number of students at regional competitions can advance to states. In other states, such as California, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, the top three projects at the regional competition advance to the state competition. Regions can be divided by geographic area, population, or by county.\n\nAt the state/affiliate level contests, students compete for a variety of prizes. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to the National Contest held each June at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nIn the preliminary rounds, each entry presents their project before a panel of three judges. In the case of the paper and website categories, the projects have been reviewed by the judges prior to the presentations. Performances, documentaries, and exhibits are presented for the judges for the first time at the contest. The top entry in each judging group advances to the final round, called \"Run Offs.\"\n\nThose in the performance and documentary categories are notified they advanced to the final round and then present their work to a panel of three new judges. Those in the paper, website, and exhibit categories are not informed if they have made it into the final round. Their projects are judged by a panel of three new judges, but the students are not interviewed in this round. Their project then has to stand alone for the final judging.\n\nAn independent study conducted in 2011 demonstrated that students who participate in the National History Day Contest outperform their non-participating peers and score higher on standardized tests, although this might be a reflection on the type of students who choose to participate in National History Day - those who seek to challenge themselves.\n\nArnita Jones, executive director of the American Historical Association, wrote in 2001:\n\n\n"}

The first institution was set up in Limerick, where there had been long-standing demand for a university, in fact a \"University of Limerick\" was proposed \"inter alia\" in the late 1960s by the \"Lichfield Report\". The institution at Dublin was to be the unified campus of what later became Dublin Institute of Technology, but instead a new institution was developed similar to Limerick.\n\nIn the 1970s it was expected that the institutions would be \"recognised colleges\" of the National University of Ireland, in time this status been raised to \"constituent college\" status. Initially this did occur for a short time (1976–1977), however the institutions had all degrees conferred by the National Council for Educational Awards after 1977, this continued until university status was achieved.\n\nIn November 1986 the International Study Group on Technological Education was established by the Minister for Education.\n\nThe chair was T.P.

Chowdhary shared his idea of developing an accessibility tool with Gadihoke, and they decided to develop the extension during the AngelHack Hackathon Delhi in 2016.\n\nAfter the development of the tool, Chowdhary and Gadihoke purchased the domain oswald.foundation on 14 August 2016 and founded Oswald Labs as Oswald Foundation on India's Independence Day on 15 August 2016 along with Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi, Chowdhary's partner in previous ventures. Oswald Labs won an award at \"Startup India Rocks\" in Bengaluru and is a part of IBM's Global Entrepreneur Program. They are also incubated in the London and Berlin-based \"EyeFocus Accelerator\", a startup accelerator program for companies developing for living with visual impairment.\n\nIn November 2016, Oswald Labs announced that they switched to wind-powered servers for their online services and content delivery network.\n\nOn 8 April 2017, Oswald Labs qualified to the finals of The Economic Times's \"Catapoolt Changemakers Challenge\" after winning the first round in Delhi. On 17 and 18 June 2017, Oswald Labs organized \"BharatHacks\", a hackathon to solve India-specific problems, in collaboration with DigitalOcean, IBM, the Delhi-NCR chapter of Facebook Developer Circles, HackerEarth, and other technology companies. In June 2017, Oswald Labs raised ₹100,000 in a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIn September 2017, Oswald Labs moved parts of their operation to Enschede, Netherlands and in December 2017, Oswald Foundation was renamed to Oswald Labs to focus on research and development. In December 2017, Oswald Labs launched a startup accelerator for early-stage startups.\n\nIn January 2018, Chowdhary was featured by Het Financieele Dagblad's list of 50 most-innovative entrepreneurs under 35 in the Netherlands. In March 2018, Chowdhary and Gadihoke were featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia 2018 list in the Social Entrepreneurs category. In October 2018, Oswald Labs exhibited smartphone apps for people with disabilities at the Dutch Design Week, in collaboration with 4TU, the consortium of Dutch technical universities.\n\nAgastya is a cross-platform JavaScript library and web accessibility plug-in for websites. It automatically adds WCAG 2.0-compliancy with support for keyboard navigation, automatic generation for alternate text for images using computer vision, and font adjustment. It also includes a mode that adjusts the color temperature of the display to reduce eye strain and disruption of sleep patterns (like the program f.lux), a night mode that converts a webpage to a dark theme, and a dyslexia-friendly mode that uses Open Dyslexic and dyslexia-friendly colors. For uses with visual impairment, it has a built-in screen reader with summarization. Websites can also access analytics about their user's disabilities. It is available for free for websites with less than 10,000 pageviews per month, and has a subscription model for larger websites.\n\nShravan is an operating system for smartphones and tablet computers based on the Android mobile platform.

Although it is a high school in the technical sense, TTC's student body comprises students from Grade One (formerly Kindergarten) to Grade Eleven (formerly Tenth Standard) or Matriculation, the highest standard in the Myanmar education system. The origin of the name of the school comes from the fact that TTC is part of the Institute of Education (former Teachers' Training College), whose trainee teachers are attached to the school as part of their course.\n\nThe school was established in 1931. Its main campus is situated on Pyay Road in Kamayut Township. It was established as an experimental school by the colonial education authority as a new means to deliver scientific education to the student body. Thus, the school did not fall under either the colonial government's school syllabus (consisting mostly of mission-schools run by the religious order), nor the newly founded Nationalist Vernacular school network. Consequently, after Myanmar (Burma)'s independence, the school remained somewhat independent of the Basic Education High School network, although they shared the same government implemented syllabus.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the World War II, the school had boarding facilities, mainly for students from out of town. The school was served by the Rangoon Electric Tramway's University Line along Prome Road (now Pyay Road).\n\nThe Yangon University of Education (Lower Myanmar) independently runs the TTC High School with the joint administration of Higher Education Department, unlike the rest of the schools in the country which are administered by the Basic Education Department. TTC Yangon is therefore the only significant school of considerable size outside the Basic Education School network.\n\nTTC has two campuses: Pyay Road (in Kamayut Township) campus and Hlaing campus (in Hlaing Township. Kamayut campus is wide, and is the main site of the school, housing much of the school's original pre-war buildings. Hlaing campus was acquired around 2000. It is wide, and comprises the unused buildings of the failed Regional College system of the 1970s. Both campuses are different to other schools'campuses for their university-like locations. Hlaing campus contains some lecture theatres, the only ones owned by a high school in Myanmar, although they are seldom used.\n\nKamayut campus is bordered by three universities: the University of Medicine-1, Yangon, the University of Education, and the University of Distant Education, sharing the same main street, Thaton Street.\n\nThe Hlaing campus was once used as a regional college (Regional College 2). However, due to reforms in the education systems, the whole regional college system and campuses were abandoned. TTC rented the Regional College 2 campus, beginning in late 2000. There are about 130 classrooms across 18 buildings shared between the two campuses. A total of 9000 students from kindergarten (Grade 1) to 10th Standard (Grade 11) are studying at TTC and around 167 teachers and support staff.\n\nTTC Yangon has a large student body in Yangon and in Myanmar, numbering near 9000. The students are spread across eleven standards or grades, from Grade-1 (formerly Kindergarten of KG) to Grade-11 (formerly Tenth Standard, colloquially \"sei-dan\")\n\nFor many years, TTC students have a tradition of putting the right finger at the lip and say \"Kyan Mar Shwin Lan Par Sae\" *_ကျန်းမာရွင်လန်းပါစေ ဆရာ/ဆရာမ_* - (good health to you) to the teachers. This is a tradition to show respect to the teachers.\n\nStudents wear uniform. There are two sets of uniform, one for wear from Kindergarten to 4th Standard (Grades 1 to 5), and another, more traditional one for wear from the 5th Standard to 10th Standard (Grades 6 to 11). All uniforms are of the same colour - a white shirt or blouse, with a green garment for the torso.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the TTC student's uniform is the lack of the sewn-in school badge - all other schools require that the school name and badge be sewn into either the shoulder sleeve or above the single left side pocket.\n\nIn TTC, a small brooch like badge, bearing an oil lamp (in both Buddhist and Burmese terminology, the oil lamp represents wisdom and education), with school's name. TTC Yangon is the only school which has such a badge system.\n\n\n\nIt ranks the highest overall in Burmese High School in the Myanmar University Entrance exam, conducted by the Myanma Examination Board. TTC's student body produces many high scoring students both in terms of collective subjects and individual subjects, making into the very competitive \"nationwide outstanding top-ten students' list\", colloquially known as the whole-Burma or top ten list quite often.\n\nTTC has won medals in national and international competitions, such as South East Asian Games.\n\nStudents have won medals in \"Myanmar Traditional and Cultural Performing Arts Competition\" (\"So-Ka-Yay-Tee\") and won painting\ncompetitions.\n\nTTC relied on already existing buildings for much of its existence. Much of these buildings were on loan from the Yangon University of Education. However, by 2000, the grants expired and were not renewed. In order to cope with the loss of nearly three-quarters of its classroom capacity, a building and renovation programme was implemented, resulting in the renting of the former University of Yangon (Hlaing Campus), which was also known as Regional College Number 2 (or RC-2), and the building of a new school wing. Five wings from RC-2 were rented from the Ministry of Education in 2000, and the completion of a three-storey wing.\n\nWith the rising use of the internet and government promotion of information technology, two IT labs have been added to the campus facilities, though they are not frequently used, due to the overwhelming student population. A new assembly hall, arts hall and a chemistry lab have also been added.\n\n\"Pyay Campus\"\n\"Hlaing Campus\"\n\nDue to insufficient space in the Pyay Campus, much of the modernisation and equipment are channelled to the Hlaing Campus\n\n\nSouth East Asian Games Gold medalist\nNational representative in Olympic Games, Asian Games and South East Asian Games\n\n"}

It operates under the Toronto District School Board and was previously part of the pre-amalgamated board, Scarborough Board of Education prior to merger. Originated at Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute in 1977 as the re-entry program, the school opened in 1986 at 959 Midland Avenue and as of 2010, the school is located in the campus of the former Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute sharing with the fellow schools, South East Year Round Alternative Centre and Caring and Safe Schools Alternative Program Area C.\n\nSCAS also operates a satellite campus on 2740 Lawrence Avenue East at David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute site for the Carpentry program.\n\nThe \"Re-entry Program\" in Scarborough began in November 1977 at Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute with one teacher and fifteen students. Envisioned was a program which would meet the needs of dropouts or disadvantaged learners wishing to return to school; the program had grown and transformed into an adult program. By 1985, the program featured 9.33 teachers and 200 students.\n\nIn 1980, the \"Co-Op Re-entry Program\" was established. The program featured an in-school component with a job experience placement and grew from the original two teachers and 35 students to 5 teachers and 170 students in 1986.\n\nFormerly known as Tabor Park Vocational School, the Re-entry Programs were united and expanded as Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies originally opened on September 2, 1986 at 959 Midland Avenue operated by the Scarborough Board of Education with 360 adults. At Tabor Park, agencies operating at SCAS included a rooms registry service called Scarborough Housing Assistance: Placement and Education for Singles (SHAPES), the counseling service Metro Youth Services, a day care facility operated by NYAD (Not Your Average Day Care), and the board's Community Liaison Office.\n\nIn May 1988, the SBE was planning to move the SCAS to a new facility. The Tabor Park campus was one of seven high schools in the Metro being given to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now the Toronto Catholic District School Board), so the Scarborough board had to vacate it along with the user groups. School board trustees considered closing one of the following collegiate schools to make room for a new SCAS: Winston Churchill, Midland, Wexford, W.A. Porter, and David and Mary Thomson. In November 1988 the school had 850 adult students. Parents in Donwood Park protested one of the relocation plans for SCAS.\n\nMeanwhile, the SBE moved classes as a method to quickly find a temporary location before the Tabor Park property being transferred to the MSSB on July 1, 1989. To save the costs, 28 classes were moved to the former Highbrook Senior Public School on 39 Highbrook Crescent, Thomson Collegiate received 20 classes at 2740 Lawrence Avenue East (along with the Carpentry program) and moved the remaining six to a commercial site in the area totaling to 54 classes.\n\nThe original SCAS campus was reopened and became known as Jean Vanier Catholic Secondary School in September 1989. The need for a new adult school led to a 'unique partnership' between the SBE and Centennial College, in 1992, to establish the new campus for SCAS, (originally the Scarborough Career Planning Centre) on 939 Progress Avenue that opened in September 1994. The programs were previously had been in temporary locations after the loss of Tabor Park.\n\nAfter 16 years, in September 2010, the school moved to 720 Midland Avenue, the site of the former Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute as Centennial expanded the teaching space by acquiring the latter site. The centre currently shares the Midland building with South East Year Round Alternative Centre and Caring and Safe Schools program.\n\nLike all TDSB adult learning centres, it has two distinctive programs, EdVance and Adult.\n\nSince the school is located in the Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute facility in 2010, SCAS currently occupies some parts of the first floor, most parts of the second floor, and the entire third floor space. The school carries many modernist design features consisting of five stairwells, a circular cafeteria, a two floor library with two seminar rooms, wide guidance area, larger atrium, a theatre with more than 900 seats, 33 academic classrooms, two home economics rooms, one large lecture hall, four performing art rooms for music/dance/drama, two visual art rooms, five science labs, three gymnasia with the larger one that can be partitioned into two smaller gyms with SCAS occupying the larger gym, and large athletic field as well the track and football/soccer fields with an attached hill. The swimming pool remains partly leased.\n\nHistorically, the school was attached by a day care centre, Not Your Average Daycare, and continues to do so today.\n\nAs the Progress Campus built in the lands of Centennial College, the school was built in a triangular configuration and students would get lunches from the college's cafeteria. Previously, SCAS had lunch service at the Tabor Park campus.\n\nAlternative Scarborough Education 1 (ASE 1) is an alternative school originally affiliated with SCAS.

At the same time, a gradual move started away from separate secondary schools and technical high schools toward comprehensive secondary schools serving both, and district high schools started falling out of favour to separate secondary schools. Combined with the post-World War II baby boom, the number of secondary students swelled and a large number of new secondary schools had to be built. By 1960, the number of secondary students had tripled from 39,000 to 140,000, and the number of secondary schools had increased to 239, comprising 102 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 41 technical high schools.\n\nWith the large number of new schools being built, most state secondary schools in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were built to common designs. The first common design was the Naenae type (after its first use at Naenae College) in 1953, with schools built with long two-story classroom wings of mixed concrete and timber construction. This was followed by the Henderson type (after Henderson High School), which was a single-story all-timber version of the Naenae type. Starting in 1957, secondary schools moved to consisting of blocks of classrooms. The Nelson plan (named for the city in which it was designed) first started with single-storey timber buildings with 6 classrooms, before evolving into two-storey H-shaped timber buildings containing 12 classrooms in 1960. The design lasted over a decade, with the Nelson classroom block going on to become the most numerous type of classroom block found in New Zealand secondary schools. In 1971, the Nelson plan was replaced with the S68 plan (after the 1968 prototype at Porirua College), which featured single-storey classroom blocks of concrete block construction, with low pitched roofs, and internal open courtyards. In 1980, two new common design plans were introduced: the Whanau plan used at Macleans College, and the Leeston plan used at Ellesmere College. However at the same time, student numbers plateaued and secondary school construction dwindled, resulting in common design plans being dropped in 1982 in favour of schools being individually designed.\n\nBy 1980, there were 265 secondary schools and 35 district high schools, with technical high schools having been completely phased out.\n\nIn 1989, the school leaving age was raised to the present age of 16. Also in 1989, the \"Tomorrow's Schools\" reform was implemented, moving the governance of secondary schools from district education boards to individual school communities through elected boards of trustees.\n\nThere are three types of school: state, private (or registered or independent) and state integrated schools. State and state integrated schools are government funded. Private schools receive about 25% of their funding from the government, and rely on tuition fees for the rest. State integrated schools are former private schools which are now \"integrated\" into the state system under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 \"on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them\". According to Ministry of Education statistics, of the 284,052 secondary students (Years 9–15) enrolled in New Zealand schools at 1 July 2012, 81.6 percent (231,817) attend state schools, 12.6 percent (35,924) attend state integrated schools, and 5.7 percent (16,230) attend private schools.\n\nMany private schools, state area schools and state integrated schools take students from Years 0 to 13, or Years 7 to 13.\n\nFor state schools, the Education Amendment Act 2000 puts in place a new \"system for determining enrollment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding.\" Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined \"home zone\". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house, if it has one, gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school's home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, in the following order of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of board employees; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a ballot, which is randomly selected.\n\nCritics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lowers socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone.\n\nThe Government-run student qualification system is the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (\"NCEA\"). At some schools students can opt for IGCSE/A-levels (popularly known as \"Cambridge exams\") or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.\n\nNCEA has three levels, one for each of the last three years of secondary school. It contains a mix of internal and external assessments. NCEA replaced the old School Certificate, Sixth Form Certificate and Bursary systems.\n\nThe IGCSE and A-level exams of the Cambridge International Examinations Board are offered at some schools. For these qualifications, IGCSE is sat in year 11, AS-level in year 12 and A-level in year 13. Neither of these independent qualifications are registered on the NZQA National Qualifications Framework.\n\nUniversity Entrance, based on NCEA results, allows entrance to New Zealand universities. New Zealand Scholarship is a qualification pitched at students within the top stanine level.\n\nStrictly speaking, no fees need to be paid for education at a state school provided the student is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident, or an Australian citizen. However, most schools also ask for a \"voluntary donation\" from parents, informally known as \"school fees\" or a \"parental contribution\".\n\nThe Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) is the largest trade union in secondary education in New Zealand with 18,000 teaching staff employed in state and state integrated secondary schools being members.\n\nIndependent Schools Education Association (ISEA) is the union for teaching and non-teaching staff in New Zealand independent (private) schools.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46472566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46472566", "title": "Smith College commencement controversies", "text": "Smith College commencement controversies\n\nCommencement controversy at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts has sometimes been the result of the selection of the commencement speaker. Most recently, this occurred between February and May 2014, when protests over Christine Lagarde’s invitation allegedly forced her to rescind her acceptance to give the commencement speech for the class of 2014 at their graduation. While it is said that “such reversals have become more common in recent years” given that, “what has changed is not so much the protests themselves, but the willingness of colleges and speakers to give in”, there is actually a longer history of controversy over the chosen commencement speaker that spans back to the 1960s if not before. What Smith’s history shows is that the struggle over representation, as demonstrated by the controversy over commencement speakers in many colleges, is not a new occurrence, but rather an old stage for a struggle over an institution’s values and those that the institution represents.\n\nIn 1967, the then-President Thomas C. Mendenhall invited Nicholas Katzenbach to be the commencement speaker for the graduating class. At the time, he was the 24th Undersecretary of State under Lyndon Johnson. When it was announced that he was to give the commencement speech, he was roundly criticized for his stance on the Vietnam War. The senior class petitioned, stating: “We are honored by the presence of Nicholas B. Katzenbach as our commencement speaker. We respect and admire his past work in the fields of civil rights and crime prevention. However, in his post as Under Secretary of State, he is clearly a representative of America’s present foreign policy. Therefore, we the undersigned graduating seniors of Smith College take this opportunity to express our opposition to our government’s responsibility for widening the conflict in Vietnam.” At their own commencement, members of the graduating class wore white armbands to express their disagreement with the foreign policy of the United States.\n\nMany faculty members also made their opposition to the Vietnam War clear by providing every commencement pamphlet with a petition. The petition quotes: “Our hopes are that the U.S. Government, by means of an extraordinary conciliatory gesture, will seek a way of bringing peace to our country and to the world.” Nicholas Katzenbach delivered the speech on the 4th of June, 1967, titled, “How Can You Be So Sure?” amidst all parents, faculty, staff and students. After his speech, President Mendenhall held a conference where Katzenbach expressed the policies of the U.S. in regards to the Vietnam War more specifically. The \"Alumnae Quarterly\" of the Summer of 1967 reflected on both methods of protest as “dignified” and hailed the president for handling the situation so well.\n\nWhile there was not as much controversy in 1970 over the choice of Alan Frank Guttmacher, the president of Planned Parenthood, the backlash from parents and Alumnae represent their powerful force in an institution that no longer represents them directly. 1970 was also the year that President Richard Nixon's daughter graduated from Smith College. He could not attend the event because his policies were not widely accepted and to avoid the possibility of protests at what was a considered a non-political event. Many parents and Alumnae wrote to the president, Thomas Mendenhall, declaring their dissatisfaction with the commencement speaker choice and lamenting how the President of The United States, nor his daughter, could be present at her own graduation. In a letter to the editor of the Daily Hampshire Gazette, the author stated: “If the present Administration and Trustees feel [they] cannot handle the troublemakers on Campus, then quietly resign and I’m sure you will have some others who will be quite capable of handling the situations as they arise and will not cop-out.” Many were upset that the president of Planned Parenthood, an organization that they say promoted pre-marital sex, could speak in front of the Smith Community while the President of The United States “could not” attend.\n\nDr. Alan F. Guttmacher delivered his address on graduation day, which was titled, “Fertility Control: A Gift and Challenge.”\n\nOne of the most notable controversies of Smith College’s history of commencement was the President’s, Jill Ker Conway, and the trustees’ decision to host Jeane Kirkpatrick as the class of 1983′s speaker. After she served as a foreign policy adviser to Ronald Reagan, she was the first female U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and was known for her doctrine, The Kirkpatrick Doctrine which justified U.S. support of military dictatorships in Central and South America. Almost immediately after the announcement of their choice, students organized against it, claiming that a human rights abuser should not receive an honorary degree. A letter to the \"Alumnae Quarterly\" by Helen Haddad ’63 said: “Students began writing letters and ‘perspectives’ pieces to \"The Sophian\", both in support of, and in opposition to, Mrs. Kirkpatrick–among them was a piece written by a senior whose aunt was one of the four Maryknoll nuns killed in El Salvador. They discussed their interpretations of Mrs. Kirkpatrick’s published books and articles. They discussed American foreign policy in Latin America, South Africa, and elsewhere. Some students who in October knew very little about Mrs. Kirkpatrick, except perhaps that she was an ambassador to the United Nations, were now arguing over her views and votes, whether or not she was an appropriate commencement speaker and whether or not they approved of the award of an honorary degree”\n\nBesides the tone which assumes Smith Students did not know of these issues before Kirkpatrick was chosen, it is clear that there was much sentiment against what made her a powerful woman within the U.S. government. This incited a discussion on the kind of feminism that Smith represents, being an all women’s liberal arts college. When Kirkpatrick canceled her commencement speech and eventually declined the honorary degree, alumnae, students, parents, and the media took hold of the story and framed it as a freedom of speech issue that was plaguing College Campuses.\n\nThe frame that many media outlets used to situate the Kirkpatrick controversy at Smith was used again in 2014 in regards to Christine Lagarde’s decision to withdraw her acceptance to speak at graduation. Christine Lagarde, the first female Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, sparked numerous protests, petitions, and discussions. Parallel’s were drawn with Smith’s current campaign, that states its mission as educating powerful woman for the benefit of the world. Whether or not Christine Lagarde benefited the world with her high-status position was the contested question.\n\nIn the wake of the protests, she rescinded her acceptance to speak at Smith College’s commencement ceremony. The response to her withdrawal was immense. Numerous articles appeared in major media outlets. Many alumnae wrote to the President, Kathleen McCartney, and faculty petitioned against those who had petitioned in support of McCartney and the Trustees. Students who had organized against the choice of having her speak wrote an open letter to McCartney after she emailed the entire College, stating: “I want to underscore this fact: An invitation to speak at a commencement is not an endorsement of all views or policies of an individual or the institution she or he leads. Such a test would preclude virtually anyone in public office or position of influence. Moreover, such a test would seem anathema to our core values of free thought and diversity of opinion. I remain committed to leading a college where differing views can be heard and debated with respect.”\n\n"}

The Simonian Foundation fully funds the center, its programs, and the adjacent Tumanyan Park. The Simonians are also directly involved in Tumo’s operations, with Sam lending his knowledge on technology and its economic impact and Sylva contributing to the center’s engagement with the environment and the program’s overall curriculum.\nMarie Lou Papazian is CEO of the Simonian Educational Foundation and Managing Director of Tumo. In addition to her responsibilities in managing the center, she led the design and construction management of the center’s interior architecture and outdoor plaza. Prior to Tumo, Marie Lou co-founded the Education for Development Foundation in 2001, where she led the Three Pomegranates project linking Armenian students to their global peers through web-based educational activities. She has a graduate degree in Education from the Columbia Teachers College and serves as a member of the Information Technology Council of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.\nTumo’s Board of Advisors is made up of professionals from North America and Armenia with industry experience across the center’s core focus areas. Members include Twitter's Vice President of Platform Engineering Raffi Krikorian, Pixar’s Katherine Sarafian, System of a Down’s lead vocalist Serj Tankian, and Industrial Toys’ Alex Seropian.\n\nBoard of Advisors\n\nStudents at Tumo advance through the center’s learning program based on their individual preferences and at their own pace. Within that flexible framework, they work towards very specific learning targets organized around four focus areas: animation, game development, web development, and digital media.\n\nTumo members are initially encouraged to get exposure to all four of Tumo’s focus areas. As they progress through the curriculum, completing a succession of increasingly challenging projects, members begin to concentrate on one of the four areas and work towards completion of a final project at the end of a two-year cycle.\n\nIn addition to instruction in its main focus areas, the Tumo curriculum covers a set of supporting technical, artistic and professional skills. These include computer programming, 3D modeling, 2D graphics, drawing, music, writing, online literacy and communication.\n\nTumo’s flagship location in Yerevan occupies over 6,000 square meters on the first two floors of a modern building. This space is especially designed to fit the flexibility and transparency of the Tumo learning system. The building’s other four floors provide office space to technology and media companies that have the potential of becoming partners in Tumo’s educational mission. The rental income from these commercial tenants ensures the sustainability of the Tumo program.\n\nTumo is located in one of Yerevan’s largest green areas, Tumanyan Park, which is maintained and managed by Tumo. The park is equipped with a range of sports and recreational facilities, including a basketball court and a football field. The Tumo Plaza, acting as a link between the technology of the Tumo building and the natural setting of Tumanyan Park, is an innovative outdoor space made up of large, triangulated surfaces and packed with water features: a reflective pool, a large historic fountain equipped with hundreds of LED lights, and a playful pop-up fountain.\n\nIn January 2013, with the support of the Central Bank of Armenia, Tumo launched its free of charge program in Dilijan, a resort town in northern Armenia. The center operates in the Knowledge for Development Center, the local library building reconstructed by the Central Bank.\n\nSimilar to the original Tumo, students in Dilijan are split across four focus areas (animation, digital media, video game development, and web development) and hands-on workshops taught by professional mentors. It is equipped with 29 workstations and currently serves more than 200 teenagers enrolled in the program who come from Dilijan and other adjacent rural areas.\n\nTumo partnered with the Armenian General Benevolent Union to open a branch in Gyumri, the second largest city in Armenia. Following a fundraising initiative by Shant TV, Tumo opened its doors in May 2015. \n\nAs a result of continued cooperation with the Armenian General Benevolent Union and support from Karabakh Telecom, the newest Tumo branch opened in Stepanakert in the Republic of Artsakh in September 2015.\n"}

{"id": "47261195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47261195", "title": "University of Dschang", "text": "University of Dschang\n\nThe University of Dschang is located in the town of Dschang, West Cameroon, about 425 kilometers northwest of Yaoundé. It has its roots in three agricultural training schools, and evolved from an agricultural institution to a university in 1993.\n\nIn 1977, the Government of Cameroon authorized the creation of university centers at locations in Cameroon. The University Center at Dschang (UCD), was created by Presidential Decree No. 77/108 of April 28, 1977. In May 1978, ENSA (Ecole Nationale Supérieure Agronomique) in Yaounde and the Institute for Agricultural Technologies in Dschang were incorporated into the UCD. ENSA was to be transferred to Dschang as soon as possible. These two institutions were later merged into a single academic entity \"The National Institute of Rural Development\".\n\nIn 1979-80, the US government, in exchanges with the Cameroon government, decided to provide assistance to UCD. In 1981, the University of Florida was selected on a competitive basis to design that assistance, through what was named the Agricultural Education Project.\n\nIn 1993, the UCD was transformed into the University of Dschang.\n\nIn 1979, the governments of Cameroon and the United States agreed to build a new academic institution in Cameroon. It was a time when the government of Cameroon had decided to place academic institutions in key corners of the country. Since there were already academic institutions in the commercial capital (Douala), the political capital (Yaoundé), in the north in Ngaundere, the new institutions were to be placed in the west (at Dschang) and in the south west (at Buea).\n\nThe US government committed $44 million USD (a mix of a grant and a loan) to fund the Dschang project, and the Cameroon government made a contribution of about $74 million USD that covered the salaries of Cameroonian staff and infrastructure. Belgium contributed about $8 million USD. The US contribution was split between two independent programs, one on infrastructure and the other on academic programs and training. The contract for the former was subcontracted to a construction company from Senegal. The latter was awarded to the University of Florida (UF) in 1982, with a small sub-contract to the Florida A&M University. The UF team was led by Joe Busby who, in 1987, was succeeded by Charlie Eno who led the team until 1989, when he was succeeded by Peter Hartmann who ran the project until 1992.\n\nThe institute’s Director General was Rene Owona. (Later when the institute became a university center, the Director General title was upgraded to that of Rector). By 1990, Owona was pulled out of the UCD and appointed Minister of Commerce. Upon his departure, Owona was replaced by Professor Jean Mfoulu who was transferred from the Ministry, where he was Director for Higher Education. His primary base was the University of Yaoundé, where he was a professor of sociology. Mfoulu held a PhD from Boston University.\n\nThere was a four-year delay on building construction, imposing serious strains on all program components – student housing, library, administrative facilities, and research facilities.\n\nAnother source of strain was the way the training of faculty was programmed. During the duration of the project, over fifty Cameroonian professionals received graduate training. Sending so many (almost half of UCD staff) for long-term studies put a huge burden on the remaining faculty and students. Only the strong collaborative spirit of the remaining faculty – American, Belgium, Cameroonian, and French - and the use to teaching assistants from external institutions saw UCD through the difficult time. Their overseas training completed, the returnees took up positions as faculty members.\n\nBy 1993, the UCD was upgraded to a full-fledged university and given the name, Dschang University. It has over 800 academic staff and 14000 students.\n\nThe University of Dschang is organized in five faculties and two institutes.\n\n\n\nIt soon became obvious that the institution was playing a regional role, particularly in training, but also in its research collaborations. Neighboring countries, like Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo, were sending students to Dschang. It was increasingly involved in regional training and collaborative research with international agencies like IITA, ILRI (formerly ILCA), and ICIPE. Dschang’s bilingual capacity is a major asset.\n"}
