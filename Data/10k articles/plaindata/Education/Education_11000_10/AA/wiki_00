The Manila Bulletin calls the school \"China’s most prestigious and renowned art academy\". It is considered one of the most selective schools in the country and turns away more than 90% of its applicants each year.\n\nThe history of National Art School in Beiping (国立北平艺术专科学校) dates back to the founding of National School of Fine Arts in Beijing in 1918, advocated by the educator Cai Yuanpei. It was the first national school of fine arts in China, and also the beginning of Chinese modern education of fine arts. The academy was founded in April 1950, as a result of merger between National Art School in Beiping and the department of fine arts at third campus of North China University. Mao Zedong wrote the school name. The former principals of CAFA include Xu Beihong, Jiang Feng, Wu Zuoren, Gu Yuan and Jin Shangyi. Current president is the painter and historian of fine arts, Prof. Pan Gongkai. Current Vice President is renowned contemporary artist, Xu Bing. Current secretary of CPC's committee is Yang Li. Current director of academic commission is the oil painter Jin Shangyi.\n\nThe academy comprises six specialty schools: School of Fine Art, School of Chinese Painting, School of Design, School of Architecture, School of Humanities, and School of Urban Design. A post-graduate education school and a high school of fine arts are also affiliated. There are 534 teachers and staffs for 3,800 undergraduate and graduate students, and over 100 international students at school. Its museum of fine arts boasts precious collections, including more than 2,000 Chinese scroll paintings since the Ming dynasty. CAFA edits, publishes and distributes two national first-class academic magazines, \"Fine Arts Study\" and \"Fine Arts of the World\". \n\nThe design programme of CAFA was renewed in 1995 in the name of the Department of Art Design, after a break of some forty years, and became the School of Design in October, 2002. with the goal of preparing and training the students as future professionals in design with creative thinking and practical capabilities, the School of Design offers undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. degrees in programs ranging from visual communication design, product design, fashion design, photography, digital media to design theory and history. The School of Design plays an important role in promoting design in China and is intensively involved in design activities, most noticeable of which are its designs for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe new CAFA Art Museum, designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, is located at the northeast corner of CAFA campus at No.8, Huajiadi Nan Street, Wangjing, covering an area of 3546 m, with total floor area of 14 777 m. The Museum opened in October 2008, for the University's 90th anniversary. The new, six-floor museum has several notable collections, including over 2,000 historic Chinese scroll paintings dating to the Ming Dynasty. The museum hosts rotating exhibitions. Tickets are 10 RMB.\n\nThe school drew media attention during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, during which the students protested by creating a large statue, called the Goddess of Democracy. Each of the eight art academies signed a statement explaining the purpose of the statue.\n\nIn 2018, asteroid 118418 Yangmei was named in honor of the academy.\n\n\n\n\nSet up in the early 1960s, Museum of Central Academy of Fine Arts, formerly CAFA Gallery when it was located at Xiaowei Hutong in downtown Beijing<nowiki>\"</nowiki>s Wangfujing Street, always focuses on the collection of artworks and has a rich collection of some 13,000 works which cover a wide variety of genres and styles, including representative works by ancient and modern Chinese masters as well as fine student works since the incorporation of the foundation of the Academy in 1950, across the categories of Chinese painting, oil painting, print, sculpture and folk art such as New Year picture, embroidery and minority ethnic costume and objects, along with Chinese relics of bronze, pottery, engravings and rubbings.\n\nDesigned by Arata Isozaki, a renowned Japanese architect, the new museum of CAFA is a building of 14,777 square meters on a land of 3,546 square meters, with four floors above ground and two floors underground. The museum will be put into use in September 2008, together with the collection warehouse, permanent and temporary exhibition halls, as well as supporting facilities including artist studios, lecture and conference rooms and cafeteria and bookstore.\n\nCAFA‘s Library has a long history.

It was founded by the Archdiocese of Santiago in 1904. The school is dedicated to \"Our Lady of Andacollo\" (), also known as the \"Virgin of Andacollo\" (), a celebrated Catholic image of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe history of Andacollo Parish School originates in the beginning of the 20th century in the midst many social questions. In the midst of a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of then Santiago, full of tenements and house of ill-repute, was lifted the tower of a chapel that shared the same land as the Confraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer. The Confraternity decided to destine the land for the construction of a sanctuary and a school for children that the priest of that era dedicated to Our Lady of Andacollo (Nuestra Señora de Andacollo).\n\nIn spite of always counting on the support of persons of good will, the economic highs and lows from the beginning of the school's history endangered the institution's future. Hence, those around it have transformed a small school into something much larger.\n\nThe school opened in a simple for in 1904, teaching literacy to the young boys of the neighborhood. Thus, the cornerstone was laid in 1906 of what would become the Sanctuary of Andacollo, under the direction of Rev. Ladislao Godoy, who would later be known as \"el Cura de Andacollo\" (the priest of Andacollo).\n\nIn the following year, some enthusiastic youth founded the first \"Patronato de Andacollo.\" As this building acquired increasing importance, the archbishop of Santiago erected it formally as a parish in June 1912., appointing Rev. Godoy as the first pastor. In that same year, Miguel Covarrubias Valdés took the helm of the school, seeking those who wanted to help him with the work.\n\nThe plan for the Patronato was always clear from the start. The idea was: \"To take the child from the first years in school, provide a Christian education and a practical instruction, without disregard for the catechesis and sports on Sundays. The young person will not be abandoned after graduation with the creation of an alumni organization and a worker's center. The goal is to improve the neighborhood morally and materially and to promote hygiene and savings and to establish,as possible, organizations and unions.\"\n\nThus, in rapid succession a variety of organizations were formed that accompanied not only the Christian formation of the child but also of the entire family. To that end, in 1911, the \"Protective Union of Andacollo\" was formed as a mutual benefit society, the \"St. Vincent DePaul Society was formed with organizations for both men and women in 1915, a Sunday school was launched in 1916, and a worker's center was formed in 1930.\n\nThe oldest attendance registry of the school dates covers the period from 1915 to 1919, with teacher Felix Berrios Bustamante, who was later named rector in 1919.\n\nThe neighborhood around the parish and colegio was very porr. In that period, streets were not paved and many houses of \"ill repute\" populated the neighborhood. Hence, the patronato exercised a positive influence in the community, and the school was one of the best examples, since \"the kids did not go about so dirty and all of them had shoes.\"\n\nThe school began to need analytic programs in conformity with the \"modern\" pedagogy of the day. Thus, Aniceto Gallardo, director of the school \"Escuela Olea,\" successfully implemented these reforms.\n\nIn 1913, the parish school had 180 students. That year, a night school was opened in addition to the day school, given that so many students worked during the day. During this same period, a student from a prestigious Jesuit school, San Ignacio, volunteered at the parish and school. That student worked in the office, as librarian, and as banker for the parish's students and its worker center. This student later enrolled in law school, focus on labor law, before entering the seminary with the Jesuits. Today, he is known as St. Alberto Hurtado. St. Alberto Hurtado was a champion of youth and the poor. His ministry with both began at Andacollo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46584869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46584869", "title": "Corps Saxo-Thuringia München", "text": "Corps Saxo-Thuringia München\n\nThe Corps Saxo-Thuringia München is a fraternity (\"Studentenverbindung\") in Munich, Germany, founded on March 15, 1882. It is one of 162 \"German Student Corps\" in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical European fraternal corporations, with roots dating back to the 15th century and fraternities founded in several European countries.\n\nMembership in the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Munich's universities and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character. Members of the Corps Saxo-Thuringia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Saxo-Thuringia's members wear the traditional couleur, colored stripes, in lightblue-white-orange. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.\n\nLike all \"German Student Corps\", Saxo-Thuringia expects tolerance from its members in political, scientific and religious affairs. Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Saxo-Thuringia as an entity always remains neutral. This \"neutrality\" is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging \"fox\") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (\"Rezeption\"). The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.\nMembers of the Corps Saxo-Thuringia value and practice the tradition of engagements in \"academic fencing\", or \"Mensur\" in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the German school of fencing, is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time. Mark Twain described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices. Saxo-Thuringia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional \"couleur\", colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as \"wearing colors\" (German: \"Farben tragen\"), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.\n\n\"Activity\" and \"responsibility\" are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term (\"Semester\") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies. Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility. All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society. Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of \"Alter Herr\" (alumnus).\n\nLong-term guidance is expected from and provided by said \"Alte Herren\", who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities (Weinheim and Bad Kösen) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/KSCV). In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.\n\nOne half of the current fraternity was founded as Landsmannschaft Nicaria featuring the colors „Light blue - white - orange\" and the Motto \"Post Nubila Phoebus\" (Sunshine follows rain) and the fencing motto \"Amico pectus, hosti frontem\" (Arm your friend, confront your enemgy) on March 15, 1882 near Stuttgart.\n\nThe other half of the current fraternity was founded as Landsmannschaft Thuringia on November 2, 1898 with the colors \"Black - Gold - Blue\" in Munich. The motto was \"Einigkeit macht stark“ (strength through unity) and fencing motto \"Nunquam Retrorsum\" (never retreat). After joining the umbrella organization Rudolstädter SC (RSC) in 1885, the fraternity chose to rename itself to Saxo-Thuringia in 1899. Later that year the fraternity grew by incorporating several members of the similar corporation Alemania. While a member of the RSC, the fraternity joined the \"Blaues Kartell\" in 1899/1900.\n\nThe fraternity members belonging to the RSC decided in 1902 to seize being a Landsmannschaft and transitioned the fraternity to a Corps (German Student Corps). Following the closure of the veterninary university in Stuttgart in 1910, Nicaria's members moved to Munich and fused with the Corps Saxo-Thuringia on October 29, 1910. Nicaria contributed a part of the new crest, the colors („Light blue - White - Orange\"), the mottos and the official founding date of the new fraternity. Saxo-Thuringia contributed the name, the post-nominal (\"Zirkel\") and remaining parts of the crest.\n\nCorps Saxo-Thuringia is a member of the \"Blaues Kartell\", a circle of four German Student Corps that understand the union as \"one fraternity spanning four cities\" (Berlin, Dresden, Hanover, and Munich).\n\n\nThe fraternity further has an official relationship with Corps Marko-Guestphalia Aachen since 2004 that has its origin in a fusion of Corps Albingia Aachen with the Corps Marko-Guestphalia in 1996. Corps Albingia had been reconstructed in Aachen after the second world war. Before the Nazis caused the German Student Corps to suspend activities in the 1930s, it flourished in Dresden where it had originally been founded on January 23, 1889. Corps Albingia Dresden was a former member of the Blaues Kartell.\n\n"}

Players run a theme park which features dinosaurs as its main attraction. The goal of the game is to care for the dinosaurs while keeping the park clean, organized, and well maintained.\n\n\"DinoPark Tycoon\" was developed by Manley & Associates Inc. and published by MECC (later SoftKey). Two versions were released: a retail version and a special school version, which was released to public elementary schools across the United States and Canada. In addition to the retail software, the school version includes background information and classroom activities for teachers. It was not required by the schools' curricula, but was intended to be a fun way for the students to learn basic finance and management skills. Writer Larry Blasko of the Associated Press described the game as having realistic similarities to real-life business management, along with skills such as mathematical estimation and \"what if?\" analysis.\n\nThe objective in \"DinoPark Tycoon\" is the successful administration of a dinosaur park. Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version. The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure. Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.\n\nPlayers then visit supply stores to buy the necessary items for park maintenance. The food store provides meat for carnivores, plants for herbivores and seeds for planting. The general store provides fences for the dinosaur pens, with varying degrees of strength and price; concessions such as bathrooms, gift shops and parking lots; and advertising, which is bought per season. The employment office offers the personnel to run the park, and Dino City retails the dinosaurs for the exhibits.\n\nAs time passes, players face problems such as escaping dinosaurs, sick employees, and seasonal attendance declines. According to Atari, \"Keeping the staff paid and the dinos fed and healthy is an ongoing task that requires kids to analyze graphs and numbers and make decisions based on their assumptions. The trick is to scratch out enough profit to expand the park with capital improvements and bigger and better dinosaurs.\" After paying off the loan, players may choose to sell their park; if it has been successful, the player achieves an onscreen award and an entry on the top scores list.\n\n\"DinoPark Tycoon\" was released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer home video game console in early 1994. It contains minor changes to gameplay and graphics.\n"}

Students generally choose advisors based on their areas of interest within their discipline, their desire to work closely with particular graduate faculty, and the willingness and availability of those faculty to work with them.\n\nIn some countries, the student's advisor serves as the chair of the doctoral examination or dissertation committees. In some cases, though, the person who serves those roles may be different from the faculty member who has most closely advised the student. For instance, in the Dutch academic system, only full professors (\"hoogleraren\") may chair doctoral examinations, so students who have been advised by lower-ranked faculty members will have a full professor as their official advisor (or \"promotor\") and their actual advisor as \"co-promotor\". In other countries, such as Spain, the doctoral advisor has the role of a mentor, but is not allowed to form part of the examination committee. This is a body of 5 experts independently selected by the rectorate among 10 candidates proposed by the university's department.\n\nAn academic genealogy may be traced based on student's doctoral advisors, going up and down the lines of academic \"descent\" in a manner analogous to a traditional genealogy.\n\n"}

It hosts online university-level courses in a wide range of disciplines to a worldwide student body, including some courses at no charge. It also conducts research into learning based on how people use its platform. EdX is a nonprofit organization and runs on the free Open edX open-source software platform.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University created edX in May 2012. More than 70 schools, nonprofit organizations, and corporations offer or plan to offer courses on the edX website. As of 29 December 2017, edX has around 14 million students taking more than 1,800 courses online.\n\nEdX courses consist of weekly learning sequences. Each learning sequence is composed of short videos interspersed with interactive learning exercises, where students can immediately practice the concepts from the videos. The courses often include tutorial videos that are similar to small on-campus discussion groups, an online textbook, and an online discussion forum where students can post and review questions and comments to each other and teaching assistants. Where applicable, online laboratories are incorporated into the course. For example, in edX's first MOOC — a circuits and electronics course — students built virtual circuits in an online lab.\n\nEdX offers certificates of successful completion and some courses are credit-eligible. Whether or not a college or university offers credit for an online course is within the sole discretion of the school. EdX offers a variety of ways to take courses, including verified courses where students have the option to audit the course (no cost) or to work toward an edX Verified Certificate (fees vary by course). For courses announced before December 7, 2015, there was an option to take honor code courses to work toward an Honor Code Certificate (no cost). EdX also offers XSeries Certificates for completion of a bundled set of two to seven verified courses in a single subject (cost varies depending on the courses).\n\nIn addition to educational offerings, edX is utilized for research into learning and distance education by collecting learners' clicks and analyzing the data, as well as collecting demographics from each registrant. A team of researchers at Harvard and MIT, led by David Pritchard and Lori Breslow, released their initial findings in 2013. EdX member schools and organizations also conduct their own research using data collected from their courses. Research focuses on improving retention, course completion and learning outcomes in traditional campus courses and online.\n\nEdX has engaged in a number of partnerships with educational institutions in the United States, China, Mongolia, Japan, and more to utilize edX courses in \"blended classrooms.\" In blended learning models, traditional classes include an online interactive component. San Jose State University (SJSU) partnered with edX to offer 6.00xL \"Introduction to Computer Science and Programming\", as a blended course at SJSU and released an initial report on the project in February 2013. Initial results showed a decrease in failure rates from previous semesters. The percentage of students required to retake the course dropped from 41% under the traditional format to 9% for those taking the edX blended course. In Spring 2013, Bunker Hill Community College and Massachusetts Bay Community College implemented a SPOC, or small private online course. The colleges incorporated an MIT-developed Python programming course on EdX into their campus-based courses, and reported positive results.\n\nOpen edX is the open-source platform software developed by EdX and made freely available to other institutions of higher learning that want to make similar offerings. On June 1, 2013, edX open sourced its entire platform. The source code can be found on GitHub.\n\nThe Open edX server-side software is almost entirely based on \"Python, with Django as the web application framework.\"\n\nSeveral higher-education institutions use the Open edX to provide MOOC services, such as St. George's University Online, MIT's MITx platform, and the University of La Serena.\n\nSome private companies also use Open edX to provide training to target populations. For example, MongoDB uses the \"Mongo University\", powered by Open edX, to provide training for their database product.\n\nIn March 2014, edX appointed Wendy Cebula, former COO of Vistaprint, as its President and Chief Operating Officer. CEO Anant Agarwal of MIT stated that Cebula would bring \"an entrepreneurial aspect\" and help the nonprofit to access \"commercial opportunities.\" Alan M. Garber, Provost of Harvard University, assisted by Michael D. Smith, a computer scientist who is Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, handles Harvard contributions. The design of a viable business model for sustainability of the enterprise is in progress.\n\nEdX was founded in May 2012 by scientists from Harvard and MIT. Gerry Sussman, Anant Agarwal, Chris Terman, and Piotr Mitros taught the first edX course on circuits and electronics from MIT, drawing 155,000 students from 162 countries. In 2013 they partnered with Stanford and in June 2013 they reached 1 million students. edx.org released as open source, creating Open edX.\n\nIn September 2014 edX announced a high school initiative.\n\nIn October 2014 edX announced Professional Education courses, and in March 2015 it partnered with Microsoft.\n\nIn April 2015, edX partnered with Arizona State University to launch the Global Freshman Academy.\n\nIn September 2016, edX launched 19 MicroMasters programs.\n\nIn February 2017, edX launched 16 MicroMasters programs.\n\nIn January 2018, edX partnered with Microsoft and General Electric to provide subsidized online courses and guaranteed job interviews.\n\nOn January 9, 2018, Tech Mahindra partnered with edX to re-skill workforce on new tech areas.\n\nIn late 2013, several countries and private entities announced their adoption of the edX open source platform to launch new initiatives. Ten Chinese universities joined together to form an online education initiative in China, called XuetangX. 120 higher education institutions in France joined under the direction of the French Ministry of Education to offer online courses throughout France, the Queen Rania Foundation for Education and Development (QRF) created Edraak as the first MOOC portal for the Arab world, the International Monetary Fund is using the edX platform to pilot online training courses in economics and finance, and Tenaris corporation is using the platform to expand its corporate training and education for its employees.\n\nAs of March 2017, edX has more than 110 partners, including universities, for-profit organizations and NGOs.\n"}

It is one of the schools of Tallinn University of Technology and it is the only educational institution in Estonia that offers professional higher education and Master’s level education in the maritime field. The university is located in the capital Tallinn but also has two centres in Saaremaa. In addition to higher education, the school contributes to research, provides training and offers services. The Academy also holds a one of a kind Simulator Centre and has a whole dedicated floor of hi-tech laboratories.\n\nThe first marine school in Estonia was founded in 1715 in Tallinn, later the school was founded in Narva as well. In these so-called calculation-schools, the sailors and shipbuilders studied different subjects, including navigation.\n\nIn 1880, a school was founded in Tallinn for children of the port factory and workshop staff. The better graduates of the school received the right to work as deck officers on ships. In the second half of the 19th century, a number of Estonian maritime schools were founded. The first of these was the Heinaste Maritime School (1864-1916), where the teaching languages were Estonian, Russian and Latvian. Other maritime schools followed in other cities as well: in Narva (1873 – 1918), Paldiski (1876 – 1916), Käsmu (1884 – 1931), Kuressaare (1891 – 1915), (1919 – 1928), (1942 – 1944), and Pärnu (1919 – 1922), (1945 – 1989).\n\nThe Tallinn Maritime School, the predecessor of the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT, was founded in 1919. At the same time, a class of engineer officers was opened at the Tallinn University of Applied Sciences (Estonian: Tallinna Tehnikum), which in 1920 became the Tallinn Ship Engineer School and, in 1935, was merged with the Tallinn Maritime School.\n\nIn 1945, the Tallinn Marine Fisheries Technicum was established, which was renamed the Tallinn Fisheries Technical School in 1956, the Tallinn Fish Industry Marine School in 1965, and the Tallinn Marine College in 1989.\n\nDuring the period of Soviet occupation from 1945 to 1991, the Estonian Maritime Schools belonged to the unified maritime education system of the USSR, and therefore the maritime education of Estonia was predominantly in Russian. In the newly independent Estonia, Estonian is again the language of instruction.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, three educational institutions in the maritime education field were provided in Tallinn:\n\n\nIn 1992, a united Estonian Maritime Education Center was formed, which merged Tallinn's Marine College and Tallinn 1st Industrial School. Before that, in 1991, the Pärnu Maritime School and the Oceanic Sea Marine School of Production were liquidated.\n\nIn 1999 Estonian Marine Education Center was renamed to the Estonian Maritime Academy.\n\nIn the autumn of 2006, a master's degree in maritime academy was opened.\n\nIn 2009, the Marine Academy's management moved from Lasnamäe to the top of the Kopli peninsula at the Kopli 101 building. Different faculties followed: The Maritime Faculty and the Training Center from Luise street building and in 2012, the Faculty of Shipping, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and other support structures from the Mustakivi street building.\nOn August 1, 2014, the Estonian Maritime Academy joined the Technical University of Tallinn and became one of the colleges and since then has been renamed Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT. When joining TUT, the Estonian Maritime Academy was separated from the Industrial Education Department, which became an independent educational institution called the Estonian Maritime School, located in the Kopli 101 courtyard building. The Joining Agreement was signed on April 23 of the same year.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT became one out of the five faculties of the TUT. When joining, the former TUT Kuressaare College was named the Kuressaare Center of the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT. TTU Small Craft Competence Center (SCC) continued with its former name.\n\nIn 2014, the Small Craft Competence Center was opened, the college celebrated its 15th birthday at the new address Tallinn 19, the electronic systems and the small craft engineering curricula were merged into the Marine Engineering programme. \nIn 2017, TUT Kuressaare College was joined to the Maritime Academy. When joining, the former TUT Kuressaare College was named the Kuressaare Center of the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT. TTU Small Craft Competence Center (SCC) continued with its former name\n\nRoomet Leiger is Director of the Estonian Maritime Academy since 01/05/2015.\n\nRectors\n\nDirectors\n\n\n"}

Kauffman and the former Effie May Winders, Kauffman grew up with his sister Irma Ruth Kauffman in Kansas City, Missouri. He was bedridden for a year at age 11 with a heart ailment, during which he read as many as 40 books a month.\n\nKauffman graduated from Kansas City's Westport High School in 1934, and later attended Kansas City Junior College,\n\nHe was an Eagle Scout and as an adult would be awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.\n\nAfter completing his Associate Degree, Kauffman enlisted in the United States Navy serving as a Sailor on a ship during World War II. After leaving the Navy, he worked as a pharmaceutical salesman until 1950, when he formed Marion Laboratories with a $5,000 investment, operating it initially out of the basement of his home. He reportedly chose to use his middle name rather than his last name in order to not appear to be a one-man operation.\n\nMarion Laboratories with Kauffman as chairman had revenues of $930 million the year before it merged, in 1989, with Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals to form Marion Merrell Dow. The company sale made more than 300 millionaires. Following the merger, Kauffman became chairman emeritus of the merged company.\n\nKauffman established the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in the mid-1960s with the same sense of opportunity he brought to his business endeavors, and, with the same convictions. Kauffman wanted his foundation to be innovative to fundamentally change people's lives. He wanted to help young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, get a quality education that would enable them to reach their full potential. He saw building enterprise as one of the most effective ways to realize individual promise and spur the economy. Today, the mission of the Kauffman Foundation follows his vision by focusing its grant making and operations on two areas: advancing entrepreneurship and improving the education of children and youth.\n\nEwing Kauffman established the Kansas City Royals, bringing major league baseball back to Kansas City. Shortly before Kauffman's death, he set up an unprecedented complex succession plan to keep the team in Kansas City.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, he was nominated to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the 2008 class; he was not elected. He was later nominated and elected to the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nIn 1988, Kauffman made a commitment to a group of high school students that if they would stay in school, stay off drugs, avoid teenage parenthood, commit to being good citizens and graduate on time, he would fund their post-secondary education. To be eligible for the program, parents also had to agree to be involved in their child's education by attending meetings and participating in parent/teacher organizations and other activities. Project Choice was offered to students at Kauffman's alma mater, Westport High School, and to selected students at five high schools in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nAt a time when other cities were building cookie-cutter, multipurpose sports facilities Kauffman went against the trend to build a home for the team, Royals Stadium, that was decades ahead of its time. The stadium was the only baseball-only facility built in the major leagues between 1966 and 1991. Fans in one of the sport's smallest markets responded by filling the stadium, topping the two-million attendance mark a total of ten times and seven seasons in a row.\n\nThe stadium opened on April 10, 1973, as part of the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City.\n\nDesigned by Kivett and Meyers architects in Kansas City, the stadium incorporated the best of the recently-built Dodger Stadium and Anaheim Stadium, with 40,793 seats, all facing second base and arranged in three tiers.\n\nA construction strike delayed the opening of the stadium so Kauffman added money to make sure it would open in time for the 1973 baseball season and the 1973 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\n\nThe stadium's prominent features include water fountains beyond the outfield fence and a ten-story-high scoreboard shaped like the Royals crest, topped by a gold crown. The water spectacular is the largest privately funded fountain in the world. The stadium featured an artificial-turf field, which was replaced in 1995 with grass.\n\nKauffman made his last public appearance at the stadium on May 23, 1993, when he was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame. One month before Kauffman died, the facility was officially renamed in his honor in a ceremony at the stadium on July 2, 1993; it is the only stadium in the American League named in honor of a person.\n\nIn 1962, he married the former Muriel Irene McBrien. He had two children from a previous marriage.\n\nSuffering from bone cancer, he died, age 76, at his home in Mission Hills, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. His remains are interred at the Ewing and Muriel Kauffman Memorial Garden next to his wife's remains, who died in 1995.\n\n"}

He is Professor and Vice-Chair of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and Professor of Cell Biology and Physiology at the University of Pittsburgh, where he is also Director of the Division of Developmental and Regenerative Medicine at the university's School of Medicine. Additionally, he is Deputy Director of the Magee-Womens Research Institute and Director of the Pittsburgh Development Center.\n\nSchatten was born in 1949 in New York City and was educated in the public school system, including at Stuyvesant High School. He graduated with an A.B. in Zoology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971, where he also obtained his Ph.D. in Cell and Developmental Biology.\n\nSchatten was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship for 1976-1977 to conduct mentored research under the direction of Daniel Mazia at UC Berkeley. He was also awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at the German Cancer Research Center.\n\nHe successively occupied the following positions:\n\n\nThroughout his academic career, Schatten has also conducted research and taught at various other institutions. During 1985-1986, he was an Instructor in Molecular Embryology of the Mouse at the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory and a Resident Instructor of Embryology at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. From 1986-1987, he held a visiting professorship at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University.\n\nSchatten's research focuses on imaging, cell biology, cell motility, cell architecture, human and other primates assisted reproductive technology (ART), reproductive and cell aging, cloning, transgenesis, and stem cells. His research has been funded through the National Institutes of Health as well as the National Science Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the NASA.\n\nSchatten’s work has been published extensively in many journals, such as \"Science\", \"Nature\", \"Lancet\", \"Nature Medicine\", \"Nature Cell Biology\", \"Journal of Cell Biology\", \"Genetics\", \"Development\", \"Developmental Biology\", \"Biology of Reproduction\", \"Human Reproduction\", and the \"Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics\".\n\nSchatten’s work on fertilization examines the differential inheritance of cellular components contributed by the sperm and egg, respectively, as well as the program of oocyte activation and cell division during meiosis and mitosis. His group has demonstrated the importance of the sperm centrosome-centriole complex during mammalian fertilization (including humans), with the unexpected exception of rodents in which the centrosome is of maternal origin (see Selected Publications).\n\nSchatten also made contributions to imaging and microscopy. In his first published paper, he demonstrated the utility of polylysine and other engineered peptides that could adhere to cells, embryos, and intracellular structures for various microscopic applications and purifications (see Selected Publications). This technology is now widely applied and has solved the problem of holding cells for imaging. His team also published findings on imaging calcium and other ion transients in egg, embryos and cells, as well as dynamic architectural alternations during fertilization and cell division (see Selected Publications).\n\nHis more recent research has focused on the use of human and primate stem cells to determine the potential of stem cell-based medical therapies and better understand cell and human development; the study of genetic versus epigenetic (environmental) causes for human disease; cloned transgenic disease modeling (using primates) (see Selected Publications).\n\nSchatten has also published on the topic of scientific ethics, including a 1998 piece on bio-ethical aspects of ART, \"Art before Science?\", in the \"Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics\" as well as a 2002 article in \"Nature Cell Biology\" titled \"Safeguarding ART\". Soon after, Schatten helped expose cloning frauds both by the Raelians and by a Korean lab he had links to. More recently, in 2009, he commented on the utilities and limitations of human disease modeling in genetically modified monkeys in the journal \"Nature\". In 2005, Schatten came to widespread media attention when he broke off his 20-month collaboration with Hwang Woo-suk, a Korean stem cell researcher, after reporting, first ethical, and later scientific lapses. In 2004 and 2005, Hwang claimed that his lab at the Seoul National University had successfully extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos, a statement later proved false. \"Science\" retracted both the 2004 article, in which Schatten had no involvement, and the 2005 article, which he participated in as a co-author. Schatten himself called for an investigation by his university, the University of Pittsburgh, in 2005. Finished in February 2006, the investigation committee concluded that Schatten was not guilty of scientific misconduct, because he was not involved in the falsification of data.\n\nSchatten has trained twenty doctoral and thirty postdoctoral fellows and he serves on the executive board of UNESCO’s International Cell Research Organization, a body devoted exclusively to research career training and mentorship. With Roger Pedersen (Cambridge, UK), Schatten established \"Frontiers in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research\", an NIH-sponsored advanced training course for new and established investigators. As with his National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-sponsored \"Frontiers in Reproduction\" course at the Woods Hole laboratory, this endeavor brings physician-scientists together with non-clinical counterparts for full-time, side-by-side, hands-on research training.\n\nSchatten’s honors include: NIH Sadler Lectureship (1997); NIH MERIT award (1997); the Purkinje Medal (2003) awarded by the Czech Academy of Sciences; Daniel Mazia Award from Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station (2003); Elected Fellow (1997) and Delegate (2005) of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; Patrick Steptoe Medal of the British Fertility Society (2005); the Stem Cell and Policy Award from the Genetics Policy Institute (2005); Pioneer in Embryonic Stem Cell Research (2006) awarded by FrhESC at Stanford University and Council Member of the National Institute of Aging (2006).

Clubs composed of students, with adults as advising figures to maintain the functionality of clubs. Clubs primarily focus on four aspects: fundraising, community service, career interest, and interpersonal dynamics (also known as group dynamics). In general, clubs are broken down into two main categories: State and/or Nationwide organizations, and local clubs. Within major, nationwide club organizations, each individual charter within each school is referred to as a \"chapter\". Clubs are started by either corporations, counterpart adult organizations, or campus students looking to satisfy a need or demand. \n\nThe first high school student-based organization chartered in Sacramento High School in California, in May 1925. The concept of instilling an organized, separate entity separate from the school itself came from Albert Olney, and Frank Vincent. They were school administrators and Kiwanis Club members who were looking to form a junior service club in the school. This organization later became known as Key Club. Key Club now stands today as the largest student-based organization in the world, though not the largest high school organization in the world.\n\nTracking down precise history of high school organizations is difficult as several thousand types of clubs exist. Prominent clubs include high school subdivisions of Red Cross, Make-A-Wish Foundation, UNICEF Clubs, National Honor Society, National Beta Club, Junior State of America, Interact, Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda, among many other organizations. Each club has their own timeline, with hallmark internal achievements only known by members of each respective club. As well as single-school clubs, such as a Debate Club, Geocaching Club, and others of the like.\n\nThere are four main club categories: fundraising, community service, career interest, and interpersonal dynamics. Many clubs offer a combination of each element.\n\nMany people polarize toward fundraising for a major organization or movement. Fundraising appeals to people as high school students make a direct impact on international affairs, such as funding cancer research or environmental preservation.\n\nMany schools require that students perform a certain community service quota. To obtain such a threshold, many people turn to community service organizations such as Exchange Clubs, Key Club, Interact Club, Lion's Club, Red Cross, FCCLA,and local clubs. In doing so, many teenagers experience more camaraderie while performing community service. Other individuals just enjoy helping the local community around them.\n\nMany teenagers join clubs that revolve around their career interest. Many clubs, such as High Schools Society in Ghana, Junior State of America and Future Scientist and Engineers of America focus on specific career fields and help students understand them better. Many competitions, awards, and conventions are held to give club members advantages in these fields by exposing them to new opportunities. In addition, members of career interest clubs network with other students who will enter similar fields.\n\nMany teenagers join clubs that offer no academic, organizational, or community benefit. These clubs tend to focus around culture, social dynamics, and self-interest. These clubs look to satisfy the needs and demands of teenagers in each school, based on environment, tradition, and culture. Clubs such as an Anime Club can bring students to socialize.\n\n\nUNICEF High School Clubs \n"}

It began more than 60 years ago as a small organization of U.S. researchers and now is truly international with more than 4500 members in over 85 countries. The Association maintains an active membership of more than 4,500 individuals in 85 countries, approximately two-thirds of whom are academic scholars, professors, and graduate students. Other members are in government, the media, communication technology, business law, medicine and other professions. ICA also has 59 institutional members (i.e. university departments or related institutions)and a growing number (16) of association members (i.e. communication associations around the world).\n\nICA is headquartered in Washington, D.C, United States. Since 2003, ICA has been officially associated with the United Nations as a non-governmental organization (NGO).\n\nICA was founded on January 1, 1950 in Austin, Texas as the National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC), a subsidiary organization of the Speech Association of America (now the (United States) National Communication Association), when the SSA determined to exclude basic communication studies from its primary focus on rhetoric. The following year, NSSC published the first issue of its official journal, \"Journal of Communication\".\n\nIn 1967, the NSSC formally separated from the SSA and opened its membership to scholars outside of the U.S. It changed its name two years later to the International Communication Association. The association restructured into divisions to allow members to find and interact with colleagues who shared similar research interests, among the widely diverse disciplines of communication study.\n\nIn the face of increasing internationalization, ICA relocated its offices from Austin, TX to the more cosmopolitan and globally accessible Washington, D.C. in 2001. The association purchased a permanent headquarters in Washington in 2006.\n\nICA is governed by a Board of Directors, consisting of:\n\n\nThe officers (except for the Executive Director) are elected by the association's members. The balloting for President and regional Members-at-Large is association-wide; student representatives are elected by ICA's student members, while Division and Interest Group chairs are chosen by the Division/Interest Group members. Terms of office begin and end at the conclusion of each year's annual ICA conference.\n\nThe president of ICA serves a one-year term; however, the Executive Committee's makeup of incoming and past presidents means that election as ICA president brings with it a six-year commitment to serve on the Executive Committee. The current (2017–2018) president is Paula Gardner (McMaster University), and the current President-Elect is Patricia Moy (University of Washington). Past presidents include Peng Hwa Ang (Nanyang Technological University), Amy Jordan (University of Pennsylvania), and Peter Vorderer (University of Mannheim).\n\nICA maintains a series of standing and awards committees to conduct its business in relation to membership, internationalization, publications, liaison with other agencies, etc., annual awards, and ad hoc task forces. Committee members are appointed by the president.\n\nThe association is administered by the five-member staff at ICA's offices in Washington, D.C. The staff is led by the Executive Director, a position held since 2016 by Laura Sawyer.\n\nICA's members are drawn from several disciplines, focuses, and approaches to the communication discipline. Its membership is thus organized into Divisions and Interest Groups that gather scholars and students of common research interests into formal structures within the association.\n\nNew \"Interest Groups\" are formed when a group of 30 or more active members of the association may petition the Executive Director to establish an Interest Group. An interest group appoints its own officers, is allocated conference sessions, and is represented in the Board of Directors, but does not have voting rights.\n\nAn interest group enrolling at least 1 percent of the members of ICA for at least two consecutive years may apply to become a \"Division\". A division also appoints its own offices, and is allocated conference sessions, but unlike Interest Groups, Divisions are granted voting status on the Board of Directors.\n\nAs of 2017 there are 23 Divisions and 9 Interest Groups within the association.\n\nICA sponsors a large annual conference for its members to present research representing the latest advances in the field of communication. The conference is held in a different city each year, with every fourth year's conference located outside of North America.\n\nEach year's conference has a theme, around which the conference planners organize discussion panels designed to integrate and promote discovery, learning, and engagement as panelists and audience members from different regions of the world take up the conversation on particular topics. The conference also includes annual plenary sessions featuring panels or keynote speakers. One of the plenaries is the Interactive Paper Session, in which participants display their work in the form of visual poster presentations and are awarded based on both the merit of their research and the visual quality of their presentations.\n\nIn addition, each of ICA's Divisions and Interest Groups organizes presentations and panels that explore the advancements within those Divisions' research focuses. These sessions often examine the conference theme from the aspects of the Divisions/Interest Groups.\n\nICA's President-Elect is head of the planning committee for the conference immediately following his/her election, and acts as the chair of that conference.\n\nThe International Communication Association's publishing partner is Oxford University Press.\n\nICA currently publishes six scholarly journals:\n\n\n\nICA publishes the web-based monthly \"ICA Newsletter\" for its members, providing news and updates on the business of the association as well as advertisements for available job positions, calls for papers, and other content related to the discipline in general and ICA in specific.\n\nFellow status in ICA is primarily a recognition of distinguished scholarly contributions to the broad field of communication. The primary consideration for nomination to Fellow status is a documented record of scholarly achievement. Living ICA fellows include Charles Berger, Jennings Bryant, Patrice Buzzanell, Robert T. Craig, Brenda Dervin, Lawrence Grossberg, Klaus Krippendorff, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Sonia Livingstone, and Patti Valkenburg.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "245481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245481", "title": "Job rotation", "text": "Job rotation\n\nJob rotation is a technique used by some employers to rotate their employees' assigned jobs throughout their employment. Employers practice this technique for a number of reasons. It was designed to promote flexibility of employees and to keep employees interested into staying with the company/organization which employs them. There is also research that shows how job rotations help relieve the stress of employees who work in a job that requires manual labor.\n\n\nAlong with the company providing the opportunities and training for job rotation, the employees who participate in job rotation learn more than the one job specification deemed to them, benefiting them in the long run in case of an open position on moving up in the company or a position opening up in another firm. Along with employees benefiting, companies benefit as well. The business can hire fewer people since the majority of their staff will be able to be versatile in the job functions that the company may demand, saving the company more money and possibly giving the current employees a better salary.\n\nJob rotation is beneficial to the company in terms of productivity and reducing the leave of absence workers take throughout the year. A study was conducted to see what motivates employees in their job performance. Job security was among the least motivators. Employees wanted a sense of responsibility and pride in their tasks performed. Job rotation was created for small crews to see if the company could produce a greater employee satisfaction, desire to become comfortable in their job functions, and decrease the desire to avoid their overtime duty.\n\nSome employees are paid more for they are presenting that they are worth a greater amount since they can perform more than one job function and thus makes a higher incentive for more employees to be able to perform better in the workplace. \nIt is a common perception to see that employees who normally opt into the program of job rotation that these individuals tend to have \"higher perceived skills\" and are more likely to be promoted.\n\nSometimes job rotation is practiced for the individual worker's health benefit. This practice helps rotates the individual tasks and muscle movements. It reduces the stress of an average workday so that the workers do not feel the tension in their muscles as well as can keep up in their demanding workplace. There has been electromyographic studies on this technique from mining to assembly lines.\n\nSemco is a Brazilian firm known for implementing job rotation in order to discourage key people from keeping trade secrets which might get lost should they leave, and because it forces the company to develop more than one expert in any particular field.\n\nToyo Kogyo Company is the Japanese firm that now produces Mazda automobiles. Toyo Kogyo has been practicing job rotation for over 20 years as a direct result of the oil embargo of the 1960s. Toyo looked to job rotation to fill gaps in experience due to the cutbacks needed during a downturn in the economy. This has resulted in company with a very efficient workforce that is more knowledgeable that their more specialized competitors.\n\nIntel Corporation now uses job rotation as a means to fill temporary positions from within their own organization. In 11 months Intel filled about 1300 jobs lasting from weeks to years. These positions were available in various fields such as HR, Marketing, Finance and Product development. These assignments are meant to rein in restless workers as well as giving opportunities to employees to learn new technologies and strategies that they may not have been familiar with before. Many employees who experience this form of job rotation are given looks into fields that may be foreign letting them have a greater understanding of the company as a whole.\n\nVirgin America has experimented with a one-year employee exchange program with Virgin Australia. The two companies traded flight attendants between each other to create excitement and energy among its employees. While trades are not as beneficial as job rotation among skill employees the short term benefits may help customer service and the general mood of the employees working for the airline.\n\nJob rotation may also be used to alleviate the physical and mental stresses endured by employees when working at the same position, year after year. By allowing employees to rotate to other positions, the risk factors for some types of musculoskeletal disorders may be reduced. Job Rotation is also believed to have the ability to decrease the amount of boredom and monotony experienced by employees who work the same position for extended periods of time. Job rotation caters to the employee's preferences in a variety of tasks, letting them be more flexible in their positions while endowing workers with a wide range of skills. This also allows the worker job security by developing multiple skills instead of specializing in one aspect. In times of urgency or emergency employees in job rotation are prepared to deal with unusual operations other more specialized workers may not be able to.\n\nThere are some negative attributes associated with job rotation. Firstly, some positions within a company may not be eligible for rotation. There may be positions within a company that may be specialized due to technology or may require highly skilled workers. These positions may not fit the profile for rotation opportunities because of the costs involved to train the workers. Another problem faced by companies is that some employ unionized workers that may be resistant to job rotation due to standard union practices.\n\nEmployers are able to evaluate employees not only for their output but also for their personality traits and team work skills. \"Output measures may easily be translated into attributes such as leadership abilities, technical competence, relations with others and judgement.\" Job rotation benefits the private sector by allowing workers to become flexible in skills needed throughout the company not just in one section or division, this allows companies to benefit through lower costs of needing to train new employees to do the same job. There are different reasons a company may choose to use job rotation such as using job rotation as a learning mechanism. Research suggests that there are significant benefits that may out weigh the costs involved with training employees for diversified positions. This employment opportunity has an effect of boosting morale and self efficacy. The company may benefit from using job rotation by having the ability to staff key positions within a company that are needed at the moment instead of having to train a specialist to fill an urgent position. This practice may allow a company to run more efficiently, and as a result, become more productive and profitable.\n\nThe cost of job rotation can be directly linked to the productive gains made through specialization.\n\nTheory determining the benefit to specialization-\n\n(1) Y=f(XuX2).\"We will refer to the inputs as \"jobs\" that must be performed in order to produce the output. Suppose the firm employees two (initially) identical workers, each of whom is capable of performing both jobs. Thus in a two-period model, each worker could produce the same amount in the first period. By assuming the workers are identical in their intrinsic skills, we focus on the effect of the organization of work related skills. According to a well-known principle spelled out by Adam Smith, a specialized worker improves his or her skill over time by repetitively performing the same task. The gain from specializations thus arises in the second period if workers remain in the same job for both periods. In that case, we assume that the with the second period that his or her counterpart had produced in the first period. To capture this we let Y1 denote the total output in the first period, and Y2, and Y2, denote the output in the second period under rotation and specialization respectively. When workers rotate jobs in the second period, Y2,= Y1; when the specialize and remain in the same job, Y2>Y1. Specialization thus yields greater output over the two periods by the amount Y2-Y2. This differential represents the cost of job rotation in terms of forgone output.\"A problem faced by companies is the possibility of having to pay incentives to workers for cooperation with the job rotation implementation which can lead towards inequality.The utilization of job rotation may have the effect of reducing a workforce due to the cross-training involved; a company may not be required to hire additional staff to cover positions and may cause a layoff of current employees no longer considered necessary.\n\nJob rotation in the public sector can be used to create communication networks between agencies. This is a benefit for agencies this in times of interagency involvement, or times of emergency.\"Interagency assignments can promote networks among personnel from the host and home agencies. Job rotation programs can be designed with a formal component to encourage networking, or networks can be established informally through day-to-day interactions between the individual and his or her peers at the host agency.\"\"Depending on the assignment, an individual can build specific skills needed for interagency collaboration, such as how to plan, lead, and execute interagency efforts. Several experts contend that the best way to teach people to lead in a collaborative environment is to provide them with an opportunity to do so.\"\n\nDrawbacks from Job Rotation in the public sector are often affected the most by lack of cooperation between the agencies involved. Each agency must come into the project fully or the project is likely to fail; making these projects often hard to create or manage. Uneven exchanged in workforce talent can occur when one agency sends skilled personnel to another agency only to receive lower skilled personnel in return. This not only affects the consistency of work coming out of the first agency, but also has the effect of making managers more apprehensible to the aspect of future programs. Employees in these situations oftentimes feel that their careers are put on hold the moment they participate in rotation. Employees feel their contributions at other agencies will not be valued as much by their home agency. Employees feel they will be looked over and miss future opportunities due to lack of recognition and difference in location.\n\"These programs are not easy to design and manage effectively, and can impose significant costs on the individuals and organizations involved. Cultural differences that exist among different agencies, funding streams, and authorities that flow toward a single agency rather than toward enterprise-level goals are additional factors that complicate agencies’ abilities to work together to design a win-win program.\"\n\n"}

He served as the first President of both the University of Missouri and the University of Wisconsin as well as president of Indiana University.\n\nJohn Lathrop was born in Sherburne, New York in 1799. He attended Yale University, graduating in 1819 and teaching for three years at Farmington, Connecticut. He later became a tutor at his alma mater from 1822 until 1826 when he was admitted to the bar and practiced at Middletown, Connecticut. He also spent some time teaching in Norwich, Vermont and Gardiner, Maine. In 1829 he became professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.\n\nHe was married to Frances E. Lothrop [sic] student of Sarah Pierce's Litchfield Female Academy. Her mother was a sister to Harvard University president John Thornton Kirkland and daughter of Samuel Kirkland, founder of Hamilton College.\n\nHis son is Gardiner Lathrop who was founder of the Kansas City law firm Lathrop & Gage.\n\nThe University of Missouri was founded in 1839 as the first public or state university west of the Mississippi River. Professor Lathrop was chosen as its first president in 1840, a position he held until 1849. He is credited with laying the foundations for the university's first century.\n\nIn 1849, Lathrop was elected the first chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. During his tenure as chancellor, he established the academic setting at the university, and he recommended the university's seal and motto, \"Numen Lumen.\" He was nominated for the position of first President of the University of Michigan in 1852 after Henry Barnard declined the job, but Henry Philip Tappan was elected instead. He resigned in 1858 due to problems with the regents and legislature, but remained the acting chancellor until Henry Barnard officially became the chancellor in 1859.\n\nUpon the death of Indiana University's first president Andrew Wylie in 1851, the Board of Trustees sought Lathrop as his replacement. Elsewhere occupied, he declined. Upon the abrupt departure of President William Mitchel Daily in 1859, the Indiana University Board of Trustees once again sought to fill the office with Lathrop. This time, he accepted, and took office on September 20, 1859. His inauguration took place July 11, 1860 and directly thereafter he submitted his resignation to the Board.\n\nAfter resigning the presidency of Indiana University in 1859 after only one year, he returned to the University of Missouri as a professor of English literature. He was re-elected president in 1865, the only president ever to hold two separate terms, and held that office until his death in Columbia, Missouri in 1866.

Its mission is to improve student performance in the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in the United States. It attempts to do this by scaling up local academic programs to a national level.\n\nIn 2005, the National Academies commissioned a report titled “Rising Above the Gathering Storm” which asserts that student achievement in the subjects of math and science has declined in the United States, while other countries have increased their student achievement scores in the same subject areas. The report recommended the creation of a non-profit organization to help marshal private sector support to help improve math and science education in the United States. Several authors of the report partnered with Peter O’Donnell Jr. to meet this need, effectively establishing NMSI’s board of directors and committing to bring both the UTeach and NMSI’s College Readiness program (formerly known as NMSI’s Comprehensive AP Program and the Advanced Placement Training and Incentive Program (APTIP)) to scale nationally. ExxonMobil invested $125 million to launch the effort, which was later supplemented by an additional $125 million from corporations, foundations, individual donors and government agencies – creating an effective public-private partnership model that continues to sustain the organization today.\n\nNMSI has expanded three programs to a national scale: NMSI’s College Readiness Program, NMSI’s Laying the Foundation Program, and NMSI's UTeach Expansion Program.\n\nNMSI’s College Readiness Program is a three-year program in which teachers go through rigorous professional development to better prepare themselves and their students for Advanced Placement Exams. The prototype for NMSI’s program, Advanced Placement Strategies (APS) was launched as a public-private partnership in the Dallas area in 1995 by a group of local businessmen committed to education reform. The goal of the APS program was to improve college readiness and encourage STEM studies for underserved Texas public high school students by increasing participation and performance in AP math, science and English courses. Texas schools in their first year of the APS program increased their exam participation by 198 percent.\n\nIn the 2008-2009 school year, NMSI replicated the APS program as the Advanced Placement Training and Incentive Program (APTIP) and in its first year, the program increased enrollment in AP courses by nearly 70 percent, including a 122 percent increase among African American and Hispanic students. The number of passing AP math, science, and English exams also increased by 52 percent, which was nine times the national average; for African American and Hispanic students, the increase in passing AP scores was 71.5 percent.\n\nOn September 1, 2012, APS officially merged with NMSI to bring this program to scale throughout the United States. More than 50,000 students are now enrolled in the NMSI College Readiness Program, and it is currently being implemented in more than 550 schools in 22 states.\n\nThe most recent results show a continuing trend of student improvement. Over the life cycle of the NMSI program, the number of average passing scores on AP math, science and English exams increased by 144 percent, compared to 23.2 percent nationally. The average three-year increase in the number of passing math, science and English scores among minorities enrolled in the NMSI program is 219 percent compared to the national average of 48.5 percent. The number of average passing scores for females enrolled in the NMSI program increased by 87 percent, compared to 8.7 percent nationally.\n\nIn 2010, the organization received funding from the Lockheed Martin Corporation to launch the AP program in schools serving military bases. In April 2011, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden announced the expansion of the program as part of their national Joining Forces initiative, which aims to provide support and resources to military personnel and their families in the areas of employment, housing, health care, education, etc. Mrs. Obama and Dr. Biden made the announcement at a community event at Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Fountain, Colo. As of January 2014, NMSI’s College Readiness Program is being implemented in 71 schools serving military families in 18 states.\n\nIn January 2012, NMSI merged with Laying the Foundation, an organization which focused on professional development for math, science, and English teachers, grades 6-12. After the merge, NMSI’s Laying the Foundation teacher training program was expanded to include training for elementary teachers, grades 3-5. In 2012, NMSI was selected to work with the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) consortium to lead Common Core State Standards training in 22 states and create the Educator Leader Cadre. \nIn August 2013, NMSI received a $248,760 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a series of web-based training modules for teachers who have attended NMSI’s Laying the Foundation Program.\n\nThe UTeach Program originated at The University of Texas at Austin in 1997, enabling students who are majoring in math, science, or computer science to receive full teaching certification without adding time or cost to their degrees. The national replication process is directed by NMSI in conjunction with the UTeach Institute.\n\nThe NMSI-supported replication of the UTeach program for preparing teachers was launched in 2008 in 13 universities in nine states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas).\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2010, President Barack Obama mentioned the UTeach program at a White House education event, saying, “To bring more educators into the classroom, the National Math and Science Initiative is working with Texas Instruments and the Dell Foundation to prepare almost 5,000 new math and science teachers in the next five years -- through a program that allows young people to earn teaching certificates and science degrees at the same time.” Furthermore, the UTeach Institute projects that 9,000 UTeach program graduates will have impacted 4.8 million secondary STEM students nationwide by 2020. \n\nOn February 4, 2014, it was announced that NMSI is expanding the program to 5 additional universities thanks to a $22.5 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, bringing the total number of UTeach Replication sites to 40 across 19 states. Another 5 will be added in 2015 through the HHMI funding.\n\nMajor support for the National Math and Science Initiative has been provided by the Exxon Mobil Corporation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, and the Texas Instruments Foundation, with in-kind assistance provided by IBM and Perot Systems.\nAdditional funding for UTeach replication comes from the Texas High School Project, the Greater Texas Foundation, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the Tennessee Department of Education, the Texas Education Agency, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, and other private philanthropy. With funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, NMSI also is preparing an alumni network for UTeach graduates.\n\nMatthew Randazzo is the CEO of NMSI. The President is Gregg Fleisher, former President of AP Strategies. NMSI is governed by a board of directors, which is led by Tom Luce, founding CEO of NMSI and the former Assistant Secretary of Education.\n\nTom Luce,\nChairman, NMSI;\nFormer Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of Education\n\nBruce Alberts,\nEditor in Chief Science Magazine;\nFormer President of the National Academy of Sciences\n\nTom Arseneault,\nExecutive Vice President of Product Sectors and Chief Technology Officer, BAE Systems Inc.\n\nNorm Augustine,\nLead Director, NMSI;\nRetired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nKenneth P.

{"id": "23773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23773", "title": "Pascal (programming language)", "text": "Pascal (programming language)\n\nPascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, which Niklaus Wirth designed in 1968–69 and published in 1970, as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.\n\nPascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. Wirth had already developed several improvements to this language as part of the ALGOL X proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed separately and released in 1970. A derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985; this was used by Apple Computer and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed into Delphi on the Microsoft Windows platform. Extensions to the Pascal concepts led to the Pascal-like languages Modula-2 and Oberon.\n\nMuch of the history of computer language design during the 1960s traces its history to the ALGOL 60 language. ALGOL was developed during the 1950s with the explicit goal to be able to clearly describe algorithms. It included a number of features for structured programming that remain common in languages to this day.\n\nShortly after its introduction, in 1962 Wirth began working on his dissertation with Helmut Weber on the Euler programming language. Euler was based on ALGOL's syntax and many concepts but was not a derivative. Its primary goal was to add dynamic lists and types, allowing it to be used in roles similar to Lisp. The language was published in 1965.\n\nBy this time, a number of problems in ALGOL had been identified, notably the lack of a standardized string system. The group tasked with maintaining the language had begun the ALGOL X process to identify improvements, calling for submissions. Wirth and Tony Hoare submitted a conservative set of modifications to add strings and clean up some of the syntax. These were considered too minor to be worth using as the new standard ALGOL, so Wirth wrote a compiler for the language, which became known as ALGOL W.\n\nThe ALGOL X efforts would go on to choose a dramatically more complex language, ALGOL 68. The complexity of this language led to considerable difficulty producing high-performance compilers, and it was not widely used in the industry. This left an opening for newer languages.\n\nPascal was influenced by the ALGOL W efforts, with the explicit goals of producing a language that would be efficient both in the compiler and at run-time, allow for the development of well-structured programs, and to be useful for teaching students structured programming. A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses.\n\nOne of the early successes for language was the introduction of UCSD Pascal, a version that ran on a custom operating system that could be ported to different platforms. A key platform was the Apple II, where it saw widespread use. This led to the use of Pascal becoming the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and later, the Macintosh. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal sources.\n\nThe typesetting system TeX by Donald E. Knuth was written in WEB, the original literate programming system, based on DEC PDP-10 Pascal, while applications like Total Commander, Skype and Macromedia Captivate were written in Delphi (Object Pascal). Apollo Computer used Pascal as the systems programming language for its operating systems beginning in 1980.\n\nVariants of Pascal have also frequently been used for everything from research projects to PC games and embedded systems. Newer Pascal compilers exist which are widely used.\n\nDuring work on the Lisa, Larry Tesler began corresponding with Wirth on the idea of adding object oriented extensions to the language. This led initially to Clascal, introduced in 1983. As the Lisa program faded and was replaced by the Mac, a further version known as Object Pascal was created. This was introduced on the Macintosh in 1985 as part of the MacApp application framework, and became Apple's primary development language into the early 1990s.\n\nThe Object Pascal extensions were added to Turbo Pascal with the release of version 5.5 in 1989. Over the years, Object Pascal became the basis of the Delphi system for Microsoft Windows, which is still used for developing Windows applications, and can cross-compile code to other systems. Free Pascal is an open source, cross-platform alternative.\n\nWirth's intention was to create an efficient language (regarding both compilation speed and generated code) based on structured programming, a recently popularized concept that he promoted in his book \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\". Pascal has its roots in the ALGOL 60 language, but also introduced concepts and mechanisms which (on top of ALGOL's scalars and arrays) enabled programmers to define their own complex (structured) datatypes, and also made it easier to build dynamic and recursive data structures such as \"lists\", \"trees\" and \"graphs\". Important features included for this were \"records\", \"enumerations\", \"subranges\", \"dynamically\" allocated variables with associated \"pointers\", and \"sets\". To make this possible and meaningful, Pascal has a strong typing on all objects, which means that one type of data cannot be converted or interpreted as another without \"explicit\" conversions. Similar mechanisms are standard in many programming languages today. Other languages that influenced Pascal's development were Simula 67 and Wirth's own ALGOL W.\n\nPascal, like many programming languages of today (but unlike most languages in the C family), allows nested procedure definitions to any level of depth, and also allows most kinds of definitions and declarations inside subroutines (procedures and functions). This enables a very simple and coherent syntax where a complete \"program\" is syntactically nearly identical to a single \"procedure\" or \"function\" (except for the heading, which has one of these three keywords).\n\nThe first Pascal compiler was designed in Zürich for the CDC 6000 series mainframe computer family. Niklaus Wirth reports that a first attempt to implement it in Fortran in 1969 was unsuccessful due to Fortran's inadequacy to express complex data structures. The second attempt was implemented in a C-like language (Scallop by Max Engeli) and then translated by hand (by R. Schild) to Pascal itself for boot-strapping. It was operational by mid-1970. Many Pascal compilers since have been similarly self-hosting, that is, the compiler is itself written in Pascal, and the compiler is usually capable of recompiling itself when new features are added to the language, or when the compiler is to be ported to a new environment. The GNU Pascal compiler is one notable exception, being written in C.\n\nThe first successful port of the CDC Pascal compiler to another mainframe was completed by Welsh and Quinn at the Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) in 1972. The target was the ICL 1900 series. This compiler, in turn, was the parent of the Pascal compiler for the Information Computer Systems (ICS) Multum minicomputer. The Multum port was developed – with a view to using Pascal as a systems programming language – by Findlay, Cupples, Cavouras and Davis, working at the Department of Computing Science in Glasgow University. It is thought that Multum Pascal, which was completed in the summer of 1973, may have been the first 16-bit implementation.\n\nA completely new compiler was completed by Welsh et al. at QUB in 1977. It offered a source-language diagnostic feature (incorporating profiling, tracing and type-aware formatted postmortem dumps) that was implemented by Findlay and Watt at Glasgow University. This implementation was ported in 1980 to the ICL 2900 series by a team based at Southampton University and Glasgow University. The Standard Pascal Model Implementation was also based on this compiler, having been adapted, by Welsh and Hay at Manchester University in 1984, to check rigorously for conformity to the BSI 6192/ISO 7185 Standard and to generate code for a portable abstract machine.\n\nThe first Pascal compiler written in North America was constructed at the University of Illinois under Donald B. Gillies for the PDP-11 and generated native machine code.\n\nTo propagate the language rapidly, a compiler \"porting kit\" was created in Zurich that included a compiler that generated code for a \"virtual\" stack machine, \"i.e.\", code that lends itself to reasonably efficient interpretation, along with an interpreter for that code – the \"Pascal-P\" system. The P-system compilers were termed Pascal-P1, Pascal-P2, Pascal-P3, and Pascal-P4. Pascal-P1 was the first version, and Pascal-P4 was the last to come from Zurich. The version termed Pascal-P1 was coined after the fact for the many different sources for Pascal-P that existed. The compiler was redesigned to enhance portability, and issued as Pascal-P2. This code was later enhanced to become Pascal-P3, with an intermediate code backward compatible with Pascal-P2, and Pascal-P4, which was not backward compatible.\n\nThe Pascal-P4 compiler/interpreter can still be run and compiled on systems compatible with original Pascal. However, it only accepts a subset of the Pascal language.\n\nPascal-P5, created outside the Zurich group, accepts the full Pascal language and includes ISO 7185 compatibility.\n\nUCSD Pascal branched off Pascal-P2, where Kenneth Bowles utilized it to create the interpretive UCSD p-System. The UCSD p-System was one of three operating systems available at the launch of the original IBM Personal Computer. UCSD Pascal used an intermediate code based on byte values, and thus was one of the earliest \"byte code compilers\". Pascal-P1 through Pascal-P4 was not, but rather based on the CDC 6600 60 bit word length.\n\nA compiler based on the Pascal-P4 compiler, which created native binaries, was released for the IBM System/370 mainframe computer by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission; it was called the \"AAEC Pascal Compiler\" after the abbreviation of the name of the Commission.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Watcom Pascal was developed, also for the IBM System 370.\n\nInto the 1990s, Pascal was still running on VAX terminals at George Mason University to teach computer programming.\n\nApple Computer created its own Lisa Pascal for the Lisa Workshop in 1982, and ported the compiler to the Apple Macintosh and MPW in 1985. In 1985 Larry Tesler, in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, defined Object Pascal and these extensions were incorporated in both the Lisa Pascal and Mac Pascal compilers.\n\nIn the 1980s, Anders Hejlsberg wrote the Blue Label Pascal compiler for the Nascom-2. A reimplementation of this compiler for the IBM PC was marketed under the names Compas Pascal and PolyPascal before it was acquired by Borland and renamed \"Turbo Pascal\".\n\nTurbo Pascal became hugely popular, thanks to an aggressive pricing strategy, having one of the first full-screen IDEs, and very fast turnaround time (just seconds to compile, link, and run). It was written and highly optimized entirely in assembly language, making it smaller and faster than much of the competition.\n\nIn 1986, Anders ported Turbo Pascal to the Macintosh and incorporated Apple's Object Pascal extensions into Turbo Pascal. These extensions were then added back into the PC version of Turbo Pascal for version 5.5. At the same time Microsoft also implemented the Object Pascal compiler. Turbo Pascal 5.5 had a large influence on the Pascal community, which began concentrating mainly on the IBM PC in the late 1980s. Many PC hobbyists in search of a structured replacement for BASIC used this product. It also began to be adopted by professional developers. Around the same time a number of concepts were imported from C to let Pascal programmers use the C-based API of Microsoft Windows directly. These extensions included null-terminated strings, pointer arithmetic, function pointers, an address-of operator and unsafe typecasts.\n\nTurbo Pascal, and other derivatives with units or module concepts are modular languages. However, it does not provide a nested module concept or qualified import and export of specific symbols.\n\nSuper Pascal is a variant that added non-numeric labels, a return statement and expressions as names of types.\n\nThe universities of Wisconsin-Madison, Zürich, Karlsruhe and Wuppertal developed the \"Pascal-SC\" and \"Pascal-XSC\" (\"Extensions for Scientific Computation\") compilers, aimed at programming numerical computations. TMT Pascal the first Borland-compatible compiler for 32-bit DOS protected mode, OS/2 and Win32 operating systems. Also the TMT Pascal language was the first one which allowed function and operator overloading. Development for Pascal-SC started in 1978 supporting ISO 7185 Pascal level 0, but level 2 support was added at a later stage. Pascal-SC originally targeted the Z80 processor, but was later rewritten for DOS (x86) and 68000. Pascal-XSC has at various times been ported to Unix (Linux, SunOS, HP-UX, AIX) and Microsoft/IBM (DOS with EMX, OS/2, Windows) operating systems. It operates by generating intermediate C source code which is then compiled to a native executable. Some of the Pascal-SC language extensions have been adopted by GNU Pascal.\n\nPascal Sol was designed around 1983 by a French team to implement a Unix-like systems named Sol. It was standard Pascal level-1 (with parametrized array bounds) but the definition allowed alternative keywords and predefined identifiers in French and the language included a few extensions to ease system programming (e.g. an equivalent to lseek). The Sol team later on moved to the ChorusOS project to design a distributed operating system.\n\nIP Pascal was an implementation of the Pascal programming language using Micropolis DOS, but was moved rapidly to CP/M-80 running on the Z80. It was moved to the 80386 machine types in 1994, and exists today as Windows/XP and Linux implementations. In 2008, the system was brought up to a new level and the resulting language termed \"Pascaline\" (after Pascal's calculator). It includes objects, namespace controls, dynamic arrays, along with many other extensions, and generally features the same functionality and type protection as C#. It is the only such implementation that is also compatible with the original Pascal implementation, which is standardized as ISO 7185.\n\nSmart Mobile Studio was created by Jon Aasenden and compiles his own dialect of Object Pascal to HTML5/Javascript\n\nSmart Mobile Studio has an IDE which includes a visual component set, its language is unusual in that it incorporates extensions for the Javascript language\n\nPascal, in its original form, is a purely procedural language and includes the traditional array of ALGOL-like control structures with reserved words such as if, then, else, while, for, and case ranging on a single statement or a begin-end statements block. Pascal also has data structuring constructs not included in the original ALGOL 60 types, like records, variants, pointers, enumerations, and sets and procedure/pointers. Such constructs were in part inherited or inspired from Simula 67, ALGOL 68, Niklaus Wirth's own ALGOL W and suggestions by C. A. R. Hoare.\n\nPascal programs start with the program keyword with a list of external file descriptors as parameters<ref name=\"iso/iec 7185:1990 6.10\">Pascal ISO 7185:1990 6.10</ref> (not required in Turbo Pascal etc.); then follows the main block bracketed by the begin and end keywords. Semicolons separate statements, and the full stop (i.e., a period) ends the whole program (or \"unit\"). Letter case is ignored in Pascal source.\n\nHere is an example of the source code in use for a very simple \"Hello world\" program:\n\nA type in Pascal, and in several other popular programming languages, defines a variable in such a way that it defines a range of values which the variable is capable of storing, and it also defines a set of operations that are permissible to be performed on variables of that type. The predefined types are:\n\nThe range of values allowed for each (except boolean) is implementation defined. Functions are provided for some data conversions. For conversion of codice_1 to codice_2, the following functions are available: codice_3 (which rounds to integer using banker's rounding) and codice_4 (rounds towards zero).\n\nThe programmer has the freedom to define other commonly used data types (e.g. byte, string, etc.) in terms of the predefined types using Pascal's type declaration facility, for example\n\nSubranges of any ordinal data type (any simple type except real) can also be made:\n\nIn contrast with other programming languages from its time, Pascal supports a set type:\n\nA set is a fundamental concept for modern mathematics, and they may be used in many algorithms. Such a feature is useful and may be faster than an equivalent construct in a language that does not support sets. For example, for many Pascal compilers:\n\nexecutes faster than:\n\nSets of non-contiguous values can be particularly useful, in terms of both performance and readability:\n\nFor these examples, which involve sets over small domains, the improved performance is usually achieved by the compiler representing set variables as bit vectors. The set operators can then be implemented efficiently as bitwise machine code operations.\n\nTypes can be defined from other types using type declarations:\n\nFurther, complex types can be constructed from simple types:\n\nAs shown in the example above, Pascal files are sequences of components. Every file has a buffer variable which is denoted by \"f^\". The procedures \"get\" (for reading) and \"put\" (for writing) move the buffer variable to the next element. Read is introduced such that \"read(f, x)\" is the same as \"x := f^; get(f);\". Write is introduced such that \"write(f, x)\" is the same as \"f^ := x; put(f);\" The type text is predefined as file of char. While the buffer variable could be used for inspecting the next character to be used (check for a digit before reading an integer), this leads to serious problems with interactive programs in early implementations, but was solved later with the \"lazy I/O\" concept.\n\nIn Jensen & Wirth Pascal, strings are represented as packed arrays of chars; they therefore have fixed length and are usually space-padded.\n\nPascal supports the use of pointers:\n\nHere the variable \"NodePtr\" is a pointer to the data type \"Node\", a record. Pointers can be used before they are declared. This is a forward declaration, an exception to the rule that things must be declared before they are used.\n\nTo create a new record and assign the value \"10\" and character \"A\" to the fields \"a\" and \"b\" in the record, and to initialise the pointer \"c\" to the null pointer (\"NIL\" in Pascal), the statements would be:\n\nThis could also be done using the with statement, as follows:\n\nInside of the scope of the \"with\" statement, a and b refer to the subfields of the record pointer \"NodePtr\" and not to the record Node or the pointer type pNode.\n\nLinked lists, stacks and queues can be created by including a pointer type field (c) in the record.\n\nUnlike many languages that feature pointers, Pascal only allows pointers to reference dynamically created variables that are anonymous, and does not allow them to reference standard static or local variables. Pointers also must have an associated type, and a pointer to one type is not compatible with a pointer to another type (e.g. a pointer to a char is not compatible with a pointer to an integer). This helps eliminate the type security issues inherent with other pointer implementations, particularly those used for PL/I or C. It also removes some risks caused by dangling pointers, but the ability to dynamically deallocate referenced space by using the \"dispose\" function (which has the same effect as the \"free\" library function found in C) means that the risk of dangling pointers has not been entirely eliminated as it has in languages such as Java and C#, which provide automatic garbage collection (but which do not entirely eliminate the related problem of memory leaks).\n\nSome of these restrictions can be lifted in newer dialects.\n\nPascal is a structured programming language, meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard statements, usually without 'goto' commands.\n\nPascal structures programs into procedures and functions.\nProcedures and functions can nest to any depth, and the 'program' construct is the logical outermost block.\n\nBy default, parameters are passed by value. If 'var' precedes a parameter's name, it is passed by reference.\n\nEach procedure or function can have its own declarations of goto labels, constants, types, variables, and other procedures and functions, which must all be in that order.\nThis ordering requirement was originally intended to allow efficient single-pass compilation. However, in some dialects (such as Embarcadero Delphi) the strict ordering requirement of declaration sections has been relaxed.\n\nPascal adopted many language syntax features from the ALGOL language, including the use of a semicolon as a statement separator. This is in contrast to other languages, such as PL/I, C etc. which use the semicolon as a statement terminator. As illustrated in the above examples, no semicolon is needed before the end keyword of a record type declaration, a block, or a \"case\" statement; before the until keyword of a repeat statement; and before the else keyword of an \"if\" statement.\n\nThe presence of an extra semicolon was not permitted in early versions of Pascal. However, the addition of ALGOL-like empty statements in the 1973 \"Revised Report\" and later changes to the language in ISO 7185:1983 now allow for optional semicolons in most of these cases. A semicolon is still not permitted immediately before the \"else\" keyword in an \"if\" statement, because the else follows a single statement, not a statement sequence. In the case of nested ifs, a semicolon cannot be used to avoid the dangling else problem (where the inner if does not have an else, but the outer if does) by putatively terminating the nested if with a semicolon – this instead terminates both if clauses. Instead, an explicit codice_5 block must be used.\n\nProgrammers usually include these extra semicolons out of habit and to avoid changing the last line of a statement sequence when new code is appended.\n\nSeveral Pascal compilers and interpreters are available for general use:\n\n\nA very extensive list can be found on Pascaland. The site is in French, but it is basically a list with URLs to compilers; there is little barrier for non-Francophones. The site, Pascal Central, a Mac centric Pascal info and advocacy site with a rich collection of article archives, plus links to many compilers and tutorials, may also be of interest.\n\n\n\nIn 1983, the language was standardized, in the international standard IEC/ISO 7185, and several local country specific standards, including the American ANSI/IEEE770X3.97-1983, and ISO 7185:1983. These two standards differed only in that the ISO standard included a \"level 1\" extension for conformant arrays (an array where the boundaries of the array are not known until run time), where ANSI did not allow for this extension to the original (Wirth version) language. In 1989, ISO 7185 was revised (ISO 7185:1990) to correct various errors and ambiguities found in the original document.\n\nThe ISO 7185 was stated to be a clarification of Wirth's 1974 language as detailed by the User Manual and Report [Jensen and Wirth], but was also notable for adding \"Conformant Array Parameters\" as a level 1 to the standard, level 0 being Pascal without conformant arrays. This addition was made at the request of C. A. R. Hoare, and with the approval of Niklaus Wirth. The precipitating cause was that Hoare wanted to create a Pascal version of the (NAG) Numerical Algorithms Library, which had originally been written in FORTRAN, and found that it was not possible to do so without an extension that would allow array parameters of varying size. Similar considerations motivated the inclusion in ISO 7185 of the facility to specify the parameter types of procedural and functional parameters.\n\nNiklaus Wirth himself referred to the 1974 language as \"the Standard\", for example, to differentiate it from the machine specific features of the CDC 6000 compiler. This language was documented in \"The Pascal Report\", the second part of the \"Pascal users manual and report\".\n\nOn the large machines (mainframes and minicomputers) Pascal originated on, the standards were generally followed. On the IBM PC, they were not. On IBM PCs, the Borland standards Turbo Pascal and Delphi have the greatest number of users. Thus, it is typically important to understand whether a particular implementation corresponds to the original Pascal language, or a Borland dialect of it.\n\nThe IBM PC versions of the language began to differ with the advent of UCSD Pascal, an interpreted implementation that featured several extensions to the language, along with several omissions and changes. Many UCSD language features survive today, including in Borland's dialect.\n\nIn 1990, an extended Pascal standard was created as ISO/IEC 10206, which is identical in technical content<ref name=\"ISO/ANSI identical\"></ref> to IEEE/ANSI 770X3.160-1989\nNiklaus Wirth's Zurich version of Pascal was issued outside ETH in two basic forms, the CDC 6000 compiler source, and a porting kit called Pascal-P system. The Pascal-P compiler left out several features of the full language. For example, procedures and functions used as parameters, undiscriminated variant records, packing, dispose, interprocedural gotos and other features of the full compiler were omitted.\n\nUCSD Pascal, under Professor Kenneth Bowles, was based on the Pascal-P2 kit, and consequently shared several of the Pascal-P language restrictions. UCSD Pascal was later adopted as Apple Pascal, and continued through several versions there. Although UCSD Pascal actually expanded the subset Pascal in the Pascal-P kit by adding back standard Pascal constructs, it was still not a complete standard installation of Pascal.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Alan Burns and Geoff Davies developed Pascal-FC, an extension to Pl/0 (from the Niklaus' book 'Algorithms+Data Structures=Programs'). Several constructs were added to use Pascal-FC as a teaching tool for Concurrent Programming (such as semaphores, monitors, channels, remote-invocation and resources). To be able to demonstrate concurrency, the compiler output (a kind of P-code) could then be executed on a virtual machine. This virtual machine not only simulated a normal – fair – environment, but could also simulate extreme conditions (unfair mode).\n\nBorland's Turbo Pascal, written by Anders Hejlsberg, was written in assembly language independent of UCSD or the Zurich compilers. However, it adopted much of the same subset and extensions as the UCSD compiler. This is probably because the UCSD system was the most common Pascal system suitable for developing applications on the resource-limited microprocessor systems available at that time.\n\nThe shrink-wrapped Turbo Pascal version 3 and later incarnations, including Borland's Object Pascal and Delphi and non-Borland near-compatibles became popular with programmers including shareware authors, and so the SWAG library of Pascal code features a large amount of code written with such versions as Delphi in mind.\n\nSoftware products (compilers, and IDE/Rapid Application Development (RAD) in this category:\n\n\nPascal generated a wide variety of responses in the computing community, both critical and complimentary.\n\nWhile very popular in the 1980s and early 1990s, implementations of Pascal that closely followed Wirth's initial definition of the language were widely criticized for being unsuitable for use outside teaching. Brian Kernighan, who popularized the C language, outlined his most notable criticisms of Pascal as early as 1981, in his paper \"Why Pascal Is Not My Favorite Programming Language\". The most serious problem described in his article was that array sizes and string lengths were part of the type, so it was not possible to write a function that would accept variable length arrays or even strings as parameters. This made it unfeasible to write, for example, a sorting library. Kernighan also criticized the unpredictable order of evaluation of boolean expressions, poor library support, and lack of static variables, and raised a number of smaller issues. Also, he stated that the language did not provide any simple constructs to \"escape\" (knowingly and forcibly ignore) restrictions and limitations. More general complaints from other sources noted that the scope of declarations was not clearly defined in the original language definition, which sometimes had serious consequences when using forward declarations to define pointer types, or when record declarations led to mutual recursion, or when an identifier may or may not have been used in an enumeration list. Another difficulty was that, like ALGOL 60, the language did not allow procedures or functions passed as parameters to predefine the expected type of their parameters.\n\nMost of Kernighan's criticisms were directly addressed in the paper \"The Pascal Programming Language\", specifically, under Myth 6: Pascal is Not For Serious Programmers.\n\nDespite initial criticisms, Pascal continued to evolve, and most of Kernighan's points do not apply to versions of the language which were enhanced to be suitable for commercial product development, such as Borland's Turbo Pascal. As Kernighan predicted in his article, most of the extensions to fix these issues were incompatible from compiler to compiler. Since the early 1990s, however, most of the varieties seem condensed into two categories, ISO and Borland-like.\n\nExtended Pascal addresses many of these early criticisms. It supports variable-length strings, variable initialization, separate compilation, short-circuit boolean operators, and default (OTHERWISE) clauses for case statements.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2936900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2936900", "title": "Piled Higher and Deeper", "text": "Piled Higher and Deeper\n\nPiled Higher and Deeper (also known as PhD Comics), is a newspaper and webcomic strip written and drawn by Jorge Cham that follows the lives of several grad students. First published in the fall of 1997 when Cham was a grad student himself at Stanford University, the strip deals with issues of life in graduate school, including the difficulties of scientific research, the perils of procrastination, the complex student–supervisor relationship and the perpetual search for free food. Cham continued the strip as an Instructor in mechanical engineering at Caltech, and now draws and gives talks about the strip full-time. Originally, the strip was drawn in crude black-and-white, eventually became grayscale, and finally became color in June 2004.\n\n\"Piled Higher and Deeper\" introduced its main characters early in its run, and their personalities have remained fairly constant during the strip's several years of publication. In the strip's first few seasons, the characters were clearly Stanford University students, though the number of school-specific references and jokes has decreased since.\n\n\n\nThe title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a Ph.D., which explains that if one knows what \"B.S.\" stands for (in this context, \"bullshit\"), then \"M.S.\" stands for \"More of the Same\" (or \"More Shit\"), and \"Ph.D.\" stands for \"Piled Higher and Deeper\".\n\nOne of Cham's recurring themes is to re-cast an item of popular culture in the grad-school milieu. Upon several occasions, the strip has included spoofs of popular movies, like \"The Thesis\" (\"The Matrix\"), \"Raiders of the Lost Dissertation\" (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"), \"I, Grad Student\" (a mixture of the book and movie \"I, Robot\"), and \"Summer days\" (\"Summer Nights\"). In addition, Cham has parodied television programs like \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" among others.\n\nJorge Cham has also parodied Newton's laws of motion as \"Newton's 3 Laws of Graduation\". According to the strip these laws of graduation were superseded by Einstein's \"Special Theory of Research Inactivity\", much as Newton's actual laws were superseded by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAnother series of strips takes up the modern debate about the proper use of the term \"irony\".\n\nThe strip has also included several adaptations of Shakespeare as well as several propaganda posters. Captions for the latter include \"This man does research for \"you!\"\", \"When you procrastinate... Someone is watching!\" and \"Women in grad school... Support your local female geek.\"\n\nCham has also released two song parodies, purportedly sung by Tajel, in MP3 format: \"Closer to fine\" (cf. Indigo Girls) and \"Who will grade your work\" (\"Who Will Save Your Soul\").\n\nFive PhD comic books have been published so far. The first book, \"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Comic Strip Collection\" (2002), contains production sketches and an afterword by Prof. Smith in addition to the comic strips.\n\nThe second volume, \"Life is Tough and then You Graduate\", was published in April 2005. It contains six strips not published online that explain what happened in Mike's thesis defense. It also has a foreword by Karl Marx, behind-the-scenes author notes and a graduate school board game.\n\nThe third book, \"Scooped!\", which was released in May 2007, also contains \"Tales from the Road\", a series of comics that detail Cham's experiences whilst giving his Power of Procrastination tour.\n\nThe fourth book, \"Academic Stimulus Package\", was released March 2009. This volume is printed in full color.\n\nThe fifth book, \"Adventures in Thesisland\", was released April 2012. This volume is also printed in full color. The introduction is an excerpt from the screenplay of the PHD Movie.\n\nIn March 2011, Jorge Cham started filming a movie based on the comic series. The film production is a collaboration between Cham and a theater group at the California Institute of Technology. In fall 2011, the film was released on selected academic campuses. A trailer of the movie is available on the Piled Higher and Deeper website as of June 8, 2011. After about a year of various campus screenings around the world, the movie became available for purchase on DVD or streaming on April 15, 2012. The sequel to the movie was shot in the Caltech campus and was released later in 2015. For the first time in India, it was screened in IIT Madras on 8 April 2016 as part of their Research Scholars Day-2016.\n\n\n\n"}

It defines communications between client side content and a host system (called \"the run-time environment\"), which is commonly supported by a learning management system. SCORM also defines how content may be packaged into a transferable ZIP file called \"Package Interchange Format.\"\n\nSCORM is a specification of the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative from the Office of the United States Secretary of Defense.\n\nSCORM 2004 introduced a complex idea called sequencing, which is a set of rules that specifies the order in which a learner may experience content objects. In simple terms, they constrain a learner to a fixed set of paths through the training material, permit the learner to \"bookmark\" their progress when taking breaks, and assure the acceptability of test scores achieved by the learner. The standard uses XML, and it is based on the results of work done by AICC, IMS Global, IEEE, and Ariadne.\n\nSCORM was designed to be web-based and utilizes JavaScript to facilitate communication between the client side content and the run-time environment. Each SCORM version specifies the methods that the run-time environment should support and how those methods should behave. Content launched by the run time environment can then call those methods utilizing JavaScript.\n\nSCORM 1.1 is the first production version. It used a Course Structure Format XML file based on the AICC specifications to describe content structure, but lacked a robust packaging manifest and support for metadata. Quickly abandoned in favor of SCORM 1.2.\n\nThis was the first version that was widely used. It is still widely used and is supported by most Learning Management Systems.\n\nThis is the current version. It is based on new standards for API and content object-to-runtime environment communication, with many ambiguities of previous versions resolved. Includes ability to specify adaptive sequencing of activities that use the content objects. Includes ability to share and use information about the success status for multiple learning objectives or competencies across content objects and across courses for the same learner within the same learning management system. A more robust test suite helps ensure good interoperability.\n\n\n\nThe Experience API (also known as xAPI or Tin Can API) was finalized to version 1.0 in April 2013. The Experience API solves many of the problems inherent with older versions of SCORM. Just like SCORM, ADL is the steward of the Experience API. AICC with their cmi5 planned to use xAPI as their transport standard, but AICC membership decided to dissolve the organization and transferred cmi5 to ADL.\n\nThe Experience API (Tin Can API) is a web service that allows software clients to read and write experiential data in the form of “statement” objects. In their simplest form, statements are in the form of “I did this”, or more generally “actor verb object”. More complex statement forms can be used. There is also a built-in query API to help filter recorded statements, and a state API that allows for a sort of “scratch space” for consuming applications. Experience API statements are stored in a data store called a Learning Record Store, which can exist on its own or within a Learning Management System.\n\n\nServer software\nClient Interface (no GUI) \nContent editing software\n\n"}

{"id": "436831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436831", "title": "Special education", "text": "Special education\n\nSpecial education (also known as special needs education, aided education, exceptional education or Special Ed) is the practice of educating students in a way that addresses their individual differences and needs. Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.\n\nCommon special needs include learning disabilities (such as dyslexia), communication disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders (such as ADHD), physical disabilities (such as osteogenesis imperfecta, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and Friedreich's ataxia), and developmental disabilities (such as autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability). Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a resource room.\n\nIntellectual giftedness is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialised teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term \"special education\" is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students with disabilities. Gifted education is handled separately.\n\nWhereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, remedial education can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high intelligence can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by internal displacement during civil disorder or a war.\n\nIn most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments. Therefore, special education in developed countries is often regarded as a service rather than a place. Integration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many students.\n\nThe opposite of special education is \"general education\". General education is the standard curriculum presented without special teaching methods or supports. Students receiving special education services can enroll in a General education setting to learn along with students without disabilities.\n\nSome children are easily identified as candidates for special needs due to their medical history. They may have been diagnosed with a genetic condition that is associated with intellectual disability, may have various forms of brain damage, may have a developmental disorder, may have visual or hearing disabilities, or other disabilities.\n\nFor students with less obvious disabilities, such as those who have learning difficulties, two primary methods have been used for identifying them: the \"discrepancy model\" and the \"response to intervention model\". The discrepancy model depends on the teacher noticing that the students' achievements are noticeably below what is expected. At which the teacher may make the decision for the student to receive support from a special education specialist. Before doing so, the teacher must show documentation of low academic achievement. The response to intervention model advocates earlier intervention.\n\nIn the discrepancy model, a student receives special education services for a specific learning difficulty (SLD) if the student has at least normal intelligence and the student's academic achievement is below what is expected of a student with his or her IQ. Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach (e.g., Aaron, 1995, Flanagan and Mascolo, 2005) among researchers. One reason for criticism is that diagnosing SLDs on the basis of the discrepancy between achievement and IQ does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who also have low IQ appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who have normal or high intelligence.\n\nThe alternative approach, response to intervention, identifies children who are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a reading remediation program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.\n\nA special education program should be customised to address each individual student's unique needs. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with special needs receives varying degrees of support based on their individual needs. Special education programs need to be individualised so that they address the unique combination of needs in a given student.\n\nIn the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals use a student's Individualized Education Program (IEP). Another name for a student's Individualized Education Plan is a student's Individual Learning Plan (ILP).\n\n\"The IEP is meant to address each child’s unique learning issues and include specific educational goals. It is a legally binding document. The school must provide everything it promises in the IEP.\"\n\nFor children who are not yet 3, an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) contains information on the child's present level of development in all areas; outcomes for the child and family; and services the child and family will receive to help them achieve the outcomes.\n\nIn the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal law that requires that every school system in the nation must provide a free and appropriate public education for every child, ages 3 to 22, regardless of how or how seriously that child may be disabled. To ensure that this federal law is obeyed, the government requires every school system provide this type of education to each student in order to receive federal funding.\n\nStudents with special needs are assessed to determine their specific strengths and weaknesses. The earlier these students with special needs are assessed, the better it is for them to get the accommodations that they need in order for them to get the most out of their education. Placement, resources, and goals are determined on the basis of the student's needs. Accommodations and Modifications to the regular program may include changes in the curriculum, supplementary aides or equipment, and the provision of specialized physical adaptations that allow students to participate in the educational environment as much as possible. Students may need this help to access subject matter, physically gain access to the school, or meet their emotional needs. For example, if the assessment determines that the student cannot write by hand because of a physical disability, then the school might provide a computer for typing assignments, or allow the student to answer questions verbally instead. If the school determines that the student is severely distracted by the normal activities in a large, busy classroom, then the student might be placed in a smaller classroom such as a resource room.\n\nParent of students with a learning disability must know what type of disability their child has, so they can get accommodations such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education.For example, if a student takes an academic test and it indicates that the student struggles with reading comprehension, parents can request speech and language support or classroom accommodations, such as extra time to complete reading and writing tasks.\nSchools use different approaches to providing special education services to students. These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to how much contact the student with special needs has with non-disabled students (using North American terminology):\n\n\n\nA \"special school\" is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to learning difficulties, physical disabilities or behavioural problems. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools.\n\nSpecial schools provide individualised education, addressing specific needs. Student to teacher ratios are kept low, often 6:1 or lower depending upon the needs of the children. Special schools will also have other facilities for children with special needs, such as soft play areas, sensory rooms, or swimming pools, which are necessary for treating students with certain conditions.\n\nIn recent times, places available in special schools are declining as more children with special needs are educated in mainstream schools. However, there will always be some children, whose learning needs cannot be appropriately met in a regular classroom setting and will require specialised education and resources to provide the level of support they require. An example of a disability that may require a student to attend a special school is intellectual disability. However, this practice is often frowned upon by school districts in the US in the light of Least Restrictive Environment as mandated in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\nAn alternative is a special unit or special classroom, also called a self-contained classroom, which is a separate room or rooms dedicated solely to the education of students with special needs within a larger school that also provides general education. These classrooms are typically staffed by specially trained teachers, who provide specific, individualised instruction to individuals and small groups of students with special needs. Self-contained classrooms, because they are located in a general education school, may have students who remain in the self-contained classroom full-time, or students who are included in certain general education classes. In the United States a part-time alternative that is appropriate for some students is sometimes called a resource room.\n\nOne of the first special schools in the world was the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles in Paris, which was founded in 1784. It was the first school in the world to teach blind students.\nThe first school in U.K, for the Deaf was established 1760 in Edinburgh by Thomas Braidwood, with education for visually impaired people beginning in the Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765.\n\nIn the 19th century, people with disabilities and the inhumane conditions where they were supposedly housed and educated were addressed in the literature of Charles Dickens. Dickens characterized people with severe disabilities as having the same, if not more, compassion and insight in Bleak House and Little Dorrit.\n\nSuch attention to the downtrodden conditions of people with disabilities brought resulted in reforms in Europe including the re-evaluation of special schools. In the United States reform came more slowly. Throughout the mid half of the 20th century, special schools, termed institutions, were not only accepted, but encouraged. Students with disabilities were housed with people with mental illnesses, and they were not educated much, if at all.\n\nDeinstitutionalization proceeded in the US beginning in the 1970s following the exposes of the institutions, and it has taken sometime before the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act of 1974, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and then Individuals with Disabilities Educational Improvement Act (IDEIA) have come into fruition. School integration was supported as early as the 1970s, and teacher preparation programs in higher education have carefully taught and instructed graduates on inclusion at the classroom, individual, school, and district levels for decades resulting in dual certification of \"regular teachers\".\n\nWith the Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997, school districts in the United States began to slowly integrate students with moderate and severe special needs into regular school systems. This changed the form and function of special education services in many school districts and special schools subsequently saw a steady decrease in enrollment as districts weighed the cost per student. It also posed general funding dilemmas to certain local schools and districts, changed how schools view assessments, and formally introduced the concept of inclusion to many educators, students and parents.\n\nThe student can be taught in either a classroom or outside environment. Both environments can be interactive for the student to engage better with the subject.\n\nDifferent instructional techniques are used for some students with special educational needs. Instructional strategies are classified as being either \"accommodations\" or \"modifications\".\n\nAn \"accommodation\" is a reasonable adjustment to teaching practices so that the student learns the same material, but in a format that is more accessible to the student. Accommodations may be classified by whether they change the presentation, response, setting, or scheduling of lessons. For example, the school may accommodate a student with visual impairments by providing a large-print textbook. This is a presentation accommodation. A \"modification\" changes or adapts the material to make it simpler. Modifications may change what is learned, how difficult the material is, what level of mastery the student is expected to achieve, whether or how the student is assessed, or any other aspect of the curriculum. For example, the school may modify a reading assignment for a student with reading difficulties by substituting a shorter, easier book. A student may receive both accommodations and modifications.\n\n\n\nAll developed countries permit or require some degree of accommodation for students with special needs, and special provisions are usually made in examinations which take place at the end of formal schooling.\n\nIn addition to how the student is taught the academic curriculum, schools may provide non-academic services to the student. These are intended ultimately to increase the student's personal and academic abilities. Related services include developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a student with special needs and includes speech and language pathology, audiology, psychological services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, medical services as defined by regulations, parent counseling and training, school health services, school social work, assistive technology services, other appropriate developmental or corrective support services, appropriate access to recreation and other appropriate support services. In some countries, most related services are provided by the schools; in others, they are provided by the normal healthcare and social services systems.\n\nAs an example, students who have autistic spectrum disorders, poor impulse control, or other behavioral challenges may learn self-management techniques, be kept closely on a comfortingly predictable schedule, or given extra cues to signal activities.\n\nA university field, termed \"severe disabilities\", also is taught throughout the US university sector in schools of education. Advanced instruction is based upon community-referenced instruction, and alignment with transition to adulthood and progressive community practices.\n\nRehabilitation counseling personnel are often association with supported employment services, and typically with \"transition to adulthood\" in which multi-decade recommendations for better coordination between the school and the community service sectors have been made at the federal and university levels.\n\nAt-risk students (those with educational needs that are not associated with a disability) are often placed in classes with students who have disabilities. Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as students with disabilities may impede the educational progress of people with disabilities.\nSome special education classes have been criticized for a watered-down curriculum.\n\nThe practice of inclusion (in mainstream classrooms) has been criticized by advocates and some parents of children with special needs because some of these students require instructional methods that differ dramatically from typical classroom methods. Critics assert that it is not possible to deliver effectively two or more very different instructional methods in the same classroom. As a result, the educational progress of students who depend on different instructional methods to learn often fall even further behind their peers.\n\nParents of typically developing children sometimes fear that the special needs of a single \"fully included\" student will take critical levels of attention and energy away from the rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.\n\nLinked to this, there is debate about the extent to which students with special needs, whether in mainstream or special settings, should have a specific pedagogy, based on the scientific study of particular diagnostic categories, or whether general instructional techniques are relevant to all students including those with special needs.\n\nSome parents, advocates, and students have concerns about the eligibility criteria and their application. In some cases, parents and students protest the students' placement into special education programs. For example, a student may be placed into the special education programs due to a mental health condition such as obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, panic attacks or ADHD, while the student and his parents believe that the condition is adequately managed through medication and outside therapy. In other cases, students whose parents believe they require the additional support of special education services are denied participation in the program based on the eligibility criteria.\n\nWhether it is useful and appropriate to attempt to educate the most severely disabled children, such as children who are in a persistent vegetative state, is debated. While many severely disabled children can learn simple tasks, such as pushing a buzzer when they want attention, some children may be incapable of learning. Some parents and advocates say that these children would be better served by substituting improved physical care for any academic program. In other cases, they question whether teaching such non-academic subjects, such as pushing a buzzer, is properly the job of the school system, rather than the health care system.\n\nAnother large issue is the lack of resources enabling individuals with special needs to receive an education in the developing world. As a consequence, 98 percent of children with special needs in developing countries do not have access to education.\n\nAnother issue would be budget cuts. Cuts can affect special education students who don't have access to proper equipment or education. The National Coalition for Personal Shortages did a survey and almost 100% of the teachers said that they are not able to give the proper rights to children with disabilities. Teachers are getting cut off from work due to the budget cuts.\n\nThere is a financial debate that covers the use and allotment of special education government funding. The three views on this topic are that we spend too much money on it, there is not enough money put into it or that the money that is given isn't being spent properly. The argument for the first is that the amount of money spent on one special needs child is enough to cover a large group of general education students, and sometimes even causes several students to suffer budget cuts on general programs to support one child. The evidence for special education not having enough money is the lack of teachers, burnt out teachers and a limited variety of teaching tools for each student. The argument to spend the money differently states that there is a lot of money set aside, but that it is being wasted by spending too much time on paperwork, inefficient IEP meetings or spending money on things that don't actually benefit the child.\n\nChildren with disabilities are often denied their right to education. However, little is known about their school attendance patterns. The collection of data on children with disabilities is not straightforward, but data are vital to ensure that policies are in place to address the constraints these children face.\n\nBy one estimate, 93 million children under age 14, or 5.1% of the world's children, were living with a ‘moderate or severe disability’ in 2004. According to the World Health Survey, in 14 of 15 low and middle income countries, people of working age with disabilities were about one-third less likely to have completed primary school. For example, in Bangladesh, 30% of people with disabilities had completed primary school, compared with 48% of those with no disabilities. The corresponding shares were 43% and 57% in Zambia; 56% and 72% in Paraguay.\n\nIt has been shown that children with a higher risk of disability are far more likely to be denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, Bhutan and Iraq, children with mental impairments were most likely to be denied this right. In Iraq, for instance, 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds with no risk of disability had never been to school in 2006, but 19% of those at risk of having a hearing impairment and 51% of those who were at higher risk of mental disability had never been to school. In Thailand, almost all 6- to 9-year-olds who had no disability had been to school in 2005/06, and yet 34% of those with walking or moving impairments had never been to school.\n\nChildren with disabilities require access to services that can support them throughout their time in school, such as more individual attention from instructors. According to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, about 2% of children with disabilities have access to these services. Those without access to these services are excluded from education and unable to attend school. Due to the need of certain services and facilities, the estimated cost of providing education for a child with disabilities is 2.3 times higher than a child without disabilities. Given the poverty levels in a variety of developing countries, the education of children with disabilities does not become a priority. Children with physical disabilities are less likely to attend school in comparison with students who do not have a disability and children with an intellectual ability are even less likely than children with physical disabilities. In the Global South, 90% of children with some form of disability do not receive any form of structured education. While current initiatives toward inclusive education internationally have been implemented, such as the Education for All program, some countries in the Global South still challenge the lack of ability to provide children with disabilities access to education due to issues such as lack of resources and schools being overcrowded.\n\nWhite Papers in 1995 and 2001 discuss special education in the country. Local schools are given some independent authority.\n\nBoth modifications and accommodations are recommended, depending on the student's individual needs.\n\n\nChina holds the largest system of education in the world and features a state run public school system under the order of the Ministry of Education.\nJapanese students with special needs are placed in one of four different school arrangements: special schools, special classrooms with another school, in resource rooms (which are called \"tsukyu\"), or in regular classrooms.\n\nSpecial schools are reserved for students whose severe disabilities cannot be accommodated in the local school. They do not use the same grading or marking systems as mainstream schools, but instead assess students according to their individualized plans.\n\nSpecial classes are similar, and may vary the national curriculum as the teachers see fit. \"Tsukyu\" are resource rooms that students with milder problems use part-time for specialized instruction individually in small groups. These students spend the rest of the day in the mainstream classroom. Some students with special needs are fully included in the mainstream classroom, with accommodations or modifications as needed.\n\nTraining of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more disabled students.\n\n\nAfter independence (1947), Pakistan had to face some serious challenges, due to which no proper emphasis was given to special education and even education. Among other reasons, lack of resources, financial as well as human, was the major one in this context. The need and importance of special education was felt in different educational policies of Pakistan in different times. At the first time, in its report, the Commission on National Education (1959) highlighted the importance of special education. After that the Education Policy (1972) and the National Policy and Implementation Programme (1979) gave some importance to this sector. The same was also reflected in different medium-term (five-year) plans. This was felt more seriously when the Directorate General of Special Education, Islamabad formulated a draft National Policy for Special Education in 1986 and revised it in 1988 to bring it in line with the emerging needs of special/disabled population. After that a special education policy was launched in 1999. Recently, Government of Pakistan has launched a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2002, which is dynamically being implemented.\n\nSpecial education is regulated centrally by the Singapore Ministry of Education. Both special schools and integration into mainstream schools are options for students with special educational needs, but most students with disabilities are placed in special schools.\n\nStudents with special education who wish accommodations on national exams must provide appropriate documentation to prove that they are disabled. Accommodations, but not modifications (e.g., simpler questions) are normally approved if they are similar to the accommodations already being used in everyday schoolwork, with the goal of maintaining the exam's integrity while not having students unfairly disadvantaged by factors that are unrelated to what is being tested. The accommodations are listed on the Primary School Leaving Exam.\n\nAustralian Association of Special Education Inc (AASE)‘s position is informed by the Disability Standards for Education 2005 which require that students with disabilities are treated on the same basis as other students in regards to enrollment and participation in education.\n\nWith respect to standardized tests, special consideration procedures are in place in all states for students who are disabled. Students must provide documentation Not all desired forms of accommodations are available. For example, students who cannot read, even if the inability to read is due to a disability, cannot have the exam read to them, because the exam results should accurately show that the student is unable to read. Reports on matriculation exams do not mention whether the student received any accommodations in taking the test.\n\nEach country in Europe has its own special education support structures. 28 European countries are covered by the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education.\n\n\nSchools must take students' special education needs into account when assessing their achievements. Students with disabilities are normally included in their neighborhood school, although may be placed in special schools.\n\n\nIn Denmark, 99% of students with specific learning difficulties like dyslexia are educated alongside students without any learning challenges.\n\n\nSchools adapt the national guidelines to the needs of individual students. Students with special educational needs are given an individualized plan.\n\nThey may be exempted from some parts of school examinations, such as students with hearing impairments not taking listening comprehension tests. If the student receives modifications to the school-leaving exams, this is noted on the certificate of achievement. If they are not following the national core curriculum, then they are tested according to the goals of their individual educational program.\n\n\nFrench students with disabilities are normally included in their neighborhood school, although children may be placed in special schools if their personalized plan calls for it. Each student's personalized school plan describes teaching methods, psychological, medical and paramedical services that the school will provide to the student.\n\n\nMost students with special needs in Germany attend a special school that serves only children with special needs. These include:\n\nOne in 21 German students attends a special school. Teachers at those schools are specially trained professionals who have specialized in special needs education while in university. Special schools often have a very favorable student-teacher ratio and facilities other schools do not have.\n\nSome special needs children in Germany do not attend a special school, but are educated in a mainstream school such as a Hauptschule or Gesamtschule (comprehensive school).\n\nStudents with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests.\n\n\nGreek students with special needs may attend either mainstream schools or special schools.\n\nStudents whose disabilities have been certified may be exempted from some standardized tests or given alternative tests. Accommodations are responsive to students' needs; for example, students with visual impairments may take oral tests, and students with hearing impairments take written tests. Accommodations and modifications are noted on the certificate of achievement.\n\nSpecial education is regulated centrally.\n\nAccording to the 1993 Act on Public Education, students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests. They have a right to extra time, a choice of formats for the tests (e.g., oral rather than written), and any equipment that they normally use during the school day.\n\nAs of 2006, students with disabilities received a significant bonus (eight points) on the university entrance examination, which has been criticized as unfair.\n\nThe National Council for Special Education (NCSE) supports students with physical and intellectual disabilities.\n\n\nAs a general rule, students with special educational needs are integrated into their regular, mainstream schools with appropriate support, under the \"Going to School Together\" policy (\"Weer Samen Naar School\"). Four types of disability-specific special schools exist. The national policy is moving towards \"suitable education\" (\"passend onderwijs\"), based on the individual's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA strong emphasis is placed on the specific needs and positive capabilities of the individual, rather than on limitations. Disabilities are normally documented by experts.\n\nNorway\n\nThe National Support System for Special Needs Education (Statped) is managed by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training. The general objective for Statped is to give guidance and support to those in charge of the education in municipalities and county administrations to ensure that children, young people and adults with major and special educational needs are secured well-advised educational and developmental provisions. The institutions affiliated with Statped offer a broad spectrum of services. Statped consists of 13 resource centres owned by the State, and 4 units for special education, where Statped buys services. These centres offer special educational guidance and support for local authorities and county administrations.\n\n\nStudents with disabilities have a \"guaranteed right\" to appropriate accommodations on assessments. Schools are generally considered autonomous.\n\n\nOn national tests, the National Examination Center normally grants most requests for accommodations that are supported by the local school's examination committee. Legislation opposes the use of modifications that would be unfair to non-disabled students.\n\n\nSchools are required to provide services and resources to students with special educational needs so that they make progress and participate in school. If the local school is unable to provide appropriately for an individual student, then the student may be transferred to a special school.\n\nSpanish non-governmental organizations like ONCE have traditionally provided significant services to students with disabilities.\n\n\nLocal schools have significant autonomy, based on national guidelines. Schools are expected to help students meet the goals that are set for them.\n\nThere are special schools (Swedish:Särskola) for students with low abilities to attend normal education. There has in 2012-2013 been media criticism on the fact that students with light problems such as dyslexia have been placed in special schools, seriously hampering their chances on the labour market.\n\n\nEducation is controlled by the 26 cantons, and so special education programs vary from place to place. However, integration is typical. Students are assessed according to their individual learning goals.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn England and Wales the acronym \"SEN\" for Special Educational Needs denotes the condition of having special educational needs, the services which provide the support and the programmes and staff which implement the education. In England \"SEN PPS\" refers to the Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Service. \"SENAS\" is the special educational needs assessment service, which is part of the Local Authority. \"SENCO\" refers to a special educational needs coordinator, who usually works with schools and the children within schools who have special educational needs. The Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Services help parents with the planning and delivery of their child's educational provision. The Department for Education oversees special education in England.\n\nMost students have an individual educational plan, but students may have a group plan in addition to, or instead of, an individual plan. Group plans are used when a group of students all have similar goals.\n\nIn Scotland the Additional Support Needs Act places an obligation on education authorities to meet the needs of all students in consultation with other agencies and parents. In Scotland the term Special Educational Needs (SEN), and its variants are not official terminology although the very recent implementation of the Additional Support for Learning Act means that both \"SEN\" and \"ASN\" (Additional Support Needs) are used interchangeably in current common practice.\n\n\nAt a young age students who have special needs in Turkey are provided special education from The Ministry of Education, who are responsible in giving them the education that they need.\n\nIn order to get special education you are required certain things:\nAll special-needs students receive an Individualized Education Program (BEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The Özel Eğitim Kurumları Yönetmeliği (ÖEKY) requires that students with special needs be provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a special school.\n\nThe education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as speech therapy, if the student needs these services.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, approximately 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.\n\nAs with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.\n\nPoor, refugies are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, \"thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education.\" Teacher efficacy, tolerance, gender, and years of experience and special education referrals.\n\nBefore 1978, little action was taken to educate children with disabilities in Columbia. Children would be left home without much interaction with the outside world. In 1985, special education was researched across the country and education programs were created. After 1990, people with disabilities were given access to public school classes. The increase in advocation for accessibility for children with disabilities was initiated by the awareness and recognition of the rights of this group of children to education. While there has been improvement over recent years, there is still slow development for special education programs and special education policy.\n\nStatistics from DANE (Departamento Administrativo Na-cional de Estadística) state that there are 2,624,898 disabled people who reside in Colombia, representing 6.3% of the countries population.According to 2010 research 90% of disabled students in Colombia no not attend a mainstream school, and only 26% of them are able to attend school at all. \n\nThe history of special education in Colombia can be categorized into three time periods: the period of neglect, the period of diagnosis and planning, and the emergence of special education. The period of planning ran from the years 1978 to the year 1990. The Ministry of Colombia in 1995 implemented a national plan for the development of special education called \"Plan Nacional para el Desarrollo de la Education Especial\". The purposes of the plan was to create a national diagnosis of special education and to initiate programs for individuals with disabilities. In 1994, the Ministry of education put the first law into action to introduce special classes in public schools that include students with disabilities, called Law 115. In 2011, Colombia entered into the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities, an agreement among the United Nations Education Scientific and Culture Organization(UNESCO)to protect people who live with disabilities.\n\nThe most recent development of special education in Colombia was Article 11 of Law 1618, which was passed in 2013. The law states that \"the Ministry of Education will define the policy and regulate the scheme of education for persons with special educational needs, promoting educational access and quality under a system based on inclusion in the educational services\". The Colombian government has also made financial strides into special education, investing over $12.3 million in 2015. \nIn North America, special education is commonly abbreviated as \"special ed\", \"SpecEd\", \"SPED\", or \"SpEd\" in a professional context.\n\nEducation in Canada is the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories. As such, rules vary somewhat from place to place. However, inclusion is the dominant model.\n\nFor major exams, Canadian schools commonly use accommodations, such as specially printed examinations for students with visual impairments, when assessing the achievements of students with special needs. In other instances, alternative assessments or modifications that simplify tests are permitted, or students with disabilities may be exempted from the tests entirely.\n\n\nAll special-needs students receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a special school.\n\nThe education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as speech therapy, if the student needs these services.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, approximately 6 million children (roughly 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services. As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services. Poor, black and Latino urban schools are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, \"thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s, in some part due to the civil rights movement, some researchers began to study the disparity of education amongst people with disabilities. The landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, which declared unconstitutional the \"separate but equal\" arrangements in public schools for students of different races, paved the way for PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia, which challenged the segregation of students with special needs. Courts ruled that unnecessary and inappropriate segregation of students with disabilities was unconstitutional. Congress responded to these court rulings with the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975 (since renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)). This law required schools to provide services to students previously denied access to an appropriate education.\n\nIn US government-run schools, the dominant model is inclusion. In the United States, three out of five students with academic learning challenges spend the overwhelming majority of their time in the regular classroom.\n\nAutism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), refers to a range of conditions. These conditions involve challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. They also involve unique strengths and differences. \n\nAutism is known as a disability that impairs the social interactions and communication skills of a person. People who are autistic tend to think and act differently than others. Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) find themselves comfortable with a device in their hands. For students with autism, there are apps called \"visual scene displays\" that are most helpful for children who are having difficulty with verbal skills, according to Jules Csillag, a speech-language pathologist who focuses on special ed tech. Apps such as SceneSpeak and Speech with Milo help autistic children develop storytelling skills with text-to-speech voice and interactive storybooks. Using apps like these in a classroom can improve autistic student's verbal skills.\n\nThere are several controversies surrounding the diagnoses and causes of autism. It's now believed that there's no single cause of autism. Research seems to suggest that autism is normally the result of both genetic and environmental influences.\n\nIf a student has down syndrome, assistive technology can help with their learning experience. Author of \"Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together,\" Terry Hassold, who got his PhD in human genetics, explains that students with Down syndrome have delays with cognitive ability. Their brains have a late reaction when their neurological system sends a message for any task. Because of this late reaction, they tend to take longer to complete a task than an average students. Assistive technology is crucial in helping Down's students with their writing ability. Down syndrome children tend to have shorter, stubbier fingers and a lowered thumb making their ability to write more difficult. Also, some of the usual wrist bones are not formed, making it difficult to hold objects. Slanted desks are one type of assisted technology that can aid in the successful ability to write. A three-ring binder can be used to create a slanted desk by turning the binder sideways. Also, students with Down's often try to hold their pencils by anchoring them against the thumb rather than using the tip of their thumb. Shortened pencils or triangular-shaped pencils encourage students to hold them correctly. Using any of these assistive technologies can help down syndrome students during their educational process.\n\nToday many people with disabilities are breaking barriers through the use of technology. For some individuals with disabilities, assistive technology is a necessary tool that enables them to engage in or perform many tasks. Integrating technology will allow students to increase their self-confidence, self-motivation, independence and they will also be able to engage in different activities within the school.\n\n\n"}

Teaching artists work with schools, after school programs, community agencies, prisons, jails, and social service agencies. The \"Arts In Education\" movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.\n\nArts learning consultant Eric Booth has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as \"a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about the arts.” This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields. Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.\nOn April 16, 2011 the Association of Teaching Artists convened the First National Teaching Artists Forum. The forum was held at The Center for Arts Education in New York City with nearly fifty participants.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1066029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1066029", "title": "Tenth grade", "text": "Tenth grade\n\nTenth grade, sophomore year, or grade 10 (called Year 11 in England and Wales) is the tenth year of school post-kindergarten or the tenth year after the first introductory year upon entering compulsory schooling. In many parts of the world, the students are 15–16 years of age, depending on when their birthday occurs. The variants of 10th grade in various nations are described below.\n\nYear 10, for most Australian states, is the fourth year of a student's high school education. However, in the Northern Territory, it is the first year of senior school, which occurs after high school. While in contrast, in most South Australian public schools, it is the third year of high school. For more in depth information on Australia's education system, see: Education in Australia.\n\nIn Belgium, the 10th grade is called \"4ème secondaire\" in French (Walloon), or \"4de middelbaar\" in Dutch (Flemish).\n\nIn Canada, Grade 10 is the 10th year of mandatory schooling. Depending on province, it may be the first (grades 10-12 high school), second (grades 9-12 high school), third (grades 8-12 high school), or fourth year of high school (grades 7-11 high school) .\n\nIn Denmark the 10th grade may refer to an extra year of primary school. Earlier, 10th grade was mostly for people who had a hard time in primary school and needed an extra year to prepare for high school (or another secondary education of some sort), but nowadays, it is widely popular amongst challenged and gifted students alike and usual attended at a special kind of boarding school called an \"Efterskole\". 10th can also be attended at a regular school, though. This year is usually taken as a way to get a break from the school system and relax and try something different before moving on to high school. \nBut, more commonly, people attend the \"gymnasium\" (can be compared to high school) where you go from 10th-12th grade (as such, some people attend 10th grade twice). People don't usually call the steps of the Danish gymnasium for 10th, 11th or 12th grade, but usually refer to them as 1st G, 2nd G, and 3rd G. Here, G is simply the letter \"G\", and it refers to the three different steps of the education.\n\nIn Finland tenth grade is usually known as the first year of High School (\"Lukio\" in Finnish and \"Gymnasiet\" in Swedish). The tenth grade may also refer to an extra year of primary school (\"kymppiluokka\" in Finnish which literally translates to \"tenth grade\"). This extra year of primary school is for those without a post-primary school study position or who need some more time to decide on their future.\n\nThe tenth year of schooling in France is known as the , so called because it is the second last in secondary education.\nIt is the first year of High School (\"Lycée\")\n\nIn Greece, the 10th grade is referring to the 1st class of Lyceum (\"1η Λυκείου\") (\"Pròti likìou). Lyceum is a form of a secondary school and it isn't compulsory for citizens to attend.\n\nIn Hong Kong, 10th grade is called Form 4.\n\nThe tenth grade (the tenth school year after kindergarten) is important in India. After the completion of the tenth grade, the student is required to sit for national board exams or state board exams wherein question papers are prepared and answer sheets are checked by a central institution to which the school is affiliated. The percentage scored in Class X decides what a student can opt for in Class XI (Science/Commerce/Arts). The Grade gains even more importance as in many parts of India the number of seats for Class XI is generally lower than the number of students who pass out Standard X.\n\nThe new system called CCE (Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation) was introduced by the Central Board of Secondary Education in India for students of sixth to tenth grades. The main aim of CCE is to evaluate every aspect of the child during their presence at the school.\n\nHowever, since the academic year 2017-18 CCE has been scrapped and the old method of complete syllabus examination is in use.\n\nIn Ireland, it is the 4th year of Secondary School or Transition Year or Idirbhliain in Gaelscoileanna. In most secondary schools optional subjects are introduced. Students continue normal classes but also have the opportunity to try new things such as work experience, participation in school stage productions or do other activities or courses such as ECDL or different sports. Students do not sit tests within this year.\n\nIn Israel, the tenth grade is the first year of high school (pronounced in Hebrew as \"Tichon\") in most formal places, which lasts three years. In some cities (such as Ramat Gan, Givatayim and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut), elementary school ends at 8th grade and high school starts at 9th grade.\n\nIn Italy, the tenth grade is the second year of the high school (which is called Scuola media superiore or scuola secondaria di secondo grado). High school in Italy lasts five years.\n\nIn Malaysia, 10th grade also known as Form 4 in secondary school. The students at this stage are 16 years old, and it is the fourth year in the secondary school.\nThis is the year when the students choose their focus as either art/science for their upcoming studies.\n\nIn Mexico, the tenth grade is the beginning of the high school, which lasts only three years. Similar to Israel's education system. Tenth graders are normally aged 15–16.\n\nIn Nepal, Grade 10th is the final year of Junior High. And Students gives SEE examination in Grade 10th after which They Qualify for +2(Senior High). They can choose Different subjects like Commerce, Science, Management, etc. in +2. They Should get minimum c+ in Science in Grade 10 to take Science. And Students can choose different subjects i.e. Optional Math or Optional English, Computer or Accounts in Grade 9. Students are generally of aged 15 or 16 in Grade 10.\n\nIn The Netherlands, the 10th grade (based on the level of compulsory secondary education) is the last (VMBO), second to last (HAVO), or fourth out of six (VWO) grades of high school. In all cases it is referred to as \"vierde klas\" or just \"de vierde\" (the fourth), because when you have finished elementary school, the grade numbers start over, beginning with one and going to either 4 (VMBO), 5 (HAVO) or 6 (VWO).\n\nIn New Zealand, \"Year 11\" is the equivalent of tenth grade, with students aged 15 or 16 during the years. It is the third year of secondary school and the eleventh year of compulsory education. Year 11 is also the first year of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), the main national qualification for secondary school students in New Zealand. Students in Year 11 study English (or Te Reo Māori), mathematics, and a minimum of four elective subjects with a science subject highly recommended.\n\nIn Norway, the tenth grade is the last year of compulsory education and the final year of \"Ungdomsskole\", equivalent to junior high school. The students enter the tenth grade the year they turn fifteen.\n\nGrade ten is the final year of high school in Pakistan; it is an important year level as it here that matriculation examinations occur after which students can qualify for grades eleven and twelve in college. Successful completion of college allows eligibility for entrance into universities and higher education. Exams of class 10th usually held in March by examination boards called Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education.\n\nIn the Philippines, Grade 10 is the fourth and last year of Junior High School. Topics mainly discussed are the following subjects like, for the major subjects are Trigonometry (Math in Grade 10), Physics (Science in Grade 10), Filipino subject with El Filibusterismo, English and Philippine Contemporary Issues (Political Studies in Grade 10). Values Education, World Literature, MAPEH (Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health), Computer and TLE (Technology and Livelihood Education) are some of the minor subjects. Students are usually 15–16 years old.\n\nIn Russia, in the end of ninth grade students have a choice: to progress to the tenth grade in school or go to college. The tenth grade is the beginning of the high school, and it is a pre-exam year, when training to USE is being. Learning is similar with Ninth grade, but priority is given to repeat the material learned in high school (Fifth to Ninth years).\n\nIn Singapore, 10th grade is equivalent of Secondary 4 level. Students are usually 16 years old and will take either the GCE 'N' Levels or the GCE 'O' Levels at the end of the year.\n\nIn South Africa, ninth grade marks the end of a student's General Education and Training-phase. Children in South Africa are required to attend school up to the age of fifteen, or completion of the General Education and Training-phase, whichever comes first. Students have the option of continuing secondary school up to twelfth grade, under Further Education and Training. Upon successful completion of the twelfth grade, students are granted the National Senior Certificate.\n\nIn Spain, the tenth grade is 4th of E.S.O. (Obligatory Secondary Education, in Spanish \"Educación Secundaria Obligatoria\").\n\nIn Sweden, the tenth to twelfth grades are taken at a certain type of school called a 'Gymnasium'. After ninth grade, Swedish children end their compulsory schooling. Therefore, these schools are significantly divided in terms of both abilities and career aims. There are two overall types of programs (courses of study) that students can choose from at their schools. Each one is taught in its own separate place. Job-oriented programs (yrkesförberedande program) and programs that prepare for university college (högskoleförberedande program). There are then several programmes of the two types; for example the natural science program (naturvetenskapsprogrammet), which prepares for university college and focuses on subjects like physics, chemistry, biology and math or the construction programme (bygg och anläggningsprogrammet), which is a programme specialized for jobs in that sector. Other options among college preparatory program are for instance the social science program, specializing in social studies and subjects like civics, sociology, psychology, language and history.\n\nFor these higher schools students can pick a school that is specialized for the job they wish to take (yrkesförberedande gymnasium). At these schools only classes relevant to the classification of the school are taught, along with language, math and some civics skills. There are widely oriented schools such as General Arts, but also very specific schools, such as Equestrian.\n\nStudents that do not yet have any specific career aspirations, or wish to go to a school specialized for a profession that requires a gymnasial degree, can choose to move into a general school, which has programmes preparing for college university (högskoleförberedande program). The system there is very similar to the system from seventh grade to ninth grade except that the student has chosen a program which allows the student to focus on an (albeit in a somewhat general way) area of interest. For instance; the economics programme (ekonomiprogrammet) includes courses in business economics, entrepreneurship and other such courses along with general courses that all students going to schools which prepare for university college must take, such as math, language, civics, physical education etc.\n\nFor education in England and Wales, this is known as Year 11.\nGeneral education certificates will be awarded if the pupils sit the end of year examinations, called GCSEs. In Year 11, students take their GCSEs. With grades ranging from 9 to 1, and the grade below 1 being U, these exams show proficiency in a range of subjects. Results of at least five 5 grades are considered a pass and many employers require their staff to have at least 5s in GCSE, including English and Maths. GCSEs are taken in May and June. Pupils may then go on to sit 'A' Levels. A new English Baccalaureate has been introduced; this is awarded to students who achieve a 9 to 5 in five subjects including English, Maths, science, a humanities subject (history or geography) and a modern language or computer science.\n\nIn Scotland, tenth grade (the tenth year after kindergarten or entry into compulsory schooling) is called S4 (or fourth year). At the end of S4, students normally sit for examinations in six or seven National 5 subjects in which they have studied over the previous two years. National 5's and are taken during the months of May and June. \nIt is followed by an optional fifth year (S5) at school or pupils may choose to leave at the end of S4, provided they have reached the age of 16 by 30, September of that year. Those who wish to leave, but will not meet the September deadline, may do so provided that they have either secured an apprenticeship or a placement in a college designed for Christmas Leavers. They are called this because there are two leaving dates in the academic year - the last day in May (summer leaving date), and the last day before the Christmas holidays (winter leaving date). Hence the term \"Christmas leavers\".\n\nThe tenth grade is the tenth school year. Grade 10 is a part of high school, and in most parts of the U.S. it is the second year of high school, with 11th then 12th following.\n\nThe term \"high school\" is often used to mean \"senior high school\" and distinguished from junior high school. Grades are used in determining a student's GPA (in the U.S.), and become part of a student's official transcript.\n\nIn the U.S. math, tenth graders are usually taught geometry. Occasionally, trigonometry, precalculus, or higher classes, are offered for students who wish to take Advanced Placement math classes in later years of high.\n\nIn the U.S. curriculum for literature, students have already begun to familiarize themselves with notable authors such as Shakespeare, while some Advanced Placement programs emphasize the work of author J.D. Salinger, for example, and his \"Catcher in the Rye\", putting a major emphasis on literary terms and getting to know themes such as \"alienation\". Generally, students at this grade will be taught World Literature. Like other classes, Honors and Advanced Placement versions of this course are available.\n\nIn the U.S. curriculum for science, tenth graders are usually taught chemistry, biology or Integrated Science 1B. Like other classes, Advanced Placement Chemistry and/or Biology is available.\n\nIn the U.S. curriculum for social studies, tenth grade students are taught recent World History or American History. In some districts, Advanced Placement coursework, such as geography, European history, World Studies, or United States History.\n\nIn the U.S., tenth grade is also known as sophomore.\n\n"}

It consists of the Higher Institute of Theology and the Higher Institute of Islamic Civilisation in Tunis and a research institution, the Center of Islamic Studies, in Kairouan. \n\nFor centuries, Qirwan was the early centre of learning and intellectual pursuits in Tunisia and North Africa in General. Starting from the 13th century, Tunis became the capital of Ifriqiya under Almohad and Hafsid rule.\nThis shift in power helped Ez-Zitouna to flourish and become one of the major centres of Islamic learning, and Ibn Khaldun, the first social historian in history was one of its products.\nThe flourishing university attracted students and men of learning from all parts of the known world at the time. Along with theology; mainly the Qur'an, the university taught jurisprudence, history, grammar, science and medicine. When it comes to books and libraries, Ez-Zituna libraries were the richest among North African counterparts. It had several collections totaling in the tens of thousands of books. One of its libraries, el-Abdaliyah included a large collection of rare and unique manuscripts. The manuscripts covered almost all subjects and sciences, including grammar, logic, documentations, etiquette of research, cosmology, arithmetic, geometry, minerals, vocational training, etc.\n\nHistorically the traditional pedagogy of the university opposed French influence in Tunisian culture, even though younger people who studied there and who were unable to attend other universities lost the concept of the university having prestige. The students, faculty, and alumni became an integral part of the 1920s Destour party.\n\nFollowing Tunisia's Independence, the modern Zitouna University was established on April 26, 1956. This was succeeded by the Zitouna Faculty of Shari’a and Theology on March 1, 1961 which became one of the components of Tunisian University. The Zitouna name was restored by Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 1987, after having been changed under Bourguiba.\n\nThe present-day institution has some 1200 students and 90 faculty, divided between two associated institutes — the Higher Institute of Theology and the Higher Institute of Islamic Civiliation in Tunis — and a research institution, the Center of Islamic Studies () in Kairouan.\n\nLessons in the Higher Institute of Theology began in the academic year 1988/89.

In 2011, it was announced that the University of Wales would also be merged into Trinity Saint David. On 1 August 2013 the university merged with Swansea Metropolitan University.\n\nThe Patron of the university is the Prince of Wales, the President of Trinity Saint David is R. Brinley Jones and the Vice-Chancellor is Medwin Hughes.\n\nThe University of Wales Trinity Saint David was formed in July 2010 by the merger of the University of Wales, Lampeter and Trinity University College, via a supplementary charter to Lampeter's 1828 royal charter.\n\nIn 2008, a QAA report on Lampeter concluded that, although the quality of the university's degrees was satisfactory, they had \"\"limited confidence\" in the institution's quality assurance procedures and systems. Further to this assessment, HEFCW commissioned a further report which found \"very real problems of leadership and management\"\" at the university.\nAs a direct result, in December 2008, Lampeter announced that it was in merger talks with Trinity with the intention of forming a new university. This was formally announced in April 2009, when the institution's new name, \"University of Wales, Trinity Saint David\", was revealed. The university received its first students in September 2010. The name of the institution is a combination of Lampeter's original name (Saint David's College) and the name of Trinity University College.\n\nIn June 2010, a declaration of intent was announced between Trinity Saint David, Swansea Metropolitan University and three regional further education colleges (Coleg Ceredigion, Coleg Sir Benfro and Coleg Sir Gâr) to establish a South-West Wales regional post-16 further education and higher education educational group. The FE colleges were to merge into one educational group, whilst the HE institutions would merge into another educational group, with both working closely within the region. \n\nIn December 2010 it was announced that the university would merge with Swansea Metropolitan University. This merger was completed on 1 August 2013. In May 2011 the university announced it would be establishing the Wales International Academy of Voice in Cardiff, opening in June 2011. In October 2011, it was announced that the University of Wales would also be merged into Trinity Saint David. A deed of union signed in 2017 functionally integrated the two universities, although the full constitutional merger has not been completed as of September 2018.\n\nA London campus was opened in 2012. In August 2012, it was announced that Coleg Sir Gâr, a further education college with five campuses across Carmarthenshire, would be merged with Trinity Saint David, forming a combined higher education and further education institution. In 2015, the university established a second centre in Cardiff with the launch of \"Canolfan Berfformio Cymru\" (the Wales Centre for Performance). In 2016, Coleg Ceredigion, another further education college with campuses in Cardigan and Aberystwyth, merged with the university. The university opened a \"learning centre\" in Birmingham in 2018, offering level 4 (first year undergraduate) courses leading to a Certificate of Higher Education.\n\nThe Lampeter campus includes a number of academic, utility and residential buildings.\nCharles Robert Cockerell designed the original college building, now called the Saint David's Building (informally known as Old Building or OB by students) in the centre of the grounds. It is a Grade II* listed building and contains lecture rooms, administrative offices, student residential accommodation and the following three main areas:\n\nThe Old Hall was the college dining hall until the Lloyd Thomas refectory was opened in 1969. It then became part of the students' union, used as a venue for meetings and dances. After the opening of a new students' union building, it fell into disuse until 1991 when it was re-opened after much restoration; it is now used as one of the university's principal venues for meetings, dinners and conferences and is often hired out to outside organisations. It is also used for examinations and occasional lectures.\n\nThe Old Hall also contains paintings of various principals, presidents, benefactors, vice-chancellors \"et al.\" including the founder of the University Bishop Thomas Burgess, Maurice Jones, Thomas Price, Llewelyn Lewellin, Edward Harold Browne, Keith Robbins and Brian Robert Morris.\n\nSt David's Chapel was consecrated in 1827. In 1879, it was rebuilt according to the specifications of the architect Thomas Graham Jackson of Cambridge and re-opened on 24 June 1880. It was again refurbished during the 1930s, mainly through the provision of a new reredos (incorporating depictions of St David, Christ and St Deiniol in 1933 and a major overhaul of the organ in 1934. The chapel is provided with a dedicated chaplain and services are held here on Sundays and throughout the week as well as on saints' days and major festivals. These are generally well-attended by a mixture of staff, students and alumni.\n\nThe Founders' Library, named after its founders — Thomas Burgess, Thomas Bowdler and Thomas Phillips — was the College's library until the new library opened in 1966 and later housed the priceless collection of the university's oldest printed books (1470–1850) and manuscripts (the earliest being from the 13th century) unique to the university, given to St David's College from 1822 onwards, as well as the university's archives. \nIn 2005, it was announced that a new £700,000 extension, The Roderic Bowen Library & Archives, was to be built adjoining the Main Library to house the university's manuscripts, as the Founders' Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable documents. This extension to the main library was completed and opened in 2008.\n\nThe former Founders' Library was subsequently refurbished and was reopened by HRH Charles, Prince of Wales to provide outside conference and seminar facilities.\n\n\"The Canterbury Building\" was built to house a growing number of students at the end of the 19th century. The foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1885 and the building was officially opened on 24 June 1887. It contained a physical science laboratory, two lecture rooms and new accommodation. However, structural problems forced the university to demolish the original building in the summer of 1971. The second Canterbury Building was opened on 20 October 1973 by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kent and at various times housed the History, Classics, Foundation, Welsh and English departments.\n\nThe second Canterbury Building was demolished during 2012, and the third Canterbury Building, opened during the 2012/13 academic year, now houses the Student Services Hub.\n\"The Library\" was opened on 7 July 1966 by the then Chancellor of the University of Wales, HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was extended and then reopened by HRH Charles, Prince of Wales on 21 June 1984.\n\n\"The Arts Building\" was built to house the geography department and was opened by The Rt. Hon Peter Thomas, Secretary of State for Wales on 4 October 1971. Currently, the Arts Building houses the School of Archaeology, History and Anthropology and the School of Management, VSS, IT, Business and Tourism as well as the Department of Philosophy.\n\"The Cliff Tucker building\", on the banks of the River Dulas, was opened by Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1996 on the site of the former archaeology practice trenches and incorporates several teaching rooms and a lecture theatre. It is named in honour of Cliff Tucker, a former student and benefactor of the university.\nCompleted in 1997 and named after Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a benefactor of the UWL, the \"Sheikh Khalifa building\" is the home of the School of Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies, one of the largest Schools of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was opened by Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland. Behind the departmental building is a small mosque and prayer room, used by Islamic students and residents of the town, and also the Rowland Williams Research building.\n\nOpened in 2007, the \"Confucius Institute\" is the home of the university's department of Chinese Studies. The mission of the Confucius Institute has been to build bridges between Wales and China.\n\n\"The Roderic Bowen Library & Archives\" were completed in 2007, adjoining the main library building. They are named after Roderic Bowen, a former President of the university. The books, manuscripts and archives kept therein were formerly held in the St David's Building Founders’ Library. The library was opened on 17 October 2008 by the former First Minister for Wales, Rhodri Morgan.\nIt is a resource for teaching, research and scholarship within the university.\n\n\"The Students' Union\" houses the university's main entertainment venue, the Xtension, a bar, television and pool rooms, student shop and offices for union officials. It is the main focus of social life on campus, hosting club nights, socials, pool tournaments and charity events.\n\n\"The Bishop Burgess Hall\" formerly housed the Departments of Classics and Philosophy. In 2009 it was converted to become a hub for student services.\n\nAlthough its foundation and indeed its speciality lies in education, the campus now also teaches a variety of degrees in subjects such as sport, health and nutrition, religious and Islamic studies, psychology, social inclusion, creative arts, photography, film and drama, business and tourism, and English and creative writing. The Carmarthen campus is the base of two of the university's three faculties.\nThe campus is centred around the original 1848 \"Old Building\" of Trinity College. It originally contained all of the original dormitories, common rooms, libraries, an original university quadrangle and teaching spaces. The building today houses several lecture theatres and smaller classrooms often used by the university's School of Justice and Social Inclusion (including psychology) and theology, religious studies and Islamic studies.\nAnother feature of the old building of Carmarthen is the \"Archbishop Childs' Hall\". Named after Derrick Greenslade Childs, who was Archbishop of Wales, Bishop of Monmouth and director of the Church of Wales. Childs was principal of Trinity in 1965. The hall is of a classical shape and is hung with framed paintings of Childs. On the outside of the building, there is a carved crest of the Bishops of Wales.\n\n\"Cwad\" – The original 1848 quadrangle, what later became the old college library has been modified into the 'Cwad'. This operates in partnership with the main library.\nAttached to the main body of the Old Building is the \"University Chapel\". This was built in 1848 and although it has been modified slightly, still retains many original features. Attached to this is the historic ante-chapel, the original chapel the present one being an extension added in 1932, which is dedicated to past students and professors who served in the first world war. The ante-chapel contains a font and is decorated with student artwork. There is also the university chapel lounge which now houses the university's chaplaincy library and serves as a comfortable, relaxed meeting space for the Chapel community. This room also has a stained glass window installed in 2008 in memory of Norah Isaac, former lecturer and pioneer of Welsh language education.\n\nThe surrounding campus is a blend of modern buildings surrounded by sweeping lawns and gardens.\n\nOpposite the old building is the \"Halliwell Centre\", named after a former principal of Trinity College, which is primarily used as a conference facility. Attached to the centre is the Merlin restaurant which is the campus' main restaurant and refectory for catered students. \n\"The Carwyn James Building\" is a large four-storey building named after Carwyn James, a former Welsh rugby player, teacher and lecturer at Trinity College. This facility is home to the Faculty of Education and Training.\n\n\"Emyr Wyn Jones Building\"- This building contains office space, music suites and practice rooms for the School of Performing Arts. Adjoining this building was the School's main workshop for the degree of theatre production and design.\n\n\"The Dewi Building\" was originally built in 1925 as the Dewi Hostel. It was an extension of the original old college and served as an extra wing for student accommodation. An account of the conditions of the hostel survives from a student living in them at the time;\n\"“To keep oneself warm in the new wing during the Winter months was a problem for although it had a system of heating, the heat seldom reached even the second floor. To wash we depended on the rain-water caught in the roof of the building and this was always cold”.\"\n\n\"The main library\" of the university campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate the growing diversity of subjects on the campus and is located opposite the Parry Block. It is dedicated to the poet Raymond Garlick, who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh department.\n\n\"The Parry Building\", named after Canon Parry (a former principal of the college and psychology lecturer 1909–1940), contains a variety of teaching facilities used largely by the university's School of Creative Arts. These include fairly large classrooms and smaller art studios. The building runs parallel to the Norah Isaac building and the two are of very similar designs. Originally the front façade of the building, the oldest part, was the broadcast room in 1950.\n\n\"Students' Union\" – The students' union building was the centre of student social life on the campus. Constructed in 1972 it comprised two main venues: the Attic Bar which served food and drinks and downstairs 'Unity', the main entertainment venue of the Union. This facility hosted club nights as well as other social events. The Union incorporated many societies, ranging from sports such as rugby and hockey to historical societies.\n\n\"Norah Isaac Building\" – This building is home to the school of social justice and Inclusion and contains the reception for that school. It is named after Norah Isaac, who was responsible for setting up the first ever Welsh drama department, and was a founder of the performing arts tradition at Trinity. It has a selection of classrooms and lecture suites. Degrees in English and Creative Writing are also taught in this building, which is also home to the university's foreign office, which deals with international programmes. It is located directly opposite the Parry Building.\n\n\"Robert Hunter Building\" – Named after Robert Hunter, this building contains a selection of classrooms, lecture halls and laboratories used by the school of sport, health and outdoor education. The facility is located near the Myrddin Accommodation blocks, and is surrounded by picturesque gardens and ponds.\n\n\"Dafydd Rowlands Building\" – Named after the author Dafydd Rowlands, a minister and previous lecturer of Trinity College in the Welsh department, the building is home to the university's department of Film and Visual Media, this space contains laboratories and studios as well as several working spaces for other programmes within the school of creative arts. It also houses office space.\n\nUWTSD took over the campuses of Swansea Metropolitan University upon the merger of the two institutions. These now make up part of the Swansea city centre campuses of the university, consisting of the Dynevor campus, the Mount Pleasant campus, the Alex Design Exchange, and the Swansea Business Campus.\n\nIn 2018 the university is opening a new £350 million campus at the SA1 Swansea Waterfront, which will house Yr Athrofa: the Institute of Education, and the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering. Staff and students from the city centre Townhill and Mount Pleasant campuses are relocating to SA1, with Townhill closing at the end of the 2017-18 academic year although the university is retaining a presence at Mount Pleasant.\n\nThe university's London Campus opened in 2012 and is located in Winchester House on Cranmer Road in the London Borough of Lambeth. The campus hosts MBA programmes run by the university’s School of Business, many of which courses are aimed at attracting overseas students.\n\nThe university is a part of what has been called a dual-sector university, delivering both higher and further education. It has partnerships with a number of other further and higher education institutions across the UK, including:\n\nIt also has a number of international validation and franchise agteements, as well as articulation agreements with Renmin University of China and Wuhan University of Technology, China.\n\nThe university is organised into a number of academic schools and faculties.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor is the chief executive of the university and the post is currently held by Medwin Hughes.\n\nThe university was the first in the UK to place at its core sustainable development. The university's Institute of Sustainable Practice and Resource Effectiveness or INSPIRE is designed to ensure that students are prepared for their futures in the workplace and in society as a whole.\n\nWith many of the degrees offered by the university there is less emphasis placed upon UCAS points and more upon individual merit especially regarding mature students. However, for many of the degrees offered within the Faculty of Humanities a set number of UCAS points is required; for most courses this is usually between 240–280.\n\nFor postgraduate taught programs a minimum of an upper second class degree is required.\n\nThe university has continued the tradition of research in the humanities at Lampeter. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF2014), 47% of the university's research was judged as world leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). The university entered six units of assessment in REF2014, with 26% of research being judged 4* and 39% 3* in Modern Languages and Linguistics (jointly with the University of Wales's Centre for Advanced Celtic Studies), 23% 4* and 52% 3* in Art and Design: History Practice and Theory (jointly with the University of South Wales and Cardiff Metropolitan University as the Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design), 14% 4* and 48% 3* in Theology and Religious Studies, 9% 4* and 25% 3* in Geography, Environmental Studies and Archaeology, 4% 4* and 38% 3* in Classics, and 3% 3* in General Engineering.\n\nThe pioneering Sophia Centre for the Study of Cosmology in Culture is a world centre for the study of the impact, role and function of cosmological, astronomical and astrological beliefs and practices in human culture.\n\nStudents are represented by Trinity Saint David Students' Union (TSDSU). The students union has buildings on all three main campuses, with bars in Carmarthen (Taphouse72) and Lampeter (Old Bar & Xtention).\n\nBoth Lampeter and Carmarthen campuses have sports halls with badminton and squash courts, with a hockey team drawing from students of both campuses and a fencing team based on the St David's College campus which regularly competes in Welsh leagues and championships. Both campuses also have indoor climbing walls.\n\nFor outdoor sports, the university has tennis courts, a cricket field and facilities for football and rugby. The Carmarthen Campus also has an indoor swimming pool, an up-to-date gym and fitness suite and AstroTurf. There plans in motion to add gym facilities to Lampeter through the conversion of one of the squash courts.\n\nThe college cricket pavilion at Lampeter was opened officially on 1 May 1909 and is now a listed building in its own right.\n\nRugby was introduced to the old St David's College by vice-principal Rowland Williams around 1850 and, as such, the Lampeter campus can claim to have the oldest Rugby football team in Wales. Despite some debate as to whether this honour belongs to the town team or the university side, the Welsh Rugby Union's official history \"Fields of Praise: The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union, 1881–1981\" indicates the college team as the first. However, Lampeter Town RFC were the representatives of Lampeter at the formation of the WRU in 1881.\n\nAt Trinity, Rugby has long been an important part of college life. Indeed, a number of alumni went on to become outstanding international players including Sid Judd, Ronnie Boon, Dewi Bebb and Barry John. Wales and British Lions winger, Gerald Davies, is a former student of both former universities.\n\nBoth Carmarthen and Lampeter campuses provide on-campus halls of residence, although some students opt to live in privately rented student housing within the respective towns. Both campuses can house approximately 600 students.\n\nThe university provides various residences for students. The Lampeter Campus is generally able to house the majority of its students on campus principally within the following Halls and Buildings, named after personalities involved with the campus's past.\n\n\nThe Carmarthen Campus is able to house hundreds of students on Campus, though many students opt to live in the town.\n\nSwansea has five halls of residence based on two separate campuses. There are over 300 rooms for first year students to apply for.\n\n\nThe university awards University of Wales degrees and, as such, the academic dress matches that of the University of Wales — graduates wear a black stuff gown, with bell sleeves for bachelors and glove sleeve for masters. Hoods are lined with mazarin blue shot green (arts) or mazarin blue shot red (divinity).\n\nThe university also awards the degrees of Master of Science (lined yellow shot black) and Master of Business Administration (yellow shot red, bound light blue).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ranking is published by the Cybermetrics Lab, a research group of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) located in Madrid.\n\nThe aim of the Ranking is to improve the presence of the academic and research institutions on the Web and to promote the open access publication of scientific results. The ranking started in 2004 and is updated every January and July. Today it provides Web indicators for more than 12,000 universities worldwide.\n\nThe Webometrics Ranking of Business Schools is a similar ranking of the world's Business Schools.\n\nThe Webometrics University Ranking is a ranking system based on university web presence, visibility and web access. This ranking system measures how strongly a university is present in the web by its own web domain, sub-pages, rich files, scholarly articles etc. The central hypothesis of this approach is that web presence is a reliable indicator of the global performance and prestige of the universities and as such, is an indirect way to measure all the university missions (teaching, research, transfer). Although the Web is universally recognized as one of the most relevant tools for scholarly communication, it is still very rare these indicators are used for the evaluation of the scientific research and the academic performance of universities. Webometric indicators are provided to show the commitment of the institutions to Web publication.\n\nA research paper in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \"Scientometrics\" found \"reasonable similarities\" between the Webometrics rankings and other prominent university rankings despite using a very different set of features to determine each university's rank. These similarities were increased when the comparison was limited solely to European universities.\n\nTop universities are publishing millions of pages produced by dozens of departments and services, hundreds of research teams and thousands of scholars. Strong web presence informs of a wide variety of factors that are clearly correlated with the global quality of the institution: widespread availability of computer resources available, global internet literacy, policies promoting democracy and freedom of speech, competition for international visibility or support of open access initiatives, among others.\n\nIn Namibia, the Webometrics list is frequently used in public interaction, particularly with respect to the country's two main state-funded institutions of tertiary education, the University of Namibia and the Polytechnic of Namibia.\n\nThe 2009-2011 rankings have received significant press coverage and individual rankings have been published on the websites of universities in countries in the Middle East, East Asia, Europe, Canada and Africa.\n\nThere are pages for several regional Rankings:\n\n- Universities. The main worldwide list of 12000 universities build from a catalogue of over 19000 institutions is also offered as regional lists:\n\nThe distribution of the Universities by region (January 2012) is as follows:\n\n- Research Institutes. Top 2000 from a catalogue of over 7000 are published\n\nThe Webometrics Ranking is produced by the Cybermetrics Lab, a unit of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the main public research body in Spain. The Lab acts as an Observatory of the Science and Technology on the Web. Isidro F. Aguillo, Hon.PhD, is the head of the Laboratory and the editor-in-chief of the Rankings.\n\n"}

Lloyd Family Trust\" to provide vocational and Professional Educational Services at National and International Levels under a Christian mission and vision of preaching, teaching and Social work. It is an Autonomous Educational Institute and Vocational Training School.\n\nThe institute was a registered and accredited training institution, accredited by the Training Accreditation Council (TAC) of the Training Department of the Government of Western Australia, and is listed on the \"Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses\" (CRICOS), which provide accredited courses to local and overseas students up to Graduate Diploma Level.\n\nWCIMT established a chain of affiliated colleges in many countries. In 2004, the trustees decided to use this infrastructure to establish the West Coast University in a favorable country; on the recommendations of faculty members West Coast University was incorporated at Panama City, under article 19 of law 32 of 1927. The word \"West Coast\" does have an historical background in Panama. West Coast University, although based in Panama, serves as a global institute for autonomous higher education.\n\nIn March 2007 a Bangladesh online newspaper reported that the nation's education ministry and University Grants Commission had found that West Coast University was operating illegally in Bangladesh and the education ministry was seeking to sue the institution for offering bachelor's degree courses without government authorization. Government personnel said that in 2006 West Coast had opened a campus in Khulna, where in February 2007 the school began conducting courses in electrical and electronic engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and architecture.\n\nIn July 2012, an English-language online newspaper for Panama reported that West Coast University was advertising courses to be conducted there, but Panama's National Council of University Assessment and Accreditation (CONEAUPA) and Ministry of Education said the institution was not accredited and they had no record of the institution being legally established or having approved curricula.\n\nAs of December 2012, West Coast University is a candidate for accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, for its bachelor's and graduate programs in business.\n\nAs of January 2013 West Coast University is now accredited by the International Accreditation Organization (IAO). The IAO is not recognised by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.\n\n"}
