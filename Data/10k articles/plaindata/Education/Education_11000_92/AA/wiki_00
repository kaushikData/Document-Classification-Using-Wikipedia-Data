Assessment for Achievement Standards uses a four-grade system, the lowest being a failing grade, while Unit Standards use a simple achieved/not achieved (pass/fail) grade system.\nSeveral schools in New Zealand, predominantly in Auckland, also offer the CIE (Cambridge International Examinations) Program and IB (International Baccalaureate) in addition to NCEA.\n\nUntil 2002, School Certificate, the predecessor to NCEA Level 1, used a norm-based five-grade system.\n\nNew Zealand universities generally award letter grades (i.e. A to D) to students, with +/- variations. These letter grades correspond to percentage mark bands, though these vary between universities (common cut-offs for A+ include 90% and 85%, and even within a university, an A+ from one department may vary from an A+ from another, with the actual cut-off subject to discretion). D grade is a failing grade, corresponding to work receiving less than 50%. However, for Honours degrees, the letter grades also correspond to degree classes, with A+/A/A- grades corresponding to a first, B+/high B corresponding to 2:1, etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "22457630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22457630", "title": "Academic grading in the United States", "text": "Academic grading in the United States\n\nAcademic grading in the United States commonly takes on the form of five, six or seven letter grades. Traditionally, the grades are A+, A, A−; B+, B, B−; C+, C, C−; D+, D, D−; F; with A+ being the highest and F, short for \"failed\", the lowest. Numeric to letter grade conversions generally vary from system to system and between disciplines and status. In some cases, grades can be numerical, from 0 to 4, with 0 being the worst and 4 being the best.\n\nThe typical grades awarded for participation in a course are (from highest to lowest) (S), A, B, C, D, and F. Variations on the traditional five-grade system allow for awarding A+, A, & A−; B+, B, & B−; C+, C, & C−; D+, D, & D−,and F+, F, & F−. In primary and secondary schools, a D is usually the lowest passing grade, however, there are some schools that consider a C the lowest passing grade, so the general standard is that anything below a 60 or 70 is failing, depending on the grading scale. In college and universities, a D is considered to be an unsatisfactory passing grade. Students will usually still earn credit for the class if they get a D, but sometimes a C or better is required to count some major classes toward a degree, and sometimes a C or better is required to satisfy a prerequisite requirement for a class.\n\nBelow is the grading system found to be most commonly used in United States public high schools, according to the 2009 High School Transcript Study. This is the most used grading system, however, there are some schools that use an edited version of the college system.\n\nBelow is a grading system used by four different colleges in the United States. Other schools use different systems, so this is by no means universal.\nIn a percentage-based system, each assignment regardless of size, type, or complexity, is given a percentage score: nine correct answers out of ten is a score of 90%. The overall grade for the class is then typically weighted so that the final grade represents a stated proportion of different types of work. For example, daily homework may be counted as 50% of the final grade, chapter quizzes may count for 20%, the comprehensive final exam may count for 20%, and a major project may count for the remaining 10%. Each are created to evaluate the students understanding of the material and of their complex understanding of the course material.\n\nIn elementary school, grades may represent rewards from teachers \"for being friendly, prepared, compliant, a good school citizen, well organized and hard-working\" rather than mastering the subject material. Schools in the United States have been accused of using academic grades to penalize students for being bored, uncooperative or for talking out of turn. Usually, this behavior leads to poor or non-existent studying habits which most likely are to blame for their grades. Some teachers use self and peer assessment to evaluate some of a student's progress.\n\nWith the adoption of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student should know and be able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.\n\nAs an instrument of systemic reform, the tests are targeted to items and skills not currently in the curriculum to promote adoption of methods such as constructivist mathematics, inquiry-based science, and problem solving.\n\nGrades can be enhanced by extra credits, awarded where students undertake optional work, additional to their compulsory school work.\n\nFor an example of standard-based grading, see \"The 1-2-3-4 System\" below.\n\nGrading on a curve is any system wherein the group performance is used to moderate evaluation; it need not be strictly or purely rank-based.\n\nIn the most extreme form, students are ranked and grades are assigned according to a student's rank, placing students in direct competition with one another.\n\nOne model uses percentages derived from a normal distribution model of educational performance. The top grade, A, is given here for performance that exceeds the mean by +1.5 standard deviations, a B for performance between +0.5 and +1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and so on. Regardless of the absolute performance of the students, the best score in the group receives a top grade, and the worst score receives a failing grade.\n\nRank-based grading is popular among some American educators, usually under the euphemism of grade rationing. The arguments for grade-rationing are that:\n\nThe arguments against rank-based grading are similar:\n\nNumerical values are applied to grades as follows:\n\nThis allows grades to be easily averaged. Additionally, many schools add .33 for a + grade and subtract .33 for a − grade. Thus, a B+ yields a 3.33 whereas an A– yields a 3.67. A+s, if given, are usually assigned a value of 4.0 (equivalent to an A) due to the common assumption that a 4.00 is the best possible grade-point average, although 4.33 is awarded at some institutions. In some places, .25 or .3 instead of .33 is added for a + grade and subtracted for a − grade. Other institutions maintain a mid-grade and award .5 for the grade. For example, an AB would receive a 3.5-grade point and a BC would receive a 2.5-grade point.\n\nThe industry standard for graduation from undergraduate institutions is a minimum 2.0 average. Most graduate schools have required a 3.0-grade point average since 1975 (the transition began two decades earlier), but some schools still have 2.75 as their pass standard. Some doctoral programs do not have a formal pass standard, but it is unlikely that they would retain a student who is doing work below 'B' quality.\n\nMost American law schools require no more than a 2.0-grade point average to qualify for the professional doctorate in law. This is because law school grades are usually based on a strict bell curve system which typically results in the failure of 10–30% of first-year students. A few law schools require 2.3 or 2.5 for post-doctoral degrees, such as the American LL.M. or S.J.D. degrees. Regular graduate schools have commonly eliminated the D grade because anything below a C is considered failing.\n\nSome high schools, to reflect the varying skill required for different level courses and to discourage students from selecting courses that are considered a source of easy 'A's, will give higher numerical grades for difficult courses, often referred to as a weighted GPA. For example, two common conversion systems used in honors and Advanced Placement courses are:\n\nDenver Public Schools uses a different system in honors and AP courses to get weighted GPA values; the scale is as follows:\n\nAnother policy commonly used by 4.0-scale schools is to mimic the eleven-point weighted scale (see below) by adding a .33 (one-third of a letter grade) to honors or advanced placement class. (For example, a B in a regular class would be a 3.0, but in honors or AP class it would become a B+, or 3.33).\n\nSometimes the 5-based weighting scale is used for AP courses and the 4.6-based scale for honors courses, but often a school will choose one system and apply it universally to all advanced courses. A small number of high schools use a 5-point scale for Honors courses, a 6-point scale for AP courses, and/or a 3-point scale for courses of below average difficulty.\n\nAlthough weighting GPAs is a widespread practice in the United States, there is little research into whether weighted GPAs are better than unweighted GPAs. In one study, weighted GPAs were not suitable for predicting any college outcomes, but unweighted GPA were strong predictors of college GPA. However, standardized test scores were better predictors than either type of GPA.\n\nAt least one boarding school in the United States uses the six-point system, Phillips Academy at Andover. While there are approximate equivalents to the 100 point system, grades are most often described as follows:\n\n\nAlthough described above, grades below a 3 are rarely dispensed in practice.\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy and a few other high schools in the United States use an eleven-point system. Numerical values are applied to grades as follows:\n\n\n\n\nVery few American high schools use a twelve-point system, which differs from the above only in using the grade A+, to which the value 12.0 is applied.\n\nSome school districts use a 1-2-3-4 rating system for grades at the elementary (K–5) level, notably many California school districts including The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) who switched with the class of 2000. The four-point scale more clearly indicates proficiency levels in core subjects by segmenting students who are proficient (4&3) and ready to advance, from those who are not meeting all required standards (2&1) and should not advance. Most notably this removes the \"C\" rating which did not clearly partition students who should advance from those who should not.\n\nAt one time (until roughly the mid-20th Century), the most popular grading system in the United States used four letters, which ranked in descending order:\n\nThis system has largely been replaced by the five-point system discussed above, but is still encountered quite often at the elementary school level, particularly in kindergarten and Grades 1 through 3 (these levels comprising the lower division of primary school). It is also occasionally used at schools for older children, including high schools, especially in the issuance of conduct or citizenship grades.\n\nThere are a few variations to this system, including the use of an O (for \"outstanding\") grade, which is even higher than the E; the use of an O instead of the E; a G (for \"good\") placed between the E and the S; the use of a G (again for \"good\") instead of the E; and the lack of a U grade. In this version, E stands for \"exemplary\" and P proficient, with AE and AP for work that approaches the E and P levels. \"Credit\" is equivalent to the D level and \"No Credit\" is equivalent to F.\n\nThe use of M (for \"mediocre\") in place of the N and I (for \"insufficient\") in place of the U was used in some places, and included the F.\n\nThe S grade may be so modified with an S+ or S−, but otherwise plus and minus are rarely used.\n\nA similar system is used to rank practical work in the certain science department of Oxford University; however only with the grades S (Satisfactory), S+ (more than satisfactory, and may be used in the allocation of degree grades) and NS (Not Satisfactory).\n\nAlternatives to letter-grading assessments have been tried in some schools, but still remain a marginal approach due to the heavy emphasis and history of letter grading. Alternatives to standard letter grading are able to evaluate the students skills and understanding of the course material. The flaws in the standard letter grading system are major and require a lot of attention. These issues include ways for students to achieve high grades without actually understanding the course material. They don't have any real understanding of the complex information taught in the class. Kyle Spencer discusses a issue a high school teacher discovered during his time teaching. The issue was on test his students were able to achieve high grades yet when presented with a complex question they couldn't get it correct. Showing him that they only have a general understanding of the material which wasn't reflected by the grades they received.\n\nA number of liberal arts colleges in the U.S. either do not issue grades at all (such as Alverno College, Antioch College, Bennington College, Evergreen State College, New College of Florida, and Hampshire College), de-emphasize them (St. John's College, Reed College, Sarah Lawrence College, Prescott College, College of the Atlantic), or do not calculate grade point averages (Brown University). In many cases, narrative evaluations are used as an alternative measurement system. Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn is one of several secondary schools to eschew grades in favor of narrative reports, while still managing to be the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in Ivy League and several other highly selective colleges.\n\n\nThe FN grade indicates that a student has failed a course due to non-attendance. It is calculated as an \"F\" in the student's grade point average. For students receiving financial aid, failure for non-attendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of his or her aid. The FN grade will be assigned by the faculty member at any time following the final withdrawal date for the course. Students who are in a failing status because of non-attendance but return to the course prior to the withdrawal date may elect to withdraw from the course.\n\nA grade of \"W\" indicates that a student has elected to withdrawal from a course prior to the course's withdraw deadline. It is not calculated in the student's grade point average, which would keep the student from facing possible academic disciplinary action if he or she was to fall below the required Standards of Academic Progress (SAP). For students receiving financial aid, a grade of \"W\" may require the student to refund to the College all or part of his or her aid. Some schools indicate whether the student was passing or failing the course at the time of withdrawal by placing WP or WF grades on the transcript; policies vary as to whether a WF counts as an unsatisfactory grade when determining if a student is in good standing.\n\nStandards for Academic Progress in Florida, for example, require a student to maintain a grade point average of 2.00 on the 4.00 scale. The student must also successfully complete 67% of the courses attempted, which includes previous failures, re-takes, and withdrawals. Additionally, a student may not attempt a course more than three (3) times.\n\nStudents may elect to audit a college credit course or workforce credit course by completing the audit form. Students may not change from credit to audit or from audit to credit after the drop deadline. A grade of 'X' will be assigned for all courses taken in audit status.\n\nNo credit will be awarded and fees for college credit courses taken on an audit basis are the same as those taken on a college credit or workforce credit basis.\n\nCourses taken for audit do not count as hours enrolled in the following areas: veteran certification, financial aid awards, Social Security certification, international student enrollment requirements or early admission program enrollment requirements.\n\nStandards of Academic Progress are the standards set by the school, state, Board of Education, or other agency which are required of students to adhere to in order to continue to attend classes. A student who falls below the SAP may have disciplinary action taken against him or her or denial of financial aid until the student has met the required SAP. In Florida, Standards of Academic Progress require a student to maintain a grade point average of 2.00 or above on the 4.00 numeric grading scale. The student must also finish 67% of the courses attempted, which includes previous failures, re-takes, and withdrawals. Additionally, a student may not attempt a course more than three (3) times.\n"}

In 1769, Aymar Joseph de Roquefeuil, commandant of the Brest fleet, obtained permission for its re-establishment from Louis XV and from Choiseul-Praslin, Secretary of State for the Navy. The Academy was linked to the Académie des sciences by an edict of 1771, but was finally suppressed by the National Convention on 8 August 1793 at the same time as all the other academies.

Her first book, \"Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club\" (University of Chicago Press 1994), examines the Japanese corporate practice of entertaining white-collar, male workers in the sexualized atmosphere of hostess clubs.\n\nHer second book, \"Permitted and Prohibited Desires: Mothers, Comics, and Censorship in Japan\" (Westview-HarperCollins 1996, reissued by University of California Press 2000) studies the intersection of motherhood, productivity, and mass-produced fantasies in contemporary Japan through essays on lunch-boxes, comics, censorship, and stories of mother-son incest.\n\nAllison's third book, \"Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination\" (California, 2006), analyzes the interplay of fantasy, capitalism, and cultural politics in the rise of \"J-cool\" (Japan's brand of \"cool\" youth goods) on the global marketplace.

Until the collapse of Japan's economic bubble in 1991, lifelong employment and a secure income were within reach of most Japanese men, enabling them to maintain their families in a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Now, as fewer and fewer people are able to find full-time work, hope turns to hopelessness and security gives way to a pervasive unease. Yet some Japanese are getting by, partly by reconceiving notions of home, family, and togetherness.\n\nAllison was a leading faculty figure during the Duke lacrosse case She is noted for being among the “Group of 88” Duke professors and faculty who published an ad condemning the Duke lacrosse team, three of whose members were accused of rape but ultimately found innocent.

ASUE was founded in 1930 and it is one of the biggest educational institutions of the South Caucasus. ASUE has 14 faculties, where 16 thousand students get education, and it offers master programs in 57 specialties, employing more than 1000 teachers, including 62 professors and 344 docents, among whom there are active members of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, New York Academy of Sciences, winners of state awards, honored teachers and scientists. ASUE is a full member of the European University Association, Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World, University Council of Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and Eurasian Association of Universities. There are 650 undergraduate and postgraduate students from 10 countries of the world getting education at ASUE.\n\nIn 2007 a Library and Information Center and a student career center started functioning at ASUE and also a new 7 floor educational building that meets the highest international standards was opened. The same year ASUE received the “European quality” award and the European Club of Rectors and European University Association. \n\nThe strategic direction of ASUE development was to bring the educational process up to the international standards by 2010, finishing the international accreditation process and ensuring full compliance with Bologna Process, as well as more active participation in the international market of educational services. Currently the university is chaired by rector professor Adalat Muradov and five vice rectors .\n\nOriginally a part of Baku State University, it became a separate, independent institution in 1934. Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions. On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute. In 1933, the government of Azerbaijan SSR changed the name to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after Karl Marx\" (similar to the naming of the Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance. In 1936 the name was tweaked to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx\". With the onset of World War II, ASEU was folded into Baku State University's Department of Economics. By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute. It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.\n\nIn 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade. In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.\n\nThe Derbent branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by Heydar Aliyev. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the Republic of Dagestan of the Russian Federation was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:\n\n\nAlong with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university - so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges. \n\nUnder the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan - Zagatala. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:\n\n\nThe first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan. \n\nThe Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities. \n\nThus, ASUE cooperates with the Siegen University of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled \"Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan\" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019. \n\nASEU was declared the winner of the TEMPUS IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called \"Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations\". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the European Commission. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized. Closing ceremony was attended by such personalities as the rector of ASUE Adalat Muradov, head of the office of the national program Erasmus+ Azerbaijan Parviz Bagirov, representative of the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Yashar Omarov, UK University of Warwick Fellow James Kennedy, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Programs ASUE Shahin Bayramov and as well as representatives of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\n\nIn 2015, for the first time in Azerbaijan, ASUE joined the International Program of the London University - the London School of Economics (LSE). Within the framework of this program, ASUE students receive education both in accordance with the curriculum of ASUE and in the curriculum of the London School of Economics. Students are provided with all the necessary materials and benefits, and upon completion of the training the students of this program receive two diplomas.\n\nIn addition to the London School of Economics and Politics, students can receive a second diploma from the French University of Montpellier in 2016. This can be done in two ways: students can go to the University of Montpellier from the third year to continue their studies for a year there, or continue their studies at ASUE, but according to the curricula of Montpellier. In both cases, students receive accreditation and a second diploma from the University of Montpellier. \n\n2006 - Azerbaijan State University of Economics was awarded the \"Golden Fortune\" prize, which was held by the International Academy of Rating Technologies and Sociology. The university participated under the nomination \"Rating of popularity\". The award was given for the creation of a new model of economic education in the territory of the CIS. Before, ASUE received the \"Silver Fortune\" award in 2002. \n\n2006 - ASUE was nominated for the National Award \"Uğur\". The prize was awarded for the fact that the university contributed to the development and advancement of science, as well as to the development of national cadres. \n\n2007 - The University received the \"University of the Year\" award, which was held at the national level. \n\n2007 - ASUE was awarded the “Intellect – 2007” Prize for the creation of the project of the Information and Library Center in ASUE. \n\n2008 - At the conference held in Ankara, ASEU received an award for the contribution and development of the Turkic world and culture.\n\n2009 - The International Academy of Professionals, which was established in Kiev in 1996, awarded the \"Golden Medal\" to the Azerbaijan State Economic University for merits in the scientific sphere and training of personnel. \n\n2009 - The \"Child of Motherland\" award and the \"Dada Gorgud\" medal were awarded to the university rector for the fact that the University made a contribution to the development of Azerbaijan, from both economic and social sides. The award was presented by the Supreme Council of the Dada Gorgud Foundation. \n\n2010 - Within the framework of the international image program \"Millennium Award\" ASUE received three awards - a diploma, a cup and an order for the fact that the university used modern educational technologies and introduced innovations in the educational system. \n\n2015 - The University was awarded the certificate \"Best Performance\" for the best presentation at the 9th Azerbaijan International Education and Career Exhibition. This is the only university that received the certificate \"Best Performance\" at the exhibition, which was attended by more than 130 institutions of higher education from 16 countries. \n\n2015 - Business School ASUE was recognized as a full member of the Accreditation of the Business School of the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) for the first time in Azerbaijan. \n\n2016 - ASEU retained its leadership among universities in Azerbaijan in accordance with the list identified by the rankings of the world's higher education institutions \"The Ranking Web\" and \"Webometrics\". \n\n2016 - According to the latest results of 2016, introduced by uniRank, which determines the popularity of the world universities on the Internet, UNEC was the first among universities in Azerbaijan. \n\n\n\nKurban Said's landmark novel, \"Ali and Nino\", opens in a classroom in the Economics University building in Baku.

The organization was founded in 1989. A Canadian organization, also called \"Cable in the Classroom\" (\"La câblo-éducation\" in French), was founded in 1995, and held the same scope as the US organization.\n\nCable stations broadcast educational television programs at specific times (usually early in the morning) commercial-free and notified Cable in the Classroom as to when the shows would air, which maintained a master list for educators to reference. This way, educators were able to record the programs for free and use them in school as learning tools for children. Copyrights were cleared so that educators could use the content of the listed programs as they wished for their syllabi and learning plans.\n\nOver the years however, many networks discontinued any effort at promoting Cable in the Classroom or setting aside programming for the organization's purposes, ceding more to direct marketing of their educational television programming to teachers and school districts via their home video departments, their Internet sites, or in the cases of networks such as ABC Family, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network, removing their involvement altogether, commensurate with the Internet ending other cable services tied to traditional scheduling such as \"near video on demand\". Another factor was likely the decline in VHS recorders, as DVRs with non-portable storage became the recording format of choice over DVD recorders, the equivalent successor to VCRs. Streaming video also played a factor in the reduction of Cable in the Classroom, as educators can now access and play content at any time via computers connected to in-classroom televisions and video projectors rather than on a set schedule.\n\nIn 2014, Cable in the Classroom was entirely discontinued in the United States with \"CNN Student News\" the only program left under the effort, and the NCTA redirected the former Cable in the Classroom portal to promote their \"Cable Impacts Foundation\" charity arm instead.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3166154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3166154", "title": "Do not feed the animals", "text": "Do not feed the animals\n\nThe prohibition \"do not feed the animals\" reflects a policy forbidding the artificial feeding of wildlife (wild or feral animals) in situations where the animals, or the people doing the feeding, might be harmed. Signs displaying this message are commonly found in zoos, circuses, animal theme parks, aquariums, national parks, parks, public spaces, farms, and other places where people come into contact with wildlife. In some cases there are laws to enforce such no-feeding policies. However, some people (such as some of those who enjoy feeding pigeons in cities) openly and strongly oppose such laws claiming that animals such as pigeons can be an amenity for people who do not have company such as friends or family, and say that the laws prohibiting feeding animals in urban places must change. In some countries, such as Greece, feeding the pigeons in cities is a widespread practice. Cultural hostility to feeding animals in cities and laws that ban the practice raise concerns about how humans relate to other living beings in the urban environment. Politicians have also protested laws that ban feeding feral pigeons in cities. Feral pigeons in cities existed for thousands of years but only recently in some countries humans started seeing them as a nuisance and became hostile to them. In India, feeding feral animals in cities is considered a noble act. Academicians say that how humans treat animals is related to how humans treat each other and thus raise concerns about the cultural shift from seeing feral city pigeons as harmless in the 1800s to seeing them a undesirable in some countries in the 2000s.\nIn zoos, giving food to the animals is discouraged due to the strict dietary controls in place. More generally, artificial feeding can result in, for example, vitamin deficiencies and dietary mineral deficiencies. Another motivation is the concern that animals will become accustomed to ingesting foreign objects and might later ingest something harmful. Outside zoos, a concern is that the increase in local concentrated wildlife population due to artificial feeding can promote the transfer of disease among animals or between animals and humans. Feeding can also alter animal behavior so that animals routinely travel in larger groups, which can make disease transmission between animals more likely. In public spaces, the congregation of animals caused by feeding can result in them being considered pests. Artificial feeding can also lead to animals aggressively seeking out food from people, sometimes resulting in injury.\n\nZoos generally discourage visitors from giving any food to the animals. Some zoos, particularly petting zoos, do the opposite and actively encourage people to get involved with the feeding of the animals. This, however, is strictly monitored and usually involves set food available from the zookeepers or vending machines, as well as a careful choice of which animals to feed, and the provision of hand-washing facilities to avoid spreading disease. Domestic animals such as sheep and goats are often permitted to be fed, as are giraffes.\n\nIn national parks and state parks, feeding animals can result in malnourishment due to inappropriate diet and in disruption of natural hunting or food-gathering behavior. It can also be dangerous to the people doing the feeding.\n\nIn the US, early 20th century park management actually encouraged animal feeding. For example, \"the feeding of squirrels had been seen as a way to civilize the parks and rechannel the energies of young boys from aggression and vandalism toward compassion and charity.\" Park rangers once fed bears in front of crowds of tourists. However, with a greater awareness of ecological and other issues, such pro-feeding policies are now viewed as detrimental, and US national parks now actively discourage animal feeding. \n\nIn Canadian national parks, it is illegal to disturb or feed wildlife, and Parks Canada advises visitors not to leave out \"food attractants\" such as dirty dishes. Ironically, the \"it is unlawful to feed animals\" signs may themselves become food attractants for porcupines. Road salt and roadkill may also act as food attractants, and removing roadkill is considered good park management.\n\nTourism operators often provide food to attract marine wildlife such as sharks to areas where they can be more easily viewed. Such a practice is controversial, however, because it can create a dependency on artificial feeding, habituate animals to feeding locations, increase inter-species and intra-species aggression, and increase the spread of disease. In Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, shark feeding is prohibited. In Hawaiian waters, shark feeding is permitted only in connection with traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious activities.\n\nThe feeding of wild dolphins for tourist purposes is also controversial, and is prohibited in the US because it can alter natural hunting behaviour, disrupt social interaction, encourage the dolphins to approach or ingest dangerous objects, and endanger the person doing the feeding. At Monkey Mia in Western Australia, dolphin feeding is permitted under Department of Environment and Conservation supervision.\n\nSimilar issues to those in national and state parks also apply in suburban and rural backyards. Artificial feeding of coyotes, deer, and other wildlife is discouraged. Feeding deer, for example, may contribute to the spread of bovine tuberculosis. The feeding of birds with bird feeders is an exception, at least in the US, even though it can sometimes contribute to spreading disease. In Australia, artificial bird feeding is viewed more negatively. Instead, growing native plants that can act as a natural food source for birds is recommended. Similar suggestions have been made in the US.\n\nFeral pigeons are often found in urban public spaces. They are often considered environmental pests, and can transmit diseases such as psittacosis. Deliberate feeding of feral pigeons, though popular, contributes to these problems.\n\nDucks are also commonly fed in public spaces. In one US study, 67% of people visiting urban parks did so to feed ducks. However, such feeding may contribute to water pollution and to over-population of the birds, as well as delaying winter migration to an extent that may be dangerous for the birds. Feeding foods such as white bread to ducks and geese can result in bone deformities. Like pigeons, ducks may also congregate in large numbers where feeding takes place, resulting in aggression towards humans who don't have food to hand as well as towards other individuals in the group. Ducks can also be messy animals, and the cleanup of an area where they congregate is time consuming.\n\n"}

Austrian-American architect, theoretician, theater designer, artist and sculptor.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1909, Kiesler studied at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna. From 1910–12, he attended painting and printmaking classes at the Akademie der bildenden Künste, both in Vienna. In July 1913, Kiesler quit the academy without having earned a diploma.\n\nHe married Stefanie (Stefi) Frischer (1896–1963) in 1920, and they moved to New York City in 1926, where he lived until his death. Kiesler collaborated there early on with the Surrealists, and with Marcel Duchamp. His writing was extensive, and his theoretical work embraced two lengthy manifestos, the article \"Pseudo-Functionalism in Modern Architecture\" (\"Partisan Review\", July 1949) and the book \"Contemporary Art Applied to the Store and Its Display\" (New York: Brentano, 1930).\n\nStefi Kiesler died in September 1963. In 1964, the year before his death, Kiesler married Lillian Olinsey, his longtime secretary and confidante, as Stefi had advised him to do while she was still living. In May 1965, he traveled to Jerusalem for the inauguration of the Shrine of the Book; seven months later he died in New York City.\n\nKiesler was productive as a theater and art-exhibition designer in the 1920s in Vienna and Berlin. In 1920, he started a brief collaboration with architect Adolf Loos and, in 1923, became a member of the De Stijl group in 1923. Kiesler was friendly with many of the major figures of the European avant-garde, which may have influenced his heretical approach to artistic theories and practices.\n\nKiesler arranged the world premiere in Vienna on September 24, 1924, of the 16-minute film \"Ballet mécanique\", directed by Dudley Murphy and Fernand Léger, with Man Ray. In November 1975, Lillian Kiesler, Frederick's second wife, found Léger's original spliced 35mm, 16-minute version of the film in the closet of their week-end house in the Hamptons on Long Island, near New York City. This version, restored by Anthology Film Archives, has since been included in the documentary film compilation \"Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant-Garde Film 1893-1941\" (released as a seven-disc DVD set by Image Entertainment, October 2005). The music for the film was originally composed by George Antheil, who used it to create a separate concert piece, also named \"Ballet mécanique\", which premiered in Paris in 1926.\n\nHis architectural designs include the Film Guild Cinema (1929) in New York City and, with Armand Phillip Bartos, the Shrine of the Book (1965) in Jerusalem, Israel.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1943, Kiesler was the director of the Laboratory for Design Correlation within the Department of Architecture at Columbia University, where the study program was more pragmatic and commercially oriented than his deep, theoretical concepts and ideas, such as those about \"correalism\" or \"continuity,\" which concern the relationship among space, people, objects and concepts.\n\nFor his object designs, such as the biomorphic furniture in his Abstract Gallery room of Peggy Guggenheim’s \"The Art of This Century Gallery\" art salon (1942), for example. For it, he sought to dissolve the visual, real, image, and environment into a free-flowing space. He likewise pursued this approach with his “Endless House,” exhibited in maquette form in 1958–59 at The Museum of Modern Art. The project stemmed from his shop-window displays of the 1920s and his Film Guild Cinema in New York City, mentioned above. Pursuing display and art-gallery work, he was a window designer for Saks Fifth Avenue from 1928 to 1930. Earlier in his career in Europe, Kiesler invented the 1924 L+T (Leger und Trager) radical hanging system for galleries and museums.\n\nHis unorthodox architectural drawings and plans that he called \"polydimensional\" were somewhat akin to Surrealist automatic drawings.\n\nHe designed some intriguing furniture, a few pieces of which were featured in the yearbook of the short-lived American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen (AUDAC); he was a founding member of the organization in 1930. Some models of the furniture — none of which was reproduced in numbers as intended — have been posthumously manufactured in limited quantities by various firms in Europe since 1990. The most popular has been the cast-aluminum \"Two-Part Nesting Table\" (1935).\n\nDuring the 1950s, Kiesler created a series of paintings called \"Galaxies\", which translated his vision of space into multi-paneled installations that protruded from the wall. Combining painting, sculpture and drawing, the \"Galaxies\" were presented as grouped units. To Kiesler, the space between the different parts was just as important as the paintings themselves, marking a reflection of the “inner necessity” of the work as a whole. He noted that it was the same as what “breathing is to our body reality.” Kiesler wrote further:\n\nThese multi-paneled paintings were also sparked by the artist's response to the political and social upheaval of his time. Conceived only a few years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Kiesler described his inspiration for the \"Galaxies\" as follows:\n\nKiesler’s body of sculptural works also incorporate similar philosophies, uniting individual pieces with specific placements, further illustrating his theories of human-design relationships. His installation of \"Us, You, Me\" (completed 1963-65), included pieces in bronze, aluminum, wood, granite, and concrete in various sizes, and was shown at Hunter College/Times Square Gallery (2004), The Parrish Art Museum (2003), and the University of Iowa Museum of Art (1995). The idea of sculpture as a landscape in \"Us, You, Me\" reflects upon Kiesler’s history with stage design, and the subject matters marking underlying anxieties of modern life. Kiesler’s final sculpture \"Bucephalus\", inspired by Alexander the Great’s battle horse, was to be entered by the viewer and used as a grotto for meditation. The sculpture was conceived in concrete and mesh by Kiesler and his assistant, Len Pitkowsky, between 1962-1965 and was posthumously cast in aluminum at the Polich Tallix Foundry, Rock Tavern, New York by Jason McCoy Gallery with the help of Len Pitkowsky between 2006-2008.\n\nKiesler was often shunned by his peers, although he was chosen in 1952 as one of \"the 15 leading artists at mid-century\" by The Museum of Modern Art and in 1957 became a fellow of the Graham Foundation in Chicago. Israeli architects disapproved of his and Bartos's serving as the architects for the Shrine of the Book (1957–65) because they were not Israelis, even though they were Jews. Further objections to Kiesler were that he had not completed his architecture studies and had built no structures, despite having been a licensed architect in New York State since 1930. One of his colleagues at Columbia University joked: \"If Kiesler wants to hold two pieces of wood together, he pretends he's never heard of nails or screws. He tests the tensile strengths of various metal alloys, experiments with different methods and shapes, and after six months comes up with a very expensive device that holds two pieces of wood together almost as well as a screw\".\n\nThe Austrian Frederick and Lillian Kiesler Private Foundation was established in 1997 in Vienna and biennially grants the Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for Architecture and the Arts. Recipients include Hani Rashid, Lise Anne Couture, Andrés Jaque, Toyo Ito, Andrea Zittel, and Judith Barry.\n\n\nThe Estate of Frederick Kiesler is represented by Jason McCoy Gallery, New York. <br>\nThe Austrian Frederick and Lillian Kiesler Private Foundation\n\n\n"}

After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \"the Proms\".\n\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\" in 1892.\n\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.\n\nWood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, \"née\" Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \"the musicians' church\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola.\nWood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.\n\nAfter taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of Manuel Garcia's singing class, but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly influenced by Garcia. Wood also accompanied the opera class, taught by Garcia's son Gustave. Wood's ambition at the time was to become a teacher of singing, and he gave singing lessons throughout his life. He attended the classes of as many singing teachers as he could, although by his own account, \"I possess a terrible voice. Garcia said it would go through a brick wall. In fact, a real conductor's voice.\"\n\nOn leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful, attracting \"more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with\" at half a guinea an hour. He also worked as a répétiteur. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for Richard D'Oyly Carte during the rehearsals for the first production of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" at the Savoy Theatre in 1888. His biographer Arthur Jacobs doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with Sir Arthur Sullivan about the score. Jacobs describes Wood's memoirs as \"vivacious in style but factually unreliable\".\nIt is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte's Royal English Opera House for Sullivan's grand opera \"Ivanhoe\" in late 1890 and early 1891, and for André Messager's \"La Basoche\" in 1891–92. He also worked for Carte at the Savoy as assistant to François Cellier on \"The Nautch Girl\" in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an oratorio, \"St. Dorothea\" (1889), a light opera, \"Daisy\" (1890), and a one-act comic opera, \"Returning the Compliment\" (1890).\n\nWood recalled that his first professional appearance as a conductor was at a choral concert in December 1887. Ad hoc engagements of this kind were commonplace for organists, but they brought little prestige such as was given to British conductor-composers such as Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and Alexander Mackenzie, or the rising generation of German star conductors led by Hans Richter and Arthur Nikisch. His first sustained work as a conductor was his 1889 appointment as musical director of a small touring opera ensemble, the Arthur Rouseby English Touring Opera. The company was not of a high standard, with an orchestra of only six players augmented by local recruits at each tour venue. Wood eventually negotiated a release from his contract, and after a brief return to teaching he secured a better appointment as conductor for the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1891. For that company he conducted \"Carmen\", \"The Bohemian Girl\", \"The Daughter of the Regiment\", \"Maritana\", and \"Il trovatore\". This appointment was followed by a similar engagement with a company set up by former Carl Rosa singers.\n\nWhen Signor Lago, formerly impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. Petersburg, was looking for a second conductor to work with Luigi Arditi for a proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood. The season opened at the newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\". At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews. The work was not popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, leaving the company unpaid. Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted performances of \"Maritana\" and rehearsed \"Oberon\" and \"Der Freischütz\". After the collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once more to his singing tuition. With the exception of a season at the Opera Comique in 1896, Wood's subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.\n\nIn 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\"\n\nNewman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.\n\nNewman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard \"diapason normal\". Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.\n\nOn 10 August 1895, the first of the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts took place. Among those present who later recalled the opening was the singer Agnes Nicholls:\n\nJust before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his position behind the curtain at the end of the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem ... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the \"Rienzi\" Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.\n\nThe rest of the programme comprised, in the words of an historian of the Proms, David Cox, \"for the most part ... blatant trivialities.\" Within days, however, Wood was shifting the balance from light music to mainstream classical works, with Schubert's Unfinished Symphony and further excerpts from Wagner operas. Among the other symphonies Wood conducted during the first season were Schubert's \"Great C Major\", Mendelssohn's \"Italian\" and Schumann's Fourth. The concertos included Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto and Schumann's Piano Concerto. During the season Wood presented 23 novelties, including the London premieres of pieces by Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov, Massenet and Rimsky-Korsakov. Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night to Beethoven, a pattern that endured for decades.\n\nThe income from the concerts did not permit generous rehearsal time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that \"if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong.\" The violist Bernard Shore wrote, \"You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with \"that\" stick in front of you\". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story by one of his players who recalled that Wood \"had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10 a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time.\"\n\nAnother feature of Wood's conducting was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check the instrument of each member of the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.\nBetween the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera \"Shamus O'Brien\" at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\"\n\nIn 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.\n\nThe promenade concerts flourished through the 1890s, but in 1902 Newman, who had been investing unwisely in theatrical presentations, found himself unable to bear the financial responsibility for the Queen's Hall Orchestra and was declared bankrupt. The concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir Edgar Speyer, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, retained Newman as manager of the concerts, and encouraged him and Wood to continue with their project of improving the public's taste. At the beginning of 1902, Wood accepted the conductorship of that year's Sheffield triennial festival. He continued to be associated with that festival until 1936, changing its emphasis from choral to orchestral pieces. A German critic, reviewing the festival for a Berlin publication, wrote, \"Two personalities now represent a new epoch in English musical life – Edward Elgar as composer, and Henry J. Wood as conductor.\" Later in the year, overtaxed by his enormous workload, Wood's health broke down. Even though this was during the Proms season, Cathcart insisted that Wood should have a complete break and change of scene. Leaving the leader of the orchestra, Arthur Payne, to conduct during his absence, Wood and his wife took a cruise to Morocco, missing the Proms concerts from 13 October to 8 November.\n\nIn the early years of the Proms there were complaints in some musical journals that Wood was neglecting British music. In 1899 Newman unsuccessfully attempted to secure for Wood the premiere of Elgar's \"Enigma Variations\", but in the same year Newman passed up the opportunity to introduce the music of Delius to London concertgoers. By the end of the first decade of the new century, however, Wood's reputation in conducting British music was in no doubt; he gave the world, British or London premieres of more than a hundred British works between 1900 and 1910. Meanwhile, he introduced his audiences to many European composers. In the 1903 season, he programmed symphonies by Bruckner (No. 7), Sibelius (No. 1), and Mahler (No. 1). In the same year, he introduced several of Richard Strauss's tone poems to London, and in 1905 he gave Strauss's \"Symphonia Domestica\". This prompted the composer to write, \"I cannot leave London without an expression of admiration for the splendid Orchestra which Henry Wood's master hand has created in such a short time.\"\n\nCreating the orchestra admired by Strauss had not been achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: \"A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.\" After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: \"Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning.\" Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony Orchestra. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct the orchestra.\n\nWood had great sympathy for rank-and-file orchestral players and strove for improvements in their pay. He sought to raise their status and was the first British conductor to insist that the orchestra should stand to acknowledge applause along with the conductor. He introduced women into the Queen's Hall Orchestra in 1913. He said, \"I do not like ladies playing the trombone or double bass, but they can play the violin, and they do.\" By 1918 Wood had 14 women in his orchestra.\n\nWood conducted his own compositions and arrangements from time to time. He gave his \"Fantasia on Welsh Melodies\" and \"Fantasia on Scottish Melodies\" on successive nights in 1909. He composed the work for which he is most celebrated, \"Fantasia on British Sea Songs\", for a concert in 1905, celebrating the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. It caught the public fancy immediately, with its mixture of sea-shanties, together with Handel's \"See the Conquering Hero Comes\" and Arne's \"Rule, Britannia!\". He played it at the Proms more than 40 times, and it became a fixture at the \"Last Night of the Proms\", the lively concert marking the end of each season. It remained so under his successors, though often rearranged, notably by Sir Malcolm Sargent. A highlight of the Fantasia is the hornpipe (\"Jack's the Lad\"); Wood said of it:\n\nThey stamp their feet in time to the hornpipe – that is until I whip up the orchestra to a fierce \"accelerando\" which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.\n\nAmong Wood's other works was his \"Purcell Suite\", incorporating themes from Purcell's stage works and string sonatas, which Wood performed at an orchestral festival in Zurich in 1921, and orchestral transcriptions of works by a range of composers from Albéniz to Vivaldi.\n\nWood worked with his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at her recitals. In 1906, at the Norwich music festival he presented Beethoven's Choral Symphony and Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\", with his wife among the singers. In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died. Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss. On his return, Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga's death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics. In June 1911, he married his secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex (1882–1967), with whom he had two daughters. In the same year he accepted a knighthood, and declined the conductorship of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in succession to Mahler, as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.\n\nThroughout the early part of the century, Wood was influential in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in \"The Manchester Guardian\", which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).\nThe 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the finest of this part of Wood's career. Among those conducting their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's \"Five Pieces for Orchestra\" also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, \"Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time\". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: \"It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London.\" However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: \"I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands.\"\n\nOn the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned. They had by this time become an established institution, and it was agreed to go ahead. However, anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the US, and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts. Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be played as planned: \"The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour.\" When Speyer left Britain, the music publishers Chappell's took on the responsibility for the Queen's Hall and its orchestra. The Proms continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by Bartók, Stravinsky and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote, \"Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the 'All Clear' between air raids. Falling bombs, shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening. But [Wood] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale.\"\n\nTowards the end of the war, Wood received an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, as he told Boult, \"it was hard to refuse, but I felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment.\"\nAfter the war, the Proms continued much as before. The second halves of concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over sponsorship of the Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, most of which were not profitable.\n\nIn 1921 Wood was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first English conductor to receive the honour. By now he was beginning to find his position as Britain's leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals. Thomas Beecham had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs. Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, always admired and respected Wood. Other younger conductors included men who had been members of Wood's orchestra, including Basil Cameron and Eugene Goossens. Another protégé of Wood was Malcolm Sargent, who appeared at the Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922. Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting. Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts.\n\nIn 1925 Wood was invited to conduct four concerts for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. Such was their success, both artistic and financial, that Wood was invited back, and conducted again the following year. In addition to a large number of English pieces, Wood programmed works by composers as diverse as Bach and Stravinsky. He again conducted there in 1934.\n\nOn his return to England from his first Hollywood trip, Wood found himself in the middle of a feud between the chairman of Chappell's, William Boosey, and the BBC. Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of music, fearing that it would lead to the end of live concerts. He attempted to prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen's Hall from broadcasting for the BBC. This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the Proms. The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926. Shortly afterwards, Boosey announced that Chappell's would no longer support concerts at the Queen's Hall. The prospect that the Proms might not be able to continue caused widespread dismay, and there was a general welcome for the BBC's announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms, and would also run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen's Hall.\nThe BBC regime brought immediate benefits. The use of the second half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.\n\nIn 1929, Wood played a celebrated practical joke on musicologists and critics. \"I got \"very fed up with them\", always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.\", and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\", as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood's later account, the press and the BBC \"fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and \"asked for\".\" Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. The press treated the deception as a great joke; \"The Times\" entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.\n\nAs Wood's working life took a turn for the better, his domestic life started to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most of Wood's money and, for much of the time, living abroad. She refused to divorce him. The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters. In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood's players recalled, \"She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie got him a new evening suit, instead of the mouldy green one, and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human.\" As Wood was not free to remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to \"Lady Jessie Wood\" and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood's wife. In his memoirs, Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship.\n\nIn his later years, Wood came to be identified with the Proms rather than with the year-round concert season. Boult was appointed director of music at the BBC in 1930. In that capacity he strove to ensure that Wood was invited to conduct a fitting number of BBC symphony concerts outside the Prom season. The BBC chose Wood for important collaborations with Bartók and Paul Hindemith, and for the first British performance of Mahler's vast Symphony No. 8. But Jacobs notes that, in the general concert repertory, Wood now had to compete against well-known foreign conductors such as Bruno Walter, Willem Mengelberg, and Arturo Toscanini, \"in comparison with whom he was increasingly seen as a workhorse\".\n\nIn 1936, Wood was in charge of his final Sheffield festival. The choral works he conducted included the Verdi \"Requiem\", Beethoven's \"Missa Solemnis\", Berlioz' \"Te Deum\", Walton's \"Belshazzar's Feast\", and, in the presence of the composer, Rachmaninoff's \"The Bells\". The following year, Wood began planning for a grand concert to mark his fiftieth year as a conductor. The Royal Albert Hall was chosen as the venue, having a far larger capacity than the Queen's Hall. The concert was given on 5 October 1938. Rachmaninoff played the solo part in his Second Piano Concerto, and Vaughan Williams, at Wood's request, composed a short choral work for the occasion: the \"Serenade to Music\" for orchestra and 16 soloists. The other composers represented in the programme were Sullivan, Beethoven, Bach, Bax, Wagner, Handel and Elgar. The orchestra comprised players from the three London orchestras: the London Symphony, London Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras. The concert raised £9,000 for Wood's chosen charity, providing health care for musicians. In the same year, Wood published his autobiography, \"My Life of Music\".\nIn September 1939, the Second World War broke out and the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less susceptible to bombing. Its musical activities, including the orchestra, moved to Bristol. The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen's Hall to close. The last Prom given at the Queen's Hall was on 7 September 1940. In May 1941, the hall was destroyed by bombs.\n\nIt was immediately agreed that the 1941 season of Proms should be held at the Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.\n\nDespite his age and the difficulties of wartime travel, Wood insisted on going to provincial cities to conduct – as much, according to Jacobs, to help the local orchestras survive as to gratify audiences. His final season was in 1944. The season began well with Wood in good form, but after three weeks raids by the devastating new German flying bombs caused the government to order the closure of places of entertainment. The Proms were immediately relocated to Bedford some away, where Wood continued to conduct. He was taken ill in early August and was unable to conduct the fiftieth anniversary Prom on 10 August; he was forbidden by his doctor even to listen to its broadcast. Wood died just over a week later on 19 August at Hitchin Hospital in Hitchin, Hertfordshire; his funeral service was held in the town at St Mary's church, and his ashes were interred in the Musicians' Chapel of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.\n\nWood's recording career began in 1908, when he accompanied his wife Olga in \"Farewell, forests\" by Tchaikovsky, for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company, better known as His Master's Voice or HMV. They made eight other records together for HMV over the next two years. After Olga's death, Wood signed a contract with HMV's rival, Columbia, for whom he made a series of discs between 1915 and 1917 with the singer Clara Butt, including excerpts from Elgar's \"The Dream of Gerontius\". Between 1915 and 1925 he conducted 65 recordings for Columbia using the early acoustic recording process, including many discs of Wagner excerpts and a truncated version of Elgar's Violin Concerto with Albert Sammons as soloist. When the microphone and electrical recording were introduced in 1925, Wood re-recorded the Elgar concerto, with Sammons, and made 36 other discs for Columbia over the next nine years. The 1929 recording of the Elgar concerto has been reissued on compact disc and is well regarded by some critics.\n\nWood was wooed from Columbia by the young Decca company in 1935. For Decca he conducted 23 recordings over the next two years, including Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Elgar's \"Enigma Variations\" and Vaughan Williams's \"A London Symphony\". In 1938 he returned to Columbia, for whom his five new recordings included the \"Serenade to Music\" with the 16 original singers, a few days after the premiere, and his own \"Fantasia on British Sea Songs\".\n\nWood's recordings did not remain in the catalogues long after his death. \"The Record Guide\", 1956, lists none of his records. A few of his recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.\n\nIn Jacobs's 1994 biography, the list of premieres conducted by Wood extends to 18 pages. His world premieres included Frank Bridge's \"The Sea\"; Britten's Piano Concerto; Delius's \"A Song Before Sunrise\", \"A Song of Summer\", and \"Idyll\"; Elgar's \"The Wand of Youth\" Suite No. 1, \"Sospiri\" and the 4th and 5th Pomp and Circumstance Marches; and Vaughan Williams's \"Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1\", \"Flos Campi\" and \"Serenade to Music\".\n\nWood's UK premieres included Bartók's \"Dance Suite\"; Chabrier's \"Joyeuse marche\"; Copland's \"Billy the Kid\"; Debussy's \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\" and \"Ibéria\"; Hindemith's \"Kammermusik\" 2 and 5; Janáček's Sinfonietta, \"Taras Bulba\" and Glagolitic Mass; Kodály's \"Dances from Galanta\"; Mahler's Symphonies Nos. 4, 7 and 8, and \"Das Lied von der Erde\"; Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Violin Concerto No. 2; Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No 1; Ravel's \"Ma mère l'oye\", \"Rapsodie espagnole\", \"La valse\" and Piano Concerto in D; Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Capriccio Espagnol\", \"Scheherazade\", and Symphony No. 2; Saint-Saëns's \"The Carnival of the Animals\"; Schumann's Konzertstück for four horns and orchestra; Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Symphonies Nos. 7 and 8; Sibelius's Symphonies Nos. 1, 6 and 7, Violin Concerto, Karelia Suite, and \"Tapiola\"; Richard Strauss's \"Symphonia Domestica\"; Stravinsky's \"The Firebird\" (suite); Tchaikovsky's \"Manfred Symphony\" and \"Nutcracker Suite\"; and Webern's \"Passacaglia\".\n\nIn addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944, to the Order of the Crown (Belgium; 1920), and Officer of the Legion of Honour (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923).\nJacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams \"Serenade to Music\", works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The poet laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \"Sir Henry Wood\", often referred to by its first line, \"Where does the uttered music go?\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.\n\nWood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially \"the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\", but universally referred to by the informal short version.\n\nHis biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood:\n\nHis orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him \"Timber\" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too. His tally of first performances, or first performances in Britain, was heroic: at least 717 works by 357 composers. Greatness as measured by finesse of execution may not be his, particularly in his limited legacy of recordings, but he remains one of the most remarkable musicians Britain has produced.\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n"}

The publication of the book by David Lowenthal, \"The Past is a Foreign Country\", in 1985 is credited with creating the field (Carman & Sørensen 2009). While related to the disciplines of history, heritage conservation, and historic preservation, heritage studies is not necessarily concerned with the objective representation of the past. History is \"the raw facts of the past\" (Aitchison, MacLeod, & Shaw 2000, p. 96) while heritage \"is history processed through mythology, ideology, nationalism, local pride, romantic ideas or just plain marketing\" (Schouten 1995, p. 21). The meanings of heritage are therefore subjective and rooted in the present; these meanings are defined by social, cultural, and individual processes. In other words, the meanings of heritage can be understood through contemporary sociocultural and experiential values. Lowenthal (1985, p. 410) argues that in the realm of human experience, we create heritage; to most people, heritage is therefore more important than history and is a product of human invention and creativity.\n\n\n"}

Rockoff is a U.S.-American education economist and currently works as Professor of Finance and Economics at the Columbia Graduate School of Business. Rockoff's research interests include the economics of education and public finance. His research on the management of public schools has been awarded the 2016 George S. Eccles Research Award in Finance and Economics by Columbia Business School.\n\nJonah Rockoff earned a B.A. in economics from Amherst College in 1997, followed by a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 2004. Since his graduation, Rockoff has taught and researched at the Columbia Graduate School of Business, first as assistant professor (2004-07), then as associate professor (2008-16), and since 2016 as full professor. Rockoff is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research, Institute of Education Sciences, National Science Foundation, and the Smith Richardson Foundation. Moreover, he works as co-editor of the \"Journal of Public Economics\".\n\nJonah Rockoff's research focuses on teachers, in particular the measurement of teachers' impact, and public schools.\n\nRevolving themes in Rockoff's research on teachers are teachers' effectiveness and the recruitment and retention of effective teachers. For example, he estimates that increasing teacher quality by one standard deviation raises reading and math test scores by approximately 0.20 and 0.24 standard deviations, respectively, and reading scores are found to increase in teachers' experience. Similarly, together with Boyd, Loeb, Wyckoff and Lankford, Rockoff finds that the NYC Teaching Fellows and Teach for America initiatives were able to substantially reduce the gap between the average qualifications of teachers at New York City's low- and high-poverty schools by substituting uncertified teachers in high-pverty schools by academically qualified teachers. Together with Kane and Staiger, Rockoff has also studied how to recruit effective teachers. In particular, they find that—unlike teachers' performance in classrooms during the first two years—teacher certification poorly predicts teachers' future effectiveness, and that composite measures of teachers' cognitive and non-cognitive skills predict well teachers' effectiveness, though individual measures do not (with Brian Jacob). This research is complemented by work with Cecilia Speroni, wherein he principals' subjective evaluations of teacher effectiveness to be good predictors of teachers' objective effectiveness. Next to teacher recruitment, Rockoff's research on teacher retention has found that mentoring among NYC teachers has only a weak effect on teachers' turnover, absenteeism and their students' achievements, though there is some evidence that mentoring successfully improves school-specific knowledge and teaching skills. Overall, Rockoff's views on the recruitment, evaluation and retention of teachers in the U.S. are summarized in a \"JEP\" article with Staiger, wherein they highlight five empirical findings: (1) teachers' impact on student achievement vary strongly; (2) measures of teacher effectiveness based on student test scores are unreliable; (3) teachers' effectiveness increases degressively over their careers; (4) the main issue related to teacher turnover is the loss in student achievement as students are taught by less experienced teachers rather than the direct cost of hiring and firing teachers; and (5) identifying effective teachers at the time of recruitment—as opposed to based on their actual job performance—is very difficult. \n\nMore recently, Rockoff and his co-researchers Raj Chetty and John Friedman have researched better ways to measure the effectiveness of teachers, with a focus on the value added methodology. They find that value-added provides unbiased estimates of teachers' impacts on student achievement and that teachers with high value-added improve students' adulthood outcomes, with a one standard deviation increase in a teacher's value-added in a single grade corresponding to a 1% increase in earnings of her students' earnings by age 28.\n\nNext to his research on teachers, Rockoff has also studied public schools, the impact of sex offender registration, and the relationship between crime risk and property values. Together with Damon Clark and Paco Martorell, Rockoff finds scant evidence for a relationship between school performance and principals' education and work experience, though there is a benefit to having worked as assistant principal beforehand and students' test scores improve as principal experience increases, suggesting principal retention as an important policy issue. In his research with Caroline Hoxby on the impact of charter schools on student achievement, Rockoff finds that charter school attendance improves elementary school students' scores in math and reading by ca. six percentile point ranks. In work with Leigh Linden, Rockoff observes that house prices within 0.1 miles of a sex offender fall on average by 4%. Finally, in research with J.J. Prescott, Rockoff finds that both sex offender registration and notification reduce the frequency of reported sex offenses against local victims, though the former acts by keeping police informed about local sex offenders, whereas the latter deters non-registered offenders and actually may exacerbate recidivism.\n\n"}

{"id": "668100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=668100", "title": "Lesson", "text": "Lesson\n\nA lesson is a structured period of time where learning is intended to occur. It involves one or more students (also called pupils or learners in some circumstances) being taught by a teacher or instructor. A lesson may be either one section of a textbook (which, apart from the printed page, can also include multimedia) or, more frequently, a short period of time during which learners are taught about a particular subject or taught how to perform a particular activity. Lessons are generally taught in a classroom but may instead take place in a situated learning environment.\n\nIn a wider sense, a lesson is an insight gained by a learner into previously unfamiliar subject-matter. Such a lesson can be either planned or accidental, enjoyable or painful. The colloquial phrase \"to teach someone a lesson\", means to punish or scold a person for a mistake they have made in order to ensure that they do not make the same mistake again.\n\nLessons can also be made entertaining. When the term \"education\" is combined with \"entertainment\", the term \"edutainment\" is coined.\n\nThe potential format and speaks to one or more people in the same room or space. This may be supplemented with gestures and tools. A lesson may range from a lecture, to a demonstration, to a discussion or a blend of some of these common presentation methods.\n\nSome lessons may involve work by the student. Traditionally this might include reading and writing or creating something, perhaps when the instructor is not present. The student may work independently or collaborate with others.\n\nMore recent technologies have expanded the way a lesson can be delivered. For example: film strips, pre-recorded audio and video tapes, television programs and podcasts are some ways to deliver or add to a lesson. Distance education techniques such as video conferencing, or electronic learning in a virtual learning environment have allowed interactive lessons to be presented to students who may not be in the same physical location. These tools offer new synchronous, asynchronous and blended ways to deliver lessons.\n\nTeachers and instructors usually have a lesson plan which dictates the structure of the teaching. A group of lessons may be linked together in a unit plan, scheme, or work. The detail of the plan may vary with some being a simple list of what is going to be taught in a lesson with others working including much more detail, such as a time plan and the learning aims and objectives. Student teachers and beginning teachers are usually advised to put a great amount of detail into the written plan. This ensures that the plan will be cohesive, that all the components of a successful lesson are taken care of, and that one has a checklist to ensure that practicalities are taken care of (e.g., resources, scheduling, and classroom management considerations). Furthermore, beginning teachers are often advised to script some sections for themselves, such as questions they might ask the students in order to get a discussion going at the beginning of the lesson. The expectation is that the teachers can and should depart from the script when appropriate; improvisation is definitely encouraged and the fact of having written it out in advance ensures that an adequate amount of thought has been put into it ahead of time. Another reason for including a great amount of detail is that student teachers are often required to submit lesson plans in advance to their mentor teachers or professors in order to receive feedback on their ideas. When creating the lesson plan it is usual to look at the following:\n\nThe word \"lesson\" comes from Latin \"lectio\" \"the action of reading (out)\". From there, the word was also used for the text itself, very often a passage from the Bible read out during a religious service (\"first lesson\", \"second lesson\"). Finally, any portion of a book to be studied was referred to as a \"lesson\".\n\n"}

One of the perpetrators would be sent to two terms of life life imprisonment with no possibility of parole; a second individual would be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment plus 99 years for conspiracy to commit murder, while the third individual was sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole after 40 years.\n\nConflicting testimony delivered at two of the perpetrators' separate trials leads to ongoing speculation as to which of the trio actually shot and killed Heather.\n\nHeather Rose Rich (January 19, 1980October 3, 1996) was the third of four children and only daughter born to Gail and Duane Rich.\n\nHeather was an avid horse rider and a talented musician, and has been described by her family as \"a naive girl with a big heart.\" An academically successful sophomore who was popular with her peers at Waurika High School, she had a notably excitable personality.\n\nAccording to one of her friends, despite her façade of ebullience, Heather was a \"very troubled\" teenager, and she began to exhibit troublesome behavior both at home and at school in the late summer and early fall of 1996. Her classmate and former boyfriend, 17-year-old Randy Wood, would state this emotional behavior largely stemmed from Heather's restlessness at the fact Waurika held few amenities to entertain the town's youth. On September 27, she and another girl had been temporarily suspended from Waurika High School and the \"Waurika Eagles\" cheerleading team for their being noticeably drunk upon the sidelines of a school cheerleading performance. The duration of this suspension was just three days, and she was expecting to be a potential candidate to be the sophomore class homecoming queen of Waurika High School on October 11.\n\nAt approximately 11 p.m. on the evening of October 2, 1996, Heather left her home without her parents' knowledge to meet a 17-year-old Waurika High School senior named Joshua Bagwell in a trailer parked at the rear of the home of Bagwell's grandfather. Bagwell had already been drinking heavily with his friends, 19-year-old Curtis Gambill and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Wood. One of the trio had earlier telephoned Heather to suggest she join them at Bagwell's trailer that evening. Shortly after Heather arrived at the trailer, both Wood and Gambill left Heather and Bagwell alone for approximately one hour, believing that as this was their first date, the two wished to be left alone. When Wood and Gambill returned to the trailer approximately one hour later, both Bagwell and Heather were naked, and a bottle of gin had been half consumed. Heather was extremely drunk, later being described as largely insensible; Bagwell would later claim the two had engaged in consensual sex. According to Wood's later trial testimony, the three youths, themselves intoxicated, began goading each other to sexually assault Heather while she was naked and largely insensible.\n\nWood then proceeded to sexually assault Heather (digitally penetrating her) before Gambill himself engaged in unconsensual sex with the semi-conscious girl. Shortly after Gambill had engaged in sex with Heather, she partially roused out of her semi-conscious state and began began moaning, screaming and crying.\n\nReportedly fearing the girl would later accuse the trio of rape, Gambill then decided to kill Heather and, with a measure of force, successfully persuaded Bagwell and Wood to assist him in the commission of this act. According to Wood, Gambill pointed his shotgun at him and ordered him to dress Heather before he and Bagwell carried her into Bagwell's grandfather's pickup truck. Bagwell then began to drive in a seemingly aimless manner around southern Oklahoma for in excess of an hour as Gambill repeatedly exclaimed they would have to kill her before driving to desolate property his grandparents owned as a potential murder location. Gambill vetoed Bagwell's choice of a murder location, stating this location could easily be traced to the trio. Gambill then chose to drive the truck; driving towards a cement bridge upon a rural road in Belknap Creek, Texas.\n\nAt this location, Gambill retrieved his shotgun from the vehicle as he ordered Bagwell and Wood to \"get her out and put her on the side (of the road).\" Bagwell and Wood then carried Heather towards the bridge, where Gambill proceeded to shoot her several times in the head and torso with the shotgun as she lay upon the ground. Wood would later claim that he had sat inside the pickup truck as Gambill approached Heather with the shotgun in his hand; he had then covered his face with his hands before hearing \"the first shot ... then I heard a bunch more.\" He then climbed from the truck to observe Gambill appearing \"dazed at what he'd done.\" Joshua Bagwell then took one of Heather's shoelaces and used this item to secure a rock to weight her body.\n\nHeather's body was then thrown over the guard rail into the creek below before the trio attempted to conceal the extensive bloodstains at the precise murder scene by kicking and throwing soil across the ground.\n\nDiscovering that their daughter's bed had not been slept in and that all her possessions were untouched, yet that her bedroom window was open, Gail and Duane Rich reported Heather missing to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department the following day. Despite the fact Heather had not taken any of her personal possessions with her, when police learned from Gail that Heather had recently argued with her mother over a $300 phone bill for which she (Heather) had largely been responsible for the accrual, investigators initially assumed Heather had likely temporarily eloped from her household to stay with friends, and would likely return home within hours. Aghast, Gail responded: \"When your daughter is missing, you can stay at home!\" She and her family then began making their own inquiries around Waurika for information as to Heather's whereabouts. They would subsequently hire a private investigator to assist in the search for their daughter.\n\nHeather's body was discovered partially submerged in the Red River by a rancher and his daughter on October 10. Due to a combination of decomposition and the sheer number of shotgun wounds she had received, including the fact she had been shot once in the back of the head, her face and body were largely unrecognizable. Thus initially, her body was tentatively identified by her father via his recognizing a gold signet ring Heather had received as a present for her 16th birthday. Her body would later be officially identified via dental records\nThe autopsy of Heather's body revealed she had been shot nine times with an M-9 Winchester shotgun, with pellets from the buckshot rounds fired also hitting her body in several locations. One of these shots had been fired into the back of her head, with the remaining eight rounds being fired into her lower back, waist, pelvis and buttocks. In conjunction with the pattern of the bloodstains discovered at the preliminary crime scene, the trajectory of the shotgun wounds indicated Heather had most likely been shot as she lay face down, with her death being almost instantaneous.\n\nThe funeral of Heather Rich was conducted on Monday, October 14, 1996 at the Praise Assembly of God Church in Comanche County. She was laid to rest in Fletcher Cemetery. As her murderer or murderers had neither been apprehended or convicted at the time of the service and with her family strongly suspecting her murderer(s) had not been strangers to her, Heather's family forbade any individual outside her immediate family from touching her coffin throughout the service, with her mother stating that prior to the service, she had promised her only daughter that \"whoever did this to her would never touch her again.\"\n\nCurtis Gambill was a high-school dropout. He was born on February 24, 1977, and at the time of Heather's murder, he was living with his 64-year-old grandmother in Terral, Oklahoma. Gambill was known to possess a short temper, and to exhibit sadistic features, being known to have regularly forced boys to fight each other in his presence upon the threat that if they did not do so, they would otherwise have to fight him. He had previously escaped from every youth detention center in which he had been incarcerated, and had been briefly committed to a psychiatric hospital at age 17. In addition, he had been convicted of feloniously carrying a firearm in February 1996; receiving a five-year suspended sentence.\n\nIn the week prior to Heather's disappearance, Gambill was notably depressed due to his best friend, 20-year-old Dennis Goss, having committed suicide on 25 September. Just days prior to October 2, he and his close friend Joshua Bagwell had attended Goss's funeral.\n\nJoshua Bagwell was born on December 21, 1978. His parents were among the wealthiest landowners in southern Oklahoma, although as his parents' employment led them to be largely absent from home, he had lived with his grandparents since the age of 16. Bagwell was a senior at Waurika High School, and by October 1996, had been the recipient of six new cars. He was variously described as being a snobbish and pampered youth, although he was considered somewhat of an outcast among his peers. He and Gambill had formed a mutual friendship, in part due to their shared interests in firearms, drinking, camping, and fishing. Occasionally, the camping and fishing trips the two had eloped upon had seen the pair travel to the environs of Belknap Creek.\n\nUndisciplined at home, Bagwell had once been arrested for driving while intoxicated, and had demanded a lawyer while resisting arrest. Both Randy Wood and Heather Rich had been impressed by Bagwell's affluent means; the latter commenting on more than one occasion that she had flirted with Bagwell until she had secured a seat in his white Dodge Stealth for the forthcoming Waurika homecoming parade. On the night of October 2, Heather had sneaked from her parents' home to meet Bagwell for what was supposed to be their first date.\n\nRandy Wood was born on July 7, 1979. He and his single-parent mother had frequently relocated throughout Oklahoma during his childhood—frequently resulting in him having to attend numerous different schools. By 1996, Wood lived with his mother in a largely dilapidated house, and his family was known as one of the poorest in Waurika.\n\nWood began smoking cannabis in the third grade, often stealing the money or the narcotic itself from his mother. Despite his personal disadvantages, Wood endeavored to better himself among his peers, and by 1996, was the captain of the Waurika High School football team, having earned the respect of the entire team. He and Heather had dated for approximately five months, during which they had regularly attended church together and conversed on the phone, although their relationship, despite being an intimate one, had never resulted in sexual intercourse, and the two were frequently mistaken as simply being friends. Having heard a rumor Heather had skinny-dipped at a party, Wood chose to end their relationship, although the two remained close friends.\n\nOne week after Heather's body was found at Belknap Creek, Randy Wood was crowned homecoming king of Waurika High School.\n\nA total of 14 investigators were assigned to investigate Heather's murder. The investigation was assisted by the FBI in the event federal kidnapping charges could be brought against the perpetrator or perpetrators should Heather have been transported across state lines against her will.\n\nInitially encountering a wall of silence from much of Waurika's youth as to Heather's potential whereabouts, by the second week of the inquiry, investigators focused more closely on a potential lead provided by Heather's best friend on the cheerleading squad that Heather may have left her home to attend a party at the home of a classmate of theirs named Joshua Luke Bagwell. Upon informal questioning, Bagwell initially claimed he and a friend of his named Randy Wood (both of whom had earlier been questioned by Gail Rich as to her daughter's whereabouts) had not seen Heather on October 2 as they had been playing dominoes and drinking whisky and beer in his trailer until approximately 6:00 a.m. the following day. Wood would corroborate this statement.\n\nHaving discovered that the buckshot rounds fired from the Winchester shotgun which killed Heather were of a distinct brand, investigators soon learned that only one store in Waurika had stocked this brand. Conversing with the owners of the store, these investigators discovered that just days prior to the murder, 20 rounds had been purchased by one Joshua Bagwell. The owner of this store was also able to positively identify Bagwell from an assembled police lineup. Furthermore, an employee of this store was adamant that at the time Bagwell had made this purchase, he had been in the company of another young male.\n\nFurther discovering that Bagwell had spent much of his time in recent months in the company of a 19-year-old high school dropout named Curtis Allen Gambill, and had regularly hunted in his company, Curtis Gambill was arrested on October 24. He was questioned for a total of eight hours, and agreed to submit to a polygraph test pertaining to his potential culpability in Heather's murder. Gambill failed this polygraph test, and subsequently agreed to allow investigators to subject the shotgun he owned to ballistic fingerprinting to determine whether this firearm had been used to murder Heather Rich.\n\nDiscovering the results of the ballistic analysis of his shotgun indicated the firearm had been the one used to murder Heather Rich, and that the weapon was capable of firing nine rounds before requiring reloading, Gambill confessed to being a participant in Heather's murder, also naming Bagwell and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Lee Wood, as participants in the murder. According to Gambill, Wood had been the instigator of the crime, and the actual murderer, with himself and Bagwell acting upon his (Wood's) instructions. Wood's actual motive, Gambill claimed, had been sexual jealousy due to the fact Heather had engaged in sex with Bagwell and not himself.\n\nBagwell and Wood were also arrested on October 24. Bagwell refused to admit any culpability in Heather's murder; invoking his right to silence and refusing to submit to a polygraph test. Shortly thereafter, his family hired a team of high-profile lawyers to defend him. By contrast, Randy Wood willingly agreed to provide a written statement in which he confessed to his being a participant in the murder, although he was adamant Curtis Gambill had been the instigator of the entire crime, and the individual who had shot and killed Heather, adding that Joshua Bagwell had been a knowing and willing participant. Wood further claimed not to have actually believed Gambill was serious in his vocal intentions to murder Heather until Gambill had parked the pickup upon the Belknap Creek bridge. He also agreed to submit to a polygraph test to verify his version of events—the results of which fully corroborated his written statement.\n\nInitially, all three individuals were charged with the kidnapping of Heather and denied bail in Oklahoma. All would subsequently be formally charged with first-degree murder in Montague County, Texas on October 25.\n\nThe trials of all three defendants were held in Texas. Owing to the law of Texas, all three individuals were tried as adults.\n\nCurtis Gambill was brought to trial on October 15, 1997. He was tried in Fort Worth. Shortly after his trial had begun, Gambill accepted a plea bargain offered by Montague County district attorney Tim Cole, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to Heather's murder—admitting to being the individual who had physically taken her life—in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty. He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with a potential possibility of parole after 30 years. As part of his plea bargain, Gambill also agreed to testify against Bagwell at his upcoming trial.\nJoshua Bagwell was brought to trial in February 1998. Prior to and at his trial, he refused to admit any culpability in her murder; claiming that his intercourse with Heather after Gambill and Wood had initially left the two alone in his trailer had been consensual; that he had later left his trailer prior to Gambill and Wood actually discussing killing Heather; and that he had ultimately believed the trio were simply driving Heather around in an effort to sober her up before returning her home. Furthermore, he stated that he was unaware of any actual plan to murder her.\n\nAt Bagwell's trial, Gambill reneged upon his own previous agreement with prosecutors; changing his story and reverting to his initial claims upon arrest. This testimony largely suited the portrayal of Bagwell by the defense; minimizing Bagwell's role in the murder and corroborating his own claims that Wood had committed Heather's murder.\n\nRandy Wood had initially accepted a similar plea bargain to that previously offered to Gambill in exchange for his testimony at Bagwell's then-forthcoming trial. However, the evening before he was due to give evidence, Wood—against the vehement advice of his defense attorney—changed his mind and rejected the plea bargain, insisting he wished to testify against Bagwell without any preconditions despite being informed by his lawyer that he risked either a longer prison sentence or a potential death penalty if convicted.\n\nOn the third day of testimony, Wood testified under oath that Gambill had largely orchestrated the murder, had shot and killed Heather, and that Bagwell had been a full, knowing participant in the act.\n\nThe day after Wood delivered his testimony, Bagwell testified before the jury. He insisted he had not been present in his trailer when Wood and Gambill had discussed murdering Heather, and blamed Wood for her actual shooting. Bagwell added his conjecture that Wood's motivation for this act had been that he had been angry at Heather for earlier refusing to engage in intercourse with him (Wood). Bagwell finally claimed not to have been physically close to the actual crime scene at the time Heather had actually been murdered, but had walked away to urinate. He solely admitted to a limited role in refusing to disclose acknowledgement of the murder after the event. Despite this testimony, when questioned as to his witnessing the actual shooting of Heather Rich, Bagwell self-contradicted himself in his reply, claiming he had witnessed \"Curtis—sorry I mean Randy—lowering the gun.\"\n\nJoshua Bagwell was convicted of capital murder on February 14, 1998 and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. He was sentenced to a mandatory life term. He would later be sentenced to an additional sentence of 99 years for conspiracy to commit capital murder on February 17.\nRandy Wood was tried for capital murder later in 1998. Against the advice of his attorney, Pat Morris, Wood declined another offered plea bargain offered prior to his trial; choosing to plead not guilty to Heather's murder, stating that although he was aware of the law of Texas, he had neither intended for Heather to be killed, and that he had not physically taken her life himself.\n\nWood was found guilty of capital murder on August 25, 1998. As the State did not seek the death penalty in his trial, he was automatically sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood will first become eligible for parole in 2036.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its students come from all sectors and populations in Israeli society. \n\nOrt Israel began functioning in 1948, when Aharon Syngalowsky, then Chairperson of World ORT, came to Israel. With the dramatic increase in immigration from North Africa, Europe and the Middle East, new challenges in absorption and rehabilitation emerged. Thousands of new immigrants needed to be integrated into the new society, and to this end, jobs and vocational training were needed. Many senior figures in the country supported this idea, such as Zalman Shazar, then the Minister of Education, and later to become President, Zalman Aran, later to become Minister of Education, and Mordechai Bentov, the Minister of Housing. The management of ORT rented an abandoned building in Jaffa and another one on Nevi'im Street in Jerusalem.\n\nThe first ORT school in Israel opened in Jaffa in 1949[1]. Its beginnings were modest, with only short courses for discharged soldiers, in order to make it easier for them to integrate into the country's economy. The school was headed by engineer Zvi Rivlin. Thus ORT Israel was founded, and this was also the beginning of technology education in the State of Israel. The school operated for seven consecutive years in extremely crowded conditions. The first courses were in welding, carpentry, pajama sewing, weaving, radio, electricity, and typewriter repair. Hundreds of discharged soldiers and new immigrants passed through the school, studying mainly in evening classes. At the end of the 1950s, ORT managed to open the new and very modern school in Tel Aviv, Yad Eliyahu named ORT Syngalowsky. \n\nDuring the 1960s, needs grew, and ORT decided to expand; the number of students in the network doubled, and doubled once again in the 1970s. The education authorities in Israel decided to make technological and vocational education a priority and demanded that more and more schools be built for this purpose. Between 1960 and 1975, 60 additional schools were added to the network to make a total of 80 schools. Thus, a decade later, the number of ORT students exceeded 70,000. The new schools were opened not just in the big cities, but also on kibbutzim, in development towns, in yeshivas and even among the Arab population. \n\nIn 2003, Israel was World ORT's largest sphere of operation, with 90,000 students enrolled in 159 schools, colleges and institutions. In 2006, ORT Israel broke away from World ORT, which continues to work in Israel as \"Kadima Mada-Educating for Life\". ORT Israel now raises funds in the United States through \"Friends of Israel Sci-Tech Schools\".Kadima Mada is investing NIS16 million to upgrade technology studies in 72 Jewish and non-Jewish schools in Israel.\n\nSince the turn of the century, the network has expanded considerably, making its main goal the cultivation of schools that define themselves as providing high-level science and technology education. ORT institutions are spread around the entire country. One in ten post-elementary students attends an ORT Israel school. Every year, some 100,000 students, youth and adults study in its institutions. The network serves the entire population of the country, both geographically and demographically, working in all the various communities: state schools (Jewish and Arab: Muslim, Christian and Druze), state-religious schools (yeshivot and ulpanot). The ORT Israel network has over 600,000 graduates, and employs 8,500 teaching and administrative staff. \n\nToday ORT is the largest non-state network of schools in Israel. Until a few years ago ORT primarily operated trade and vocational schools. Now the focus is on the advancement of science and technology education.\n\nThe network runs over 200 institutions, including dozens of 6-year comprehensive (middle and high) schools, industrial schools, and colleges for technicians and practical engineers, which train some 30% of the technology HR for Israel's economy. \nThe Ort Israel Research and Development Center was established by Manya and Israel Moshinsky of Mexico [3] in 1972.\n\nThe Center was designed to train ORT teachers the work methods and applications of the new technologies used in ORT's more advanced study tracks. The Pedagogical Center became a model for other information centers worldwide. The Center was built on the campus of the ORT Syngalowsky High School, not by chance.\n\nA very imaginative staff was selected to conduct research and be creative while teaching and learning materials were developed and tried out on the brightest in its adjacent labs. The R&D Center supervised the writing of technology textbooks for students and teachers and these have reached ORT students everywhere and been translated into several languages.\n\nOver the years, the ORT R&D Center has continued to set standards of innovation and progress with changing technology. There has been a shift from textbooks to the development of online tools and information systems for teaching and learning. The R&D Center currently has some 100 employees and is responsible for innovative pedagogical development for the entire network. The Center also exports curricula abroad to both Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Every year the ORT R&D Center takes part in international science and technology projects and has an outstanding reputation as a center of quality and innovation.\n\nORT Israel offers 40 different study tracks in science and technology, social sciences and humanities. About 60% of ORT Israel students study in science and technology tracks.\nIn recent years, ORT has been the first to launch study tracks in Israel in: biomedical engineering, mechatronics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, environmental studies and electro-optics.\nParallel to their high school studies, some 1,200 outstanding ORT students also study n the ORT Academy program for a Bachelor's degree at the Technion and Israel's other research universities. \nTeaching methods at ORT include a combination of online learning systems that use the internet and social media platforms. Among these, ORT Israel has developed a Learning Management System based on an open source platform, launched a virtual school and supports over 100 websites specially developed and run by the network's teachers and students. \nIn 1996, World ORT launched the \"Science through Technology\" in Israeli junior high schools (grade 7–9). In the \"Young Investigators\" program for seventh graders, the students build LEGO models to explore scientific phenomenon. In \"Galileo, Newton and Me\" for eighth graders, LEGO is used to study systems. In the \"Design your own world\" program, ninth graders attempt to solve real-life problems using LEGO bricks and programming. \n\nIn 2008, Kadima Mada embarked on a project to build high-tech classrooms, equipping 60 rooms on six campuses with Interactive Whiteboards, wireless Internet and other technological aids.\n\nEach year the network continues to expand and take on more schools from these sectors.\n\nVarious ORT institutions maintain close ties with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The two main ones are ORT Israel Aerospace Industries, which offers an UAV study track and ORT Air Force at Tel Nof, which trains students for technical support roles in the Air Force. Additional schools incorporate a cadet program.\n\nThis collaboration with the IDF has led thousands of ORT graduates to serve in engineering, technology and ICT positions in the IDF. Among other things, ORT graduates work on developing sophisticated combat systems for aircraft and helicopters and on programming information systems for the Air Force, the Navy and the Intelligence Corps. After their military service, many ORT Israel graduates take jobs in Israel's defense industries, including Elbit Systems, Rafael, and the IAI.\n\nTogether with representatives from the Manufacturer's Association, ORT Israel heads a project of having schools adopted by industrial concerns to allow students to get to know them and gain hands-on experience while still studying. In addition, ORT Israel operates a track in conjunction with the Ministry of Economics and Industry to place practical engineers in the country's key corporations. \nORT represents Israel in collaborations with bodies and educational institutions around the world. For example, ORT Israel led the Consortium on nanotechnology as part of the FP-7 programs of the European Union. It is part of the e-learning initiative in which 10 Mediterranean Basin countries are participating, and has been involved in a project of the British Council to make connections between academia and industry. \n\nORT Israel exports science and technology curricula to high schools and middle schools in Europe and the USA. In the USA, ORT Israel functions under the name of the Israel Sci-Tech Schools Network.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7215034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7215034", "title": "Rule of three (aeronautics)", "text": "Rule of three (aeronautics)\n\nIn aviation, the rule of three or \"3:1 rule of descent\" is that 3 miles of travel should be allowed for every of descent.\n\nIn the early days of aviation, few aircraft were pressurized. A pilot who descended rapidly would cause his passengers the discomfort of rapid pressure changes on their eardrums.\n\nTransport pilots adopted this formula to assure a slow, steady and comfortable descent for their passengers. Many aircraft had a cruising speed between . Three miles would be traveled in about 1.5–1.8 minutes, resulting in a rate of descent of about 550–660 feet per minute. That was about as fast as passengers could comfortably adapt to the changing pressure on their eardrums. However, many pilots used a 300-feet-per-minute descent rate because doing so is almost unnoticed by passengers. A pilot cruising at 10,500 feet would calculate that in order to be at 1,000 feet at his destination, he would have to descend 9,500 feet. Dividing 9,500 feet by 300 feet per minute, that descent would require about 32 minutes. If his ground speed was , he would begin his descent about from his destination (traffic permitting).\n\nThe \"rule of three\" is used by pilots flying small, unpressurized aircraft as well as by those flying airliners and aircraft with pressurized cabins. These usually fly in a structured environment governed by instrument flight rules (IFR) and may not have the luxury of choosing a descent rate, instead observing the altitude constraints assigned to them by air traffic controllers. Although rate of cabin pressurization change may be a consideration, this is usually managed automatically and for an airliner a larger consideration is fuel economy. A 3:1 descent gives an efficient glide descent from cruising altitude, and aids in planning; the company standard descent speed will be close to (usually slightly higher than) the optimum Lift/Drag ratio speed, and will give a descent ratio close to 3:1. \n\nAn additional use of this rule-of-thumb is on final approach which generally has a 3 degree vertical angle. This corresponds to 3 nautical miles (nm) per 1000ft and again makes mental estimation simple. \n"}

In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase \"sixth form college\" as the English name for a lycée.\n\nIn England and the Caribbean, education is currently compulsory until the end of year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18 (previously in England, education was compulsory only until year 11 before August 2013 and until year 12 between August 2013 and 2015). In the English state educational system, pupils may either stay at a secondary school with an attached sixth form, transfer to a local sixth form college, or go to a more vocational further education college, although in some places there may in practice be little choice which of these options can be taken. In the independent sector, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools (public schools), and there is also a number of smaller-scale independent sixth form colleges. In Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of year 11.\n\nStudents at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 12 and 13, Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland and/or lower sixth and upper sixth). Some students sit AS examinations at the end of the first year, and A-level examinations at the end of the second. These exams are called C.A.P.E. (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in the Caribbean. In addition, in recent years a variety of vocational courses have been added to the curriculum.\n\nThere are currently over 90 sixth form colleges in England and Wales. Most perform extremely well in national examination league tables. In addition, they offer a broader range of courses at a lower cost per student than most school sixth forms. In a few areas, authorities run sixth form schools which function like sixth form colleges but are completely under the control of the local education authorities. Unlike further education colleges, sixth form colleges rarely accept part-time students or run evening classes, although one boarding sixth form college exists.\n\nThere are a few schools in Brunei providing sixth form education. Five of them are dedicated sixth form colleges, with four located in Brunei-Muara District and one in Tutong District. Belait has yet to have its own sixth form centre and sixth form education is presently housed in Sayyidina Ali Secondary School, sharing facilities with the secondary education. There is no sixth form education in Temburong — prospective students go to sixth form colleges in Brunei-Muara where they may stay in dormitories.\n\nAlmost all sixth form schools are government schools. Five of them provide education leading up to Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level qualification. Jerudong International School is a non-government school which has sixth form education and its A Level is independent of those offered by its counterpart. Along with International School Brunei which offers the program International Baccalaureate Diploma instead of A Levels after the completion of International General Certificate of Secondary Education in their lower secondary year. \n\nAnother school, Hassanal Bolkiah Boys' Arabic Secondary School, is a government sixth form centre for students in the specialised Arabic stream. Instead of A Level subjects, students generally learn subjects pertaining to Islamic knowledge in Arabic medium. The schooling culminates in the sitting of \"Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Ugama Brunei (STPUB)\", translatable as the Higher Certificate of Brunei Religious Education. They may then proceed to Islamic universities, locally or abroad such as Al-Azhar University.\n\nIn the English-speaking Caribbean, there are many sixth form colleges, usually attached to secondary schools. Students must usually attain a grade A-C in 1-3 in the Caribbean Examinations Council (C.X.C) CSEC examinations. Students that fail these exams are not accepted into the sixth form program and either can do courses in other tertiary facilities, or begin working with high school degrees. After sixth form, students are presented with an Associate Degree.\n\nScotland does not, in general, have separate sixth form colleges (or, indeed, the same concept of the terminal two years of secondary education as being distinct from the other time spent there); as such, Scottish students who opt to remain in full-time education will typically remain in the same school for fifth and sixth year (the equivalent to the English lower- and upper-sixth forms), studying Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. Higher Grade qualifications can be taken in both the fifth and sixth years.\n\nThe first comprehensive intake sixth form college in England was established in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and took its first intake of students in September 1964. Since then sixth form colleges have spread across the UK and have proved popular with students, their parents, and other groups in the community. Until 1992, these colleges were controlled and funded by local education authorities (LEAs), but the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 transferred all institutions within the sector to the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), a national agency with strategic responsibility for the operation of general further education (FE) colleges. Later the FEFC's functions were taken over by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), a reorganisation that included changes in the funding and supervision of sixth form colleges.\n\nSixth form colleges take responsibility for their own employment, pensions and pay arrangements with the support and advice of the Sixth Form Colleges' Association (SFCA, formerly SFCF). The SFCA is made up of representative principals from SFCs across the UK. The SFCA sets up several Committees to deliver its range of support services for SFCs as well as facilitating lobbying work with Central Government.\nColleges for the most part do not charge full-time daytime students; however, adult students (most of whom attend evening classes) may have to pay a fee (for examinations, tutors' time and other costs).\n\nThere are also some sixth form colleges in the independent sector, specialising in A levels for which fees are paid; these are unconnected with the SFCA.\n\nIn Wales, sixth form education falls under the remit of the Welsh Assembly, and sixth form colleges are sources of further education alongside FE Colleges and sixth forms integrated into secondary schools. They typically offer the Welsh Baccalaureate and Key Skills qualifications.\n\nEven though Hong Kong had changed from having two public examinations to one, its first sixth form college, PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College, remains in operation as an upper secondary college.\n\n"}

{"id": "3281107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3281107", "title": "TUTOR (programming language)", "text": "TUTOR (programming language)\n\nTUTOR (also known as PLATO Author Language) is a programming language developed for use on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign around 1965. TUTOR was initially designed by Paul Tenczar for use in computer assisted instruction (CAI) and computer managed instruction (CMI) (in computer programs called \"lessons\") and has many features for that purpose. For example, TUTOR has powerful answer-parsing and answer-judging commands, graphics, and features to simplify handling student records and statistics by instructors. TUTOR's flexibility, in combination with PLATO's computational power (running on what was considered a supercomputer in 1972), also made it suitable for the creation of many non-educational lessons—that is, \"games\"—including flight simulators, war games, dungeon style multiplayer role-playing games, card games, word games, and medical lesson games such as Bugs and Drugs (BND).\n\nTUTOR was originally developed as a special purpose authoring language for designing instructional lessons, and its evolution into a general purpose programming language was unplanned.\nThe name TUTOR was first applied to the authoring language of the PLATO system in the later days of Plato III.\nThe first documentation of the language, under this name, appears to have been \"The TUTOR Manual\", CERL Report X-4, by R. A. Avner and P. Tenczar, Jan. 1969.\n\nThe article \"Teaching the Translation of Russian by Computer\" gives a snapshot of TUTOR from shortly before PLATO IV was operational. Core elements of the language were present, but commands were given in upper case, and instead of using a general mechanism, support for alternative character sets was through special command names such as codice_1 for \"write using the Russian character set.\"\n\nThrough the 1970s, the developers of TUTOR took advantage of the fact that the entire corpus of TUTOR programs were stored on-line on the same computer system. Whenever they felt a need to change the language, they ran conversion software over the corpus of TUTOR code to revise all existing code so that it conformed with the changes they had made.\nAs a result, once new versions of TUTOR were developed, maintaining compatibility with the PLATO version could be very difficult.\n\nCDC, by 1981, had largely expunged the name TUTOR from their PLATO documentation. They referred to the language itself as the \"PLATO Author Language\". The phrase \"TUTOR file\" or even \"TUTOR lesson file\" survived, however, as the name of the type of file used to store text written in the PLATO Author Language.\n\nA TUTOR lesson consists of a sequence of \"units\" where each unit begins with the presentation of information and progress from one unit to the next is contingent on correctly answering one or more questions. As with COBOL paragraphs, control may enter a TUTOR unit from the preceding unit and exit into the next, but units are also callable as subroutines using the codice_2 or codice_3 commands.\n\nHere is an example unit from page 5 of the \"TUTOR User's Memo\", March 1973 (Computer-based Education Research Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign):\n\nSeveral things should be immediately apparent from this example.\n\n\nWhat may not be apparent is the control structure implicit in this unit. The codice_5 command marks the entrance to a \"judging block\" This control structure is one of TUTOR's unique features.\n\nTUTOR contained a number of unique features. The following list is not intended as a substitute for a TUTOR manual, but merely highlights the most interesting, innovative, and sometimes confusing features of the language.\n\nA \"judging block\" in TUTOR is a control structure that begins with an codice_5 command and ends with the next codice_5, codice_8 or codice_9 command. The codice_5 command also prompts for input, with the special arrow character (resembling \"▷\") displayed as a prompt at the indicated screen coordinates. In effect, a judging block can be thought of as a backtracking control structure where the student may make multiple attempts to answer a question until a correct answer allows forward progress.\n\nEach judging block consists of a sequence of pattern matching commands, each of which introduces a (possibly empty) block of commands to be executed if that pattern matches. The two most common pattern matching commands were codice_11 and codice_12. These had identical pattern matching semantics except that codice_11 judged a student response to be correct if it matched, while codice_12 judged a student response to be incorrect.\n\nThe tag fields on the codice_11 and codice_12 commands consisted of lists of optional, required and alternative words. consider this example from exercise 4-1 in the 1973 \"TUTOR User's Memo\":\n\nThis would match answers such as \"it is a right triangle\" or \"it's a triangular figure\" or just \"rt triangle\". It would not match \"sort of triangular\" because the words \"sort of\" are not listed as ignored, and it would not match \"triangle, right?\" because the\norder is wrong.\n\nThe pattern matching subsystem recognized spelling errors, so the words \"triangel\" or \"triangl\" would match the example pattern. The lesson author could use the codice_17 command to set how pedantic the system was about spelling errors.\n\nThe pattern matching algorithms used by various TUTOR implementations varied in detail, but typically, each word in the input text and each word in the pattern were converted to bit vectors. To see whether a word of student input matched a word of the pattern, the Hamming distance between the two bit vectors was used as a measure of the degree of difference between the words. Bit vectors were typically 60 or 64 bits long, with fields for letter presence, letter pair presence, and the first letter. As a result, the number of one bits in the exclusive or of two such bit vectors approximated the extent of the phonetic difference between the corresponding words.\n\nAll early presentations of the control structure of a TUTOR judging block were confusing. In modern terms, however, a judging block can be described as an iterative control structure that exits when the student input is judged correct. The body\nof this control structure consists of a series of cases, each introduced by a pattern matching command such as codice_11 or codice_12. All output produced by the body of the judging loop in the\nprevious cycle is erased from the screen prior to the next cycle.\n\nConsider this example, from exercise 4-1 of the 1973 \"TUTOR User's Memo\":\n\nIn the event that the student inputs \"square\" or \"a square\", the answer is judged to be incorrect, and the text \"A square has four sides.\" is output starting at line 15 column 1 on the screen. This output remains on the screen until the student begins to enter\na new answer, at which point, it is erased so that the response to the new answer can be computed. The mechanism by which the display screen rolls back to its previous state varies from implementation to implementation. Early implementations operated by switching the terminal into erase mode and re-executing the entire case that had matched. Some later implementations buffered the output produced during judging so that this output could be erased.\n\nThe codice_3 command was a unique form of subroutine call. It was defined as being equivalent to textual substitution of the body of the joined unit in place of the join command itself (page 21, 1973 \"TUTOR User's Memo\"). As such, a joined unit could contain part of a judging block. Thus, while the judging block is conceptually an iterator enclosing a series of cases, this block may be arbitrarily broken into subroutines. (An alternative subroutine call, the codice_2 command, conformed to the usual semantics associated with subroutine calls in other programming languages.)\n\nThe PLATO IV student terminal had a 512 by 512 pixel plasma display panel,\nwith hardware support for point plotting, line drawing, and text display.\nEach pixel on the PLATO IV terminal was either orange or black. The CDC PLATO V terminal used a monochrome black and white CRT to emulate the plasma panel. The built-in character set had 4 sets of 63 characters, each 8 by 16 pixels, half of these were fixed, half were programmable. The Tutor language provided complete support for this terminal.\n\nThere were two coordinate systems (see page II-1 of \"The TUTOR Language\" by Bruce Sherwood):\n\n\nThe following example illustrates some of Tutor's drawing commands.\n\nNote the use of semicolons to separate successive coordinates on the codice_22 command. This allows unambiguous use of comma-separated fine coordinates. Normally, the draw command connects consecutive points with line segments, but by putting codice_23 in the tag, the codice_22 command could be made to conceptually lift its pen.\n\nThe tags on the codice_25 command give the radius and fine coordinates of the center. Additional tags could specify starting and\nending angles for partial circles.\n\nHand composing draw commands is difficult, so a picture editor was included in the PLATO system by 1974 to automate this work. This could only deal with drawing commands with constant coordinates.\n\nThe following example illustrates some of the text rendering tools of Tutor.\n\nText rendered in size zero rotation zero used the built-in character rendering hardware of the PLATO terminal, while rendering with nonzero size and rotation was done with line segments and therefore significantly slower due to the speed of the communication link to the terminal.\n\nAside from its unique answer judging mechanisms, TUTOR's original set of control structures was rather sparse. In the mid 1970s, this shortcoming was addressed by introducing codice_26, codice_27 blocks with optional codice_28 and codice_29 sections. The semantics of these control structures was routine, but the syntax was unique, with mandatory indentation presaging that of Python and a unique use of nonblank indent characters to distinguish indenting from continuation lines.\n\nThis is illustrated in the following example, from page S5 of the \"Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables (10th ed)\" by Elaine Avner, 1981:\n\nThe same syntax was used for codice_31, codice_32 blocks with semantics comparable to while loops in conventional programming languages. This is illustrated in the following example, from page S6 of the \"Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables (10th ed)\" by Elaine Avner, 1981:\n\nNote that the codice_33 and codice_34 commands are somewhat analogous to the codice_35 and codice_36 statements of languages based on C, except that they must sit at the indenting level of the loop they modify, and they have a condition tag that indicates when the indicated control transfer is to take place.\n\nTUTOR's expression syntax did not look back to the syntax of FORTRAN, nor was it limited by poorly designed character sets of the era. For example, the PLATO IV character set included control characters for subscript and superscript, and TUTOR used these for exponentiation. Consider this command (from page IV-1 of \"The TUTOR Language\", Sherwood, 1974):\n\nThe character set also included the conventional symbols for multiplication and division, codice_37 and codice_38, but in a more radical departure from the conventions established by FORTRAN, it allowed implicit multiplication, so the expressions codice_39 and codice_40 were valid, with the values 99 and 15.9, respectively (op cit).\n\nThe language included a pre-defined constant named with the Greek letter pi (π), with the appropriate value, which could be used in calculations. Thus, the expression codice_41 could be used to calculate the area of a circle, using the built-in π constant, implicit multiplication and exponentiation indicated by a superscript.\n\nIn TUTOR, the floating-point comparison codice_42 was defined as being true if codice_43 and codice_44 were approximately equal (see page C5 of \"PLATO User's Memo, Number One\" by Avner, 1975). This simplified life for mathematically naïve developers of instructional lessons, but it occasionally caused headaches for developers of numerically sophisticated code because it was possible that both codice_45 and codice_46 could be true at the same time.\n\nAs an authoring language, TUTOR began with only minimal memory resources and only the crudest tools for manipulating them. Each user process had a private data segment of 150 variables, and shared \"common blocks\" could be attached, allowing interuser communication through shared memory.\n\nOn the PLATO IV system, words were 60 bits, in keeping with the CDC 6600 family of computers. Some later implementations changed this to 64 bits.\n\nThe private memory region of each process consisted of 150 words each, referred to as student variables; the values of these variables were persistent, following the individual user from session to session. These were addressed as codice_47 through codice_48 when used to hold integer values, or as codice_49 through codice_50 when used to hold floating point values.\n\nA TUTOR lesson could attach a single region of up to 1500 words of shared memory using the codice_51 command. Each lesson could have an unnamed temporary common block containing variables shared by all users of that lesson. Such blocks were created when a lesson came into use and deallocated when the lesson became inactive. In contrast, named common blocks were associated with a block of a lesson (a disk file). Shared memory was addressed as codice_52 through codice_53 (for integers) or codice_54 through codice_55 (for floating point numbers).\n\nWhere 150 student variables was insufficient, a lesson could use the\ncodice_56 command to create an additional private memory segment of up to 1000 words. This segment existed in swap space only, but it could be mapped to student variables or common variables. For example (from page X-11 of \"The TUTOR Language\", Sherwood, 1974):\n\nThis example defines codice_52 to codice_58 as a shared unnamed common block, while codice_59 to codice_60 are private storage.\n\nThe Tutor codice_61 command was very similar to the C codice_62 preprocessor directive. This was the only way to associate mnemonic names with variables. It was up to the programmer to statically allocate memory and assign names to variables. Consider this example from page 17 of the \"TUTOR User's Memo -- Introduction to TUTOR\", 1973\"\n\nThis creates a set of definitions named codice_63 defining three floating point variables. Users were advised that \"there should not be any v3's or v26's anywhere in your lesson except in the codice_61 statement itself. Put all your definitions at the very beginning of the lesson where you will have ready reference to which variables you are using.\" (underlining from the original, page IV-5 of \"The TUTOR Language\", Sherwood, 1974.)\n\nFunctions could be defined, with macro-substitution semantics, as in this illustration from page IX-2 of \"The TUTOR Language\", Sherwood, 1974:\n\nUnlike C, the original scope rules of TUTOR were pure \"definition before use\" with no provisions for local definitions. Thus, the formal parameter codice_65 used above must not have any previous definition.\n\nLater in the development of TUTOR, with the introduction of multiple named sets of definitions, the programmer was given explicit control over which sets of definitions were currently in force. For example, codice_66 would discard all definitions in the named set.\n\nThe original TUTOR tools for text manipulation were based on commands for specific text operations, for example, codice_67 to place a packed character string into consecutive variables in memory, codice_68 to search for one string within another, and codice_69 to move a string from memory to memory. By 1975, more general tools for arrays of integers and packed arrays were added. Page 14 of \"PLATO User's Memo -- Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables\", Avner, 1975, gives the following:\n\n\"Segmented arrays\", defined with the keyword codice_70, were comparable to packed arrays in Pascal. The byte size and whether or not the array elements were to be treated as signed or unsigned were entirely under user control. Arbitrary text manipulation could be done by setting the byte size to the machine byte size, 6 bits on implementations using display code, 8 bits on some later ASCII and extended ASCII implementations. Note the lack of any specification of array dimensionality for segmented arrays.\n\nA general parameter passing mechanism was added to TUTOR early in the PLATO IV era. Page IV-10 of \"The TUTOR Language\" by Sherwood, 1974 gives the following example:\n\nNotice that the formal parameters listed in the argument list to the codice_9 command are simply the defined names for statically allocated global variables. The semantics of parameter passing was given as being equivalent to assignment at the time of the control transfer to the destination unit, and if actual parameters were omitted, as in the second codice_2 command above, the effect was to leave the prior values of the corresponding formal parameters unchanged.\n\nLocal variables were added to TUTOR some time around 1980. Lesson authors wishing to use local variables were required to use the codice_73 command to declare the size of the buffer used for local variables, up to 128 words. Having done so, a unit using local variables could begin as follows (from Page C2 of \"Summary of TUTOR Commands and System Variables\", Avner, 1981):\n\nThe continuation lines of the codice_9 command given above are taken to be lines of an implicit codice_61 command with local scope. Conventional definitions in terms of student variables such as codice_48 could be used in such a local codice_61, but the forms illustrated here all automatically bind names to locations in the block of memory allocated by the codice_73 command. The available TUTOR documentation does not discuss how local variables are allocated.\n\nThere has been a sizable family of TUTOR-related languages, each similar to the original TUTOR language but with differences. In particular, TUTOR was a component of a system (the PLATO computer-based education system) that ran on particular CDC mainframe hardware. For efficiency, there were some hardware-specific elements in TUTOR (e.g. variables that were 60-bit words that could be used as arrays of 60 bits or as 10 six-bit characters, etc.). Also, TUTOR was designed before the advent of the windows-oriented graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nThe microTutor language was developed in the PLATO project at UIUC to permit portions of a lesson to run in terminals that contained microcomputers, with connections to TUTOR code running on the mainframe. The microTutor dialect was also the programming language of the Cluster system developed at UIUC and licensed to TDK in Japan; the Cluster system consisted of a small group of terminals attached to a minicomputer which provided storage and compilation. The Tencore Language Authoring System is a TUTOR derivative developed by Paul Tenczar for PCs and sold by Computer Teaching Corporation. cT was a derivative of TUTOR and microTutor developed at Carnegie Mellon which allowed programs to run without change in windowed GUI environments on Windows, Mac, and Unix/Linux systems: The cT Programming Language Archives\n\n"}

TEPS has been administered nationwide since January 1999. It consists of 200 questions which are divided into four sections: Listening (60 questions, 55 minutes), Grammar (50 questions, 25 minutes), Vocabulary (50 questions, 15 minutes), and Reading (40 questions, 45 minutes). TEPS scores are divided into the ten ratings ranging from 1 + to 5. It is designed to test applicants' communicative English skills and to minimize test-taker reliance on certain strategies such as rote memorization. A study of the test indicated that it is valid and fair.\n\nTEPS score is valid to be converted into TOEFL score and this conversion is used throughout many universities in the United States.\n\nTEPS consists of four sections: Listening Comprehension, Grammar, Vocabulary, and Reading Comprehension. The test has a total of 200 questions and takes approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes to administer. Scores are assigned on a scale of 10 points to 990 points total and incorporate Item Response Theory, which is also called the IRT.\nThe new revised version of the test was introduced in May 2018, which includes four section. The listening section divided in to five parts with total 240 points and 40 minutes test time. Vocabulary and grammar section each have 60 points, with 25 minute test time and divided into further 2 and 3 parts respectively. The comprehensive reading section complete in 40 minutes and 240 points with 4 parts. The overall new test have 14 parts, 135 questions, 105 minute test duration and 0 to 600 points.\n\n\n"}

More interactive and specific than a book or a lecture, a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.\n\nA tutorial can be taken in many forms, ranging from a set of instructions to complete a task to an interactive problem solving session (usually in academia).\n\nIn British academic parlance, a tutorial is a small class of one, or only a few students, in which the tutor, a lecturer, or other academic staff member, gives individual attention to the students. \n\nThe tutorial system at Oxford and Cambridge is fundamental to methods of teaching at those universities, but it is by no means particular to them; Heythrop College (University of London), for instance, also offers a tutorial system with one-on-one teaching. It is rare for newer universities in the UK to have the resources to offer individual tuition ; a class of six to eight (or even more) students is a far more common tutorial size. However, at New College of the Humanities, established in 2011, one to one tutorials are integral to its teaching method. At Cambridge, a tutorial is known as a supervision.\n\nIn Australian, New Zealand, and South African universities, a tutorial (colloquially called a tute or tut) is a class of 10–30 students. Such tutorials are very similar to the Canadian system, although, tutorials are usually led by honours or postgraduate students, known as 'tutors'.\n\nAt the two campuses of St. John's College, U.S. and a few other American colleges with a similar version of the Great Books program, a \"tutorial\" is a class of 12–16 students who meet regularly with the guidance of a tutor. The tutorial focuses on a certain subject area (e.g., mathematics tutorial, language tutorial) and generally proceeds with careful reading of selected primary texts and working through associated exercises (e.g., demonstrating a Euclid proof or translating ancient Greek poetry). Since formal lectures do not play a large part in the St. John's College curriculum, the tutorial is the primary method by which certain subjects are studied. However, at St. John's the tutorial is considered ancillary to the seminar, in which a slightly larger group of students meets with two tutors for broader discussion of the particular texts on the seminar list.\n\nSome US colleges, such as Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, offer tutorials almost identical in structure to that of an Oxbridge tutorial. At Williams, students in tutorials typically work in pairs alongside a professor and meet weekly, while alternately presenting position papers or critiques of their partner's paper.\n\nThere are also specialized schools for tutoring such as, Kumon and EduHub. These supplemental hands-on learning programs are especially popular in Asia.\n\nOffered as a service or deliverables to its members, conference tutorials are one example of a continuing education activity sponsored by a technical and professional association.\n\nA tutorial in high schools in the United States may also mean a session for homework or other private study. \n\nInternet computer tutorials can take the form of a screen recording (screencast), a written document (either online or downloadable), interactive tutorial, or an audio file, where a person will give step by step instructions on how to do something.\n\nTutorials usually have the following characteristics:\n\n\nWhile many writers refer to a mere list of instructions or tips as a tutorial, this usage can be misleading.\n\nIn computer-based education, a tutorial is a computer program whose purpose is to assist users in learning how to use parts of a software product such as an office suite or any other application, operating system interface, programming tool, or video game. There are three kinds of software tutorials: 1) video tutorials that the user views, 2) interactive tutorials where the user follows on-screen instructions (and—in some cases—watches short instruction movies), whereupon he/she does the tutorial exercises and receives feedback depending on his/her actions; and 3) webinars where users participate in real-time lectures, online tutoring, or workshops remotely using web conferencing software.\n\n"}

The university today serves approximately 17,000 students, and is one of eight universities in Norway.\n\nAlthough the university was founded as late as 1946, academic activity had taken place in Bergen since the founding of Bergen Cathedral School in 1153, the Seminarium Fredericianum in 1750 and the establishment of the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy in 1817. Academia and higher education would also be significanlty advanced in the city with the establishment of Bergen Museum, later renamed \"University Museum of Bergen\", in 1825. Founded by Wilhelm Frimann Christie and Jacob Neumann, the museum became a venue for both research and education specialized on natural science, and featured prominent researcher like Michael Sars, Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Fridtjof Nansen. \n\nBergen would eventually become a city with several arenas for higher education and research with the Geophysical Institute being established in 1917, the Chr. Michelsen Institute in 1930, the Norwegian School of Economics in 1936 and finally the university in 1946.\n\nThe University of Bergen has an elected rector, currently Dag Rune Olsen (As of August 1, 2013–present). The university has 7 faculties, the newst being \"The Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design\" which was established in 2017. The University of Bergen Library and the University Museum of Bergen have a faculty-like status. Most of the university campus and administration is located in the Nygård neighbourhood, which has resulted in the campus area often being referred to as \"Nygårdshøyden\" or simply \"høyden\", meaning \"the hill\". \n\nIn 2010 the university was ranked as number 135 worldwide by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and 181st worldwide by the 2015/16 QS World University Rankings. UiB was also ranked number 148 worldwide in the July 2010 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities. The URAP (University Ranking by Academic Performance) has ranked UiB for 2014/2015 as the 219th worldwide.\n\nThe University of Bergen, in common with other Norwegian universities, does not charge tuition fees, which also applies to international students. Students are however required to be members of the student welfare organisation. As of Fall 2015, this fee (\"semesteravgift\") is NOK 590 (approx. US$ 72) per semester, and provides access to several services, including cultural activities, childcare, refunds for many medical expenses and subsidized accommodation. 40kr of the fee is a donation to the SAIH, a student charity, but this is optional. However most of the students give the donation.\n\n\nThe faculty revised its structure and names in August 2007.\n\nThe Faculty of Law was established as a separate faculty in 1980, with legal studies and research having been conducted at the university since 1969. The faculty is one of three Norwegian institutions which offer legal studies, the other two being the law faculties at the University of Oslo and the University of Tromsø. The faculty offers a five-year programme leading to a Master's degree in law and a three-year PhD programme, and currently has approximately 1900 students.\n\n\nSince January 2013 the faculty is organised in the following departments and units:\n\nThe University of Bergen is the only institution in the Nordic countries where the study of psychology has been assigned to its own faculty. Established in 1980, it educates psychologists and is responsible for the University's pedagogic education.\n\n\nThe University also has an Arboretum and Botanical Garden.\n\n"}
