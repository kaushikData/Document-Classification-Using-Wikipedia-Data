It is a non-profit private council that evaluates and accredits medical residency and internship programs. The ACGME was founded in 1981 and was preceded by the Liaison Committee for Graduate Medical Education, which was established in 1972.\nThe ACGME currently oversees the post-graduate education and training for all MD and the majority of DO physicians in the United States. Plans call for the ACGME to oversee the Unified Accreditation System for all MDs and DOs in 2015.\n\nThe ACGME's member organizations are the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies each of whom appoints four members to the ACGME's board of directors.\n\nIn 2014, the ACGME, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) announced an agreement to pursue a single, unified accreditation system for graduate medical education programs in the United States beginning in 2015. Plans call for the ACGME to accredit all osteopathic graduate medical education programs by 2020.\nThe Clinical Learning Environment Review project promotes patient safety, quality during changes in care, appropriate supervision of care, managing fatigue of residents, and increasing the professionalism of physicians.\n\nBy June 30, 2020, all US residency programs will be ACGME-accredited. Before this date, only MD residencies were ACGME-accredited, while DO residencies were AOA-accredited.\n\nThe Outcome Project began in 2001 with a set of assessments for measuring physician competence. By 2009, it was recognized that ACGME measurements could not reliably be evaluated independently of each other and instead should be used together and with other measurements.\n\nThe ACGME introduced milestones in internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery for assessing progress of residents toward the six identified competencies. Milestones can be evaluated by numerous methods ranging from direct observation of clinical encounters to medical simulation.\n\nAwards handed out by the ACGME include the David C Leach award and Palmer award. Many of the awardees have notably earned multiple national level awards including both ACGME and American Medical Association award recognition.\n\n"}

Teachers may be involved in primary, secondary, or university education. Additionally, retired and student teachers are welcome. Currently there are about 10,000 members. As the interest in French has declined in the United States since 1980's, the organisation has held annual convention to bring together a cross-section of teachers and educators to find ways to promote French in traditional curriculum and other methods.\n\nThe AATF's official publication is called \"The French Review\", which has the largest circulation of any scholarly journal on the French language.\n\nThe National French Contest was established in 1936 by the Executive Council of AATF to help determine the relative student achievement in the learning of French in the United States. Originally the contest was called Le Grand Concours National de Français but was later shortened to Le Grand Concours. \n\nThe annual contest currently has around 100,000 participants from elementary schools to high schools in all chapters nationwide. There are seven levels. The first level called FLES is for elementary school students. Levels 01, and 1 to 5 are for grades 7 to 12. In each level, there are divisions A to E to separate students based on prior exposure to French. About 0.1% of all participants receive gold medals for National Rank 1. About 0.7% receive silver medals for National Ranks 2 to 3. About 8% receive bronze medals for National Ranks 4 to 10.\n\n"}

{"id": "652248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=652248", "title": "Bogdanov affair", "text": "Bogdanov affair\n\nThe Bogdanov affair is an academic dispute regarding the legitimacy of a series of theoretical physics papers written by French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov (alternately spelt Bogdanoff). These papers were published in reputable scientific journals, and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at the Big Bang.\n\nThe controversy began in 2002 when Max Niedermaier, a physicist at the University of Tours, emailed Ted Newman, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, alleging that the twins—who had previously gained celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had \"spoofed\" their PhD theses. Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals. While the Bogdanov brothers continued to defend the veracity of their work, the debate over whether or not the work represented a contribution to physics spread from Usenet to many other Internet forums, including the blogs of notable physicists. The ensuing dispute received considerable coverage in the mainstream media. A Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) internal report eventually concluded that their theses had no scientific value.\n\nThe authors have Ph.D. degrees from the University of Burgundy; Grichka Bogdanov received his degree in mathematics, and Igor Bogdanov received his in theoretical physics (in 1999 and 2002 respectively). Both were given the low, unusual, but passing grade of \"honorable\"; Igor initially failed and was required to publish three papers in peer-reviewed journals before being given a degree. When later challenges to the legitimacy of the Bogdanovs' papers arose, the debate spread to the question of whether a publication requirement is a valid means of evaluating students' work. The incident also prompted considerable reflection among physicists as to how and why the peer review system can fail.\n\n The Bogdanov brothers were born in 1949 in the Commune of Saint-Lary, in the Gascony region of southwest France. The brothers claim that their parents came from aristocratic Russian and Austrian families, and that their maternal grandfather was noted African-American lyric tenor Roland Hayes. The brothers each studied applied mathematics in Paris, but then began careers in television, hosting several popular programs on science and science fiction. The first of these, \"Temps X\" (\"Time X\"), ran from 1979 to 1989.\n\nIn 1991 the Bogdanovs published a book, \"Dieu et la Science\" (\"God and Science\"), drawn from interviews with the philosopher Jean Guitton, which became a French bestseller. This book provoked a dispute of its own when University of Virginia astronomy professor Trinh Xuan Thuan accused the Bogdanovs of plagiarizing his 1988 book \"The Secret Melody: And Man Created the Universe\". After a legal battle in France, Thuan and the Bogdanovs settled out of court, and the Bogdanovs later denied all wrongdoing. Thuan suggests that the plagiarism suit pressed the brothers to obtain doctorates as fast as possible, since (according to Thuan) the back cover of the book claimed that the Bogdanovs held doctorates when they did not. In 1993, the brothers began work toward doctorates, first working under the mathematical physicist Moshé Flato of the University of Burgundy. Flato died in 1998, and his colleague Daniel Sternheimer (of CNRS) took over the job of supervising the Bogdanovs. According to Sternheimer, the twins viewed themselves as \"the Einstein brothers\" and had a propensity to voice vague, \"impressionistic\" statements; he considered guiding their efforts \"like teaching My Fair Lady to speak with an Oxford accent.\" As he told \"The Chronicle of Higher Education,\" Sternheimer did not consider himself an expert in all the topics Grichka Bogdanov included in his thesis, but judged that those portions within his specialty were Ph.D.-quality work.\n\nGrichka Bogdanov was given a Ph.D. by the University of Burgundy (Dijon) in 1999, though this doctorate is sometimes erroneously described as having been granted by the École Polytechnique. He originally applied for a degree in physics, but was instead given one in mathematics, and was first required to significantly rewrite his thesis, de-emphasizing the physics content. Around the same time, Igor Bogdanov failed the defense of his thesis. His advisors subsequently agreed to allow him to obtain a doctorate if he could publish three peer-reviewed journal articles. In 2002, after publishing the requisite articles, Igor was given a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Burgundy. Both of the brothers received the lowest passing grade of \"honorable,\" which is seldom given, as Daniel Sternheimer told \"New York Times\" science reporter Dennis Overbye. In justifying the conferring of doctoral degrees to the Bogdanovs, Sternheimer told the \"Times\", \"These guys worked for 10 years without pay. They have the right to have their work recognized with a diploma, which is nothing much these days.\"\n\nIn 2001 and 2002 the brothers published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including \"Annals of Physics\" and \"Classical and Quantum Gravity\". The controversy over the Bogdanovs' work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by University of Tours physicist Max Niedermaier to University of Pittsburgh physicist Ezra T. Newman. Niedermaier suggested that the Bogdanovs' Ph.D. theses and papers were \"spoof[s],\" created by throwing together instances of theoretical-physics jargon, including terminology from string theory: \"The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which apparently have been taken seriously.\" Copies of the email reached American mathematical physicist John Baez, and on October 23 he created a discussion thread about the Bogdanovs' work on the Usenet newsgroup \"sci.physics.research\", titled \"Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?\" Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs' publications to the 1996 Sokal affair, in which physicist Alan Sokal successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a cultural studies journal in order to criticize that field's lax standards for discussing science. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed. The story spread in public media, prompting Niedermaier to offer an apology to the Bogdanovs, admitting that he had not read the papers firsthand. The Bogdanovs' background in entertainment lent some plausibility to the idea that they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation. The online discussion was quickly followed by media attention; \"The Register\" reported on the dispute on November 1, 2002 and stories in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", \"Nature\", \"The New York Times\", and other publications appeared soon after.\n\nOne of the scientists who approved Igor Bogdanov's thesis, MIT's Roman Jackiw, spoke to \"New York Times\" reporter Dennis Overbye. Overbye wrote that Jackiw was intrigued by the thesis, although it contained many points he did not understand. Jackiw defended the thesis:All these were ideas that could possibly make sense. It showed some originality and some familiarity with the jargon. That's all I ask.\n\nIn contrast, Ignatios Antoniadis (of the École Polytechnique), who approved Grichka Bogdanov's thesis, later reversed his judgment of it. Antoniadis told \"Le Monde,\"\n\nI had given a favorable opinion for Grichka's defense, based on a rapid and indulgent reading of the thesis text. Alas, I was completely mistaken. The scientific language was just an appearance behind which hid incompetence and ignorance of even basic physics.\n\nIn May 2001, the journal \"Classical and Quantum Gravity\" (CQG) reviewed an article authored by Igor and Grichka Bogdanov, titled \"Topological theory of the initial singularity of spacetime\". One of the referees' reports stated that the article was \"Sound, original, and of interest. With revisions I expect the paper to be suitable for publication.\" The paper was accepted by the journal seven months later.\n\nHowever, after the publication of the article and the publicity surrounding the controversy, mathematician Greg Kuperberg posted to Usenet a statement written by Andrew Wray and Hermann Nicolai of the CQG editorial board. Originally sent via e-mail, the statement read, in part,\n\nRegrettably, despite the best efforts, the refereeing process cannot be 100% effective. Thus the paper ... made it through the review process even though, in retrospect, it does not meet the standards expected of articles in this journal... The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that it should not have been published. Since then several steps have been taken to further improve the peer review process in order to improve the quality assessment on articles submitted to the journal and reduce the likelihood that this could happen again.\n\nThe paper in question has, however, not been withdrawn by the journal. Later, the editor-in-chief of the journal issued a slightly different statement on behalf of the Institute of Physics, which owns the journal, in which he insisted on the fact that their usual peer-review procedures had been followed, but no longer commented on the value of the paper. In particular the sentences \"...it does not meet the standards expected of articles in this journal\" and \"The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that it should not have been published\" were removed. The former phrase was, however, quoted in the \"New York Times,\" the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" and \"Nature.\" Moreover, \"Die Zeit\" quoted the journal's co-editor Hermann Nicolai as saying that had the paper reached his desk, he would have immediately rejected it.\n\nIn 2001, the \"Czechoslovak Journal of Physics\" accepted an article written by Igor Bogdanov, entitled \"Topological Origin of Inertia\". The referee's report concluded: \"In my opinion the results of the paper can be considered as original ones. I recommend the paper for publication but in a revised form.\" The following year, the \"Chinese Journal of Physics\" published Igor Bogdanov's \"The KMS state of spacetime at the Planck scale\". The report stated that \"the viewpoint presented in this paper can be interesting as a possible approach of the Planck scale physics.\" Some corrections were requested.\n\nNot all review evaluations were positive. Eli Hawkins, acting as a referee on behalf of the \"Journal of Physics A\", suggested rejecting one of the Bogdanovs' papers: \"It is difficult to describe what is wrong in Section 4, since almost nothing is right. [...] It would take up too much space to enumerate all the mistakes: indeed it is difficult to say where one error ends and the next begins. In conclusion, I would not recommend that this paper be published in this, or any, journal.\"\n\nAfter the start of the Usenet discussion, most comments were critical of the Bogdanovs' work. For example, John C. Baez stated that the Bogdanov papers are \"a mishmash of superficially plausible sentences containing the right buzzwords in approximately the right order. There is no logic or cohesion in what they write.\" Jacques Distler voiced a similar opinion, proclaiming \"The [Bogdanovs'] papers consist of buzzwords from various fields of mathematical physics, string theory and quantum gravity, strung together into syntactically correct, but semantically meaningless prose.\"\n\nOthers compared the quality of the Bogdanov papers with that seen over a wider arena. \"The Bogdanoffs' work is significantly more incoherent than just about anything else being published\", wrote Peter Woit. He continued, \"But the increasingly low standard of coherence in the whole field is what allowed them to think they were doing something sensible and to get it published.\" Woit later devoted a chapter of his book \"Not Even Wrong\" (2006) to the Bogdanov Affair.\n\nParticipants in the discussions were particularly unconvinced by a statement in the \"Topological origin of inertia\" paper that \"whatever the orientation, the plane of oscillation of Foucault's pendulum is necessarily aligned with the initial singularity marking the origin of physical space.\" In addition, the paper claimed, the Foucault pendulum experiment \"cannot be explained satisfactorily in either classical or relativistic mechanics\". The physicists commenting on Usenet found these claims and subsequent attempts at their explanation peculiar, since the trajectory of a Foucault pendulum—a standard museum piece—is accurately predicted by classical mechanics. The Bogdanovs explained that these claims would only be clear in the context of topological field theory. Baez and Russell Blackadar attempted to determine the meaning of the \"plane of oscillation\" statement; after the Bogdanovs issued some elaborations, Baez concluded that it was a complicated way of rephrasing the following:\nSince the big bang happened everywhere, no matter which way a pendulum swings, the plane in which it swings can be said to \"intersect the big bang\".\nHowever, Baez pointed out, this statement does not in fact concern the Big Bang, and is entirely equivalent to the following:\nNo matter which way a pendulum swings, there is some point on the plane in which it swings.\nYet this rephrasing is itself equivalent to the statement Any plane contains a point. If \"this\" was the essence of the statement, Baez noted, it cannot be very useful in \"explaining the origin of inertia\".\n\nUrs Schreiber, then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hamburg, noted that the mention of the Foucault pendulum was at odds with the papers' general tone, since they generally relied upon more \"modern terminology\". (According to George Johnson, the Foucault pendulum is \"an icon of French science that would belong in any good Gallic spoof.\") Schreiber identified five central ideas in the Bogdanovs' work—\"'result' A\" through \"'result' E\"—which are expressed in the jargon of statistical mechanics, topological field theory and cosmology. One bit of jargon, the Hagedorn temperature, comes from string theory, but as Schreiber notes, the paper does not use this concept in any detail; moreover, since the paper is manifestly not a string theory treatise, \"considering the role the Hagedorn temperature plays in string cosmology, this is bordering on self-parody.\" Schreiber concludes that the fourth \"result\" (that the spacetime metric \"at the initial singularity\" must be Riemannian) contradicts the initial assumption of their argument (an FRW cosmology with \"pseudo\"-Riemannian metric). The fifth and last \"result\", Schreiber notes, is an attempt to resolve this contradiction by \"invok[ing] quantum mechanics\". The Bogdanovs themselves described Schreiber's summary as \"very accurate\"; for more on this point, see below. Schreiber concluded,\nJust to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out what I think are the central 'ideas' the authors had when writing their articles and how this led them to their conclusions.\n\nEli Hawkins of Pennsylvania State University voiced a similar concern about \"The KMS state of spacetime at the Planck scale\".\n\nThe main result of this paper is that this thermodynamic equilibrium should be a KMS state. This almost goes without saying; for a quantum system, the KMS condition is just the concrete definition of thermodynamic equilibrium. The hard part is identifying the quantum system to which the condition should be applied, which is not done in this paper.\n\nBoth Baez and, later, Peter Woit noted that content was largely repeated from one Bogdanov paper to another.\nDamien Calaque of the Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, commented negatively about Grichka Bogdanov's unpublished preprint \"Construction of cocycle bicrossproducts by twisting\". In Calaque's estimation, the results presented in the preprint did not have sufficient novelty and interest to merit an independent journal article, and moreover the principal theorem was, in its current formulation, false: Grichka's construction yields a bialgebra which is not necessarily a Hopf algebra, the latter being a type of mathematical object which must satisfy additional conditions.\n\nEventually, the controversy attracted mainstream media attention, opening new avenues for physicists' comments to be disseminated. \"Le Monde\" quoted Alain Connes, recipient of the 1982 Fields Medal, as saying, \"I didn't need long to convince myself that they're talking about things that they haven't mastered.\" Nobel laureate Georges Charpak stated on a French talk show that the Bogdanovs' presence in the scientific community was \"nonexistent\".\n\nThe most positive comments about the papers themselves came from string theorist Luboš Motl:\n\n...Some of the papers of the Bogdanoff brothers are really painful and clearly silly ... But the most famous paper about the solution of the initial singularity is a bit different; it is more sophisticated.\n\n...it does not surprise me much that Roman Jackiw said that the paper satisfied everything he expects from an acceptable paper—the knowledge of the jargon and some degree of original ideas. (And be sure that Jackiw, Kounnas, and Majid were not the only ones with this kind of a conclusion.)\n\n...Technically, their paper connects too many things. It would be too good if all these ideas and (correct) formulae were necessary for a justification of a working solution to the initial singularity problem. But if one accepts that the papers about these difficult questions don't have to be just a well-defined science but maybe also a bit of inspiring art, the brothers have done a pretty good job, I think. And I want to know the answers to many questions that are opened in their paper.\n\nMotl's measured support for \"Topological field theory of the initial singularity of spacetime\", however, stands in stark contrast to Robert Oeckl's official MathSciNet review, which states that the paper is \"rife with nonsensical or meaningless statements and suffers from a serious lack of coherence,\" follows up with several examples to illustrate his point, and concludes that the paper \"falls short of scientific standards and appears to have no meaningful content.\" An official report from the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), which became public in 2010, summarized the Bogdanovs' theses thusly: \"Ces thèses n’ont pas de valeur scientifique. […] Rarement aura-t-on vu un travail creux habillé avec une telle sophistication\" (\"These theses have no scientific value. [...] Rarely have we seen a hollow work dressed with such sophistication\"\"\")\".\"\n\nIn addition to a few articles in print media, the Bogdanov Affair has been discussed extensively in various newsgroups, webpages and blogs; the Bogdanov brothers have often participated in the discussions, sometimes using pseudonyms or represented by friends acting as proxies. They have used these methods to defend their work and sometimes to insult their critics, among them the Nobel Prize recipient Georges Charpak.\n\nIn October 2002, the Bogdanovs released an email containing apparently supportive statements by Laurent Freidel, then a visiting professor at the Perimeter Institute. Soon after, Freidel denied writing any such remarks, telling the press that he had forwarded a message containing that text to a friend. The Bogdanovs then attributed the quoted passages to Freidel, who said, \"I'm very upset about that because I have received e-mail from people in the community asking me why I've defended the Bogdanov brothers. When your name is used without your consent, it's a violation.\"\n\nAt the start of the controversy in the moderated group \"sci.physics.research\", Igor Bogdanov denied that their published papers were a hoax, but when asked precise questions from physicists Steve Carlip and John Baez regarding mathematical details in the papers, failed to convince any other participants that these papers had any real scientific value. \"New York Times\" reporter George Johnson described reading through the debate as \"like watching someone trying to nail Jell-O to a wall\", for the Bogdanovs had \"developed their own private language, one that impinges on the vocabulary of science only at the edges.\"\n\nAt the beginning of 2004, Igor Bogdanov began to post on French Usenet physics groups and Internet forums, continuing the pattern of behavior seen on \"sci.physics.research.\" A controversy began on the French Wikipedia when Igor Bogdanov and his supporters began to edit that encyclopedia's , prompting the creation of a new article dedicated to the debate (\"\"—\"Debate surrounding the work of the Bogdanov brothers\"). The dispute then spread to the English Wikipedia. In November 2005, this led the Arbitration Committee, a dispute resolution panel that acts as the project's court of last resort, to ban anyone deemed to be a participant in the external dispute from editing the English Wikipedia's article on the Bogdanov Affair. A number of English Wikipedia users, including Igor Bogdanov himself, were explicitly named in this ban. In 2006, Baez wrote on his website that for some time the Bogdanovs and \"a large crowd of sock puppets\" had been attempting to rewrite the English Wikipedia article on the controversy \"to make it less embarrassing to them\". \"Nobody seems to be fooled\", he added.\n\nThe participation of an unidentified \"Professor Yang\" provoked additional confusion. Using an e-mail address at the domain \"th-phys.edu.hk\", an individual publishing under this name wrote to a number of individuals and on the Internet to defend the Bogdanov papers. This individual wrote to physicists John Baez, Jacques Distler and Peter Woit; to \"New York Times\" journalist Dennis Overbye; and on numerous physics blogs and forums, signing his name \"Professor L. Yang—Theoretical Physics Laboratory, International Institute of Mathematical Physics—HKU/Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.\" It is the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology which is located in Clear Water Bay, not Hong Kong University (HKU), whose main campus is located in the Mid-Levels of Hong Kong Island.\n\nThe Bogdanovs have claimed several times that the \"domain name 'th-phys.edu.hk' was officially owned by Hong Kong University.\" This was not confirmed officially by HKU and no Prof. Yang existed on the roster of the HKU physics department; nor did the university have an \"International Institute of Mathematical Physics\".\n\nSuspicions were consequently raised that Professor L. Yang was actually a pseudonym of the Bogdanovs. However, Igor Bogdanov has maintained that Professor Yang is a real mathematical physicist with expertise in KMS theory, a friend of his, and that he was posting anonymously from Igor's apartment.\n\nFollowing this pattern, another academic domain name was also registered in Latvia (phys-maths.edu.lv), hosting the \"Mathematical Center of Riemannian Cosmology\". Again, this apparent educational institution was registered by Igor Bogdanov. When asked why the Center's website had a Latvian top-level domain, Igor claimed that it had been established and hosted by the University of Riga, after the brothers had attended a conference there in either 2001 or 2002.\n\nIn 2002, the Bogdanovs launched a new weekly TV show \"Rayons X\" (\"X Rays\") on French public channel France 2. In August 2004, they presented a 90-minute special cosmology program in which they introduced their theory among other cosmological scenarios. The French mainstream media, in both the press and on the Internet, covered the renewed controversy to some extent; media outlets that reported upon it include \"Acrimed\" and \"Ciel et Espace.\"\nIn 2004, the Bogdanovs published a commercially successful popular science book, \"Avant Le Big Bang\" (\"Before the Big Bang\"), based on a simplified version of their theses, where they also presented their point of view about the affair. Both the book and the Bogdanovs' television shows have been criticized for elementary scientific inaccuracies. Critics cite examples from \"Avant Le Big Bang\" including a statement that the \"golden number\" φ (\"phi\") is transcendental, an assumption that the limit of a decreasing sequence is always zero, and that the expansion of the Universe implies that the planets of the Solar System have grown farther apart.\n\nIn October 2004, a journalist from \"Ciel et Espace\" interviewed Shahn Majid of Queen Mary, University of London about his report on Grichka Bogdanov's thesis. Majid said that the French version of his report on Grichka's thesis was \"an unauthorized translation partially invented by the Bogdanovs.\" In one sentence, the English word \"interesting\" was translated as the French \"\"important\".\" A \"draft [mathematical] construction\" became \"la première construction [mathématique]\" (\"the first [mathematical] construction\"). Elsewhere, an added word demonstrated, according to Majid, that \"Bogdanov does not understand his own draft results.\" Majid also described more than ten other modifications of meaning, each one biased towards \"surestimation outrancière\"—\"outrageous over-estimation.\" Majid said that his original report described a \"very weak\" student who nevertheless demonstrated \"an impressive amount of determination to obtain a doctorate.\" Later, Majid claimed in a Usenet post that, in an addendum to \"Avant Le Big Bang,\" Grichka intentionally misquoted Majid's opinion on the way this interview had been transcribed.\n\nAdditionally, in the same addendum, a critical analysis of their work made by post-doc Urs Schreiber, and affirmed by the Bogdanovs as \"very accurate\", was included with the exception of the concluding remark \"Just to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning\", thus inverting the meaning from criticism into ostensible support. Moreover, a comment by physicist Peter Woit written as, \"It's certainly possible that you have some new worthwhile results on quantum groups\", was translated as \"Il est tout à fait certain que vous avez obtenu des résultats nouveaux et utiles dans les groupes quantiques\" (\"It is completely certain that you have obtained new and useful results on quantum groups\") and published by the Bogdanovs in the addendum of their book.\n\nIn December 2004, the Bogdanovs sued \"Ciel et Espace\" for defamation over the publication of a critical article entitled \"The Mystification of the Bogdanovs\". In September 2006, the case was dismissed after the Bogdanovs missed court deadlines; they were ordered to pay 2500 euros to the magazine's publisher to cover its legal costs. There was never a substantive ruling on whether or not the Bogdanovs had been defamed.\nAlain Riazuelo, an astrophysicist at the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris, participated in many of the online discussions of the Bogdanovs' work. He posted an unpublished version of Grichka Bogdanov's PhD thesis on his personal website, along with his critical analysis. Bogdanov subsequently described this version as \"dating from 1991 and too unfinished to be made public\". Rather than suing Riazuelo for defamation, Bogdanov filed a criminal complaint of copyright (\"droit d'auteur\") violation against him in May 2011. The police detained and interrogated Riazuelo. He came to trial and was convicted in March 2012. The sentence was lenient: a fine of 2000 euros the court imposed was suspended, and only one euro of damages was awarded. But in passing judgement the court stated that the scientist had \"lacked prudence\", given \"the fame of the plaintiff\".\n\nThe verdict outraged many scientists, who felt that the police and courts should have no say in a discussion of the scientific merits of a piece of work. In April 2012, a group of 170 scientists published an open letter titled \"L'affaire Bogdanoff: Liberté, Science et Justice, Des scientifiques revendiquent leur droit au blâme\" (\"The Bogdanov Affair: Liberty, Science and Justice, scientists claim their right to blame\").\n\nIn 2005, the Bogdanovs became professors at Megatrend University in Belgrade where they were appointed Chairs of Cosmology and said to direct the Megatrend Laboratory of Cosmology. Mića Jovanović, the rector and owner of Megatrend University, wrote a preface for the Serbian edition of \"Avant le Big Bang.\" Jovanović later became embroiled in controversy and resigned his post when it was revealed that he had not obtained a PhD at the London School of Economics as he had claimed. This scandal, combined with the presence of the Bogdanovs, contributed to an atmosphere of controversy surrounding Megatrend.\n\nDuring the heyday of this affair, some media coverage cast a negative light on theoretical physics, stating or at least strongly implying that it has become impossible to distinguish a valid paper from a hoax. Overbye's article in the \"New York Times\" voiced this opinion, for example, as did Declan Butler's piece in \"Nature.\" Posters on blogs and Usenet used the affair to criticize the present status of string theory; for the same reason, Woit devoted a chapter of \"Not Even Wrong,\" a book emphatically critical of string theory, to the affair. On the other hand, George Johnson's report in \"The New York Times\" concludes that physicists have generally decided the papers are \"probably just the result of fuzzy thinking, bad writing and journal referees more comfortable with correcting typos than challenging thoughts.\" String theorist Aaron Bergman riposted in a review of \"Not Even Wrong\" that Woit's conclusion\nis undermined by a number of important elisions in the telling of the story, the most important of which is that the writings of the Bogdanovs, to the extent that one can make sense of them, \"have almost nothing to do with string theory.\" ... I first learned of the relevant papers in a posting on the internet by Dr. John Baez. Having found a copy of one of the relevant papers available online, I posted that \"the referee clearly didn't even glance at it.\" While the papers were full of rather abstruse prose about a wide variety of technical areas, it was easy to identify outright nonsense in the areas about which I had some expertise. ... A pair of non-string theorists were able to get nonsensical papers generally not about string theory published in journals not generally used by string theorists. This is surely an indictment of something, but its relevance to string theory is marginal at best.\n\nJacques Distler mused that the tone of the media coverage had more to do with journalistic practices than with physics.\nThe much-anticipated New York Times article on the Bogdanov scandal has appeared. Alas, it suffers from the usual journalistic conceit that a proper newspaper article must cover a \"controversy\". There must be two sides to the controversy, and the reporter's job is to elicit quotes from both parties and present them side-by-side. Almost inevitably, this \"balanced\" approach sheds no light on the matter, and leaves the reader shaking his head, \"There they go again...\"\n\nMany comments have been made on the possible shortcomings of the referral system for published articles, and also on the criteria for acceptance of a thesis and subsequent delivery of a Doctorate of Philosophy. Frank Wilczek, who edited \"Annals of Physics\" (and is now a Nobel laureate), told the press that the scandal motivated him to correct the journal's slipping standards, partly by assigning more reviewing duties to the editorial board.\n\nPrior to the controversy, the reports on the Bogdanov theses and most of the journal referees' reports spoke favorably of their work, describing it as original and containing interesting ideas. This has been the basis of concerns raised about the efficacy of the peer-review system that the scientific community and academia use to determine the merit of submitted manuscripts for publication; one concern is that over-worked and unpaid referees may not be able to thoroughly judge the value of a paper in the little time they can afford to spend on it. Regarding the Bogdanov publications, physicist Steve Carlip remarked:\n\nReferees are volunteers, who as a whole put in a great deal of work for no credit, no money, and little or no recognition, for the good of the community. Sometimes a referee makes a mistake. Sometimes two referees make mistakes at the same time.\n\nI'm a little surprised that anyone is surprised at this. Surely you've seen bad papers published in good journals before this! ... referees give opinions; the real peer review begins after a paper is published.\n\nSimilarly, Richard Monastersky, writing in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", observed, \"There is one way...for physicists to measure the importance of the Bogdanovs' work. If researchers find merit in the twins' ideas, those thoughts will echo in the references of scientific papers for years to come.\" Before the controversy over their work arose, the scientific community had shown practically no interest in the Bogdanovs' papers; indeed, according to Stony Brook physics professor Jacobus Verbaarschot, who served on Igor Bogdanov's dissertation committee, without the hoax rumors \"probably no one would have ever known about their articles.\" , the Bogdanovs' most recent paper was \"Thermal Equilibrium and KMS Condition at the Planck Scale\", which was submitted to the \"Chinese Annals of Mathematics\" in 2001 and appeared in 2003. That journal ceased publication in 2005.\n\nSeveral sources have referred to the Bogdanov affair as a \"reverse Sokal\" hoax, drawing a comparison with the Sokal affair, where the physicist Alan Sokal published a deliberately fraudulent and indeed nonsensical article in the humanities journal \"Social Text.\" Sokal's original aim had been to test the effects of the intellectual trend he called, \"for want of a better term, postmodernism\". Worried by this \"more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment\", Sokal decided to perform an experiment which he later cheerfully admitted was both unorthodox and uncontrolled, provoking a maelstrom of reactions which, to his surprise, received coverage in \"Le Monde\" and even the front page of \"The New York Times.\" The physicist John Baez drew a comparison between the two events in his October 2002 post to the \"sci.physics.research\" newsgroup.\n\nBoth Igor and Grichka Bogdanov have vigorously insisted upon the validity of their work, and possess academic degrees in the fields in which they are publishing, although the \"bona fides\" of their credentials are a bone of contention. In comparison, Alan Sokal was an outsider to the field in which he was publishing—a physicist, publishing in a humanities journal—and promptly issued a statement himself that his paper was a deliberate hoax; indeed, Sokal published the article to expose the weakness of the journal's editorial process. Replying on \"sci.physics.research\", Sokal referred readers to his follow-up essay, in which he notes \"the mere fact of publication of my parody\" only proved that one particular journal's editors were \"derelict in their intellectual duty\". (According to \"The New York Times\", Sokal was \"almost disappointed\" that the Bogdanovs had not attempted a hoax after his own style. \"What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\", he said.) Baez, who made a comparison between the two affairs, later retracted, saying that the brothers \"have lost too much face for [withdrawing the work as a hoax] to be a plausible course of action\".\n\nIn a letter to \"The New York Times\", Cornell physics professor Paul Ginsparg writes that the contrast between the cases is plainly evident: \"here, the authors were evidently aiming to be credentialed by the intellectual prestige of the discipline rather than trying to puncture any intellectual pretension.\" He adds that the fact some journals and scientific institutions have low or variable standards is \"hardly a revelation\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "209443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209443", "title": "Civil society", "text": "Civil society\n\nCivil society can be understood as the \"third sector\" of society, distinct from government and business, and including the family and the private sphere. By other authors, \"civil society\" is used in the sense of 1) the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens or 2) individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.\n\nSometimes the term \"civil society\" is used in the more general sense of \"the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society\" (\"Collins English Dictionary\"). Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a normative concept of civic values.\n\nThe term \"civil society\" goes back to Aristotle's phrase \"koinōnía politikḗ\" (κοινωνία πολιτική), occurring in his \"Politics\", where it refers to a ‘political community’, commensurate with the Greek city-state (\"polis\") characterized by a shared set of norms and ethos, in which free citizens on an equal footing lived under the rule of law. The \"telos\" or end of civil society, thus defined, was eudaimonia (τὸ εὖ ζῆν \"tò eu zēn\") (often translated as human flourishing or common well-being), in as man was defined as a ‘political (social) animal’ (ζῷον πολιτικόν \"zōon politikón\"). The concept was used by Roman writers, such as Cicero, where it referred to the ancient notion of a republic (\"res publica\"). It re-entered into Western political discourse following one of the late medieval translations of Aristotle’s \"Politics\" into Latin by Leonardo Bruni who as a first translated \"koinōnía politikḗ\" into \"societas civilis\". With the rise of a distinction between monarchical autonomy and public law, the term then gained currency to denote the corporate estates (\"Ständestaat\") of a feudal elite of land-holders as opposed to the powers exercised by the prince. It had a long history in state theory, and was revived with particular force in recent times, in Eastern Europe, where dissidents such as Václav Havel as late as in 1990's employed it to denote the sphere of civic associations threatened by the intrusive holistic state-dominated regimes of Communist Eastern Europe. The first post-modern usage of civil society as denoting political opposition stems from writings of Aleksander Smolar in 1978-79. However the term was not in use by Solidarity labor union in 1980-1981 and was popularized on a global scale by communist propaganda only in 1989 as a tool of legitimation of neoliberal transformation. \n\nThe literature on relations between civil society and democratic political society have their roots in classical liberal writings of G.W.F. Hegel from whom they were adapted by Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, and Ferdinand Tönnies. They were developed in significant ways by 20th century researchers Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba, who identified the role of political culture in a democratic order as vital.\n\nThey argued that the political element of political organizations facilitates better awareness and a more informed citizenry, who make better voting choices, participate in politics, and hold government more accountable as a result. The statutes of these organizations have often been considered micro-constitutions because they accustom participants to the formalities of democratic decision making.\n\nMore recently, Robert D. Putnam has argued that even non-political organizations in civil society are vital for democracy. This is because they build social capital, trust and shared values, which are transferred into the political sphere and help to hold society together, facilitating an understanding of the interconnectedness of society and interests within it.\n\nOthers, however, have questioned how democratic civil society actually is. Some have noted that the civil society actors have now obtained a remarkable amount of political power without anyone directly electing or appointing them. It has also been argued that civil society is biased towards the global north. Partha Chatterjee has argued that, in most of the world, \"civil society is demographically limited.\" For Jai Sen civil society is a neo-colonial project driven by global elites in their own interests. Finally, other scholars have argued that, since the concept of civil society is closely related to democracy and representation, it should in turn be linked with ideas of nationality and nationalism. Latest analyses suggest that civil society is a neoliberal ideology legitimizing antidemocratic attack of economic elites on institutions of the welfare state through the development of the third sector as its substitute.\n\nConstitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including budget process. The term \"constitutional economics\" was used by American economist James M. Buchanan as a name for a new budget planning and the latter's transparency to the civil society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.\n\nCritics and activists currently often apply the term \"civil society\" to the domain of social life which needs to be protected against globalization, and to the sources of resistance thereto, because it is seen as acting beyond boundaries and across different territories. However, as civil society can, under many definitions, include and be funded and directed by those businesses and institutions (especially donors linked to European and Northern states) who support globalization, this is a contested use. Rapid development of civil society on the global scale after the fall of the communist system was a part of neo-liberal strategies linked to the Washington Consensus. Some studies have also been published, which deal with unresolved issues regarding the use of the term in connection with the impact and conceptual power of the international aid system (see for example Tvedt 1998).\n\nOn the other hand, others see globalization as a social phenomenon expanding the sphere of classical liberal values, which inevitably led to a larger role for civil society at the expense of politically derived state institutions.\n\nThe integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System, developed by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), facilitates interactions between civil society organizations and DESA.\n\nCivil Societies also have become involved in the environmental policy making process. These groups impact the environmental policies by setting an agenda on fixing the harms done to the environment. They also get the public informed about environmental issues, which increases the public demand for environmental change.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the actual meaning of the concept of civil society has changed twice from its original, classical form. The first change occurred after the French Revolution, the second during the fall of communism in Europe.\n\nThe concept of civil society in its pre-modern classical republican understanding is usually connected to the early-modern thought of Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century. However, it has much older history in the realm of political thought. Generally, civil society has been referred to as a political association governing social conflict through the imposition of rules that restrain citizens from harming one another. In the classical period, the concept was used as a synonym for the good society, and seen as indistinguishable from the state. For instance, Socrates taught that conflicts within society should be resolved through public argument using ‘dialectic’, a form of rational dialogue to uncover truth. According to Socrates, public argument through ‘dialectic’ was imperative to ensure ‘civility’ in the polis and ‘good life’ of the people. For Plato, the ideal state was a just society in which people dedicate themselves to the common good, practice civic virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation and justice, and perform the occupational role to which they were best suited. It was the duty of the ‘philosopher king’ to look after people in civility. Aristotle thought the polis was an ‘association of associations’ that enables citizens to share in the virtuous task of ruling and being ruled. His \"koinonia politike\" as political community.\n\nThe concept of \"societas civilis\" is Roman and was introduced by Cicero. The political discourse in the classical period, places importance on the idea of a ‘good society’ in ensuring peace and order among the people. The philosophers in the classical period did not make any distinction between the state and society. Rather they held that the state represented the civil form of society and ‘civility’ represented the requirement of good citizenship. Moreover, they held that human beings are inherently rational so that they can collectively shape the nature of the society they belong to. In addition, human beings have the capacity to voluntarily gather for the common cause and maintain peace in society. By holding this view, we can say that classical political thinkers endorsed the genesis of civil society in its original sense.\n\nThe Middle Ages saw major changes in the topics discussed by political philosophers. Due to the unique political arrangements of feudalism, the concept of classical civil society practically disappeared from mainstream discussion. Instead conversation was dominated by problems of just war, a preoccupation that would last until the end of Renaissance.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War and the subsequent Treaty of Westphalia heralded the birth of the sovereign states system. The Treaty endorsed states as territorially-based political units having sovereignty. As a result, the monarchs were able to exert domestic control by emasculating the feudal lords and to stop relying on the latter for armed troops. Henceforth, monarchs could form national armies and deploy a professional bureaucracy and fiscal departments, which enabled them to maintain direct control and supreme authority over their subjects. In order to meet administrative expenditures, monarchs controlled the economy. This gave birth to absolutism. Until the mid-eighteenth century, absolutism was the hallmark of Europe.\n\nThe absolutist concept of the state was disputed in the Enlightenment period. As a natural consequence of Renaissance, Humanism, and the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment thinkers raised fundamental questions such as \"What legitimacy does heredity confer?\", \"Why are governments instituted?\", \"Why should some human beings have more basic rights than others?\", and so on. These questions led them to make certain assumptions about the nature of the human mind, the sources of political and moral authority, the reasons behind absolutism, and how to move beyond absolutism. The Enlightenment thinkers believed in the inherent goodness of the human mind. They opposed the alliance between the state and the Church as the enemy of human progress and well-being because the coercive apparatus of the state curbed individual liberty and the Church legitimated monarchs by positing the theory of divine origin. Therefore, both were deemed to be against the will of the people.\n\nStrongly influenced by the atrocities of Thirty Years' War, the political philosophers of the time held that social relations should be ordered in a different way from natural law conditions. Some of their attempts led to the emergence of social contract theory that contested social relations existing in accordance with human nature. They held that human nature can be understood by analyzing objective realities and natural law conditions. Thus they endorsed that the nature of human beings should be encompassed by the contours of state and established positive laws. Thomas Hobbes underlined the need of a powerful state to maintain civility in society. For Hobbes, human beings are motivated by self-interests (Graham 1997:23). Moreover, these self-interests are often contradictory in nature. Therefore, in state of nature, there was a condition of a war of all against all. In such a situation, life was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\" (Ibid: 25). Upon realizing the danger of anarchy, human beings became aware of the need of a mechanism to protect them. As far as Hobbes was concerned, rationality and self-interests persuaded human beings to combine in agreement, to surrender sovereignty to a common power (Kaviraj 2001:289). Hobbes called this common power, state, Leviathan.\n\nJohn Locke had a similar concept to Hobbes about the political condition in England. It was the period of the Glorious Revolution, marked by the struggle between the divine right of the Crown and the political rights of Parliament. This influenced Locke to forge a social contract theory of a limited state and a powerful society. In Locke’s view, human beings led also an unpeaceful life in the state of nature. However, it could be maintained at the sub-optimal level in the absence of a sufficient system (Brown 2001:73). From that major concern, people gathered together to sign a contract and constituted a common public authority. Nevertheless, Locke held that the consolidation of political power can be turned into autocracy, if it is not brought under reliable restrictions (Kaviraj 2001:291). Therefore, Locke set forth two treaties on government with reciprocal obligations. In the first treaty, people submit themselves to the common public authority. This authority has the power to enact and maintain laws. The second treaty contains the limitations of authority, i. e., the state has no power to threaten the basic rights of human beings. As far as Locke was concerned, the basic rights of human beings are the preservation of life, liberty and property. Moreover, he held that the state must operate within the bounds of civil and natural laws.\n\nBoth Hobbes and Locke had set forth a system, in which peaceful coexistence among human beings could be ensured through social pacts or contracts. They considered civil society as a community that maintained civil life, the realm where civic virtues and rights were derived from natural laws. However, they did not hold that civil society was a separate realm from the state. Rather, they underlined the co-existence of the state and civil society. The systematic approaches of Hobbes and Locke (in their analysis of social relations) were largely influenced by the experiences in their period. Their attempts to explain human nature, natural laws, the social contract and the formation of government had challenged the divine right theory. In contrast to divine right, Hobbes and Locke claimed that humans can design their political order. This idea had a great impact on the thinkers in the Enlightenment period.\n\nThe Enlightenment thinkers argued that human beings are rational and can shape their destiny. Hence, no need of an absolute authority to control them. Both Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a critic of civil society, and Immanuel Kant argued that people are peace lovers and that wars are the creation of absolute regimes (Burchill 2001:33). As far as Kant was concerned, this system was effective to guard against the domination of a single interest and check the tyranny of the majority (Alagappa 2004:30).\n\nG. W. F. Hegel completely changed the meaning of civil society, giving rise to a modern liberal understanding of it as a form of market society as opposed to institutions of modern nation state. While in classical republicanism civil society where synonymous with political society, Hegel distinguished political state and civil society, what was followed by Tocqueville's distinction between civil and political societies and associations, repeated by Marx and Tönnies.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Hegel considered civil society () as a separate realm, a \"system of needs\", that is the, \"[stage of] difference which intervenes between the family and the state.\" Civil society is the realm of economic relationships as it exists in the modern industrial capitalist society, for it had emerged at the particular period of capitalism and served its interests: individual rights and private property. Hence, he used the German term \"bürgerliche Gesellschaft\" to denote civil society as \"civilian society\" – a sphere regulated by the civil code. This new way of thinking about civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville and Karl Marx as well. For Hegel, civil society manifested contradictory forces. Being the realm of capitalist interests, there is a possibility of conflicts and inequalities within it (ex: mental and physical aptitude, talents and financial circumstances). He argued that these inequalities influence the choices that members are able to make in relation to the type of work they will do. The diverse positions in Civil Society fall into three estates: the substantial estate (agriculture), the formal estate (trade and industry), and the universal estate (civil society). A man is able to choose his estate, though his choice is limited by the aforementioned inequalities. However, Hegel argues that these inequalities enable all estates in Civil Society to be filled, which leads to a more efficient system on the whole.\n\nKarl Marx followed the Hegelian way of using the concept of civil society. For Marx, the emergence of the modern state created a realm of civil society that reduced society to private interests competing against each other. Political society was autonomised into the state, which was in turn ruled by the bourgeois class (consider also that suffrage only belonged, then, to propertied men). Marx, in his early writings, anticipated the abolition of the separation between state and civil society, and looked forward to the reunification of private and public/political realms (Colletti, 1975). Hence, Marx rejected the positive role of state put forth by Hegel. Marx argued that the state cannot be a neutral problem solver. Rather, he depicted the state as the defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie. He considered the state to be the executive arm of the bourgeoisie, which would wither away once the working class took democratic control of society.\n\nThe above view about civil society was criticised by Antonio Gramsci (Edwards 2004:10). Departing somewhat from Marx, Gramsci did not consider civil society as a realm of private and alienated relationships. Rather, Gramsci viewed civil society as the vehicle for bourgeois hegemony, when it just represents a particular class. He underlined the crucial role of civil society as the contributor of the cultural and ideological capital required for the survival of the hegemony of capitalism. Rather than posing it as a problem, as in earlier Marxist conceptions, Gramsci viewed civil society as the site for problem-solving. Misunderstanding Gramsci, the New Left assigned civil society a key role in defending people against the state and the market and in asserting the democratic will to influence the state. At the same time, neo-liberal thinkers consider civil society as a site for struggle to subvert Communist and authoritarian regimes. Thus, the term civil society occupies an important place in the political discourses of the New Left and neo-liberals.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the post-modern way of understanding civil society was first developed by political opposition in the former Soviet bloc East European countries in the 1980s. However, research shows that communist propaganda had the most important influence on the development and popularization of the idea instead, in an effort to legitimize neoliberal transformation in 1989. According to theory of restructurization of welfare systems, a new way of using the concept of civil society became a neoliberal ideology legitimizing development of the third sector as a substitute for the welfare state. The recent development of the third sector is a result of this welfare systems restructuring, rather than of democratization.\n\nFrom that time stems a political practice of using the idea of civil society instead of political society. Henceforth, postmodern usage of the idea of civil society became divided into two main ones: as political society and as the third sector – apart from plethora of definitions. The Washington Consensus of the 1990s, which involved conditioned loans by the World Bank and IMF to debt-laden developing states, also created pressures for states in poorer countries to shrink. This in turn led to practical changes for civil society that went on to influence the theoretical debate. Initially the new conditionality led to an even greater emphasis on \"civil society\" as a panacea, replacing the state's service provision and social care, Hulme and Edwards suggested that it was now seen as \"the magic bullet.\"\n\nBy the end of the 1990s civil society was seen less as a panacea amid the growth of the anti-globalization movement and the transition of many countries to democracy; instead, civil society was increasingly called on to justify its legitimacy and democratic credentials. This led to the creation by the UN of a high level panel on civil society. However, in the 1990s with the emergence of the nongovernmental organizations and the new social movements (NSMs) on a global scale, civil society as a third sector became treated as a key terrain of strategic action to construct ‘an alternative social and world order.’ Post-modern civil society theory has now largely returned to a more neutral stance, but with marked differences between the study of the phenomena in richer societies and writing on civil society in developing states.\n\nJürgen Habermas said that the public sphere encourages rational will-formation; it is a sphere of rational and democratic social interaction. Habermas argues that even though society was representative of capitalist society, there are some institutions that were part of political society. Transformations in economy brought transformations to the public sphere. Though these transformations happen, a civil society develops when it emerges as non-economic and has a populous aspect, and when the state is not represented by just one political party. There needs to be a locus of authority, and this is where society can begin to challenge authority. Jillian Schwedler points out that civil society emerges with the resurrection of the public sphere when individuals and groups begin to challenge boundaries of permissible behaviour – for example, by speaking out against the regime or demanding a government response to social needs – civil society begins to take shape.\n\nOn 5 November 2017, social activist Himmat Bhandari in his lecture said at Civil Society, Rotary Club Bareilly, \n\"Civilization need civilized societies, and civil societies need civilized citizens.\"\n\nCivil society organizations, also known as civic organizations, include among others:\n\n\n\n"}

After working with Jesse Jackson's campaign he joined the Nation of Islam and became Conrad X.\n\nHe became a student leader at the University of Pennsylvania, when he was elected to the Presidency of the Black student League in 1986. He was later that year elected to a citywide student leadership position as President of the Philadelphia Inter-Collegiate Black Student Union. His leadership grew nationally as he led the effort to organize the National Student Unity Conference and Congress, that hosted its inaugural conference of over 700 from across the nation from over 80 colleges and university at the University of Pennsylvania in 1986-87. The conference featured national 60 speakers spanning the ideological spectrum in black America, from Kwame Toure (formerly Stokely Carmichael) to Ronald Reagan supporter, and Black conservative Robert L. Woodson. Both Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan were keynote speakers. Jackson called the conference, \"the most significant gathering of students since the founding of SNCC in 1960.

Thurman was an African-American theologian, civil rights advocate, author, philosopher, and educator.\n\nIn the 1990s he started (CHHCHANGE), A Movement for Change, was said to focus on “conscious hip hop activism\", and social empowerment for black youth. Conrad also hosted a popular radio talk show in the late 90s into the new millennium on New York City's African-American owned Inner-City Broadcasting, owned by one of his mentors Percy Ellis Sutton. He hosted New York Roundtable daily on WLIB and on the weekends Sunday Night Live on the networks flagship station WBLS. \n\nMay 2001 -Conrad organized a hip-hop summit in Harlem at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building on 125th Street to address critical and negative issues with Hip-Hop and to find ways to clean up rap music. Music industry executives were invited such as; Elektra, Motown, and rappers included was Fat Joe and Afrika Bambaata.\n\nConrad was outraged when he felt that Reverend Al Sharpton had taken his idea, and that Al Sharpton the leader of the National Action Network in Harlem along with David Mays of The Source magazine were to \"use the moral cover of the civil rights movement\", said to divert from criticizing that rap is not in good taste, and lacks decency. Taking the Rap an article written by Peter Noel for the Village Voice on January 9, 2001 stated that Conrad was infuriated that Sharpton and the other black leaders did not address Sean Combs or Shyne Barrows both who were at the time symbols of gangsta rap. Conrad stated that the Hip hop summits organized by Al Sharpton were shams. Combs, Barrow and Anthony \"Wolf\" Jones were about to go on trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan for a shooting at Club New York in New York City that took place in December 1999. Conrad is quoted as saying \"I'm challenging the civil rights establishment, who essentially have become hired guns\". Muhammad is also quoted as saying \"Is the civil rights movement for rent, for sale, to the highest bidder?\"\n\nRussell Simmons did not support Conrad Muhammad's Hip-Hop summit. He organized a counter-summit hosted by Louis Farrakhan. Farrakhan who had ousted Conrad from Mosque No. 7 in Harlem. Russell Simmons at the time was considered to be rap's premier mogul. Simmons was quoted as saying, “I urge that you do not support open and aggressive critics of the hip-hop community (i.e. C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole or Conrad Muhammad)\".\n\nConrad Muhammad is quoted as saying a \"New York Post\" article, “It is our community,” says Muhammad, “that is most hurting from the excesses of this music\". “Contemporary rap has brought back ‘pimp’ style,” Muhammad told The Post. “Contemporary rap has brought back ‘pimp’ style,” Muhammad told \"The Post\". He was outspoken against the use of the \"N word\" and quoted as saying \nSecond, he decries the ubiquitous use of the “N”-word in commercial rap.\n\n“We have reinstitutionalized a word that the black community had fought to make persona non grata. Today, it is more popular than ever\".\n\nIn 2002, he ran for Congress, challenging veteran Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel, predicting that Harlem was becoming unaffordable for its longtime residents.\n\nAlso in 2002, Conrad returned to his birth name Conrad Tillard. that same year, deeply influenced by Baptist theologian, Howard Thurman and several influential Christian ministers, including Bishop Frank M. Reid of the AME Church, Rev. William James, a legendary Harlem United Methodist Minister and Dr. Calvin o. Butts III, Tillard returned to Christianity.He is currently working on a book about his early life and ministry, his memoir, \"In My Father's House: The Spiritual and Political Memoir of the Man Once Known as the Hip Hop Minister, Conrad Muhammad\". He says about his book, \"It was the golden age of Black Hip Hop. All the groups and things the youth like now I was right there in the middle of it and I can't wait to share my story through this book,\" said Rev. Tillard.\n\nConrad co-wrote and hosted Culture Shock a one-hour television program for WPIX channel 11 in New York City. A program that addressed negative imagery in the media in youth programming. The program won various awards, the National Council on Family Relations First Place Media Award, Platinum Best “Show Award”, and the “Aurora Award\".\n\nIn Bedford Stuyvesant, Conrad was a very socially and community-oriented Minister. As the Senior Minister, at The Nazarene Congregational United Church of Christ, he served on the Community Advisory Board, for the historic Boys and Girls High School. He funeralized police brutality victim Kiel Coppin, a Bedford Stuyvesant teenager with developmental issues, who was shot to death by police holding a hairbrush. He also worked to end violence among youth in the central Brooklyn, fair wages for NYC workers and in 2013 he made a spirited run for New York City Council in the 36th Council District. He was a key early clergy supporter of Barack Obama's historic 2009 campaign for president.\n\nDuring his tenure at Nazarene, the pulpit featured nationally renown Ministers, politicians, civil rights leaders and cultural icons. Dick Gregory, Wynton Marsalis, Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, NAACP President Ben Jealous, Howard University Divinity School Dean, Yolanda Pierce and journalist George Curry are some of the individuals who came to Nazarene, during Conrad's tenure. He constantly said to his members, \"I want to expose my people to the best minds, I want the youth of Bedford Stuyvesant to see that they can be rappers, but they can also be anything they want to be, they can be the best\"\n\n\n\n\"I knew God had been calling me. It's been so long time, but I finally came home\".\n\"Hands that once scratched turntables, will one day pick a president.\"\n\" If Jesse Ventura can as a former pro wrestler, become Governor of Minnesota, then Chuck D, and Fat Joe can become elected officials as well\"!\n\" I had to learn to separate Christ, from Christians.\" \n\"The faith toward God was already in my heart. But I had so many questions and doubts\".\n"}
{"id": "47179108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47179108", "title": "Constantin Banu", "text": "Constantin Banu\n\nConstantin Gheorghe Banu (March 20, 1873 – September 8, 1940) was a Romanian writer, journalist and politician, who served as Arts and Religious Affairs Minister in 1922–1923. He is remembered in literary history as the founder of \"Flacăra\" review, which he published in two editions, alongside Petre Locusteanu, Ion Pillat, Adrian Maniu, and, later, Vintilă Russu-Șirianu. A best-selling magazine for its time, it functioned as a launching pad for several writers of the Romanian Symbolist movement.\n\nBanu was an affiliate and orator of the National Liberal Party, which he served continuously for 30 years, as a political journalist, public polemicist, and member of Parliament. His contribution as an essayist, lampoonist, and aphorist reflected his progressive approach to labor and productive life, his critique of conservatism, as well as his concept of civilized political mores.\n\nBanu's career in politics reached the international level during World War I, when he took refuge from German-occupied Romania to campaign for the Romanian cause in Paris. Subsequently, during his term as minister, he focused on negotiating a Romanian Concordat and normalizing relations with the Catholic Church. In his final years in politics, he was an affiliate of the National Liberal Party-Brătianu. These activities, like much of his vast (but fragmentary) work in print, or his speeches, endured as the focus of political controversy.\n\nBorn in Bucharest, his father was a Gheorghe N. Banu, and his mother a Smaranda (or Coralia) Banu. He was French on his mother's side, but his exact lineage is unclear. According to Banu himself, his French grandmother led a mysterious life in Bucharest and died at \"Așezămintele Brâncovenești\" Hospital in September 1848. Her husband was a Greek-Romanian known as Koronidy, who may have been a shipbuilder or a schoolteacher from a shipbuilding family. On his father's side, Banu was probably descending from a clan of Romanian shepherds. His grandfather or great-grandfather was reportedly a \"Staroste\" of the furriers' guild in Galați.\n\nBaptized Romanian Orthodox, Banu completed secondary education at Saint Sava National College, a classmate of writer Ioan A. Bassarabescu, actor Ion Livescu, and lawyer-politician Scarlat Orăscu. Influenced by their teacher, classical scholar Anghel Demetriescu, they formed their own literary club, which held its meetings in the Saint Sava basement, putting out the polygraphed magazine \"Armonia\", then the bi-monthly \"Studentul Român\". Banu was also in a mathematics class taught by Ștefan Popescu. By his own recollection, he was a struggling student, and had much trouble learning trigonometry from the textbook of Spiru Haret—his future political mentor and employer.\n\nBanu graduated from the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest in 1895, and from the law faculty in 1900. As he himself noted in 1936: \"Although not a literary professional, I always had a soft spot for literature.\" He also had an enduring passion for history, as noted by his professor Nicolae Iorga, who recommended him for a teacher's chair. During a stint as a novice teacher in Brăila, he had his \"second encounter\" with Haret, who, as Education Minister, was personally inspecting the local schools. He equated listening to Haret's speech as a personal revelation about the sheer force of one's creative energies.\n\nReturning to Bucharest, Banu began working as a history professor at Matei Basarab High School in 1898, part of a teaching staff which came to include Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, Emanoil Grigorovitza, Theodor Speranția, Alexandru Toma, and Eugen Lovinescu. One of his students was the poet George Topîrceanu. Banu later transferred to the Nifon Mitropolitul Seminary. In this environment, he founded a literary-and-theatrical society, with contributions from pupil Petre Locusteanu, who later became his friend and close associate. His debut in letters came in 1900, with a brochure criticizing the textbook author Serafim Ionescu and the teaching of Romanian history. At the time, Banu also took up work as a promoter of public literacy, joining Ioan Kalinderu and Barbu Știrbey's Steaua Association, which had as its object \"the strengthening of education among regular folk through moral, patriotic and useful publications\".\n\nIn 1900, Banu's former professor, folklorist G. Dem. Teodorescu, died. Attending his funeral, Banu gave a rousing speech exhorting the values of work ethic. His political articles that appeared in \"Secolul XX\" starting in 1899, as well as his oratorical talent, drew the attention of Haret's own National Liberal Party (PNL). Around 1903, he was a functionary in the upper echelons of Education Ministry, Chief Inspector of the Private Schools under Minister Haret, in which capacity he first met and encouraged the novelist (and aspiring politician) Mihail Sadoveanu. Upon moving to Bucharest, he took over a villa on Parfumului Street, where he lived with his wife Aneta (or Ioana). She came from a boyar family of Western Moldavia, and owned an estate at Hălăucești. Their two sons, Nicolae and Ioan, were respectively born in 1907 and 1908.\n\nAs noted by memoirist Constantin Kirițescu, Banu quit the education system when his job became \"a nuisance, a hindrance to his rise.\" Working for the liberal press, he was editor-in-chief of \"Voința Națională\" from 1903 and director of \"Viitorul\" from 1907, part of a team that also comprised Ion G. Duca and Henric Streitman. At \"Voința Națională\", Banu inaugurated a literary supplement, which put out \"feuilletons\" by Sadoveanu, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, Ilarie Chendi, Nicolae Gane, and Ion Bentoiu. Under his auspices, \"Voința Națională\" also featured commentary on literature, theater and painting. Under the pen name Teofil, he wrote the column \"Una-alta\" (\"This and That\") in a literary style, focusing on politics, but also outlining his belief in the didactic value of art. It was also at this paper that he resumed his close collaboration with Locusteanu.\n\nMeanwhile, Banu's radical politics collided with the agenda of the Conservative Party and its Prime Minister, Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. During the peasants' revolt of early 1907, Iorga and Banu's Bucharest homes were searched by police, who confiscated \"a great number of letters and important papers.\" In his late years, Banu still recalled the impression left on him by the revolt, \"this free-riding daughter of Nature\": \"I have seen pillars of fire roaming the villages, setting train stations alight, and crackling among the ruins.\" In the election of May, running on PNL lists in Ialomița County, Banu took a seat in the Assembly of Deputies. He was its Secretary from 1907 to 1911. Banu impressed his audience, including the Conservative adversary Alexandru Marghiloman, with his oratorical skill. In 1910, he was among the jurors who condemned to prison Gheorghe Stoenescu-Jelea, the would-be assassin of Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu. Upon the Conservatives' return to power, he failed to win a seat in the 2nd College Ilfov County in the February 1911 election, running on a coalition anti-Conservative list headed by Nicolae Fleva.\n\nOn October 22, 1911, Banu and Locusteanu printed the first issue of \"Flacăra\", a weekly literature and current events magazine. When asked what motivated him to launch his own magazine, Banu referred to his literary passion, and also noted that the magazine (or \"literary newspaper\") was \"of some use to my [liberal] party\"—\"Duca understood this from the very start, and so he was happy to inaugurate the magazine with an article of his own\". The name, literally \"Flame\", was chosen in oblique reference to the \"pillars of fire\" of 1907. These, Banu argued, could be turned into constructive fires of \"purification\".\n\nWith its \"people's agenda\", \"Flacăra\" had unparalleled success among the urban middle classes, particularly with its exposure of literary scandals, but was poorly received by literary professionals. Once criticized for its alleged eclecticism and lack of aesthetic discernment, the magazine became involved in polemics, mainly written by Banu, who also personally interviewed his featured writers. \"Flacăra\" had a regular circulation of 15,000, peaking at 30,000, which was unusually high for the demographic and literacy standards of the Kingdom of Romania. This was largely because of Locusteanu's contribution in publicity, but also, according to Banu, to the talents featured in its pages. Also according to Banu, the magazine owed its survival to Locusteanu and, secondly, to Spiru Hasnaș.\n\nThe magazine set out as a mainstream review, hosting established talents such as Ion Luca Caragiale and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea; its most nonconformist contributors were \"moderate\" Romanian Symbolists: Ion Minulescu, Caton Theodorian, and Victor Eftimiu, later joined by Barbu Nemțeanu, and sometimes by Nicolae Budurescu, Alexandru Dominic, and Eugen Titeanu. Most of Banu's own writings appeared in \"Flacăra\"; these included poems, aphorisms and literary, cultural and political articles. He also signed his work as Glaucon and Mefisto, and sometimes used Al. Șerban, Const. Paul and Cronicarul Dâmboviței, pen names he shared with Locusteanu. His journalistic work, also carried in George Diamandy's \"Revista Democrației Române\", sought to express political objectivity and sincerity. Some of his socially themed texts, conceived as sketches or little scenes, denounced parasitism, lack of patriotism, arrogance and aggressive stupidity; his ideology veered toward sympathy and a sense of duty toward the productive classes. According to literary historian George Călinescu, such works are without stylistic value: \"C. Banu shows up in his aphorisms as a grieving but trite Guicciardini, of no humanistic worth\".\n\nAt the time of their publishing, Banu's texts were derided by a rival modernist, Tudor Arghezi, who, by one estimate, wrote half of his lampoons entirely against Banu or \"Flacăra\". In Arghezi's magazine \"Facla\", Banu and Locusteanu were viewed as \"triumphant mediocrities\" and \"street organs\", on the same artistic level as Radu D. Rosetti and Maica Smara. Nevertheless, with Ion Pillat and Adrian Maniu as caretakers of the literary pages, \"Flacăra\" also turned to more radical forms of modernism. Pillat, Maniu, and Horia Furtună also \"conspired\" to relaunch here the disgraced Symbolist mentor, Alexandru Macedonski, serializing his novel \"Thalassa\"; and helped launch the career of George Bacovia, publishing his plaquette \"Plumb\". Symbolist N. Davidescu took over as the literary reviewer, pushing an aesthetic ideal that was inspired by readings from Remy de Gourmont; the other staff reviewer was Hasnaș who, Călinescu notes, merely wrote \"earnestly\". The magazine also published illustration by, among others, the debuting avant-garde draftsman, Marcel Janco.\n\nIn the years before World War I, returned to the Assembly, Banu debated major national issues with the Conservative Party doctrinaires. Responding to Constantin C. Arion's call for national unity after the Balkan Wars, he argued that such internal peace could never be achieved with \"an aggrieved peasantry as the basis of our State\". A land reform, he contended, could even make Romania into a great regional power. Nevertheless, Banu was also critical of the populist currents undermining the PNL, and thus picked sides against Iorga and his Democratic Nationalists. His \"Flacăra\" articles, Iorga noted at the time, supported anti-nationalist causes such as Jewish emancipation, while his parliamentary speeches expressed worries against the rise of Romania's insurrectionist \"Boulangisme\". Banu hoped to appease Conservatives who viewed land reform as proof of socialism, contending that \"increasing property\" was the best method to curb left-wing agitation and promote \"social conservation\". He also campaigned for election reform, insisting that it could solve the \"periodic convulsions\" in Romanian society, and criticizing the Conservatives' electoral ideal as a Potemkin village.\nBy 1914, Banu was also writing for the \"Flacăra\" satellite \"Semnalul\", for the PNL paper \"Democrația\", and for the literary bimonthly \"Văpaia\". In July, days after the Sarajevo assassination, Banu was selected on a panel of deputies, headed by Mihail G. Orleanu, which proposed democratic reforms to the 1866 constitution. Other members included Iorga, Constantin Stere, Nicolae Romanescu, and Vintilă Brătianu. Romania kept neutral during the first two years of war, but an intellectual battle divided Romanian society, between \"Francophiles\", who supported the Entente, and \"Germanophiles\", who looked to the Central Powers. Banu and the National Liberals leaned toward the Entente Francophiles. In October 1914, he directed a rally of university students who vandalized the offices of \"Ziua\", a Germanophile daily put out by Ioan Slavici, and chanted threats against Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, owner of the Germanophile \"Seara\".\n\nAlthough, as historian Lucian Boia writes, it remained \"without jarring partisanship\", \"Flacăra\"s Ententist-and-populist tinges were ridiculed and parodied in \"Chemarea\", the radical-left Symbolist review put out by Ion Vinea. Banu's 1916 book \"Sub mască\" (\"Under the Mask\"), signed Mefisto, included poems initially published in \"Flacăra\"s \"Gazeta rimată\" column. Their subjects received varying treatment, with tones that ranged from humor and pamphleteering jokes to invective; Banu himself acknowledged that such pieces were \"sometimes mean and often unfair\". As critics note, his critical virulence and moralizing intent were balanced by a certain literary talent, itself subsumed by the categorical nature of polemic. Also published that year, the brochure \"Trăiască viaţa!…\" (\"Long Live Life!…\") is a collection of articles, some of them distinctly autobiographical.\n\nHonoring its secret commitment to the Entente, Romania entered the war in August 1916. \"Flacăra\" closed down with a final issue on November 13 of that year, as Bucharest prepared for the German siege. Banu later escaped to Paris, where, from January 1918, he joined the directorial staff of \"La Roumanie\" journal (with Emil Fagure and Constantin Mille), campaigning in French for the cause of Greater Romania. He intervened directly to obtain statements of solidarity with beleaguered Romania from Ernest Lavisse, Lucien Poincaré, and other French academics, while trying in vain to prevent the Romanian government from negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers.\n\nWith the turn of tides, Banu formed part of the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, attending as co-director of \"La Roumanie\". Reelected to the Assembly in November 1919, he made overtures toward Iorga and the Democratic Nationalists in power, moderating his party's attacks against them. In March 1920, when the anti-PNL coalition was toppled by King Ferdinand I, Iorga proposed that Banu and Matei B. Cantacuzino form a technocratic government of national reconciliation; the monarch preferred a cabinet headed by Alexandru Averescu. Banu put out two more editions of \"Flacăra\" between December 10, 1921 and June 1923, with Vintilă Russu-Șirianu as his second, contributions from old regulars such as Minulescu and Macedonski, and food chronicles by Păstorel Teodoreanu. Banu who wrote regularly for \"Cuget Românesc\" monthly during that interval, had no say in \"Flacăra\"s management, which went to Pillat, Furtună, and then Minulescu. Despite their \"great efforts\", he noted, the magazine failed commercially—\"such were the times.\"\n\nStill in the Assembly following the 1922 election, Banu served as Arts and Religious Affairs Minister under Prime Minister Brătianu, from 1922 to 1923. During that time, he involved himself in negotiating a Concordat, in the hope of normalizing relations with the Holy See. The 1923 constitution gave special recognition to the Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church, but Banu satisfied the former when he stripped state representatives of their right to elect bishops. According to memoirist and PNL man Ion Rusu Abrudeanu, he erred in keeping by his side the Greek Catholic functionary Zenovie Pâclișanu, who stood accused of undermining the PNL and of leaking the Concordat draft to the Catholic press in Transylvania. Reportedly, Pâclișanu also sabotaged Banu's investigation into allegations of church art smuggling by Catholic clergymen who migrated to Hungary.\n\nBanu's accomplishments as minister include his successful promotion of Romania's first copyright law, on January 15, 1923. He also founded an Inspectorate of Romanian Museums, under Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, but withheld its financing later on. The two politicians negotiated for a reciprocal exchange of coveted cultural goods between, on one hand, Romania and, on the other, Weimar Germany and the Austrian Republic. They only managed to obtain the Cucuteni Treasure from Berlin.\n\nBy late 1923, Banu was noted for his opposition to the new PNL establishment, whose most prominent figure was Vintilă Brătianu; unlike his colleagues, he did not believe in the goal of \"crushing\" the opposition, at the time led by the Peasants' Party. Resigning from the Ministry in November, to be replaced by Alexandru Lapedatu, Banu still served in the Senate, but largely withdrew from public life. His articles and musings were being still published in \"Adevărul\", \"Convorbiri Literare\", and \"Cele Trei Crișuri\". In 1927, celebrating the golden jubilee of Romanian Independence with conferences at the Bucharest Atheneum, Banu outlined his liberal critique of the conservative ethos, turning against \"reactionary\" cultural figures such as Caragiale, Mihail Eminescu, and the \"Junimea\" circle. Such themes were also explored in his lectures, recorded by Radio Romania in 1929 and 1933. As Caragiale scholar Șerban Cioculescu noted at the time, Banu's \"effete phraseology\" and \"cliche vocabulary\" encased his resentments against conservative intellectuals, who had exposed and satirized the \"characteristics of practical liberalism\".\n\nBetween 1927 and 1930, the PNL polarized into competing factions: one led by Vintilă Brătianu and the other, the \"Georgists\", by Gheorghe Brătianu. Banu was on the side of the former, and also expressed his faction's sympathy for King Carol II, who had returned from exile to reclaim his throne. By December 1933, with Vintilă dead and Duca, his one-time colleague at \"Viitorul\", in charge of the party, Banu had embraced Georgism and defected to the PNL's seceded wing, the \"National Liberal Party-Brătianu\". He and Artur Văitoianu were the most notorious PNL assets to follow Gheorghe Brătianu on this venture. This move was also a sign of Banu's opposition to the politically ambitious Carol II: Banu, Brătianu, and Constantin C. Giurescu were working on a proclamation against Carol, his \"camarilla\", and Duca, the acting PNL Prime Minister. A year later, after Duca's unexpected assassination by the Iron Guard, a National Peasants' Party administration intervened to stop Banu, Brătianu, P. P. Negulescu and others from coordinating massive opposition rallies. The Iron Guard also took notice, and Banu's name appeared on an enemies' list, alongside those of Aristide Blank, Alexandru C. Constantinescu, Wilhelm Filderman, and Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu.\n\nAccording to Kirițescu, Banu reached the \"forefront of politics\", but failed to preserve his position—overall, he lacked \"the faculty which allows one to wiggle through, to engage in transactions\". Banu's final book appeared in 1937 as \"Grădina lui Glaucon sau Manualul bunului politician\" (\"Glaucon's Garden or A Textbook for Good Politicians\"). Here, he uses his political and artistic experience to analyze his peers in 757 sections (aphorisms, words of advice and morality sketches). Through these, he shows his ethical leanings, irony, and skepticism, formulating concise general judgments.\n\nBanu spent his final years away from the capital, at his wife's home in Hălăucești. He died in 1940 at a hospital in Roman, and was buried in Plot 21 of Bellu Cemetery, Bucharest. His former mentor and adversary Iorga paid homage to him with an obituary in \"Neamul Românesc\", emphasizing that Banu, the \"unusual figure\" among his peers, belonged to an older era of \"dignity and decency, when people were held up by talent and merit\". Banu's oratory was of \"great formal restraint, unjarring.\"\n\nAneta Guțulescu-Banu survived her husband for decades, dying in 1970. Their first-born Nicolae \"Bob\", who lived to 1985, was married to the actress Lucia, a member of the Rosetti family and niece of the composer George Enescu. Ioan, his brother, died in 2001. Constantin and Aneta's other child was a daughter, Ana-Irina \"Nazica\", who married the engineer Nicolae Cristofor. The villa built by the Banus' on Parfumului Street was nationalized by the communist regime, and assigned to an army institution. In 1987, at the height of the Ceaușima campaign, it was demolished.\n\n"}
{"id": "6456874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6456874", "title": "Course evaluation", "text": "Course evaluation\n\nA course evaluation is a paper or electronic questionnaire, which requires a written or selected response answer to a series of questions in order to evaluate the instruction of a given course. The term may also refer to the completed survey form or a summary of responses to questionnaires.\n\nThey are a means to produce feedback which the teacher and school can use to assess their quality of instruction. The process of (a) gathering information about the impact of learning and of teaching practice on student learning, (b) analyzing and interpreting this information, and (c) responding to and acting on the results, is valuable for several reasons. They enable instructors to review how others interpret their teaching methods. The information can be also used by administrators, along with other input, to make summative decisions (e.g., decisions about promotion, tenure, salary increases, etc.) and make formative recommendations (e.g., identify areas where a faculty member needs to improve). Typically, these evaluations are combined with peer evaluations, supervisor evaluations, and results of student’s test scores to create an overall picture of teaching performance. Course evaluations are implemented in one of two ways, either summative or formative.\n\nCourse evaluation instruments generally include variables such as communication skills, organizational skills, enthusiasm, flexibility, attitude toward the student, teacher – student interaction, encouragement of the student, knowledge of the subject, clarity of presentation, course difficulty, fairness of grading and exams, and global student rating.\n\nSummative evaluation occurs at the end of a semester, usually a week or two before the last day of class. The evaluation is performed by the current students of the class. Students have the option to reflect on the teachers’ instruction without fear of punishment because course evaluations are completely confidential and anonymous. This can be done in one of two ways; either with a paper form or with online technology. Typically, in a paper based format, the paper form is distributed by a student while the teacher is out of the room. It is then sealed in an envelope and the teacher will not see it until after final grades are submitted. The online version can be identical to a paper version or more detailed, using branching question technology to glean more information from the student. Both ways allow the student to be able to provide feedback. This feedback is to be used by teachers to assess the quality of their instruction. The information can also be used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of a teacher, particularly for tenure and promotion decisions.\n\nFormative evaluation typically occurs when changes can take place during the current semester, although many institutions consider written comments on how to improve formative as well. Typically this form of evaluation is performed by peer consultation. Other experienced teachers will review one of their peer’s instructions. The purpose of this evaluation is for the teacher to receive constructive criticism on teaching. Generally, peer teachers will sit in on a few lessons given by the teacher and take notes on their methods. Later on the team of peer teachers will meet with the said teacher and provide useful, non-threatening feedback on their lessons. The peer team will offer suggestions on improvement, which the said teacher can choose to implement.\n\nPeer feedback is given to the instructor typically in the form of an open session meeting. The peers first reflect on the qualities that were good in the instruction. Then they move on to areas that need improvement. Next the instructor will make suggestions for improvement and receive feedback on those ideas.\n\nStudent feedback can be an important part of formative evaluation. Student evaluations are formative when their purpose is to help faculty members improve and enhance their teaching skills. The teachers may require their students to complete written evaluation, participate in ongoing dialogue or directed discussions during the course of the semester. The use of a 'Stop, Start Continue' format for student feedback has been shown to be highly effective at generating constructive feedback for course improvement.\n\nAt the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Vienna, Twitter was used for formative course evaluation.\n\nSummative student evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been widely criticized, especially by teachers, for not being accurate measures of teaching effectiveness. Surveys have shown that a majority of teachers believe that a teacher's raising the level of standards and/or content would result in worse SETs for the teacher, and that students in filling out SETs are biased in favor of certain teachers' personalities, looks, disabilities, gender and ethnicity. The evidence that some of these critics cite indicates that factors other than effective teaching are more predictive of favorable ratings. In order to get favorable ratings, teachers are likely to present the content which can be understood by the slowest student. Consequently, the content has been affected. Many of those who are critical of SETs have suggested that they should not be used in decisions regarding faculty hires, retentions, promotions, and tenure. Some have suggested that using them for such purposes leads to the dumbing down of educational standards. Others have said that the typical way SETs are now used at most universities is demeaning to instructors and has a corrupting effect on students' attitudes toward their teachers and higher education in general.\n\nThe economics of education literature and the economic education literature is especially critical. For example, Weinberg \"et al.\" (2009) finds SET scores in first-year economics courses at Ohio State University are positively related to the grades instructors assign but are unrelated to learning outcomes once grades are controlled for. Others have also found a positive relationship between grades and SET scores but unlike Weinberg \"et al.\" (2009) do not directly address the relationship between SET scores and learning outcomes. A paper by Krautmann and Sander (1999) find that the grades students expect to receive in a course are positively related to SET scores. Isely and Singh (2005) find it is the difference between the grades students expect to receive and their cumulative GPA that is the relevant variable for obtaining favourable course evaluations. Another paper by Carrell and West (2010) use a data set from the U.S. Air Force Academy where students are randomly assigned to course sections (reducing selection problems). It found that calculus students got higher marks on common course examinations when they had instructors with high SET scores but did worse when they took later courses requiring calculus. The authors discuss a number of possible explanations for this finding, including that instructors with higher SET scores may have concentrated their teaching on the common examinations in the course rather than giving students a deeper understanding for later courses. Hamermesh and West (2005) find that students at the University of Texas at Austin gave attractive instructors higher SET scores than less attractive instructors. However, the authors conclude that it may not be possible to determine if attractiveness increases the effectiveness of an instructor, possibly resulting in better learning outcomes. It may be the case that students pay more attention to attractive instructors. Meanwhile, a 2017 lawsuit was filed on grounds of xenophobic discrimination in course evaluations at the University of Kansas, with Peter F. Lake, the director of Stetson University's Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy, suggesting this is no isolated incident.\n\nThe empirical economics literature is in sharp contrast to the educational psychology literature which generally argues that teaching evaluations are a legitimate method of evaluating instructors and are unrelated to grade inflation. However, similar to the economic literature other researchers outside of educational psychology have offered negative findings on course evaluations. For example, some papers have examined online course evaluations and found them to be heavily influenced by the instructor’s attractiveness and willingness to give high grades in return for very little work.\n\nAnother criticism of these assessment instruments is that largely the data they produce are difficult to interpret for purposes of self- or course-improvement, given the number of variables that can affect evaluation scores. Finally, paper based course evaluations can cost a university thousands of dollars over the years, while an electronic survey is offered at minimal cost to the university.\n\nAnother concern that has been raised by instructors is that response rates to online course evaluations are lower (and therefore the results may be less valid) than paper-based in class evaluations. The situation is more complex that response rates alone would indicate. Student-faculty engagement is offered as an explanation, where course level, instructor rank, and other variables lacked explanatory power.\n\n\n"}

Most diver training follows procedures and schedules laid down in the associated training standard, in a formal training programme, and includes relevant foundational knowledge of the underlying theory, including some basic physics, physiology and environmental information, practical skills training in the selection and safe use of the associated equipment in the specified underwater environment, and assessment of the required skills and knowledge deemed necessary by the certification agency to allow the newly certified diver to dive within the specified range of conditions at an acceptable level of risk. Recognition of prior learning is allowed in some training standards.\n\nDiver training is closely associated with diver certification or registration, the process of application for and issue of formal recognition of competence by a certification agency or registration authority.\n\nWork skills specific to the underwater environment may be included in diver trailing programmes, but are also often provided independently, either as job training for a specific operation, or as generic training by specialists in the fields.\n\nThe entry requirements for diver training depend on the specific training involved, but generally include medical fitness to dive.\n\nFitness to dive, (also medical fitness to dive), is the medical and physical suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner.\n\nThe most important medical is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. Other important medicals are after some significant illness where medical intervention is needed. This has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules.\n\nPsychological factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies.\n\nFormal educational prerequisites are variable. Diving skills are largely physical, but for professional diving a measure of literacy and numeracy is necessary to allow a reasonable chance of success with the theoretical knowledge requirements, and for effective on-site communication within the dive team. The international \"lingua franca\" of offshore diving operations is English.\n\nSome training standards include an ability to swim as a prerequisite.\n\nDiving theory is the basic knowledge of the physical and physiological effects of the underwater environment on the diver.\n\nDiving physics are the aspects of physics which directly affect the underwater diver and which explain the effects that divers and their equipment are subject to underwater which differ from the normal human experience out of water. These effects are mostly consequences of immersion in water, the hydrostatic pressure of depth and the effects of the pressure on breathing gases. An understanding of the physics is useful when considering the physiological effects of diving and the hazards and risks of diving.\n\nDiving physiology is the physiological influences of the underwater environment on the physiology of air-breathing animals, and the adaptations to operating underwater, both during breath-hold dives and while breathing at ambient pressure from a suitable breathing gas supply. It, therefore, includes both the physiology of breath-hold diving in humans and other air-breathing animals, and the range of physiological effects generally limited to human ambient pressure divers either freediving or using underwater breathing apparatus. Several factors influence the diver, including immersion, exposure to the water, the limitations of breath-hold endurance, variations in ambient pressure, the effects of breathing gases at raised ambient pressure, effects caused by the use of breathing apparatus, and sensory impairment. All of these may affect diver performance and safety.\n\nImmersion affects fluid balance, circulation and work of breathing. Exposure to cold water can result in the harmful cold shock response, the helpful diving reflex and excessive loss of body heat. Breath-hold duration is limited by oxygen reserves, and the risk of hypoxic blackout, which has a high associated risk of drowning.\n\nLarge or sudden changes in ambient pressure have the potential for injury known as barotrauma. Breathing under pressure involves several effects. Metabolically inactive gases are absorbed by the tissues and may have narcotic or other undesirable effects, and must be released slowly to avoid the formation of bubbles during decompression. Metabolically active gases have a greater effect in proportion to their concentration, which is proportional to their partial pressure, which for contaminants is increased in proportion to absolute ambient pressure.\n\nWork of breathing is increased by increased density and viscosity of the breathing gas, artifacts of the breathing apparatus, and hydrostatic pressure variations due to posture in the water. The underwater environment also affects sensory input, which can impact on safety and the ability to function effectively at depth.\n\nDecompression theory is the study and modelling of the transfer of the inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure, but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and travellers in aircraft which are not pressurised to sea level pressure, are generally exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms caused by decompression occur during or within a relatively short period of minutes to hours, or occasionally days, after a significant pressure reduction. The term \"decompression\" derives from the reduction in ambient pressure experienced by the organism and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during and after this reduction in pressure. The uptake of gas by the tissues is in the dissolved state, and elimination also requires the gas to be dissolved, however a sufficient reduction in ambient pressure may cause bubble formation in the tissues, which can lead to tissue damage and the symptoms known as decompression sickness, and also delays the elimination of the gas.\n\nDecompression modeling attempts to explain and predict the mechanism of gas elimination and bubble formation within the organism during and after changes in ambient pressure, and provides mathematical models which attempt to predict acceptably low risk and reasonably practicable procedures for decompression in the field. Both deterministic and probabilistic models have been used, and are still in use.\n\nDiving medicine, also called undersea and hyperbaric medicine (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the underwater environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how a diver's fitness to dive affects the diver's safety. \n\nHyperbaric medicine is a related field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving-related illnesses, decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism.\n\nDiving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness. The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety.\n\nIn diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications.\n\nDiving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and an important part of diver education.\n\nTeaching of diving theory is usually provided as classroom lecture sessions with formative assessment tasks and exercises and a written examination for final assessment. Blended learning is used by some agencies and schools to ensure a more consistent standard.\n\nProfessional divers are required to be familiar with the law regulating their occupation, and any national or international codes of practice that apply in the region where they will practice. National legislation will commonly be included in the curriculum for entry level professional diving, and may be recognised as prior learning for further diver training. The level of knowledge required of a diving supervisor is considerably higher, and is usually part of supervisor training and assessment.\n\nOccupational heath and safety are important aspects of professional diving. The diver is expected to understand the hazards, risks and potential consequences of diving at work and using the equipment provided in the environment of the project, and though risk assessment and team safety on the job are primarily the responsbility of the supervisor and the employer, the diver is also responsible as a member of the team and is expected to have sufficient knowledge of the processes for informed consent.\n\nDive planning is the practical application of theoretical knowledge and understanding. It is the process of planning an underwater diving operation. The purpose of dive planning is to increase the probability that a dive will be completed safely and the goals achieved. Some form of planning is done for most underwater dives, but the complexity and detail considered may vary enormously. In most professional diving, dive planning is mainly the responsibility of the supervisor, but the diver is expected to understand the process sufficiently to know when it has been done correctly. In recreational diving, unless under training, the diver is generally considered equally responsible for the planning of any dive they participate in, along with the other involved divers, so dive planning at the level of certification is an important aspect of recreational diver training.\n\nProfessional diving operations are usually formally planned and the plan documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that the scope of work to be done is within the scope of the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.\n\nThe planning of a diving operation may be simple or complex. In some cases the processes may have to be repeated several times before a satisfactory plan is achieved, and even then the plan may have to be modified on site to suit changed circumstances. The final product of the planning process may be formally documented or, in the case of recreational divers, an agreement on how the dive will be conducted. A diving project may consist of a number of related diving operations.\n\nA documented dive plan may contain elements from the following list:\n\nFor scuba dives, selection of the breathing gases and calculation of the required quantities is one of the most complex parts of dive planing, and is done in parallel with planning of the dive profile and decompression plan.\n\nThe general aspects of dive planning include the following, but not all of these apply to every dive, and in many cases there is no choice available to the diver, who must work within the constraints of what is available and appropriate to their level of competence. Planning of a complex dive may be an iterative process, and the order of steps may vary.\nTeaching of dive planning typically omits any aspects not relevant to the certification level, and to some extent the certification will be defined by the competence requirements for dive planning. Assessment of dive planning competence is commonly a combination of written exams on the details, and direct observation of performance of dive planning tasks.\n\nScuba skills are the skills required to dive safely using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, (scuba). Most of these skills are relevant to both open circuit and rebreather scuba, and many are also relevant to surface-supplied diving. Those skills which are critical to the safety of the diver may require more practice than is usually provided during training to achieve reliable long-term proficiency\n\nSome of the skills are generally accepted by recreational diver certification agencies as necessary for any scuba diver to be considered competent to dive without direct supervision, and others are more advanced, though some diver certification and accreditation organizations may consider some of these to also be essential for minimum acceptable entry level competence. Divers are instructed and assessed on these skills during basic and advanced training, and are expected to remain competent at their level of certification, either by practice or refresher courses.\n\nThe skills include selection, functional testing, preparation and transport of scuba equipment, dive planning, preparation for a dive, kitting up for the dive, water entry, descent, breathing underwater, monitoring the dive profile (depth, time and decompression status), personal breathing gas management, situational awareness, communicating with the dive team, buoyancy and trim control, mobility in the water, ascent, emergency and rescue procedures, exit from the water, unkitting after the dive, cleaning and preparation of equipment for storage and recording the dive, within the scope of the diver's certification.\n\nSurface supplied diving skills are the skills and procedures required for the safe operation and use of surface-supplied diving equipment. Besides these skills, which may be categorised as standard operating procedures, emergency procedures and rescue procedures, there are the actual working skills required to do the job, and the procedures for safe operation of the work equipment other than diving equipment that may be needed.\n\nSome of the skills are common to all types of surface-supplied equipment and deployment modes, others are specific to the type of bell or stage, or to saturation diving. There are other skills required of divers which apply to the surface support function, and some of those are also mentioned here.\n\nDiving skills are practical skills, suitable for learning by performing and improvement by correct repetition and overlearning. Many of the diving skills are safety-critical – incorrect performance can put the diver or another person at risk, and in some cases incorrect response can be rapidly fatal. The skill is generally discussed, demonstrated by a skilled practitioner, and then attempted by the learner in controlled conditions. Repetition with feedback from the instructor is generally continued until the skill can be performed reliably under normal conditions. Professional, particularly military training, may overtrain skills until they are internalised to the extent of being conditioned reflexes, requiring very little conscious thought, as adequate performance under highly stressed conditions may be necessary for survival.\n\nInitial skills training is restricted to Confined water, a diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training purposes. This generally implies that conditions are not affected by geographic or weather conditions, and that divers can not get lost. Swimming pools and diver training tanks are included in this category. A diver training tank is a container of water large and deep enough to practice diving and underwater work skills, usually with a window through which the exercises can be viewed by the instructor. Once competence has been demonstrated in confined water, repetition of skills in open water is usual. This is generally done in combinations that simulate realistic circumstances when reasonably practicable.\n\nMost professional divers are required by national or state legislation to be qualified first aid providers to a specified standard. First aid training is not generally considered to be an integral part of diver training, but may be provided in parallel. First aid registration is generally valid for a limited period and must be updated to stay in-date to dive.\n\nUnderwater work skills may be included in professional diver training to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the requirements of the relevant training standard, which will specify the minimum, and the diving school, which may choose to offer more than the minimum as a premium service.\n\nSpecialist work skills are generally not part of diver training, and are either learned at a specialist training facility, from the equipment manufacturer, or from the employer at the workplace.\n\nTraining methods vary depending on the specific skill, but in many cases it is more effective to first learn the skill out of the water, where it is generally safer and easier, and where immediate feedback on problems is much simpler, then learn how to do it in the underwater environment. Some work skills used underwater are more complex and difficult to learn than diving skills – it is quicker to train a skilled welder to dive well than to train a skilled diver to weld well. This principle holds particularly for professional skills. A marine scientist or archaeologist may require 3 to 5 years full-time university study to become competent in their chosen field, but can be trained to do the relevant diving in about a month.\n\nCompetence may be assessed in several ways. Theoretical knowledge and understanding is often amenable to assessment by written examination, which has the advantage of inherently providing a permanent record.\nPractical skills are more generally assessed by direct observation of a demonstration of the skill, or by inference, where successful completion of an activity implies acceptable application of the skill. In some cases simulations are used, particularly for emergency skills. Records of practical assessment are usually in the form of a report made by the assessor, which may involve the use of a checklist to ensure that all aspects have been covered, and may also include video recordings.\n\nThe level of competence required depends on the safety implications of the skill. A qualified diver should be a low risk for causing injury or death to themselves or another member of the diving team when operating within the constraints of the training standard. Competence at assessment is no guarantee of competence at a future date. Retention and improvement of skills requires practice.\n\nThe quality assurance of diver training is usually based on three basic components:\n\nDiving schools are establishments where divers are trained and assessed. They range from a spare room in the home of a freelance recreational diving instructor, to a set of offices, classrooms, workshops, stores, accommodations and ancillary structures such as diving tanks, swimming pools, diving support vessels, saturation systems, hyperbaric chambers and similar, with associated staff and equipment, for a major military or commercial diving school. The minimum facilities for occupational diver training schools may be specified by a standard or code of practice, and in these cases the school may be periodically audited to ensure that the facilities comply with requirements.\n\nProfessional divers are generally trained firstly to dive safely as a member of a dive team, and secondly in underwater work skills specific to their employment. Registration as a professional diver does not necessarily imply competence in any specific work skills other than those commonly required by the majority of professional diving work. These may be specified in the training standard associated with the specific registration, but training standards can change over time and may no longer be accurate in all details.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, public safety divers may be required to be registered as commercial divers, or may be trained independently by specialists, or may be initially trained as recreational divers, then given additional specialist training.\n\nIn addition to basic diving skills training, public safety divers require specialized training for recognizing hazards, conducting risk assessments, search procedures, diving in zero visibility, using full-face masks with communication systems, and recovering evidence that is admissible in court. Some of the water they are required to dive in is contaminated, and they may be required to wear vulcanized drysuits, with diving helmets sealed to the suit, and utilize surface supplied air. At times, the decontamination process that takes place out of the water can be longer than the dive time.\n\nWhen a scientific diving operation is part of the duties of the diver as an employee, the operation may be considered a professional diving operation subject to regulation as such. In these cases the training and registration may follow the same requirements as for other professional divers, or may include training standards specifically intended for scientific diving. In other cases, where the divers are in full control of their own diving operation, including planning and safety, diving as volunteers, the occupational health and safety regulations may not apply.\n\nWhere scientific diving is exempt from commercial diving regulation, training requirements may differ considerably, and in some cases basic scientific diver training and certification may not differ much from entry level recreational diver training.\n\nTechnological advances have made it possible for scientific divers to accomplish more on a dive, but they have also increased the complexity and the task loading of both the diving equipment and the work done, and consequently require higher levels of trainng and preparation to safely and effectively use this technology. It is preferable for effective learning and safety that such specialisation training is done systematically and under controlled conditions, rather than on site and on the job. Environmental conditions for training should include exercises in conditions as close as reasonably practicable to field conditions.\n\nIn some cases national training standards and codes of practice will apply to professional diver training, assessment and registration, for example:\n\nThe International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRF) is a group of representatives of countries with national training standards for professional divers, who work together towards mutual recognition of diver registration and to identify and implement good practice in diver training and assessment. Members of the IDRF include ADAS (Australia), DCBC (Canada), HSE (UK), PSA (Norway), and the Secretariat General to the Sea Progress Committee (France).\n\nA similar arrangement for international recognition of scientific divers within Europe exists. Two levels of scientific diver registration are recognised. These represent the minimum level of training and competence required to allow scientists to participate freely throughout the countries of the European Union in underwater research projects diving using scuba. Certification or registration by an authorized national agency is a prerequisite, and depth and breathing gas limitations may apply.\nThis competence may be gained either through a formal training program, by in the field training and experience under appropriate supervision, or by a combination of these methods. These standards specify the minimum basic training and competence for scientific divers, and do not consider any speciality skill requirements by employers. Further training for job-specific competence is additional to the basic competence implied by the registration.\n\nRecreational diver training is the process of developing knowledge and understanding of the basic principles, and the skills and procedures for the use of scuba equipment so that the diver is able to dive for recreational purposes with acceptable risk using the type of equipment and in similar conditions to those experienced during training.\n\nNot only is the underwater environment hazardous but the diving equipment itself can be dangerous. There are problems that divers must learn to avoid and manage when they do occur. Divers need repeated practice and a gradual increase in challenge to develop and internalise the skills needed to control the equipment, to respond effectively if they encounter difficulties, and to build confidence in their equipment and themselves. Diver practical training starts with simple but essential procedures, and builds on them until complex procedures can be managed effectively. This may be broken up into several short training programmes, with certification issued for each stage, or combined into a few more substantial programmes with certification issued when all the skills have been mastered.\n\nMany diver training organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a \"Diving Certification Card,\" also known as a \"C-card,\" or qualification card. This diving certification model originated at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence. Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organization that will certify the divers attending the course. The International Organization for Standardization has approved six recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide, and some of the standards developed by the (United States) RSTC are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards:\n\nThe initial open water training for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer. Dive operators, dive shops, and cylinder filling stations may refuse to allow uncertified people to dive with them, hire diving equipment or have their diving cylinders filled. This may be an agency standard, company policy, or specified by legislation.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization has approved six recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide (January 2007).\n\nThe listed standards developed by the (United States) RSTC are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards:\n\nTechnical diving requires specialised equipment and training. There are many technical training organisations: see the Technical Diving section in the list of diver certification organizations. Technical Diving International (TDI), Global Underwater Explorers (GUE), Professional Scuba Association International (PSAI), International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD) and National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) were popular . Recent entries into the market include Unified Team Diving (UTD), InnerSpace Explorers (ISE) and Diving Science and Technology (DSAT), the technical arm of Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI). The Scuba Schools International (SSI) Technical Diving Program (TechXR – Technical eXtended Range) was launched in 2005.\n\nBritish Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) training has always had a technical element to its higher qualifications, however, it has recently begun to introduce more technical level Skill Development Courses into all its training schemes by introducing technical awareness into its lowest level qualification of Ocean Diver, for example, and nitrox training will become mandatory. It has also recently introduced trimix qualifications and continues to develop closed circuit training.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, no certification is required for freediving, and the equipment is sold freely over the counter with no questions asked of the purchaser's competence to use it. Most freedivers learn the skills from practice, often with some coaching from a friend, and sometimes attend a formal training programme presented by a qualified and registered instructor, with assessment and certification of competence as the target.\n\nSome recreational diver training agencies offer training and certification in freediving, sometimes known as a snorkel certificate. \nProfessional diver training standards may include freediving at basic level as part of scuba training and assessment.\n\nProfessional diving support personnel are the members of the professional diving team, which at minimum includes a working diver, a standby diver and a supervisor:\n\nRecreational diving support may only be one person, but can be more:\n\nSupport personnel who are not generally part of the dive team, and apply similarly to professional and recreational diving, include:\nIn all three of these cases requirements vary with national legislation. In some countries there is no specific requirement, in others some form of assessed competency may be necessary. Equipment technicians often have some equipment specific training from the equipment manufacturers, but the fundamental skill level required may vary considerably.\n"}

{"id": "2027387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027387", "title": "Episkopon", "text": "Episkopon\n\nEpiskopon (Greek: ΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΩΝ, \"bishop\") is a secret society at Trinity College in the University of Toronto, which has been active since 1858 when its male branch was founded. The 225th reading was held in 2011. A female branch of Episkopon has been active since 1899, holding their 175th Reading in 2017. Prominent alumni of the Episkopon include Former Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham, filmmaker Atom Egoyan, and Former Canadian Governor General Adrienne Clarkson.\n\nThe male and female branches both present three annual Readings during which they publicly satirize the goings-on about college through a wide range of jokes, songs, and poems delivered mostly by the branch's leader, the Scribe. The society's mythological premise is to deliver \"gentle chastisement\" on behalf of the Venerable Father (or Mother) Episkopon, a spirit who supposedly resides at Trinity and who is represented at Readings by a human skull. Described in the media as a \"self-perpetuating board of directors\", the clandestine group of former Scribes and their assisting editors style themselves as the Order of the Golden Key. The motto of the organization is from Horace: \"Notandi Sunt Tibi Mores\" (Latin: \"The manners of men are to be carefully observed\").\n\nIn 1992, Episkopon was censured and forcibly disassociated by the Trinity College Council following allegations of racism and homophobia. Despite policies prohibiting Episkopon from engaging in any activities on College property, the society has nevertheless continued to play a controversial role in undergraduate life at Trinity. \n\nEpiskopon has existed since 1858, when it was announced that the first Scribe was Pakenham Edward Stewart, later an Anglican priest. Episkopon began as a student newspaper, developed into a form in which only one copy of each edition was created, to be read aloud by the Scribe. Episkopon provides insight into College history, through the keeping of archives dating back to 1879. A poster by artist Roloff Beny advertising a Reading from 1945 is in possession of the National Archives of Canada. Also in the National Archives is a film about the former Trinity College campus on Queen Street West, made by Gordon Sparling, in which Episkopon's traditions feature prominently. A board listing the names of female Scribes once hung in Trinity's St. Hilda's College, but was removed upon the group's decision to disassociate from the College, a show of solidarity with the male branch in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2018, the Trinity College Meeting - the student government of Trinity College - passed a non-binding motion requesting student leaders not to join Episkopon.\n\nOne attempted student suicide was allegedly linked to a 1985 reading, although the circumstances of the connection were not reported. In October 1991, following accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia in Episkopon, a task force was formed to investigate it and Trinity College at large. When the male Scribe of the 1992-1993 academic year refused to draft a constitution that was consistent with the task force's recommendations, the Trinity College Council voted unanimously to sever all ties with the organization. Investigative journalist Declan Hill, a Trinity alumnus, in a 1993 documentary broadcast on the CBC Radio program \"Ideas\", claimed that Episkopon's Readings tended to ridicule certain groups and actions as a form of social control.

{"id": "35307951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35307951", "title": "History of education in Canada", "text": "History of education in Canada\n\nThe history of education in Canada covers schooling from elementary through university, plus the ideas of educators, plus the policies of national and provincial governments. According to Brenda B. MacKay and Michael W. Firmin, Phillips in 1957 periodized the history of public schooling in terms of four stages:\nFor the current situation see Education in Canada.\n\nThe first schools in New France were operated by the Catholic church (as indeed were schools in France itself). In the early nineteenth century the colonial governments moved to set up publicly funded education systems. Protestants and Catholics were deeply divided over how religious and moral education should be delivered. In Upper Canada the Catholic minority rejected the Protestant practice of Biblical study in schools, while in Lower Canada the Protestant minority objected to the education system instilling Roman Catholic dogma. Thus in both these areas two schools systems were established, a Catholic and a Protestant.\n\nUpon Confederation these schools systems were enshrined in the British North America Act (BNA), 1867. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time.\n\nBritish Columbia established a non-sectarian school system in 1872. \n\nIn the three Maritime provinces, schools were mainly Protestant, and a single Protestant oriented school system was established in each of them. In Newfoundland there was not only the Catholic/Protestant split, but also deep divisions between Protestant sects, and nine separate schools systems were set up, one catering to each major denomination. Eventually the major Protestant boards merged into an integrated school system.\n\nOver time, the originally Protestant school boards of English Canada, known as the public schools, became increasingly secularized as Canadians came to believe in the separation of Church and state, and the main boards became secular ones. In Ontario all overt religiosity was removed from the public school system in 1990. In two provinces the sectarian education systems have recently been eliminated through constitutional change. Newfoundland and Labrador eliminated its tri-denominational Catholic-Protestant-Pentecostal system after two referendums. In Quebec the Catholic/Protestant divide was replaced with a French language/English language one.\n\nReligious colleges are attached to numerous universities. \n\nIn Ontario in 1912, the Conservative government of Sir James P. Whitney issued Regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and then only English was allowed. Few of the teachers at these schools were fluent in English, so they had to shut down. \n\nFrench-Canadians—growing rapidly in number in eastern Ontario because of migration, reacted with outrage, journalist Henri Bourassa denouncing the \"Prussians of Ontario\"--a stinging rebuke since Canada was at war with Prussia and Germany at the time. It was one of the key reasons the Francophones turned away from the war effort in 1915 and refused to enlist. Ontario's Catholics were led by the Irish, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools. \n\nRegulation 17 was eventually repealed in 1927. \nThe three Prairie provinces adopted a system based on Ontario's with a dominant Protestant system, and smaller Catholic ones. \nIn 1891, Manitoba moved to eliminate the Catholic board, sparking the Manitoba Schools Question. It demonstrated the deep divergence of cultural, religious and language values and became an issue of national importance. The Catholic Franco-Manitobains had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, such that their children would be taught in French. However a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them. The federal Conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. The Manitoba Schools issue became an issue in the Canadian federal election of 1896, where it worked against the Conservatives and helped elect the Liberals. As Prime Minister, Laurier implemented a compromise stating that Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.\n\nThe Catholic archbishop of Edmonton, Henry Joseph O'Leary had a considerable impact on the city's Catholic sectors, and his efforts reflect many of the challenges facing the Catholic Church at that time. During the 1920s, O'Leary favored his fellow Irish and drastically reduced the influence of French Catholic clergy in his archdiocese and replaced them with Anglophone priests. He helped to assimilate Ukrainian Catholic immigrants into the stricter Roman Catholic traditions, extended the viability of Edmonton's separate Catholic school system, and established both a Catholic college at the University of Alberta and a seminary in Edmonton.\n\nIn 1892 Alberta adopted the Ontario schools model, emphasizing state-run institutions that stressed the English language, English history and English customs. The Catholic community, under the control of Irish, joined the British Protestant community in these new policies, despite the complaints of the French-Canadian minority. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Française de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their own cultural agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908-35; the majority of those hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones.\n\nAfter 1870 numerous non-Anglophone immigrants arrived from Europe, including Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians and many others. Large numbers headed to the attractive free farms in the Prairie Provinces. Education was a central factor in their assimilation into Canadian culture and society. An important indicator of assimilation was the use of English; the children of all immigrant groups showed a strong preference in favour of speaking English, regardless of their parents' language. From 1900 to 1930, the governments of the Prairie Provinces faced the formidable task of transforming the ethnically and linguistically diverse immigrant population into loyal and true Canadians. Many officials believed language assimilation by children would be the key to Canadianization. However, there was opposition to the direct method of English teaching from some immigrant spokesmen. English-language usage in playground games often proved an effective device, and was systematically used. The elementary schools especially in rural Alberta played a central role in the acculturation of the immigrants and their children, providing, according to Prokop, a community character that created a distinctive feature of Canadian schools glaringly missing in the European school tradition.\n\nHistoric educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States, have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines. In 1960, for example 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States. Furthermore, the United States has long led in vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion. According to research by Lawrence Downey:\n\nIvor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era, a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.\n\nOntario took the lead in the early 20th century in developing a theoretical approach to education that was not only taught in universities, but largely shaped government policies in Ontario, and in other provinces as well. The central theme was that schooling could be approached in scientific fashion. \n\n"}

Francis Ormond MLA in 1887, in Melbourne, Victoria.\n\nIn 1881, prominent grazier and philanthropist, The Hon. Francis Ormond, proposed that a technical college would serve \"useful\" to City of Melbourne. Ormond, who had donated the majority of funds towards the foundation of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne, offered £5,000 towards the establishment of a college on the proviso that the public contribute a \"like sum\".\n\nA considerable sum was raised by the Council of the Melbourne Trades Hall, which rallied support amongst its membership of unions. Construction of the \"Working Men's College\" then began in 1886, on a site provided by the Colony of Victoria, next to the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, and adjacent the Melbourne Public Library on La Trobe Street. The College was officially opened during a gala ceremony on June 4, 1887 and, on the night of its opening, took 320 enrollments which increased to over 1000 in its first 12 months of operation. Ormond, a staunch believer in the values of education and a tireless campaigner for the College, served as its President until his death in 1889.\n\nThe College began offering full-time courses in 1899 and was incorporated under the \"Companies Act\" as a private college in 1904. Around the turn of the century, it began developing courses in engineering, applied science, chemistry, metallurgy and mining. Between the 1900s and the 1920s, the College expanded beyond its foundation building, and constructed two new buildings on nearby Bowen Street, a new Art School and also acquired the neighbouring, and recently decommissioned, Melbourne Gaol site for expansion.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the College underwent further expansion with the completion of an Engineering School and a Radio School, and two more buildings constructed on Bowen Street. In 1934, the College officially changed its name to the \"Melbourne Technical College\" (incorporating The Working Men's College), after a representation from its Student's Association.\n\nAfter the closure and partial demolishment of the nearby Old Melbourne Gaol, during the 1920s, the College acquired the site for future expansion. In 1929, the remains of Australia's most notorious bushranger, Ned Kelly (who was hanged at the gaol), were believed to have been discovered during the construction of the Kernot Engineering School. These remains were later reinterred Pentridge Prison, and rediscovered in 2008. However, no conclusive evidence of the remains suggest they are that of Ned Kelly's, and many historians believe his remains are still buried under the present day RMIT.\n\nThe College contributed to Australia's war efforts both in World War I and in World War II. Initially, between 1917 and 1919, it trained over 1500 returned ANZAC service men from World War I in vocational qualifications for post-war life in Australia. Between 1939 and 1945, during World War II, it made a greater contribution to Australia's war efforts by training 23,000 service men and women (approximately one-sixth of all trained in Australia), mainly Royal Australian Air Force personnel in radio communications, as well as 2,000 civilians in munitions manufacturing. The Government of Australia also commissioned the College to manufacture parts for the Air Force's DAP Beaufort Bomber.\n\nAfter World War II, and during the 1950s, the College again trained returned service men and women for post-war life, which prompted the development of courses in food technology, transport studies, accountancy and advertising, and the revision of its art syllabuses. During this time, the College also embraced the Commonwealth of Nations' newly devised Colombo Plan, which increased its intake of South East Asian students greatly.\n\nIn 1954, the College was awarded royal patronage by Queen Elizabeth II - for its service to the Commonwealth in the area of education and for its contribution to the war effort; and was officially renamed the \"Royal Melbourne Technical College\". It became (and remains to this day) the only higher education institution in Australia with the right of the prefix \"Royal\" along with the use of the Monarchy of England's regalia.\n\nIn 1960, the Council of the College voted to begin the process of reconstituting the college as a tertiary institution. The name of the College was then officially changed to the \"Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology\".\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s, the non-tertiary branch of RMIT was reconstituted as the \"Technical College\" (TAFE), and it was believed the Institute and the College would eventually separate. However, the two have remained as incorporated branches of RMIT to the present day. During the 1960s, RMIT's Art School established its reputations as an Australian leader in its field.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, the Institute expanded its degrees in business and engineering, and the College expanded its courses in technology and general studies. In 1979, the neighbouring Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy on Russell Street amalgamated with RMIT, bringing with it its reputation in fashion design and food technology. RMIT's Aeronautics School also established its reputation as an Australian leader in its field, during the late 1970s.\n\nRMIT celebrated its centenary in 1987 with a year-long calendar of events staged across the City of Melbourne, a time capsule set in the Bowen Street courtyard of the foundation building of the Working Men's College on La Trobe Street and a book called \"The Tech: A Centenary History of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology\", documenting the institute's 100 years of history, was also published.\n\nIn 1992, RMIT was granted public university status by the Parliament of Victoria under the \"Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Act\". RMIT's newly appointed Chancellery officially adopted the names \"RMIT University\" for its Institute branch and \"RMIT TAFE\" for its College branch, during the early 1990s, and its Design School also established its reputation as an international leader in eco-friendly design.\n\nFollowing its reconstitution as a public university, RMIT then underwent a large and rapid expansion where a number of other institutes and colleges became amalgamated with it, between 1993 and 1999, which included: Phillip Institute of Technology, Melbourne College of Decoration and Design, Melbourne College of Printing and Graphic Art and Melbourne Institute of Textiles.\n\nIn 1995, RMIT acquired the neighbouring, and recently vacated, former Melbourne Magistrates' Court and City Watch House buildings on the corner of La Trobe Street and Russell Street, and renamed its expanding campus in Melbourne the \"City campus\". It also established a new enivronmentally sustainable \"country campus\" around 20 km from the City campus, in Bundoora, which opened in 1995.\n\nIn 1999, it acquired the derelict state heritage-listed Capitol Theatre in the Melbourne CBD, and refurbished it to its original design. It also established a specialised fashion and printing campus in Brunswick, on the site of the former Melbourne Institute of Textiles in 1999, and became a founding member of the Australian Technology Network, a coalition of leading Australian universities working with industry.\n\nAt the turn of the century, RMIT was invited by the Government of Vietnam to establish Vietnam's first foreign-owned university. In 2001, it established \"RMIT International University, Vietnam\" (now RMIT University Vietnam) near the centre of Ho Chi Minh City, and a second campus in the Vietnamese capital city of Hanoi in 2004. In its years of operation, the Government of Vietnam has awarded RMIT University Vietnam five Golden Dragon Awards for Education.\n\nDuring the mid-2000s, RMIT experienced financial problems, partly due to problems associated with its student administration system upgrade (A$47 million was spent in this effort). The financial problems eventually claimed the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ruth Dunkin. In 2005, RMIT appointed a new Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Margaret Gardner AO and, between 2006 and 2007, posted operating profits of A$50.1 million and then A$109.5 million each year respectively. In 2006, it also became a founding member of the Global U8 Consortium.\n\n\nTexts:\n"}

{"id": "236515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236515", "title": "Ivan Illich", "text": "Ivan Illich\n\nIvan Illich (; 4 September 1926 – 2 December 2002) was a Croatian-Austrian philosopher, Roman Catholic priest, and critic of the institutions of modern Western culture, who addressed contemporary practices in education, medicine, work, energy use, transportation, and economic development. The book that brought Ivan Illich to public attention was \"Deschooling Society\" published in 1971. It was a groundbreaking critique of compulsory mass education. He argued that the oppressive structure of the school system could not be reformed but must be dismantled in order to free humanity from the crippling effects of lifelong institutionalization.\n\nIllich was born in Vienna to a Croatian Catholic father, engineer Ivan Peter Illich, and a Sephardic Jewish mother, Ellen née Regenstreif-Ortlieb. His maternal grandmother was from Texas. Illich spoke Italian, Spanish, French, and German fluently. He later learned Croatian, the language of his grandfathers, then Ancient Greek and Latin, in addition to Portuguese, Hindi, English, and other languages. He studied histology and crystallography at the University of Florence (Italy) as well as theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (from 1942 to 1946), and medieval history in Salzburg.\n\nHe wrote a dissertation focusing on the historian Arnold J. Toynbee and would return to that subject in his later years. In 1951, he \"signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York's poorest neighborhoods—Washington Heights, on the northern tip of Manhattan, at that time a barrio of newly-arrived Puerto Rican immigrants.\" In 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed vice rector of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, \"a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out—Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican's pronouncements on birth control and comparatively demure silence about the bomb.\" It was in Puerto Rico that Illich met Everett Reimer and the two began to analyze their own functions as \"educational\" leaders. In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.\n\nThe end of Illich's tenure at the university came in 1960 as the result of a controversy involving Bishops James Edward McManus and James Peter Davis, who had denounced Governor Luis Muñoz Marín and his Popular Democratic Party for their positions in favor of birth control and divorce. The bishops also started their own rival Catholic party. Illich later summarized his opposition thusly:\n\nAs a historian, I saw that it violated the American tradition of Church and State separation. As a politician, I predicted that there wasn't enough strength in Catholic ranks to create a meaningful platform and that failure of McManus's party would be disastrous on the already frail prestige of the Puerto Rican Church. As a theologian, I believe that the Church must always condemn injustice in the light of the Gospel, but never has the right to speak in favor of a specific political party.\n\nAfter Illich disobeyed a direct order from McManus forbidding all priests from dining with Governor Muñoz, the bishop ordered Illich to leave his post at the university, referring to his very presence as \"dangerous to the Diocese of Ponce and its institutions.\"\n\nDespite this display of insubordination and an order from Paul Francis Tanner, then general secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, forbidding Illich from any official role in the organization's Latin American bureau, Illich maintained the support of the influential priest John J. Considine, who continued to push for Illich to have a role in training the Church's missionaries, personally funding trips to Mexico in order for Illich to scout locations.\n\nIn 1961, Illich founded the Centro Intercultural de Documentación (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center) at Cuernavaca in Mexico, ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the Alliance for Progress program initiated by John F. Kennedy. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the \"modern development\" of the so-called Third World. Illich looked askance at the liberal pity or conservative imperiousness that motivated the rising tide of global industrial development. He viewed such emissaries as a form of industrial hegemony and, as such, an act of \"war on subsistence\". He sought to teach missionaries dispatched by the Church not to impose their own cultural values. \"Throughout the late '60s and early '70s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectuals from all over the Americas.\"\n\nAt the CIDOC, \"Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups.\" After ten years, critical analysis from the CIDOC of the institutional actions by the Church brought the organization into conflict with the Vatican. Unpopular with the local chapter of Opus Dei, Illich was called to Rome for questioning, due in part to a CIA report. In 1976, Illich, apparently concerned by the influx of formal academics and the potential side effects of its own \"institutionalization\", shut the center down with consent from the other members of the CIDOC. Several of the members subsequently continued language schools in Cuernavaca, of which some still exist. Illich himself resigned from the active priesthood in the late-1960s (having attained the rank of monsignor), but continued to identify as a priest and occasionally performed private masses.\n\nIn the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by André Gorz. However, his influence declined after the 1981 election of François Mitterrand as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the French Left took control of the government.\n\nIn the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology and Society at Penn State. He also taught at the University of Bremen and University of Hagen. During his last days of his life he admitted that he was greatly influenced by one of the Indian economists and adviser to M. K. Gandhi, J. C. Kumarappa, most notably, his book, \"Economy of Permanence\".\n\nWhile Illich never referred to himself as an anarchist in print, he was closely associated with major figures in left-anarchist circles, notably Paul Goodman and unschooling advocate John Holt. Goodman is credited in \"Deschooling Society\" with having \"radically obliged\" Illich to revise his thinking, and described with great affection in Illich's 1990s interviews with David Cayley:\n\nIllich died 2 December 2002 in Bremen, Germany. His last wish, to die surrounded by close collaborators amid the genesis of a new learning centre he had planned in Bologna, was not realised.\n\nThe book that brought Ivan Illich to public attention was \"Deschooling Society\" (1971), a radical critical discourse on education as practised in \"modern\" economies. Giving examples of what he regards as the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:\n\nThe last sentence makes clear what the title suggests—that the institutionalization of education tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.\n\nThe book is more than a critique—it contains suggestions for a reinvention of learning throughout society and lifetime. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support \"learning webs\":\n\nAccording to a contemporary review in \"The Libertarian Forum\", \"Illich's advocacy of the free market in education is the bone in the throat that is choking the public educators.\" Since Illich's opposition was not merely to publicly funded schooling, as with the libertarians, but to schooling as such; the disestablishment of schools was for him not a means to a free market in educational services, but a deschooled society, which was a more fundamental shift. As he later asserted in \"After Deschooling, What?\" (1973): 'We can disestablish schools, or we can deschool culture'. He actually opposed advocates of free-market education as \"the most dangerous category of educational reformers.\"\n\n\"Tools for Conviviality\" (1973) was published only two years after \"Deschooling Society\". In this new work Illich generalized the themes that he had previously applied to the field of education: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of technocratic elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that \"[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a 'radical monopoly' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty', dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts.\" Illich proposed that we should \"invert the present deep structure of tools\" in order to \"give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency.\"\n\n\"Tools for Conviviality\" attracted worldwide attention. A résumé of it was published by French social philosopher André Gorz in \"Les Temps Modernes\", under the title \"Freeing the Future\". The book's vision of tools that would be developed and maintained by a community of users had a significant influence on the first developers of the personal computer, notably Lee Felsenstein.\n\nIn his \"Medical Nemesis\", first published in 1975, also known as \"Limits to Medicine\", Illich subjected contemporary Western medicine to detailed attack. He argued that the medicalization in recent decades of so many of life's vicissitudes—birth and death, for example—frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of iatrogenic disease, which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820–1910). Others have since voiced similar views.\n\nIn his speech of 1968 to the Conference on InterAmerican Student Projects (CIASP), Illich strongly opposes the presence of American missionaries in Mexico. Illich says that the presence of American's \"do-gooders\" is causing more harm than good. Rather, he suggests that the Americans should stay completely away from Latin America and stay in their homeland where they can at least know what they are doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The movement had a list of claims to the President and Government of Mexico for specific students' actions such as the release of political prisoners and the reduction or elimination of authoritarianism. In the background, the movement was motivated by the global Protests of 1968 and struggled for a democratic change in the country, more political and civil liberties, the reduction of inequality and the resignation of the government of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that they considered authoritarian.\n\nThe movement aroused from July–October 1968 in the context of the buildup to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City and the worldwide protests that year. In the course of the movement was permanently repressed by the government and finally tried to annihilate on the Tlatelolco massacre on October 2, 1968. The massacre was planned and executed under the code name Operation Galeana, by the paramilitary group called Olimpia Battalion, the Federal Security Direction (DFS), then the so-called Secret Police and the Mexican Army simulating a shooting in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas after the conclusion of a concentration of the CNH. One year after, in 1969, president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz –also a CIA's informer assumed the responsibility of the massacre.\n\nTwenty two years after the Government of Mexico created a Special Prosecutor for the Social and Political Movements of the Past (FEMOSSP, in Spanish) which published several conclusions in an \"Historical Inform to the Society\"\"\" after the reopening of the case and concluded that the movement marked an inflection \"in the political times of Mexico\", and was \"independent, rebellious and close to the civil resistance\" this last recognized officially as false the main argument of the Diaz Ordaz's official version that the reason behind the movement was the pretension of the installation of a Communist regime. With this argument the mexican government justified a strategy to combat the movement and characterizing it as a foreign risk with terrorists pretensions.\n\nIn that order the Mexican Government planned and ordered an extermination campaign during the months of the movement and after based on a massive strategy of Human Rights violations as false imprisonments, abuses, torture, persecution, espionage, criminalization; also crimes as forced disappearances, homicides and extrajudicial killings. All along this period the Mexican Government had an active advising, presence and intelligence operations of the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States\"\" under the undercovered Operation LITEMPO including having Diaz Ordaz and other high representatives of the Mexican Government as informants. The number of victims, disappeared and imprisoned is still imprecise\"\".\n\nSome victims of the Tlatelolco massacre tried to sue the October 2 killings on national and international courts as a crime against humanity and a genocide, affirmation that was sustained by FEMOSPP but rejected by its courts. Some political scientists, historians and intellectuals like Carlos Monsiváis agreed in pointing out that this movement and its conclusion incited a permanent and more active critical and oppositional attitude of civil society, mainly in public universities. As well provoked the radicalization of some survivor activists who opted for clandestinity and formed urban and rural guerrillas, which were repressed in the so-called Dirty War on the 70s.\n\nFor several years prior to the protests, Mexico had experienced a period of strong economic performance called the Mexican miracle. The government wanted to showcase this progress to the world during the Olympics. However, the economic growth hadn't been spread evenly, and students saw an opportunity to bring reforms and more democracy to Mexico. Arising from reaction to the government's violent repression of fights between rival \"porros\" (gangs), the student movement in Mexico City quickly grew to include large segments of the student body who were dissatisfied with the regime of the PRI.\n\nThe 1968 Olympic Games took place in Mexico, making it the first developing country to host this event. This represented an important source of income to the country because of the tourists who would come to attend the Olympics. Giving a good impression to the world could lead to the introduction of international investors. However the students were against these ideals. They did not believe that the appearance of Mexico to the world was a priority. They preferred a revolution resulting in the reformation of their country. \"No queremos Olimpiadas, queremos revolución\" (We do not want Olympic Games, we want a revolution). The IOC threatened to move the Games to Los Angeles if the situation deteriorated.\n\nProtests took place throughout 1968, and were often violently stopped by police.\n\nThe Silence March was a silent demonstration that took place on September 13, meant to prove that the movement was not a series of riots but had discipline and self-control.\n\nFrom July to September 1968, student movements started to arise and become stronger, to the point that the government began aggressively intervening. On October 2, 1968, at 5 PM in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco, a neighborhood of Mexico City, almost 10 thousand men, women and children stood waiting for a meeting to start. However, when the leaders of the several student organizations and movements arrived, policemen and the military, sent by president Díaz Ordaz and commanded by Luis Echeverria, decided to dissolve the meeting. A student claims that at about 6:10 a helicopter dropped three flares over the plaza, quickly followed by the first gunshots. Students were kidnapped,\ntortured, and terrorized by the government.\n\nThis social movement brought unavoidable consequences which permanently changed the future of Mexico, but these political and social changes were not immediate, the repression continued with the Corpus Christi massacre in 1971.\n\nThe major change caused by this movement came at a political level. The citizens had the opportunity to live a new democracy in which their opinion could actually bring change in society. People no longer trusted completely in the government and would no longer live completely under the conscious control of their government, nor tolerate it anymore, although they were not completely free. Octavio Paz resigned from the Indian embassy as an act of protest against the government's harsh repression of the student movements. However, there were also some older intellectuals who were in favor of the government, like Agustín Yañez.\n\n"}

{"id": "33912864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33912864", "title": "Montessori in India", "text": "Montessori in India\n\nMontessori in India became popularised when Maria Montessori, founder of the Montessori method, was forced to stay in India during World War II.\n\nMaria Montessori's work in India began with her arrival there in 1939, and continued through her representatives, Joosten and Swamy, before spreading further. In 1939, the Theosophical Society of India extended an invitation to the 69-year-old Montessori. She accepted the invitation and reached India the same year. She made Adyar, Chennai her home and lived there along with her son, Mario. The famous Montessorians, Gool Minwala, Tehmina Wadia and Khurshed Taraporewala were the students in the first training at Adyar.\n\nIn 1940, when India entered World War II, Montessori and her son were interned as enemy aliens in India, but Maria was allowed to conduct training courses. Sixteen courses were conducted during this time, creating a very strong base for the method here. She also had her own school in Kodaikanal for this duration. In 1947, she went back to Europe for a brief period. Montessori returned to India for a second time the same year to conduct a few more courses in Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Karachi. The Montessoris then returned to Europe, leaving A.M. Joosten as their representative in India. Montessori died in 1952 at the age of 81 years.\n\nTo create an official structure for Joosten's work, an organisation was created by the name of Indian Montessori Training Courses (IMTC) in 1949. It was an organisation consisting mainly of Joosten and Swamy. This travelling institution moved from city to city until Swamy's retirement in 1990. Ex-students from previous trainings working in the locality were called upon to be assistants. After Swamy's retirement, IMTC ran under the Directorship of Meenakshi Shivaramakrishnan. IMTC was now based in Bangalore. By the next decade, new branches were created at Chennai under the name CMTC.\n\nIndian Montessori Center invited Rajendra Gupta to conduct a primary Montessori training at Bangalore in 1996. This was the first such course to be conducted in India after Montessori left the country. However, IMC discontinued the course after this year. To preserve the method thereafter, Rajendra Gupta set up Indian Institute for Montessori Studies with himself as the Director, Radha Nagaraj as the co-Director, with the help of a few of his students. IIMS continues to be a rarity where the work is carried out by a committee rather than an individual, adding more faculty over the years.\n\nAt present, there are four AMI Montessori centres in India: Bangalore, Chennai, Hydrebad and Mumbai.\n\nAfter the popularising of the Primary Montessori Training by IIMS, several schools offering this method at the primary level came up in Bangalore, Tumkur, Chennai and Trichy. This has encouraged other pre-primary based institutions to branch out into this area. Both IMTC and Navadisha Montessori Institute have offered primary Montessori training from time to time.\n\nIt has taken many years' work by many to make Montessori method popular in India. In one city, Bangalore itself, the number of such schools has increased from six in 1990 to more than a hundred. This growth of the movement was sustained by the following people and their students, who held it together with their personal efforts and charisma.\n\nAlbert Joosten, a renowned Montessori trainer, was trained by Montessori in 1934. He worked in Montessori schools (pre-primary and elementary) in Berlin, Amsterdam, London and Laren (Netherlands) and assisted Maria and Mario Montessori and at International Montessori Training Courses and Conferences all over Europe. In 1949, he was appointed Director of the Indian Montessori Training Courses, India, Joosten co-founded the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Center at Colombo (Sri Lanka) in 1957. In 1973, he was appointed, on behalf of the Association Montessori International, Director of the Montessori Training Center of Minnesota, U.S.A. He was the director of all these training centers until his death in 1980. Joosten conducted workshops and lectures in India, the U.S.A., Canada and several European countries and was speaker at several International Montessori Conference in Europe and the U.S.A. He translated and cooperated with the translation of several of Montessori's books in English, Dutch, German and Portuguese. He continued to be the Director of IMTC till his demise in 1980.\n\nS. R. Swamy took Montessori training with Montessori at Kodaikanal. He worked in various schools in India until 1951. He was first Assistant to Joosten and a trainer at the Indian Montessori Training Courses from 1951 to 1980. He became the Director of the training from 1980 to 1990.\n\nTo read about her, please look below under the See also section\n\nGupta took his Montessori pre-primary training with Joosten in India in 1953 on the recommendation of the headmaster of the school in which he was working at Muzzafarnagar. After working for several years at his old school and at the AMI school of Gwalior, he moved to Delhi. When Joosten conducted his 6th – 8th course in Delhi, Gupta acted as his assistant. His wife, Urmila Gupta also took her training at this period and joined him in his work for nearly a decade. When the Birth Centenary celebrations of Montessori was organised in New Delhi, he was in charge. A postage stamp was released on the occasion. V. V. Giri, President of India, presided over the function. Two years later, he left for US. Gupta stayed in touch with Joosten until his death in 1980, even visiting him during the latter’s visit to Minnesota.\nGupta took his elementary training with Margaret Stevenson in the USA in 1978. Later he completed his Master of Education degree from Century University, New Mexico, USA. He worked in AMI Montessori Houses of Children for about 20 years in India and the USA and in AMI elementary Montessori Schools for 25 years in the USA.\nGupta was a Montessori trainer for both pre-primary and primary levels with the Southwest Montessori Training Center, Denton, Texas, USA for about ten years. He also gave orientation courses in Montessori Education at the College of St Scholastica, Duluth, Minnesota, and at the Chicago Community College, Illinois, USA. He was an Adjunct Professor with the University of Texas A & I, Kingsville, Texas, USA where he gave a pre-primary Montessori course to the Master of Education students. Mr. Gupta gave workshops in India as well as in the USA on various subjects during 45 years of his teaching career. He has written manuals for Montessori teachers in the areas of botany, zoology, and language, and published classroom materials on science, language, botany, zoology, and history. He has also published books written by Albert Joosten and other Montessorians. Currently he is the Director of the Indian Institute for Montessori Studies which is conducting Pre-primary cum Elementary course in Bangalore, India.\n\nRadha Nagaraj was a product of the infant Montessori school at Hymamshu. She took her pre-primary Montessori training from Joosten and Swamy in 1967–68 at the behest of the then Director, Sundaramma. She also set up a new Montessori at Mahila Mandali and worked there under the guidance of Swamy for ten years.\nJoosten came to Bangalore in 1978. Radha Nagaraj acted as his assistant for two years. She continued to work in Mahila Mandali since then as a Director. She took up assistance at IMTC from 1997 under Swamy, and continued to work there till 2002. She also handled the training in Kannada till 2004. The post of the co-Director of the pre-primary-cum-primary course at IIMS became hers in 2000, which continues to be hers till now.\nRadhaji has presented papers at the seminars organized by the Indian Montessori Center at Bangalore and at the celebration of 50 years of Montessori held at Chennai in 1989. She has been consulting with organisations like the Shreyas Foundation school at Ahmedabad and the Balasevika shibira of Vishva Hindu Parishad since 1990. She contributes articles to various Montessori publications in India.\n\nAs training institutions grew and set roots in one place, they grew societies to support their students in their work in the field. They also helped in the work of propagation, and brought together all those interested in the method, be they Montessorians, parents, school management or public. We list here some of the prominent ones.\n\nGovernment regulations in India state that no education institution can be run by an individual. To solve that issue, IMC, a registered society was created in 1990 with S.R Swamy as the first chairman.

Use of these materials constitutes the next level of difficulty after those of practical life.\n\nLike many other materials in the Montessori classroom, sensorial materials have what is called \"control of error\", meaning that the child not only works with the material, but has a way to check their work rather than seeking out the teacher if they have a question on whether or not they did it right. This is done to help promote independence and problem solving on the part of the child.\n\nThe cylinder blocks are ten wooden cylinders of various dimensions that can be removed from a fitted container block using a knobbed handle. To remove the cylinders, the child tends to naturally use the same three-finger grip used to hold pencils.\n\nSeveral activities can be done with the cylinder blocks. The main activity involves removing the cylinders from the block and replacing them again in the spot that one got them from. The control of error is constituted in the child's inability to replace a cylinder in the wrong hole.\n\nThe pink tower has ten pink cubes of different sizes, from 1 centimeter up to 10 cm in increments of 1 cm. The work is designed to provide the child with a concept of \"big\" and \"small.\" \n\nThe child starts with the largest cube and puts the second-largest cube on top of it. This continues until all ten cubes are stacked on top of each other.\n\nThe control of error is visual. The child sees the cubes are in the wrong order and knows that they should fix them. The successive dimensions of each cube are such that if the cubes are stacked flush with a corner, the smallest cube may be fit squarely on the ledge of each level\n\nThe broad stair (also called Brown Stair) is designed to teach the concepts of \"thick\" and \"thin\". It comprises ten sets of wooden prisms with a natural or brown stain finish. Each stair is 20 cm in length and varies in thickness from 1 to 10 cm. When put together from thickest to thinnest, they make an even staircase.\n\nAs an extension, the broad stairs are often used with the pink tower to allow the child to make many designs.\n\nThe red rods are rods with a square cross section, varying only in length. The smallest is 10 cm long and the largest is one meter long. Each rod is 2.5 cm/1inch square. By holding the ends of the rods with two hands, the material is designed to give the child a sense of long and short.\n\nAlso called the \"knobless cylinders\", the colored cylinders are exactly the same dimensions as the cylinder blocks mentioned above.\n\nThere are 4 boxes of cylinders:\n\nThe child can do a variety of exercises with these materials, including matching them with the cylinder blocks, stacking them on top of each other to form a tower, and arranging them in size or different patterns. When the yellow, red, and green cylinders are placed on top of each other, they all are the same height.\n\nThe binomial cube is a cube that has the following pieces: one red cube, three black and red prisms, three black and blue prisms, and one blue cube.\n\nA box with eight prisms represent the elements of formula_1 or: formula_2\n\nThe pieces are stored in a box with two hinged opening sides. The color pattern of the cube is painted all around the outside of the box (except the bottom).\n\nThe material is not designed for math education until the elementary years of Montessori education. In the primary levels (ages 3-6), it is used as sensorial material.\n\nThe trinomial cube is similar to the binomial cube, but has the following pieces instead:\n\nThis is similar to the binomial cube, but is a physical representation of this formula:\n\nformula_3\n\nThere are many Montessori sensorial materials, and more are being investigated and developed by teachers around the world. Other popular Montessori sensorial materials include:\n\n"}

{"id": "2573338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2573338", "title": "National Assessment of Educational Progress", "text": "National Assessment of Educational Progress\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment of what U.S. students know and can do in various subjects. NAEP is a congressionally mandated project administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education. The first national administration of NAEP occurred in 1969. The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) is an independent, bipartisan board that sets policy for NAEP and is responsible for developing the framework and test specifications.The National Assessment Governing Board, whose members are appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Education, includes governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators, business representatives, and members of the general public. Congress created the 26-member Governing Board in 1988.\n\nNAEP results are designed to provide group-level data on student achievement in various subjects, and are released as The Nation's Report Card. There are no results for individual students, classrooms, or schools. NAEP reports results for different demographic groups, including gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. Assessments are given most frequently in mathematics, reading, science and writing. Other subjects such as the arts, civics, economics, geography, technology and engineering literacy (TEL) and U.S. history are assessed periodically.\n\nIn addition to assessing student achievement in various subjects, NAEP also surveys students, teachers, and school administrators to help provide contextual information. Questions asking about participants' race or ethnicity, school attendance, and academic expectations help policy makers, researchers, and the general public better understand the assessment results.\n\nTeachers, principals, parents, policymakers, and researchers all use NAEP results to assess student progress across the country and develop ways to improve education in the United States. NAEP has been providing valid and reliable data on student performance since 1969.\n\nNAEP uses a carefully designed sampling procedure that allows the assessment to be representative of the geographical, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity of the schools and students in the United States. Data is also provided on students with disabilities and English language learners. Since NAEP assessments are administered uniformly to all participating students using the same test booklets and identical procedures across the nation, NAEP results serve as a common metric for states and select urban districts that participate in the assessment.\n\nThere are two NAEP websites: the NCES NAEP website and The Nation's Report Card website. The first site details the NAEP program holistically, while the second focuses primarily on the individual releases of data.\n\nNAEP began in 1964, with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to set up the Exploratory Committee for the Assessment of Progress in Education (ESCAPE). The first national assessments were held in 1969. Voluntary assessments for the states began in 1990 on a trial basis and in 1996 were made a permanent feature of NAEP to be administered every two years. In 2002, selected urban districts participated in the state-level assessments on a trial basis and continue as the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA).\n\nThe development of a successful NAEP program has involved many, including researchers, state education officials, contractors, policymakers, students, and teachers.\n\nThere are two types of NAEP assessments, main NAEP and long-term trend NAEP. This separation makes it possible to meet two objectives:\n\n\nMain NAEP assessments are conducted in a range of subjects with fourth-, eighth- and twelfth-graders across the country. Assessments are given most frequently in mathematics, reading, science, and writing. Other subjects such as the arts, civics, economics, geography, technology and engineering literacy (TEL), and U.S. history are assessed periodically.\n\nThese assessments follow subject-area frameworks that are developed by the NAGB and use the latest advances in assessment methodology. \nUnder main NAEP, results are reported at the national level, and in some cases, the state and district levels.\n\nNational NAEP reports statistical information about student performance and factors related to educational performance for the nation and for specific demographic groups in the population (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender). It includes students from both public and nonpublic (private) schools and depending on the subject reports results for grades 4, 8, and 12.\n\nState NAEP results are available in some subjects for grades 4 and 8. This allows participating states to monitor their own progress over time in mathematics, reading, science, and writing. They can then compare the knowledge and skills of their students with students in other states and with the nation.\n\nThe assessments given in the states are exactly the same as those given nationally. Traditionally, state NAEP was assessed only at grades 4 and 8. However, a 2009 pilot program allowed 11 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South Dakota, and West Virginia) to receive scores at the twelfth-grade level.\n\nThrough 1988, NAEP reported only on the academic achievement of the nation as a whole and for demographic groups within the population. Congress passed legislation in 1988 authorizing a voluntary Trial State Assessment. Separate representative samples of students were selected from each state or jurisdiction that agreed to participate in state NAEP. Trial state assessments were conducted in 1990, 1992, and 1994. Beginning with the 1996 assessment, the authorizing statute no longer considered the state component a \"trial.”\n\nA significant change to state NAEP occurred in 2001 with the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also referred to as \"No Child Left Behind\" legislation. This legislation requires that states which receive Title I funding must participate in state NAEP assessments in mathematics and reading at grades 4 and 8 every two years. State participation in other subjects assessed by state NAEP (science and writing) remains voluntary.\n\nLike all NAEP assessments, state NAEP does not provide individual scores for the students or schools assessed.\n\nThe Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) is a project developed to determine the feasibility of using NAEP to report on the performance of public school students at the district level. As authorized by congress, NAEP has administered the mathematics, reading, science, and writing assessments to samples of students in selected urban districts.\n\nTUDA began with six urban districts in 2002, and has since expanded to 27 districts for the 2017 assessment cycle.\n\nLong-term trend NAEP is administered to 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds periodically at the national level. Long-term trend assessments measure student performance in mathematics and reading and allow the performance of today's students to be compared with students since the early 1970s.\n\nAlthough long-term trend and main NAEP both assess mathematics and reading, there are several differences between them. In particular, the assessments differ in the content assessed, how often the assessment is administered, and how the results are reported. These and other differences mean that results from long-term trend and main NAEP cannot be compared directly.\n\nNAGB sets the calendar for NAEP assessments. Please refer to the entire assessment schedule for all NAEP assessments since 1968 and those planned through 2017.\n\nMain NAEP assessments are typically administered over approximately six weeks between the end of January and the beginning of March of every year. Long-term trend assessments are typically administered every four years by age group between October and May. All of the assessments are administered by NAEP-contracted field staff across the country.\n\nNAEP is conducted in partnership with states. The NAEP program provides funding for a full-time NSC in each state. He or she serves as the liaison between NAEP, the state's education agency, and the schools selected to participate.\n\nNSCs provide many important services for the NAEP program and are responsible for:\n\nWhile most NAEP assessments are administered in a paper-and-pencil based format, NAEP is evolving to address the changing educational landscape through its transition to digitally-based assessments. NAEP is using the latest technology available to deliver assessments to students, and as technology evolves, so will the nature of delivery of the DBAs. The goal is for all NAEP assessments to be paperless by the end of the decade. The 2011 writing assessment was the first to be fully computer-based.\n\nIn 2009, ICTs were administered as part of the paper-and-pencil science assessment. The computer delivery affords measurement of science knowledge, processes, and skills not able to be assessed in other modes. Tasks included performance of investigations that include observations of phenomena that would otherwise take a long time, modeling of phenomena on a very large scale or invisible to the naked eye, and research of extensive resource documents.\n\nThis special study in multi-stage testing, implemented in 2011, investigated the use of adaptive testing principles in the NAEP context. A sample of students were given an online mathematics assessment which adapts to their ability level. All of the items in the study are existing NAEP items.\n\nThe TEL assessment framework describes technology and engineering literacy as the capacity to use, understand, and evaluate technology as well as to understand technological principles and strategies needed to develop solutions and achieve goals. The three areas of the assessment are:\n\n\nEighth-grade students throughout the nation took the assessment in winter of 2014. Results from this assessment were released in May 2016.\n\nIn 2011, NAEP transitioned its writing assessment (at grades 8 and 12) from paper and pencil to a computer-based administration in order to measure students' ability to write using a computer. The assessment takes advantage of many features of current digital technology and the tasks are delivered in multimedia formats, such as short videos and audio. Additionally, in an effort to include as many students as possible, the writing computer-based assessment system has embedded within it several universal design features such as text-to-speech, adjustable font size, and electronic spell check. In 2012, NAEP piloted the computer-based assessment for students at grade 4.\n\nIn addition to the assessments, NAEP coordinates a number of related special studies that often involve special data collection processes, secondary analyses of NAEP results, and evaluations of technical procedures.\n\nAchievement gaps occur when one group of students outperforms another group and the difference in average scores for the two groups is statistically significant (that is, larger than the margin of error). In initial report releases NAEP highlights achievement gaps across student groups. However, NAEP has also releases a number of reports and data summaries that highlight achievement gap. – Some examples include the School Composition and the Black-White Achievement Gap and the Hispanic-White and the Black-White Achievement Gap Performance. These publications use NAEP scores in mathematics and/or reading for these groups to either provide data summaries or illuminate patterns and changes in these gaps over time. Research reports, like the School Composition and Black-White Achievement Gap, also include caveats and cautions to interpreting the data.\n\nThe HSTS explores the relationship between grade 12 NAEP achievement and high school academic careers by surveying the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the course-taking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. Recent studies have placed an emphasis on STEM education and how it correlates to student achievement on the NAEP mathematics and science assessments.\n\nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an international assessment by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) that measures student learning in mathematics and science. NCES initiated the NAEP-TIMSS linking study so that states and selected districts can compare their own students' performance against international benchmarks. The linking study was conducted in 2011 at grade 8 in mathematics and science. NCES will \"project\", state and district-level scores on TIMSS in both subjects using data from NAEP.\n\nThe NIES is a two-part study designed to describe the condition of education for American Indian/Alaska Native students in the United States. The first part of the study consists of assessment results in mathematics and reading at grades 4 and 8. The second part presents the results of a survey given to American Indian/Alaska Native students, their teachers and their school administrators. The surveys focus on the students' cultural experiences in and out of school.\n\nUnder the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, states develop their own assessments and set their own proficiency standards to measure student achievement. Each state controls its own assessment programs, including developing its own standards, resulting in great variation among the states in statewide student assessment practices. This variation creates a challenge in understanding the achievement levels of students across the United States.\nSince 2003, NCES has supported research that compares the proficiency standards of NAEP with those of individual states. State assessments are placed onto a common scale defined by NAEP scores, which allows states' proficiency standards to be compared not only to NAEP, but also to each other. \nNCES has released the Mapping State Proficiency Standards report using state data for mathematics and reading in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and most recently 2013.\n\nOver the years, NCES has conducted a number of other studies related to different aspects of the NAEP program. A few studies from the recent past are listed below:\n\nNAEP's heavy use of statistical hypothesis testing has drawn some criticism related to interpretation of results. For example, the Nation's Report Card reported \"Males Outperform Females at all Three Grades in 2005\" as a result of science test scores of 100,000 students in each grade. Hyde and Linn criticized this claim, because the mean difference was only 4 out of 300 points, implying a small effect size and heavily overlapped distributions. They argue that \"small differences in performance in the NAEP and other studies receive extensive publicity, reinforcing subtle, persistent, biases.\"\n\n"}

It is owned by the National Trust, who bought the property at auction in October 2014 for £450,000. It was formerly for many years part of Birmingham City Council's Outdoor Learning Service, providing outdoor education, and with links to the climbing community.\n\nLocated on the London to Holyhead A5 road (Great Britain), Ogwen developed as a stage coach inn and the present stores building was once stabling for horses. The nearby Tin Can Alley was a source of honing stones used to sharpen tools during the construction of the A5 by Thomas Telford. This mammoth project started in 1815 and it was 1836 by the time the first mail coach crossed the Menai Straits via Telford's bridge. Telford designed the milestones and the hexagonal toll houses every five miles. Toll houses survive in Capel Curig and Bethesda, Wales whilst in the middle stands Ogwen.\n\nThe centre is informally referred to as \"The Cott\" and has been used as a base for climbers since the nineteenth century. During the 1890s climbers stayed at Ogwen or the Pen-y-Gwryd and early accounts make mention of Mrs Jones of Ogwen Cottage; \" Mrs Jones at Ogwen Cottage always most good naturedly received and fed us if we turned up, no matter at what hour.”\n\nIn 1895 Archer Thompson ascended Twll Du, climbing the ice with an unusual tool; \"According to tradition Thor was armed with a hammer for his battle with the Frost Giants, and with such a weapon, we too, were luckily provided in the form of a hatchet, surreptitiously removed from Mrs Jones' coal cellar at Ogwen.”\n\nThe 1894 Climbers' Club Journal contained an advert for The Cott citing it as \"the chief centre for climbers visiting Snowdonia….the cottage is on the high road and conveyances meet visitors at Bethesda Station if so desired.”\n\nGeoffrey Winthrop Young, a noted alpinist with many first ascents to his credit, stayed at Ogwen between visits to the Alps in the early 1900s.\n\n1959 saw Ron James, Trevor Jones and Tony Mason-Hornby purchasing The Cott from Mrs Williams and opening it as a mountaineering school. Ogwen became a climbing base and Mrs Williams gave the new owners advice on mounting rescues; \"Fire a red flare in the car park – get the climbers together and put the one with the cleanest boots in charge.”\n\nWith increasing leisure time and improved transport links, Ogwen grew as a climbing mecca and The Cott's instructors regularly became involved in rescuing climbers in trouble and gradually a specialist mountain rescue team evolved into what is now the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation.\n\nRon James remained chief instructor for another five years after Birmingham City Council purchased The Cott in 1964.\n\nOver the next 45 years thousands of Birmingham people attended courses at Ogwen. Until the 1980s courses were for a fortnight but economic considerations and the need to take more students meant a reduction to six days.\n\nThe Adventurous Activities Licensing Service (AALLS) pays regular visits and while the activities may not be as extreme as they once were, Ogwen is probably the only centre in the UK to programme multi-pitch climbing for secondary school students.\n\nThe traditional core of mountaineering activities remains with an emphasis on mountain walking and climbing but the programme has expanded to include kayaking, gorge walking, canoeing, ski trips, orienteering, expeditions. A student might ascend Hope on the Idwal Slabs as their first ever climb, before descending Suicide Wall by abseil. An evening of orienteering and then the next day might see a kayak descent of the Afon Llugwy or a walk up Tryfan.\n\nOgwen now offers self-catering bunkhouse style accommodation and runs National Governing Body Awards and adventure courses for adults.\n\nStudents look after themselves, help serve meals, wash and tidy up. \n\nIn October 2014 it was sold off by Birmingham City Council, which had to close its outdoor education service due to funding cuts and an increasing number of schools switching to different venues for educational trips. The National Trust purchased it at auction for £450,000.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1816, it is among the oldest colleges in the United States. It is composed of the College of Arts & Sciences,the School of Business, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the Crane School of Music.\n\nPotsdam was founded by Benjamin Raymond in 1816 as the St. Lawrence Academy. In 1834, the academy was chosen by the New York State Legislature to exclusively offer a teacher education program for its senatorial district. With funds from the state, and from support by preceptor Reverend Asa Brainerd, the first diploma in teaching was given in 1836, thus beginning the academy's and eventually the college's longstanding tradition of excellence in the field of teacher education.\n\nIn 1866, the State Legislature ended its funding of teacher education departments in private academies, and began establishing several normal schools throughout the state. The Village of Potsdam was thus named as one of four locations for new normal schools, and in 1867, the St. Lawrence Academy became the Potsdam Normal School.\n\nBy 1886, the Potsdam Normal School had become the first institution in the United States to offer a normal training course for public school music teachers in the United States. Founded by Julia E. Crane, the Crane Normal Institute of Music continues today as the world-renowned Crane School of Music as a leader in the field of music education.\n\nThe State University of New York was founded in 1948, and Potsdam became one of its founding members, and was thus renamed New York State Teachers College at Potsdam. In 1964, the college's mission changed to providing multiple programs, and the university adopted its current name.\n\nDuring the 1980s, despite the college's traditional strengths in music and education, the college gained recognition for its quickly blossoming mathematics program under the guidance of Dr. Clarence F. Stephens. Known as the Potsdam Miracle, Stephens transformed a practically non-existent department to having the third largest number of mathematics majors of any institution in the United States during his tenure.\n\nThe college has a total enrollment of approximately 4,500 students and approximately 930 freshmen entered Potsdam in 2010. That is the biggest first-year class since 1982, and an 11.4 percent increase over last year's incoming freshman class, which had 835 students.\n\nThe campus is in the small village of Potsdam, near the Canada–United States border. It is situated in the St. Lawrence Valley, between the St. Lawrence River and the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains. It is about 10 miles northwest of the border of the Adirondack State Park in Parishville.\n\nThe school sits on and consists of 44 buildings. Barrington Drive runs through the center of the campus, with all academic buildings on the northwest side of the street, and all campus life and residence buildings on the southeast side. The Crane School of Music campus is in the northern part of the campus, east of the academic quad.\n\nThe college has two libraries, the Frederick W. Crumb Memorial Library in the center of the academic quad, and the Crane Music Library in Schuette Hall at the Crane complex. The college also has six performance facilities: Hosmer Hall, Snell Theatre, and Wakefield Recital Hall (three venues in The Crane School of Music), the Proscenium Theater, the Black Box Theater, and the Dance Theater (three venues in the college's new Performing Arts Center). The college also houses an art gallery and the Maxcy Hall Athletic Facility.\n\nSUNY Potsdam is home to the Charles T. Weaver Anthropology Museum, a teaching museum that allows students to curate exhibitions and have hands on experience with the museum's collection. Also on campus is the Art Museum at SUNY Potsdam, also known as the Gibson Gallery, which stresses its mission to connect students, faculty and all those on campus with visual art.\n\nThe affiliated non-profit organization that provides dining services and runs the union market and college bookstore on campus is known as PACES or Potsdam Auxiliary College Education Services. This organization is the largest financial supporter of the college, annually donating significant portions of their proceeds back to the college in support of scholarships and other initiatives on campus.\n\nStudent activities:\n\nIn 1981 and 1986, under Hall of Fame Coach Jerry Welsh, the Potsdam Bears basketball team won the NCAA Division III National Championship. In 1979, 1982, and 1985, the Potsdam Bears were national runners-up for this title. The SUNY-Potsdam men's ice hockey team has competed in the NCAA for 27 years, from 1976 to the present. Most recently, they played in the State University of New York Athletic Conference, which is a Division III athletics conference. The 1995-96 Men's Ice Hockey team won the hockey program's only SUNYAC title in school history, under Hall of Fame Coach Ed Seney.\n\nSUNY Potsdam athletics were recently placed on NCAA probation due to an inadvertent error in the awarding of international student grants. The teams affected by the NCAA probation are men's and women's hockey, women's volleyball, men's and women's lacrosse, and women's soccer.\n\nMany SUNY Potsdam students participate in the Army ROTC and Air Force ROTC programs. Students can apply for ROTC scholarships to the university, and may commission as officers in the United States military upon graduation.\n\nSUNY Potsdam is a partner school of the Golden Knight Battalion, one of 272 Army ROTC Battalions in the United States. SUNY Potsdam students are the second largest group represented in the battalion, which is composed of approximately 100 ROTC Cadets. The headquarters for the Golden Knight Battalion is at 49 Elm St. in downtown Potsdam, where it has been for decades.\n\n\n\nSUNY Potsdam has four a cappella groups on campus - The Potsdam Pointercounts (1993–Present), The A Sharp Arrangement (1994–Present), The Potsdam Pitches (2007–Present) and Stay Tuned (2012–Present). All four groups have competed in the ICCAs (International Championship of Collegiate A cappella) run by Varsity Vocals.\n\nThe Potsdam Miracle refers to the unusual success of the Mathematics Department at SUNY Potsdam, USA, under the guidance of Dr. Clarence F. Stephens, in attracting large numbers of students to become successful mathematics majors. For example, in one year, about 25% of the degrees conferred by Potsdam were in mathematics and over 40% of the institution’s honor students were mathematics majors. The 184 majors that year was the third-largest number of colleges and universities in the United States.\n\nSeven of the eight valedictorians for the period 1980–1987 were mathematics majors. No student who graduated from SUNY Potsdam between the time of its founding in 1816 and the arrival of Stephens in 1969 is known to have earned a Ph.D. in mathematics. However, twelve students who graduated during Stephens's tenure are known to have done so, half of them women.\n\nThe Potsdam Miracle confirmed the effectiveness of the Potsdam Model of mathematics education. The model is based not on lowering student standard but in raising teaching standards.\n\nIn explaining the program in Dilip Datta's book \"Math Education at its Best: The Potsdam Model\", Stephens said his primary goal was to create the most favorable possible conditions for students to learn and for faculty to teach. He and a team of other student-oriented faculty members taught a course, \"How to Read Mathematics Literature with Understanding and to Become Independent Learners\", to students early in their study of mathematics. For undergraduates, that was typically in the freshman or sophomore year, while for graduate students it was during their first year.\nThe Potsdam Model is “based on the premise that the study of pure mathematics can be undertaken successfully by a large number of students if they are provided with a supportive environment including: careful and considerate teaching by a well-trained and dedicated faculty, continual encouragement, successful (student) role models, enough success to develop self-esteem, enough time to develop intellectually, recognition of their achievement, and the belief that the study is a worthwhile endeavor.”\n\nStephens had largely developed his ideas and earlier implemented them at Morgan State College (now Morgan State University). Although no graduates of Morgan are known to have received a Ph.D. in mathematics, nine did so during his tenure there. Hence, the Potsdam Model is sometimes called the Morgan-Potsdam Model.\n\n\n"}

Released on itch.io on July 4, 2017 for PC/Mac and PlayStation 4 on May 15, 2018, the game translates the experience of naturalist and author Henry David Thoreau's stay at Walden Pond in 1845-47 to a video game. The game was announced for PlayStation 4 at the 2017 PlayStation Experience.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Walden, a game\" is balanced between several goals: surviving in the woods through self reliant living; seeking inspiration in the woods through attention to animals, sounds, solitude and books; and exploration and discovery of the social and personal context leading to Thoreau's experiment.\n\nThe survival simulation focuses on the four \"necessaries of life\" as described by Thoreau in the book Walden -- food, fuel, shelter and clothing. Players must care-take these aspects of their life in the woods in order to maintain their energy. If they fail to do so, they will faint from exhaustion. \n\nThe inspiration aspects of the game focus on several of the themes discussed in the later chapters of the book Walden -- visitors, sound, solitude and reading. Players can find inspiration by exploring the woods and interacting with animals (visitors), finding places of solitude, which are marked by cairns, listening to the sounds of civilization (wagons, a train whistle, church bells, etc) that can be heard from the edges of the woods, and reading the books found throughout the woods. When the player is inspired, the colors and sounds of the game are richer, however if they let their inspiration fall, these colors and sounds will become dull.\n\nIn addition to care-taking survival and inspiration, the player may also explore Thoreau's world to discover a series of intertwined stories about his life and the tensions in the world around him that sent him to the woods for his experiment in self-reliant living. Letters and visits from his mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson explore his ambitions as a writer. A series of poetic clues from his sister Sophia lead the player to secret areas of the woods and to an understanding of a mutual tragedy. Other storylines follow Thoreau's involvement in the Abolitionist movement of the times, his work as a surveyor, and his connections to prominent scientist Louis Agassiz.\n\nThe game takes place over the course of the first year of Thoreau's stay in the woods, as does the book of Walden. At the end of the year, as Spring comes, Thoreau experiences a re-birth and re-connection to life, and the player can choose to leave the woods, or to stay and continue their own experiment.\n\nThe game was developed over the course of ten years as a research project at the USC Game Innovation Lab lead by Tracy Fullerton. The game began production in 2007 without funding, but in 2012 was awarded a media arts grant from the NEA to support production of the game. This support was followed by admission into the Sundance New Frontier Story Lab in 2014, and grants from the NEH Digital Projects for the Public.\nThe crew for the production was made up of a small core team of faculty and staff from the Game Innovation Lab as well as students who participated over the years. The audio design and music composition for the game was done by Michael Sweet of Berklee College of Music and the score for the game was recorded live at Berklee College.\n\nThe voice of Henry David Thoreau is performed by actor Emile Hirsch.\n\n\"Walden, a game\" was selected for several festivals prior to its launch, including Indiecade 2014 (Digital Select), Indiecade 2015 (Finalist), Tokyo Game Show Sense of Wonder Night 2015, International Documentary Film Festival 2015, Sheffield Doc Fest 2015 (Special Mention Interactive Award), Meaningful Play 2016 (Most Meaningful Game Award) and Davos BetaZone 2017 at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe game received significant press attention after an article on the front page of \"The New York Times\" extolled its unique premise: \"In ‘Walden’ Video Game, the Challenge Is Stillness.\" The launch of the game in July of 2017, concurrent with the 200th anniversary of Thoreau's birth, brought attention from \"Harper's Magazine\", \"The Smithsonian Magazine\", \"The Times\", \"USA Today\", \"CNN\", \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\", \"Slate\", \"Salon\" and \"Rolling Stone\" among others. Press reaction to the game was positive, citing beautiful visuals, a slow pace allowing for reflection, and historical accuracy of the content. The game was given a five star rating by Common Sense Media for its positive messages, role models and educational value.\n\nAt the 2017 Games for Change Festival \"Walden, a game\" was awarded Game of the Year and Most Significant Impact. At the 2017 Indiecade Festival, it was awarded the Developers Choice Award along with \"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine\". It was also nominated for the Off-Broadway Award for Best Indie Game at the New York Game Awards 2018.\n\n\"Walden, a game\" was one of the top purchased games of 2017 on Itch.io as well as one of the top tipped games on the platform of that year.\n\n"}
