The Edinburgh Society of Accountants (1854), the Glasgow Institute of Accountants and Actuaries (1854) and the Aberdeen Society of Accountants (1867) were each granted a royal charter almost from their inception. The title is an internationally recognised professional designation; the certified public accountant designation is generally equivalent to it. \n\nChartered accountants work in all fields of business and finance, including auditing, taxation, financial and general management. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.\n\nChartered accountants' institutes require members to undertake a minimum level of continuing professional development to stay professionally competitive. \nThey facilitate special interest groups (for instance, entertainment and media, or insolvency and restructuring) which lead in their fields. They provide support to members by offering advisory services, technical helplines and technical libraries. They also offer opportunities for professional networking, career and business development.\n\nChartered accountants of Australia belong to the Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand (CA ANZ, formerly the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia) and use the designatory letters \"CA\". Some senior members (at least 15 years' membership) of the institute may be elected fellows and use the letters \"FCA\". Of equal legal status and recognition in Australia as qualified professional accountants are Institute of Public Accountants (IPA) and CPA Australia. On 28 June 2016, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CA ANZ announced a strategic alliance to provide an opportunity for dual membership of both bodies, which will add value for the members locally and globally. ACCA members resident in Australia and New Zealand will be invited to apply for CA membership and CA ANZ members will be invited to apply for ACCA membership, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria of the other body.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) is the national professional accounting body of Bangladesh. Established in 1973, it is the sole organization with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation in Bangladesh. Senior members (at least five years' membership) of the institute are called \"fellow members\" and use the letters \"FCA\".\n\nBangladesh has more than 1,900 registered Chartered Accountants and more than 28,000 articled students.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda works with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and is the sole organisation in Bermuda with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation.\n\nIn Canada, chartered accountants belong to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) by way of membership in at least one provincial or territorial institute (or \"order\" in Quebec). In order to become a member, a candidate requires an undergraduate degree plus experience and, depending on the province, additional education. Candidates in all provinces are required to pass the three-day Uniform Evaluation (UFE) now Common Final Examination (CFE).\n\nSince 2012, the CICA has been in a process of unification with the other two accounting bodies in Canada. Canadian CA's, along with Certified General Accountants (CGAs) and Certified Management Accountants (CMAs), have now adopted the designation Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA), making the term \"chartered accountant\" obsolete.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Czech Republic and use the designatory letters \"CAE\" (Chartered Accountant expert). Chartered Accountants may also be members of the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic (KACR), with whom the ICAEW launched its ACA qualification in 2015.\n\nUnder the Mutual Recognition Directive, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals holding a professional qualification can become members of the equivalent bodies in another member state.\nThey must, however, pass an aptitude test in understanding local conditions (which for accountants will include local tax and company law variations).\n\nThe local title is, however, not available for use if the professional does not choose to join the local professional body. For example, a holder of the French \"\"  qualification could practise as an accountant in England without taking a local test but could only describe him or herself as \"expert-comptable (France)\" not \"Chartered Accountant\". Within the EEA, only the UK and Ireland have bodies that issue the Chartered Accountant title.\n\nIn India, Chartered Accountants are regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) which was established by the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. \nAssociate members of the ICAI are entitled to add the prefix \"CA\" to their names. Members who are in full-time practice, and have completed five years of practice, can use \"FCA\". , the ICAI had nearly 270,000 registered members.\n\nEntry to the profession can be made by taking the CA Foundation Course after completion of schooling (12th grade). Alternatively, graduates may train as an articled assistant for three years in a chartered firm before taking the Intermediate and then final exam.\nA comprehensive 100 hours of information technology training and an orientation programme for soft skills development have to be completed before being articled.\n\nIn Ireland, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Chartered Accountants Ireland and use the designatory letters ACA or FCA. Chartered accountants may also be members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.\n\nIn Nepal, the profession of Chartered Accountancy is regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN) which was established by parliament under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1997.\n\nAfter completion of three levels of examination (CAP I, CAP II, and CAP III) with three years of articleship training under a qualified CA, one can get the membership of ICAN and with the Certificate of Practice (COP), one can practise as a professional accountant.\n\nIn New Zealand, Chartered Accountants belong to the Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand (CA ANZ, formerly New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) and use the designatory letters CA. Some senior members may be elected fellows and use the letters FCA.\n\nThere is also a mid-tier qualification called Associate Chartered Accountant with the designatory letters ACA. Associate chartered accountants are not eligible to hold a certificate of public practice and therefore cannot offer services to the public.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) is the professional body of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan, established on 1 July 1961 under the Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961. ICAP is the sole body and authority in Pakistan which has a mandate to regulate the accounting and auditing profession in the country. It adopts and develops the national auditing standards and develops accounting standards for the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). It represents accountants employed in public practice, business and industry, and the public sector. The Institute is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), which is the global organization for the accountancy profession.\n\nICAP has more than 7,000 active members and more than 25,000 students.\n\nThe Chartered Accountant of Singapore (CA (Singapore)) title is protected under the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) Act. The pathway to obtain the designation is owned by the SAC, a statutory body of the government. The Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) is a designated entity in the SAC Act and confers the CA (Singapore) designation on behalf of SAC. The Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification programme has three components: academic base, professional programme and 3 years of practical experience. ISCA and the SAC have worked to raise the profile and promote the Singapore CA Qualification for international recognition.\n\nApplicants who are eligible for the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification foundation programme should have either accredited degrees, other degrees, undergraduates and local polytechnic diplomas. Those with who are eligible for direct entry into the professional programme should have local accountancy degrees from Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Social Sciences, and Singapore Institute of Technology. \n\nIn 2013, holders of Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CPA Australia have until 31 December 2016 and existing students have until 31 December 2018 to complete the ICPAS PAC and qualify for the \"Chartered Accountant of Singapore\" professional designation through the previous transitional arrangements.\n\nIn South Africa, SAICA (South African Institute of Chartered Accountants) regulates the Chartered Accountant (South Africa) designation, CA (SA).\n\nTo qualify as a CA (SA), one requires a specialised bachelor's degree in accounting, followed by a Certificate in the Theory of Accounting (CTA); depending on the university, this is offered as a postgraduate honours degree or as a postgraduate diploma. This formal education is followed by two external competency exams set by SAICA.\n\nA separate registration is needed for Chartered Accountants wishing to act as auditors in public practice as a registered auditor (RA). The RA designation is conferred by IRBA (Independent Regulatory Board For Auditors, previously known as Public Accountants and Auditors Board [PAAB]) under the Auditing Profession Act (AP Act).\n\nCandidates must complete three years of practical experience, working for a registered training office – the Training In Public Practice (TIPP) programme. Articled clerks who switch employers during this period are required to extend their training by six months. The Training Outside Public Practice (TOPP) programme has a financial management focus; TOPP trainees can thus become Chartered Accountants with a more limited knowledge and experience of auditing than those who undergo the TIPP programme, but with a more extensive financial management and business experience.\n\nChartered accountants who are not registered auditors may not act as or hold out to be auditors in public practice. However, the AP Act does not prohibit non-RAs from using the description 'internal auditor' or 'accountant', or from auditing a not-for-profit club, institution or association if they receive no fee for such audit.\n\nIn South Africa the Companies Act was replaced, with effect in July 2010, to allow companies without a public interest to choose between an audit or an independent review. A review is not an attest function and will be performed by accountants who are members of bodies that are registered in terms of the Close Corporations Act of 1984, which include SAIBA, CIMA, SAICA, SAIPA and ACCA.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the title of Chartered Accountant (CA Sri Lanka) can be used by only members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. These could be Associate Members (ACA) and Fellows (FCA). Chartered accountants holding practising certificates may also become Registered Auditors, who are able to perform statutory financial audits in accordance with the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. Chartered Accountants can also register as company secretaries.\n\n"}

It was commissioned as part of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.\n\n\"Chicken Fat\" was the theme song for President John F. Kennedy's youth fitness program, and millions of 7-inch 33 RPM discs which were pressed for free by Capitol Records were heard in elementary and junior high school gymnasiums across the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Willson contacted Fitness Council administrator Dick Snider with an offer to write a song to be used to promote exercise for children. Willson's offer was accepted and he consulted with Physical Fitness Council director Ted Forbes to ensure that the song would be effective. The bouncy chorus ended with the words \"Go, you chicken fat, go!\"\n\nThe song was originally recorded on a Warner Bros. Pictures soundstage in early 1962 at the same time as the recordings for the film soundtrack of the Warner Bros. film \"The Music Man\", starring Robert Preston. Recorded on the same three-track 35MM magnetic film as the soundtrack recordings, it features Preston's vocal isolated on one track, with the Bernie Green Orchestra isolated on the second track and a chorus of boys and girls isolated on the third track. However, the location of the original multi-track tapes is unknown. As a result, with only the full-track quarter-inch 15 IPS monophonic composite master being available from which Capitol mastered their records in 1962, no stereophonic version of the song is currently possible and it remains in monophonic sound on the CD re-issue.\n\nTwo versions of the song exist: a 2:12 minute, radio-friendly length, “Disc Jockey Version\"; and a longer, 6:30 “School Version”, for use in educational institution gymnasiums. The latter included 11 floor exercises for school children designed by Bud Wilkinson, the head coach of the University of Oklahoma football team. Willson, Preston, and Forbes all donated their services to the project , while Capitol Records, which produced and distributed three million copies of the 33 1/3 RPM record, paid for the backup musicians, studio time, and production and distribution. The original Physical Fitness Council was promoted in 1962 and 1963 through a series of public service TV commercials featuring baseball great Stan Musial, filmed at Roosevelt Elementary School in Tampa, Florida. \n\nIn 2014, \"Chicken Fat\" was used in a TV commercial by Apple Inc. to promote its new iOS 8 health application. The commercial shows people swimming, running, and checking their weight while connected to iPhone apps and accessories to a recording of \"Chicken Fat\". It was reported to be a 2000 recording by Bernie Knee, a jingle writer and part-time cantor, which was released by Kimbo Educational Music, though he died in 1994. Separately, it was reported that it was a new recording but that Apple would not name the singer.\n\n"}

It was built by the Heliopolis Society for the benefit of all the children of Egypt. This work involved contributions from Egyptian and international museums and institutions.\n\nThe museum was designed by experts from Egypt, UK and the USA and built by museum specialists from all over the world who have contributed to the museum to assist children and young adults to learn through hands on exhibits, inter-actives, computer games, and a spectacular dome show exhibit that takes the visitor through the history of science in Egypt.\n\nIn May 2012 it won the UK's Museum and Heritage International Award.\n\nThe entrance to the museum is from Sharia Abo Bakr El Seddik, opposite the tram station at Haroun El Rashid. The entrance is marked by the spectacular Space Pyramidion structure of planet spheres circling a pyramid that celebrates the cultures of Egypt ancient and modern. The visit to the museum begins with a journey down the Nile valley through time and space, it provides a living experience of how the Nile has changed and formed the landscape of modern Egypt. The journey begins at the fountain symbolic of the source of the Nile in Nubia, the rocks are carved with the dinosaurs and basilosaurus that once lived and swam where modern Egypt is today. Their descendents the Hippo and the Crocodile, greet the visitors, as the journey continues down the Nile path into the early period of the Niles settlement by man, when the river banks were still humid jungle and elephants still wandered beside the Nile. Next the path leads onto the beginning of the drying out of the Nile Valley, savannah formed on either bank, and Lion, giraffe and gazelles appear along the river bank. Continuing, the Nile path reaches the Pharaonic period, the surrounding landscape becomes desert, an oasis forms a small side garden with a desert encampment, while along the Nile, an Egyptian garden with 'T' Basins filled with Lotus and Papyrus celebrates the diverse species cultivated. The path leads on past the medieval Nile village to the modern landscape of Heliopolis where the new Museum building and the cinema is situated. Finally, on passing the Museum the path finally leads to the Delta landscape, with the Alexandria seaside resort, and a covered Roman theatre for outdoor performances. The landscape path passes through a shady garden of mature trees, and both calms and stimulates the imagination of the visitor in anticipation for entering the new learning areas of the museum. The garden has a living displays, of birds, butterflies and fishes, and an outdoor excavation area. A large cafeteria allows for the schools, family groups and visitors to refresh themselves and so stay for the whole day. Outdoor classroom spaces provide for creativity and musical activities, while the Cinema provides a 3D learning films, and conference facilities, as well as book shop and learning materials supplies for the schools.\n\nThe Interior exhibition is divided into four, each on a separate floor connected by the central spiral staircase - the Time Stair - that provides a path from the roof to the basement.\nThe four themes are;\n\nWhere am I from? - explore the archaeology and history of Egypt, explores the pyramids, visits Tutankamen's tomb, and trains the visitor in mummy examination, modern excavation and underwater exploration in Alexandria\n\nWho am I? - discover the development of Egyptian civilisation along the Nile divided into the three seasons of flood, sowing and harvest.\n\nWhy is Egypt like it is today? - examine the development of modern Egypt, in a panorama of Egyptian landscapes and their environmental issues, and how modern citizens can contribute today.\n\nWhat is the future of Egypt? - Looks at the history of science in Egypt, through both a static hands on exhibition that looks at stars, ships, astrolabes, telescopes, airplanes and space travel, and also an immersive 4D experience dome show, in which the pioneers of Egypt appear to tell the history of science and encourage visitors to participate in the future.\n\nThe museum is open every day except Friday from 9 - 2.\n"}

Specifically, the Centre has studied law and communicative processes by means of empirical research conducted by Italian and foreign scholars. In addition to the research activities in the field of law and legal communication, the Centre has developed studies on journalism and communication. Among the others, the Center has studied the “journalistic construction of electoral campaigns”, deviance, youth, and immigration. Recently, the Centre has produced a research in the field of education, \"The Normative Impact of the Legislation on Schooling and Education in Calabria\", financed by the Local Government of Calabria.\n\nThe quality of the working papers published by the Center is remarkable, peer-reviewed, and freely distributed. These studies address a vast number of topics (media, crime, legal change, family, etc.) and represent an interesting experience in the landscape of the Italian research and publishing market. By using the flexibility of the Internet, and thanks to the support of an international-based community of scholars, these working papers present a relevant scientific quality and have a cost equal to zero.\n\nApart from the research activities, CIRSDIG organizes seminars, conferences, and other similar events. In May 2001, an international conference on the new communicative and social codes was held at the University of Messina. Participants included Michel Maffesoli, Eric Landowski, Oscar Correas, and Roque Carrion-Wam, among others. Presented papers were later published in two books. Another important event organized by the Center is the conference on \"Youth, Values and Liquid Society\", held in Messina in 2004, with participants coming from various Italian universities: Mario Morcellini, Valerio Pocar, Antonio La Spina, and Domenico Carzo.\n\nCIRSDIG plays an important role in the local academic and civic communities, particularly by involving public opinion in a successful attempt to raise issues and to discuss about phenomena that had not been carefully observed by the cultural and scientific worlds. In 2006, for example, an important research project was carried out on the subject of usury and organized crime in the city of Messina – a study that raised the interest of the national press. Today, the Centre covers a larger spectrum of interests and is focused principally on \"social change\" in the Southern Italian society. To do so, new studies on New Media, multiculturalism, and social protections have been promoted.\n\nIn May 2006, CIRSDIG began a new empirical study on \"Cultural Consumption and Social Imaginaries: Gender Perspectives\", which is still in progress.\n\n"}

After the mayoral dismantling of school boards and Community District Education Councils were formed in 2004 she was elected by parents to the District 3 Community Education Council in 2004 and again in 2005. As an education advocate she has supported the Campaign for Fiscal Equity efforts and joined the fight for badly needed resources, funding, and technology and capital improvements, particularly in the most underserved and lowest performing schools in the district. Parent empowerment and involvement, qualified teachers and reforms to policies and practices that result in major inequities between schools in and/or students from certain neighborhoods and socio-economic backgrounds are among the many issues Cordell fought for. She served as Perkins’ Chief of Staff in the State Senate, where she continued to work on important issues affecting the community.\n\nAs the female Democratic District Leader in the 68th Assembly District in Harlem (2007 – 2015) Cordell organized and participated in many efforts to build and improve the community and encourage participation in the political process. Through the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club, she supported and worked successfully to get numerous Democratic candidates on the ballot and elected to federal, state, city and party positions. After the 2010 Census and the redistricting that followed in 2012 Cordell was drawn into a new district (70th Assembly District) where she ran for and successfully won the vacant seat in 2015 and was re-elected to the position in 2017. \n\nIn 2007 she served as Coordinator of “CD 15 for Obama” and led petitioning efforts to get Barack Obama on the ballot in the 15th congressional district in New York, gathering the second highest number of signatures for his Presidential race\nthan any other congressional district on the East Coast. Cordell also sat as an Obama delegate in the historic 2008 National Democratic Convention in Denver, Colorado.\n\nCordell Cleare was born in the Bahamas and raised in Harlem. Her work in the community started as being a resident addressing community issues; such as housing conditions. She is an advocate for lead poisoning which affected the building where she lived. She organized tenants and community around lead paint poisoning.\n\nCordell Cleare has worked for over 15 years for New York State Senator Bill Perkins (politician). She is a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club based in New York City, NY, and New York City District Leader for District 70.\nShe is currently running for Harlem City Council seat of Inez Dickens. She was a New York Delegate for the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She has served as chair to the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning. Her family was directly affected by lead poisoning. She says, \"as chief of staff she has been able to help the Harlem community to navigate the system\". She has been Democratic District Leader. She supported Barack Obama's run for presidency, and was a delegate.\n\nShe is on the Advisory Board for the African American Day Parade, and has worked with the African Day Parade.\n\nCleare and Bill Perkins supported justice for the Central Park jogger case.\n\nShe has worked and supported \"New York Health\" bill to establish universal healthcare system for the state of New York.\n\nIn 2008 Cleare campaigned for President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign for presidency.\n\nShe was a Bernie Sanders delegate for the Democratic Party Convention in 2016.\n\nAs of 2017, Cleare is running for Harlem Council Member to represent District #9. She was recently endorsed by New York Amsterdam News. They said \"...we clearly understand the significant role she played during her years working in the City Council and State State\". \"Now, it's her turn in the election arena\".\n\n2017 - The League of Pissed off Voters of New York endorsed Cordell for District 9 City Council, stating that \"she is exactly the kind of grass-roots figure we want to see taking up offices throughout this city\". \n\n\"I'm not tired of serving\". It has been a constant learning experience and constant fulfillment providing leadership for this community. I wake up everyday thinking about this job.\"\n\n\"We've dealt with this, we've lived with this, we've withstood loss of property, loss of irreplaceable items, photographs, record albums, artwork, loss of days from work, and just by the grace of God no one has been physically injured,\" said tenant Cordell Cleare.\n\n\n"}

The extensive publication is published under the patronage of UNESCO.\n\nIn 1996, international scientists, engineers, and policy makers were invited by the UNESCO to Washington, Tokyo, Moscow, Mexico City, Beijing and the Bahamas to generate a detailed list of EOLSS contents and achieve a global consensus and acceptance of its structure. Life support system means a natural or human constructed system that furthers the life of the biosphere in a sustainable fashion. The knowledge is structured in 21 topic areas: Earth and atmospheric sciences; Mathematical sciences; Biological, physiological and health sciences; Biotechnology; Land use, land cover and soil sciences; Tropical biology and conservation management; Social sciences and humanities; Physical sciences, engineering and technology resources; Control systems, robotics and automation; Chemical sciences engineering and technology resources; Water sciences, engineering and technology resources; Energy sciences, engineering and technology resources; Environmental and ecological sciences, engineering and technology resources; Food and agricultural sciences, engineering and technology resources; Human resources policy, development and management; Natural resources policy and management; Development and economic sciences; Institutional and infrastructural resources; Technology, information and system management resources; Area studies (Africa, Brazil, Canada and USA, China, Europe, Japan, Russia); Desalination and water resources.\n\nThe way the encyclopedia is being compiled can be defined as crowdsourcing, where thousands of intellectuals from all over the world and across various academic institutions are contributing. The encyclopedia relies on strict standards of peer review and the joint Paris-based UNESCO and EOLSS secretariat manages the encyclopedia in progress. It has got a publishing wing in Oxford as well which specializes in publishing various materials such as books, e-books or scholarly subscriptions.\n\nThe web portal of EOLSS receives maximum hits from the United States and India. If each hit is assumed to originate from one unique user, then USA has about 28% and India has about 10% of the users of this portal. The number of hits falls dramatically after we consider USA and India, whereas countries like Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom each contribute almost about 5% of the total hits. This shows that people familiar with English are feeling more comfortable in utilizing this project for their educational or knowledge seeking purposes and researches. The proportion of users from states of the European Union who do not speak English as native language is about 8 percent in total. The statistics are updated as of May 2018.\n\n1.

Eng., OSU 1895, also known as \"A Manual of Engineering Drawing for Students and Draftsman,\" was first published in 1911 by McGraw-Hill Book Company. It appeared in fourteen editions and was last published in 1993. The title and author remained the same through the first six editions. French died during the publication years of the Sixth Edition, so the Seventh Edition was revised by his colleague at Ohio State University, Charles J. Vierck. The Eighth through Tenth editions had the same title and were also authored by Charles J. Vierck. For the Eleventh and Twelfth editions, the book title changed to \"Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology\". Following the death of Vierck in 1980, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Editions were additionally authored by Robert J. Foster, Penn State University.\n\nIn North America, this textbook was widely used for education of drafters, engineers, and architects. \n\nIt was during the year 1910 that Martin M. Foss, a traveling representative of the newly organized McGraw-Hill Book Company, in calling on the Department of Engineering Drawing, recognized in the group headed by Professor Thomas E. French one of the most successful and talented groups in its field in the United States. He said to Professor French: \"We want a new mechanical drawing text. \" \"There are already fifty drawing books on the market\" protested French. \"But which is standard?\" countered Foss. \"We want a text that will be widely accepted as the standard work on the subject.\" Professor French accepted the challenge. Discarding the time-worn name \"Mechanical Drawing\" he coined a new title and wrote a text, \"A Manual of Engineering Drawing for Students and Draftsmen\", which was published in 1911. He was ably assisted by Assistant Professor Robert Meiklejohn, Instructors Owen E. Williams, Arthur C. Harper, Cree Sheets, Frederick W. Ives, William D. Turnbull and William J. Norris, which were the entire teaching staff of the department. The staff contributed immeasurably in the preparation of drawings, problem material as well as advice and suggestions in the text. This pioneering book (now in its 10th edition) made publishing history. It was a truly monumental classic, and for many years was a perennial leader in its field and held the American publishers record as the best selling of all college textbooks. This text is attributed to giving great impetus to the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, as well as helping Martin Foss, who later became President of the company.\n\nAs an author of textbooks, Professor French is perhaps unequalled by anyone else in his field in the world. The following quotation is taken from the Ohio State University Monthly, February 1935, p. 148: \"Not only is he famous as the 'father of the Stadium' idea, but his textbook, \"A Manual of Engineering Drawing\", has taken the name of Professor Thomas E. French, Mech. E., '95 into 400 colleges and universities throughout the world. It is the most widely used text on engineering extant.\" The fifth edition of this book is now used by engineering students in schools throughout the world, and has been translated into several different languages.\n\nThis book became a best seller for the McGraw Hill publishing company, and reportedly its sales kept the company from bankruptcy during the depression.\n\nStarting with the Seventh Edition in 1947, 16mm sound motion picture films were created to complement the instruction found in the textbook.

{"id": "8203216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8203216", "title": "Giovanni Dosi", "text": "Giovanni Dosi\n\nGiovanni Dosi is Professor of Economics and Director of the Institute of Economics at the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa. He is the Co-Director of the task forces “Industrial Policy” and “Intellectual Property” at the Initiative for Policy Dialogue at Columbia University. Dosi is Continental European Editor of \"Industrial and Corporate Change\". Included in \"ISI Highly Cited Researchers\".\n\nHis major research areas - where he is author and editor of several works - include economics of innovation and technological change, industrial organization and industrial dynamics, theory of the firm and corporate governance, evolutionary theory, economic growth and development.\n\nA selection of his works has been published in two volumes: \"Innovation,Organization and Economic Dynamics. Selected Essays\", Cheltenham, Edward Elgar, 2000; and \"Economic Organization,Industrial Dynamics and Development: Selected Essays\", Cheltenham, Edward Elgar, 2012.\n\nGiovanni Dosi's economic analysis is characterized by the contemporaneous attempt to \"(i)\" identify empirical regularities and \"(ii)\" provide micro-foundations consistent with such regularities. As such, his work is a mix of statistical investigations and theoretical efforts.\n\nThroughout his work Dosi and his co-authors have identified some stylized facts as being especially relevant for economic analysis, among others:\n\nS.F.1 Over the 19th-20th century technological innovation has proved to be the major contributor to the economic growth of countries, whose growth rates have however displayed an expanding variance.\n\nS.F.2 The learning processes that firms undertake to carry out innovations are characterized by trials, errors and unexpected success.\n\nS.F.3 Firms are highly heterogeneous in terms of sizes, productivities, and profitabilities. In particular, firm sizes display stationary skewed distributions, while productivities and profitabilities display stationary wide supports of their fat tailed distributions.\n\nThese facts have led Dosi to point out some theoretical implications, which raise contradictions within Neoclassical economics and bear favorable witness to Evolutionary economics.\n\nThe role of technological progress as an explanation of contemporary economic growth (S.F.1) has led Dosi to carefully analyze the nature of technology. In particular, he has suggested an interpretation of technical change resting on the concepts of technological paradigm and technology trajectory.\n\nIn analogy with Thomas Kuhn's definition of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a technological paradigm as the general \"outlook\" on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological paradigm is composed by some sort of \"model\" of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, a technological paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the \"direction\" of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.\n\nSuch interpretation of technological change brings Dosi to identify a limited influence of market signals on the \"direction\" of technological change. More precisely, in his view relative prices might affect the direction of technological change only \"within\" the boundaries defined by the nature of the technological paradigm. Such idea can be better understood by analyzing the effect of market signals in their two possible directions: moving \"downstream\" (i.e. from the technology to the sale of goods) and \"upstream\" (i.e. from the market environment to the technology).\n\nGoing \"downstream\", from the technology to the sale of goods, market signals enter the picture at opposite stages. First, market signals can act \"ex ante\" in the competition among different paradigms: if more paradigms are available, firms would select one or the other according to their expected profitability. But once a paradigm is affirmed, the direction of technological change would be already implied by its technological prescriptions. Second, market signals can act by selecting \"ex post\" those applications of the affirmed paradigm (i.e. the final products) that best fit the market requests. However, at that point their impact on the direction of technical change would be null, since such direction had already been decided by the prescriptions of the affirmed paradigm.\n\nGoing \"upstream\", from the market environment to the technology, market signals act to inform the producers of the technology about variations in relative prices. However, the extent to which technology producers can shift from more expensive to cheaper inputs, or modify technology toward the use of cheaper complement goods is bound by technical constraints. Such constraints emerge because inputs are characterized by low substitutability due to the physical and chemical limits involved in the production process. Consequently, the upstream incentives given by market signals affect only the \"rate\" of use of certain inputs as well as the rate of development of a trajectory but not the \"direction\" of technical change, which is bound by the technical constraints of production.\n\nThe trial and error procedures adopted by firms to improve along a technological trajectory (S.F.2) have taken Dosi to assess the issue of uncertainty. At a general level, trial and error procedures imply that firms might not be able to forecast completely the outcome of a choice they make; in fact, if they could foresee the error, they would presumably avoid it because it is costly. Such a fact is strongly at odds with any assumption of \"perfect rationality\" or \"farsightedness\" on the side of economic agents, which is a foundational element of the Neoclassical approach. Dosi has analyzed this issue by assessing the ways in which economic agents perceive and deal with choices that have an uncertain outcome. In analogy with Herbert A. Simon's distinction about rationality, he has proposed the distinction between substantive uncertainty and procedural uncertainty. In his view, \"the former is related to some lack of information about environmental events, while the latter concerns the competence gap in problem-solving\". Nonetheless, both of them generate \"limitations on the computational and cognitive capabilities of the agents to pursue unambiguously their objectives\". Crucially, though, the fact that such types of uncertainties limit the computational rationality of agents leads them precisely to develop routines and decision rules that are the likely explanation of their heterogeneous behaviors. Moreover, even though such routines and decision rules are not optimally determined, they might well prove more \"intelligent\" than \"optimal\" decisions especially when applied to turbulent selection landscapes.\n\nThe fact that firms appear to be consistently heterogeneous (S.F.3) has brought Dosi to criticize the Neoclassical prediction that firms in an industry converge toward some kind of \"optimal\" or \"representative\" characteristic. For such argument to be valid, the characteristics of firms would need to evolve in time toward a normal distribution, possibly showing some shrinking of the support. Notably, this theoretical implication poses an unresolved challenge to the arguments put forward by Milton Friedman in his essay \"The Methodology of Positive Economics\". In such work Friedman asserted that maximizing behavior was a reasonable working approximation to describe the choices of economic agents: in fact, even if not all economic agents actually maximize (for example because some make mistakes) only the \"fittest\" ones will be selected by the market. Therefore, those agents that actually maximize would be the only \"survivors\" to market selection, and hence they would gather very closely around the single optimal behavior. In other words, the tails of the distribution will tend to disappear as market selects the best \"genes\", which would turn out to be both \"optimal\" (in terms of fit to the market selection) and \"representative\" (since it would be the only surviving type). However, the empirical findings that constitute S.F.3 prove the exact opposite of Friedman's prediction: very different \"genes\" survive to the market. As a consequence, a realistic representation of economic behavior should rather allow for firm-specificities, which would explain the heterogeneity found in the data: a point that was clearly made by Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter in their book \"An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change\".\n"}

McBride\n\nGuy Thornton McBride (1919 - 2011) was an American chemical engineer who was a professor at Rice University, president of the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and as an executive of a major American corporation. McBride earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Texas (UT) in 1940, where he was valedictorian, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 1948.\n\nMcBride worked in both industry and academia, although he said that he preferred teaching. He first taught at Rice University from 1948 to 1954. Then he worked as an executive for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company until he was appointed president of Colorado School of Mines in 1970. He retired as president in 1984, but continued to teach chemical engineering courses. He died in 2011.\n\nMcBride was a strong believer in the necessity to develop young engineers who could think and work more effectively in society with people who had diverse cultures and backgrounds. He argued that this required more exposure to subjects and experiences than were customarily presented in traditional engineering curricula. The result of his work at CSM was later named, \"The Guy T. McBride Honors Program in Public Affairs for Engineers.\"\n\nGuy McBride was born December 12, 1919 in Austin, Texas. The censuses of 1920, 1930 and 1940 indicate his parents were Guy T. and Imogene (nee Thrasher) McBride, Sr. The family lived in Wharton, Texas through those years. Guy also had a younger brother. After graduating from high school, Guy enrolled in the University of Texas, majoring in chemical engineering. He graduated from UT with the degree of Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering and was valedictorian of his class of 1940. He enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he earned master and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering.\n\nAfter his graduation from MIT in 1948, McBride first went to work as an engineer for Standard Oil Company (now Exxon Mobil). A few years later, he became a consultant for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company.\n\nIn 1948, he joined the Rice University (then named Rice Institute) in Houston, Texas, as an associate professor of chemical engineering. By 1950 he had also become Dean of Students, while still teaching. He replaced the late Dean H. H. Cameron, who had died on June 28, 1950. In 1958, he left academia to work for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company. (TGS) as vice president and general manager of its Phosphate Division. He left TGS in 1970 to accept an appointment as the president of the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) in Golden, Colorado.\n\nMcBride made a major mark during his tenure as CSM president. He is credited with:\n\nMcBride argued several times before leading state legislators to more funding of education. The \"Denver Post\" praised his ability to \"...(ramrod) a major expansion despite inadequate state funds.\" He was also quoted as saying in 1984, \"What we're trying to produce is the ability (among students) to think critically and be able to take the problem apart and put it back together. That is deceptively hard.\" According to the \"Post\", the honors program came about because of his belief that \"...engineers should be literate in public policy and social issues as well as engineering.\" An article describing CSM's innovative approach to engineering education quoted President McBride as saying, \"We expose our students to stress deliberately to toughen them for the real world. We produce a graduate that really doesn't know there is anything he can't do.\"\n\nAfter stepping down from the presidency in 1984, McBride continued living in Golden and teaching courses at CSM. He also served on boards of directors for several corporations, such as Hercules, Halliburton and Kerr-McGee.\n\nWhen Guy McBride began his academic career, only a few engineering educators had begun to address how to broaden their students' school experiences. Constraints of budget and time left little room for flexibility in expanding the curriculum beyond courses that were intimately connected to his specialty. McBride's exposure to industry caused him to see that the engineers' jobs were changing at a more rapid pace, forcing him or her to make decisions based on factors that were not even addressed by his college curriculum. As technological progress speeded up , these factors seemed to proliferate, and the engineer's world became more complex.\n\nAfter McBride came to CSM, he seemed to be the right man in the right place at the right time to begin implementing significant changes in engineering education.

It covers students, teachers, schools, and educational policies.\n\nThe small historically French settlements that became part of the United States in 1803 have limited schooling. schools were established in several Missouri towns; by 1821, they existed in the towns of St. Louis, St. Charles, Ste. Genevieve, Florissant, Cape Girardeau, Franklin, Potosi, Jackson, and Herculaneum, and in rural areas in both Cooper and Howard counties. They were proprietary schools run by itinerant teachers who catered to boys of families who could pay small stipends, and usually provide room and board for the teacher. A few coeducational schools existed in some rural areas by the 1830s. Eleven schools for girls also operated during the territorial period, but these focused on basic literacy and homemaking practices.\n\nWhen Louis William Valentine Dubourg became the Catholic bishop of St Louis in 1818 he began numerous projects. A Catholic academy, St. Louis Academy (later Saint Louis University), was established in 1818 as the first college west of the Mississippi River.\n\nBefore the Civil War, Missouri followed the southern pattern that downplayed public schooling, as well-to-do families patronized local private academies. Ambitious but poor parents pooled their resources to hire part-time teachers for their children. During Reconstruction in the 1860s, the Radical Republicans in power strongly favored modernization through the rapid growth in public schools. Their 1865 Constitution, and numerous state laws, called for a large network of public schools, including ones for black children. The plan was to require four months terms of schooling every year for children. Under the aggressive leadership of state superintendent of schools Thomas A. Parker, the number of public schools jumped from 48,000 in 1867 to 75,000 in 1870, as enrollment grew from 169,000 to 280,000. The 1870 totals included 9100 black students. About 59 percent of the eligible white children attended school annually in 1870, along with 21 percent of the eligible black children. Parker built up organizations of teachers at the county level, as well as the state level, holding numerous clinics to provide the pedagogical education the teachers lacked. New normal schools, to train teachers, were opened at Kirksville and Warrensburg in 1870. A new state university was founded in Columbia, with land-grant federal aid. However it had to share some of that aid with the new school of mines at Rolla. The public school system across the state was heavily oriented toward providing the three Rs of elementary education. High schools were rare outside the major cities. Families that could afford to have children attend school rather than hold a paying job patronized 45 academies in 1870, most of which were attached to the 37 small private colleges. Most were run by religious denominations. St. Louis, under the leadership of William Torrey Harris as superintendent of schools 1868-1880, developed one of the nation's outstanding public school system, complete with the first public kindergartens. Once the conservatives returned to power in 1872, however, public schooling became again a low priority matter in rural Missouri.\n\nEducation for slaves was practically nonexistent in Missouri, the small free black population in St. Louis provided small-scale schooling. During the war, the 62nd Colored Infantry regiment of the U.S. Army, largely recruited in Missouri, set up educational program for its soldiers. At the end of the war it raised $6300 To set up a black school, to be headed by a white abolitionist officer, Richard Foster (1826 – 1901). Foster opened Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City in 1866. Lincoln had a black student body, both black and white teachers, and outside support from religious groups. The state government was supportive and provided $5000 a year to train teachers for the new black school system.\n\nIn the early 1950s, legal challenges led to the admission of black students to the University of Missouri, which had heretofore been a white-only institution. From 1950 to 1954, four attempts were made by black families to enroll their students in white schools in Kansas City, St. Louis County, and St. Louis City. In Kansas City, 150 black students attempted to enroll at a white school; despite their schools not offering gymnasiums or auditoriums, their attempt was rejected.\n\nAfter the United States Supreme Court declared school segregation unconstitutional in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), Missouri Attorney General announced that Missouri's school segregation laws were void. Despite this, several Missouri districts refused to comply with the ruling; schools in Charleston avoided integration until the mid-1960s, along with several other Bootheel districts. In many cases, black students were assigned to schools more than 30 miles from their homes, beyond white schools, and many libraries and parks remained off limits to black students. Many black teachers were laid off after integration. In Moberly, eleven black teachers were laid off in 1955, and more than 125 teachers lost their jobs in mid-Missouri.\n\nBy 1970 the Kansas City school district had experienced massive white and middle-class black flight that left it with a smaller tax base and a severe money shortage. The district increasingly depended on federal funding and could not afford to turn down large federal grants that required it to integrate faster. Ultimately, the desegregation that was accomplished in Kansas City was far too little and came far too late, after the district had lost most of its white students to the suburbs, says historian Peter Moran.\n\nIn the 1970s, a lawsuit challenged segregation in St Louis city and suburban schools led to a 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, in an effort to desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students. The program is shrinking every year and will end after the 2030–2031 school year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "435331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435331", "title": "Lysenkoism", "text": "Lysenkoism\n\nLysenkoism () was a political campaign conducted by Trofim Lysenko, his followers and Soviet authorities against genetics and science-based agriculture. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964.\n\nThe pseudo-scientific ideas of Lysenkoism assumed the heritability of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism). Lysenko's theory rejected Mendelian inheritance and the concept of the \"gene\"; it departed from Darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection. Proponents falsely claimed to have discovered, among many other things, that rye could transform into wheat and wheat into barley, that weeds could spontaneously transmute into food grains, and that \"natural cooperation\" was observed in nature as opposed to \"natural selection\". Lysenkoism promised extraordinary advances in breeding and in agriculture that never came about.\n\nJoseph Stalin supported the campaign. More than 3,000 mainstream biologists were fired or even sent to prison, and numerous scientists were executed as part of a campaign instigated by Lysenko to suppress his scientific opponents. The president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was sent to prison and died there, while scientific research in the field of genetics was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines was also negatively affected or banned.\n\nIn modern usage, the term lysenkoism has become distinct from normal pseudoscience. Where pseudoscience pretends to be science, lysenkoism aims at attacking the legitimacy of science itself, usually for political reasons. It is the rejection of the universality of scientific truth, and the purposeful defamation of the scientific method to the level of politics. \n\nIn 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a previously unknown agronomist, claimed to have developed an agricultural technique, termed vernalization, which tripled or quadrupled crop yield by exposing wheat seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are a normal part of the life cycle of autumn-seeded winter cereals, the vernalization technique claimed to increase yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised, although some increase in production did occur.\n\nWhen Lysenko began his fieldwork in the Soviet Union of the 1930s, the agriculture of the Soviet Union was in a massive crisis due to the forced collectivisation of farms, and the extermination of the kulaks. The resulting famine provoked the people and the government alike to search for any possible solution to the critical lack of food. Lysenko's vernalization practices yielded marginally greater food production on the farms, and he was quickly accepted as the hero of Soviet agriculture.\n\nMany agronomists were educated before the revolution, and even many of those educated afterwards did not agree with the forced collectivization policies. Furthermore, among biologists of the day, the most popular topic was not agriculture at all, but the new genetics that was emerging out of studies of \"Drosophila melanogaster\", commonly known as fruit flies. Drosophilid flies made experimental verification of genetics theories, such as Mendelian ratios and heritability, much easier.\n\nIsaak Izrailevich Prezent, a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in Soviet mass-media as a genius who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, Soviet propaganda often focused on inspirational stories of peasants who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko's widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. This was accompanied by fake experimental data supporting Lysenkoism from scientists seeking favor and the destruction of counter-evidence to Lysenko's theories. Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.\n\nLysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the Communist Party and Soviet ideology. Following the disastrous collectivization efforts of the late 1920s, Lysenko's \"new\" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an \"agricultural revolution.\" Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of Leninism. During a period which saw a series of man-made agricultural disasters, he was also extremely fast in responding to problems, although not with real solutions. Whenever the Party announced plans to plant a new crop or cultivate a new area, Lysenko had immediate practical suggestions on how to proceed.\n\nSo quickly did he develop his prescriptions—from the cold treatment of grain, to the plucking of leaves from cotton plants, to the cluster planting of trees, to unusual fertilizer mixes—that academic biologists did not have time to demonstrate that one technique was valueless or harmful before a new one was adopted. The Party-controlled newspapers applauded Lysenko's \"practical\" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's \"revolution in agriculture\" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science.\n\nLysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as \"fly-lovers and people haters\", and to decry the \"wreckers\" in biology, who he claimed were trying to purposely disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology.\n\nLysenko presented himself as a follower of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, a well-known and well-liked Soviet horticulturist. However, unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of Lamarckism, insisting on using only hybridization and grafting, as non-genetic techniques. With this came, most importantly, the implication that \"acquired\" characteristics of an organism—for example, the state of being leafless as a result of having been plucked—could be inherited by that organism's descendants. This is why Lysenko claimed vernalization would give greater productivity than it did; he believed the ability of his vernalized seeds to flower faster and produce more wheat would be passed on to the next generation of wheat seeds, thus causing vernalization to further amplify the process.\n\nSupport from Joseph Stalin gave Lysenko even more momentum and popularity. In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism. Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out \"Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo.\" This event emboldened Lysenko and gave him and his ally Prezent free rein to slander the geneticists who still spoke out against him. Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, were imprisoned or even executed because of Lysenko's and Prezent's denunciations.\n\nOn August 7, 1948, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as \"the only correct theory\". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko. Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as \"bourgeois\" or \"fascist\", and analogous \"non-bourgeois\" theories also flourished in other fields in the Soviet academy at this time (see Japhetic theory; socialist realism). Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet nuclear physicists: as Tony Judt has observed, \"It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess \"their\" calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid.\"\n\nMany other countries of the Eastern Bloc accepted Lysenkoism as the official \"new biology\" as well; however the acceptance of Lysenkoism was not uniform in communist countries. In Poland, all geneticists except for Wacław Gajewski followed Lysenkoism. Even though Gajewski was not allowed contact with students, he was allowed to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was then rapidly rejected starting from 1956 and modern genetics research departments were formed, including the first department of genetics headed by Wacław Gajewski, which was started at the Warsaw University in 1958.\n\nCzechoslovakia adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. Jaroslav Kříženecký (1896–1964) was one of the prominent Czechoslovak geneticists opposing Lysenkoism, and when he criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, he was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for \"serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people\", and imprisoned in 1958. In 1963, he was appointed head of the newly established Gregor Mendel department in the Moravian Museum in Brno, the city in which Gregor Mendel pursued his early experiments on inheritance and formulated the laws of Mendelian inheritance.\n\nIn the German Democratic Republic, although Lysenkoism was taught at some of the universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists (for example, the geneticist and fierce critic of Lysenkoism, Hans Stubbe) and an open border to West Berlin research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks until the dismissal of Nikita Khrushchev in 1964.\n\nLysenkoism dominated Chinese science from 1949 until 1956, particularly during the Great Leap Forward, when, during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics. In the proceedings from the symposium, Tan Jiazhen is quoted as saying \"Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too\". For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including Isaak Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or sent to labor camps. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943. Hermann Joseph Muller (and his teachings about genetics) was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoting fascism so he left the USSR, to return to the US via Republican Spain. In 1948, genetics was officially declared \"a bourgeois pseudoscience\"; all geneticists were fired from their jobs (some were also arrested), and all genetic research was discontinued.\n\nOver 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism at one time and overall, scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Due to Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR actually declined as well.\n\nAt the end of 1952, the situation started changing, possibly due to Stalin taking offense to Lysenko's growing influence. Articles criticizing Lysenkoism were published in newspapers. However, the process of return to regular genetics slowed down in Nikita Khrushchev's times, due to Lysenko showing him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It once again became forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and all geneticists were released or rehabilitated posthumously. The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.\n\nAlmost alone among Western scientists, John Desmond Bernal, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London, and a Fellow of the Royal Society, made an aggressive public defense of Lysenko and some years later gave an obituary of \"Stalin as a Scientist\". However, despite Bernal's endorsement, other members of Britain's scientific community retreated from open support of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe word \"Neo-Lysenkoism\" has occasionally been used by hereditarian researchers, such as Roger Pearson and Bernard Davis, as a pejorative term in the debates over race and intelligence and sociobiology to describe scientists supposedly minimizing the role of genes in shaping human behavior, such as Leon Kamin, Richard Lewontin, Stephen Jay Gould and Barry Mehler.\n\nThe use of the term \"neo-Lysenkoism\" to describe criticism of evolutionary psychology have drawn criticism for misapplying the term \"Lysenkoism\" to things unrelated to actual Lysenkoism. For instance, Lysenko's views on inheritance of acquired characteristics presumed that individuals were born with characteristics acquired by their parents, not tabula rasa. This was integrated into Stalin's purges by presuming that simply having biological parents who were capitalists constituted a risk factor for becoming a dissident due to inheritance of acquired capitalist interest even if the children had not been postnatally raised capitalist. This is argued to show that the definition of \"nature\" as \"anything before birth\" that is used by evolutionary psychologists when they classify ideas of hormones before birth on sexuality and empathy as \"biological\" would also classify Lysenkoism as \"biological\" due to all three being prenatalist but not Mendelian genetic, remarking that accusations of social engineering in \"nurture\" models can simply transform into accusations of prenatal environment engineering in \"womb environment\" models. The usage of the term \"neo-Lysenkoism\" for models of evolution that contradict the Darwinian model of gradual and maximized reproductive success is criticized for missing the point that while it is uncertain whether or not Darwin read about Mendel's genetic discoveries, it is clear that Darwin did not integrate Mendelian genetics into his model of evolution and that Mendel read The Origin of Species and accepted evolution but did not consider his discoveries a solution to any problems with Darwinian evolution, that Mendelian genetics was the primary subject of suppression of modern biology under Lysenkoism, and that Mendelian genetics is actually a source of modern criticism of the maximization of reproductive success model of evolution as Mendelian models show that short term maximized reproductive success of specific genes deplete genetic variation and increase the long term risk of extinction (explaining higher extinction risks in more sexually dimorphic species as a functional similarity between Bateman's principle and asexual reproduction) during environmental change which could not be predicted by premodern models of genetics such as those of Darwin and Lysenko alike. Contrary to the allegation of anti-psychiatry being neo-Lysenkoist, it is remarked that psychiatric medication was not suppressed in the Soviet Union under Lysenkoism, but the use of psychiatric drugs in the Soviet Union actually increased and was approved by the regime during the Lysenko era. It is cited that Communists considered chemical imbalance models of \"mental illnesses\" including but not limited to anti-communism in \"working class\" people in Communist countries more materialistic and in accordance with Marxist dialectical materialism than the idea of other cultural factors than class interest influencíng behavior that was considered idealist, and that this was used as an argument by officials in the Soviet Union for approving increased psychiatric medication.\n\n\n\n"}

It was one of a number of such acronym-based conservative American organizations and shared a political agenda with groups such as SOS (\"Sanity on Sex\"), POSSE (\"Parents Opposed to Sex and Sensitivity Education\"), PAUSE (\"Parents Against Unconstitutional Sex Education\"), ACRE (\"Associated Citizens for Responsible Education\"), POPE (\"Parents for Orthodoxy in Parochial Education\"), and CHIDE (\"Committee to Halt Indoctrination and Demoralization in Education\") among many others.\n\nMOMS was largely an organized reaction by conservative residents of the county to the Anaheim Union High School District's family life and sex education course. The school district had implemented a sex education course in 1965 with little resistance. Three years later, in 1968, a homemaker named Eleanor Howe, whose son was enrolled at one of the district's schools, got wind of the curriculum and began organizing a network of like-minded mothers to confront the school board. The members of this group flocked to a meeting of the school board and quoted material from a pamphlet, \"Is the Schoolhouse the Proper Place to Teach Raw Sex?\", which had recently been published by Billy James Hargis's Christian Crusade and demanded that the course be halted immediately. They also stated their firm belief, based on the film Pavlov's Children produced by members of the political Radical Right who saw the US as locked in conflict between Christian-based traditional values and Communist subversive \"new\" values, that the course was the result of a Soviet communist conspiracy orchestrated through the United Nations to make American youth amenable to totalitarian dictatorship. Within a year they had replaced the elected members of the board with their political allies, and the sex education program at A.U.H.S.D. was dispensed with.\n"}

A group of both professional and amateur astronomers as well as teachers and educators was formed to define and run the first ever event. NAW was proposed in 1979 and a steering committee was set up in 1980. Since then a total of seven events have run as listed below.\n\nThe seventh event, named \"Target Jupiter\", ran from 1–8 March 2014. Jupiter was at a very high position in the sky, the best that will be achieved for many years. Observing conditions were generally well above average. More than 200 events were run across the UK. Participating organisations included Astronomy Societies, Schools, Universities, and Scouts/Guides. The details are listed on the National Astronomy Week website.

It originated in 1904 as a campaign for equal pay for equal work, and dissolved in 1961, when this was achieved.\n\nWomen teachers in the National Union of Teachers (NUT) first formed a Ladies' Committee in 1896. In 1900, this became a standing committee, consisting of the women members of the executive of the union, and some male executive members in an \"ex officio\" role. However, the committee focused on recruitment drives and, for example, in 1906 refused to sign a petition for women's suffrage. The union's journal, \"Board Teacher\", was opposed to equal pay for women teachers, but the Ladies' Committee was unwilling to campaign on the issue. This inspired a small number of members to form the Equal Pay League in April 1904.\n\nThe main founders of the league were L. E. Lane, a London-based teacher who had previously campaigned to equalise payments from the union's benevolent and orphanage funds, and Joseph Tate, based in Birmingham, who became its first honorary secretary. Other founder members included Teresa Billington, who soon became the group's main organiser, and her Manchester branch became the most important section of the organisation. But growth was initially slow, with only 34 members by November, and an effort to pass an equal pay policy at the NUT conference that year was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1906 the organisation was renamed the National Federation of Women Teachers, and it adopted a new policy of opposing increases in membership dues for women, on the grounds that they received lower benefits than male members. It successfully sponsored Isabel Cleghorn's campaign to become vice-president of the NUT in 1909. Failing to persuade the NUT to support women's suffrage, many federation members were founders of the Women Teachers' Franchise Union in 1912. Ethel Froud became honorary secretary of the federation in 1913, the position being renamed \"general secretary\" in 1917; she remained in post until 1940.\n\nBy 1916, the federation's membership had grown significantly, and its members had become increasingly frustrated with continuing male control of the NUT. It decided to prepare to break away from the NUT after the conclusion of World War I. Although the NUT finally adopted a policy of equal pay in 1919, it did not prioritise this during subsequent pay negotiations, and this was the final straw. In 1920, the federation broke away to form an independent trade union, the \"National Union of Women Teachers\" (NUWT). From this date, members of the central council of the NUWT were not permitted to hold membership of the NUT. Rank-and-file members were initially permitted to also join the NUT, as the union feared that otherwise its members in rural areas would be isolated. However, the union discouraged joint membership, and prohibited it in 1932.\n\nThe NUWT was a feminist organisation, maintaining close links with other groups and individuals in the Feminist movement. Its main aim was to obtain equal pay for women but also interested itself in the wide range of issues affecting women teachers including the marriage bar, maternity rights and family allowances. It was also concerned with education in its widest sense and took an interest in many issues such as class sizes, corporal punishment, the school leaving age, teacher training, and wider social and political debates such as capital punishment, the minimum wage and health policy. \n\nMembership of the union peaked at 8,500 in the mid-1920s, and thereafter gradually declined. In 1961, when equal pay had been achieved, the union wound up. Members either joined the NUT or the Association of Assistant Mistresses, while the anti-feminist National Association of Schoolmasters arranged for the formation of a new Union of Women Teachers.\n\nPresidents of the union included Emily Phipps, Agnes Dawson, Nancy Stewart Parnell and Nan McMillan.\n\nThe archive of the National Union of Women Teachers is held in the UCL Institute of Education Archives, and a partial list can be found on the online catalogue.\n\n\n"}

Many of the attendees got raucously drunk. Coughlin was one of the first female attendees who reported being indecently assaulted by male attendees.

She had reported the incident to senior officers, but after a lack of progress due to \"closing ranks and obfuscation,\" she went public in June 1992. The President, George H.W. Bush, met with Coughlin and expressed sympathy with her and promised a full investigation. Coughlin met with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney—who told her he had just fired the Secretary of the Navy, implying it was her fault. She resigned from the Navy in February 1994, after being subject to abuse in retaliation for her allegations.

It became a registered charity on 11 November 2011, and is listed on the Localgiving.com website.\n\nThe SMHC won the Scarborough Mayor’s Big Thank You award for Artistic and Cultural Development three times in a row between 2010 and 2012, and the Max Payne Award for Outstanding Achievement. The SMHC website was voted 'Best Maritime Family History' website by the BBC TV's Who Do You Think You Are magazine readers in 2011. In 2016, Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre received the Queen's Award for voluntary service. The highest honour, which a voluntary organisation can achieve.\n\nThe centre is run by a group of Directors, Committee Members and Trustees along with 24 volunteers who staff the Centre during its opening hours. Entrance is free.\n\nMonday and Tuesday : Closed\n\nWednesday to Sunday: 11:00 until 16:00 (4 p.m.)\n\n\nThe Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre works in close partnership with the local community and is actively engaged in promoting the town's historical and cultural life, participating in major annual events such as Coastival, Armed Forces Day and SeaFest.\n\nThey organise exhibitions and events to share information with people who are interested in the history of Scarborough, North Yorkshire. They display a variety of documents and memorabilia, as well as oral history recordings from previous generations.\n\nExhibitions change every 3 months and have included topics such as: Shipbuilding, Superstitions, Smuggling, World War One and the 1914 bombardment, Tuna & Herring fishing, The RNLI lifeboat, Royal Naval Patrol Service, Maritime Artists and even the town's connections to the \"Titanic\". Members of the public who are interested in sharing their stories or knowledge are able to donate or lend memorabilia to the Centre for other people to see.\n"}

While they often showed relative sizes, these models were usually not built to scale. The enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a scale model of the Solar System a challenging task. As one example of the difficulty, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the Earth.\n\nIf the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye, large outdoor spaces are generally necessary, as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance. The objects in such models do not move. Traditional orreries often did move and some used clockworks to make the relative speeds of objects accurate. These can be thought of as being correctly scaled in time instead of distance.\n\nMany towns and institutions have built outdoor scale models of the Solar System. Here is a table comparing these models.\n\nSeveral sets of geocaching caches have been laid out as solar system models.\n\nMost classroom globes are 41 cm (16 inches) in diameter. If the Earth were reduced to this size, the Moon would be a 10 cm (4 in) baseball floating 12 metres (40 feet) away. The Sun would be a beach ball 14 stories tall (somewhat smaller than the Spaceship Earth ride at Epcot) floating away. While a complete model to this scale has never been built, a Solar System built centered in Washington DC, London, or Sydney, to that scale (approximately 1:31 000 000) would look like this:\n\nIf the scale of the above model is increased to 1:310 000 000, i.e. all distances and sizes reduced by a factor of 10, then the Earth and Venus can be modeled by ping pong balls, the Moon and smaller planets by various size marbles or lumps of modeling clay, the gas giants by balloons or larger playing balls, and a circle the diameter of the Sun can be drawn on the floor of most classrooms. The scale distance to Alpha Centauri would be 1/3 of the way to the Moon.\n\nSome planetaria and related museums often use this type of scale model of the Solar System, with a planetarium dome representing the Sun. Examples of this can be seen in planetaria like the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, the Clark Planetarium, the Griffith Observatory, the Louisiana Arts and Sciences Museum, the Adventure Science Center, etc.\n\n\n"}

School-based teams of four students investigate several undergraduate-level research problems in preparation for the tournament. The competition itself consists of \"physics fights,\" student-led debates over the quality of each team's solution. Teams are judged on their own solutions to the problems and on their ability to engage in evaluation and discussion of other teams' solutions. Phillips Exeter Academy won their first championship in 2018. The Harker School of San Jose, California has earned three championships, the most of any school. The 2018 tournament at Randolph College in Virginia involved 15 schools; the 2019 tournament will be at Rye Country Day School in New York.\n\nThe United States sent teams to the International Young Physicists' Tournament several times in the 2000s, and achieved a second-place finish in 2005. The nonprofit United States Association for Young Physicists Tournaments was incorporated in 2005, initially for the purpose of supporting and training the US team as well as to spread the pedagogical methodology of preparing and conducting the \"physics fight.\" In 2007, the USAYPT organized their own Young Physicists Tournament, inviting school-based teams from around the world to debate over a slate of four research problems. The one-day event at the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) included five teams, all from the United States; Woodberry Forest School won the inaugural championship.\n\nThe 2008 tournament, also at NCSSM, included the first \"international\" team: Brisbane Girls Grammar School. They faced Woodberry Forest School, a boys' boarding school in central Virginia. In the final physics fight, Brisbane's Sarah Thang and Samantha Luck outdueled Woodberry's Chris McLamb and Robert Bauer for the title.\n\nFor 2009 and 2010, the event was moved to Woodberry Forest School. Raffles Institution of Singapore beat out an eight-team field for the 2009 title. However, the \"snowmaggedon\" blizzard of February forced cancellation of the 2010 tournament. Instead, two informal mini-tournaments were held in April, one at Woodberry Forest School, one at the Harker School in California.\n\nThe USIYPT moved to Oak Ridge Associated Universities for 2011 and 2012, and expanded to a two-day, six-round event. Teams and jurors toured Oak Ridge National Laboratory in between sets of physics fights, viewing the High Flux Isotope Reactor and the Spallation Neutron Source. Official sponsorship in 2011 came from the University of Tennessee department of physics, among others. The Harker School won in 2011; Rye Country Day School of New York won in 2012. Oak Ridge High School won the first-ever Clifford Swartz Trophy for top performance in the tournament's poster session.\n\nThe 2014 tournament was held at the Harker School in San Jose, California. The Harker School won the title with playoff victories over Woodberry Forest School and Shenzhen Middle School on the \"Magnet Stack\" and \"Ball Stack\" problems. Guilderland High School of New York won the Clifford Swartz Trophy for best poster.\n\nIn 2015, the USIYPT moved back to Woodberry Forest School. The final rounds were switched to a pool-play format. The Harker School and Woodberry Forest met twice in those final rounds, with Harker edging Woodberry 79-77 for the 2016 title. Other finalists included Rye Country Day, who were 1/10 of a point off Woodberry's pace; and first-time USIYPT participant Renmin University High School of Beijing, China.\n\nSecond-year participant Phoenixville Area High School of Pennsylvania topped the standings after the preliminary rounds in the 2016 USIYPT. They, Harker, Rye Country Day School, and Shenzhen Middle School competed in the final rounds, with Shenzhen coasting to the championship.\n\nAt the 2017 tournament at the University of the Sciences, the Harker School was the highest ranked of the six teams who entered the playoff rounds. Rye Country Day School emerged from those rounds with a convincing victory of 77-72 against RDFZ of Beijing, due in part to an especially innovative approach to measuring Planck's constant conducted by Charlie Curnin and Kasey Luo in their high school laboratory. The four presenting members for Rye Country Day School were Charlie Curnin, Jeffrey Chen, Cate Mollerus (captain), and Varun Wadhwa. \n\nThe USIYPT consists of six preliminary rounds and a set of final rounds. In each round, called a \"Physics Fight,\" a student from the reporting team presents a 10-minute summary of their research into one of the four official tournament problems. Next, a student from another team engages the reporter in a 12-minute conversation about the reporting team's project. This opponent is charged with helping the audience understand the strengths and weaknesses of the report by means of a series of discussion questions. Only after this conversation is complete are jury members allowed to question the presenting students directly. Teams are judged as much on their ability to ask and answer questions in the physics fight as on the quality of their initial presentations.\nUnusual among science competitions, the USIYPT aims to improve physics teaching skills as well as student understanding of the subject. High school teachers are participating members of each school's research team. The sponsoring organization chooses problems for each tournament that are \"nontrivial, but not impossible,\" whose solutions are not necessarily unknown to practicing professional physicists, but are generally new to high school teachers and students. Research is expected to be conducted primarily in each team's school, with direction and assistance from a teacher at that school.\n\nThe Harker School, California – 9 tournaments, 3 championships\n\nRye Country Day School, New York – 11 tournaments, 2 championships\n\nShenzhen Middle School, China – 7 tournaments, 2 championships\n\nWoodberry Forest School, Virginia – 11 tournaments, 1 championship\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy, New Hampshire – 3 tournaments, 1 championship\n\nBrisbane Girls Grammar School, Australia – 2 tournaments, 1 championship\n\nRaffles Institution, Singapore – 1 tournament, 1 championship\n\nPioneer School of Ariana, Tunisia – 6 tournaments\n\nNanjing Foreign Language School, China – 5 tournaments\n\nPrinceton International School of Science and Mathematics, New Jersey – 4 tournaments\n\nHigh School affiliated with Renmin University, China – 4 tournaments\n\nCary Academy, North Carolina – 3 tournaments\n\nPhoenixville Area High School, Pennsylvania – 3 tournaments\n\nWildwood School, California – 3 tournaments\n\nOak Ridge High School, Tennessee – 2 tournaments\n\nNorth Carolina School of Science and Mathematics– 2 tournaments\n\nOregon Episcopal School – 2 tournaments \n\nVistamar School, California – 2 tournaments\n\nGuilderland High School, New York – 2 tournaments\n\nQingdao No. 2 High School, China – 2 tournaments\n\nVanke Meisha Academy, China – 2 tournaments \n\nHigh School of Jur Hronec, Slovak Republic – 1 tournament\n\nCalverton School, Maryland – 1 tournament\n\nMadeira School, Virginia – 1 tournament\n\nPioneer School of Manzeh 8, Tunisia – 1 tournament\n\nGeorgian English-Spanish School, Tbilisi – 1 tournament\n\n"}
