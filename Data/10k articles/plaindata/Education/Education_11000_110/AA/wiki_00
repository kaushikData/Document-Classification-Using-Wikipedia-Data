Bellesiles about American gun culture, an expansion of a 1996 article he published in the \"Journal of American History\". Bellesiles, then a professor at Emory University, used fabricated research to argue that during the early period of US history, guns were uncommon during peacetime and that a culture of gun ownership did not arise until the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nAlthough the book was initially awarded the prestigious Bancroft Prize, it later became the first work for which the prize was rescinded following a decision of Columbia University's Board of Trustees that Bellesiles had \"violated basic norms of scholarship and the high standards expected of Bancroft Prize winners.\"\n\nThe thesis of \"Arming America\" is that gun culture in the United States did not have roots in the colonial and early national period but arose during the 1850s and 1860s. The book argues that guns were uncommon during peacetime in the United States during the colonial, early national, and antebellum periods, that guns were seldom used then and that the average American's proficiency in use of firearms was poor. Bellesiles maintains that more widespread use and ownership of guns dated to the Civil War, a period of widespread advance in firearm manufacturing and a consequent reduction in price and improvement in accuracy.\n\nThe book garnered many enthusiastic professional reviews and won the prestigious Bancroft Prize in 2001. The book's thesis bore upon ongoing political controversies about gun control and the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and gun rights advocates criticized it. Actor Charlton Heston, then-president of the National Rifle Association, described the book's argument as \"ludicrous.\"\n\nConversely, Roger Lane's review in the \"Journal of American History\" said that the book's research was “meticulous and thorough.” He wrote that Bellesiles had \"attacked the central myth behind the National Rifle Association's interpretation of the Second Amendment.\" Lane declared Bellesiles’ evidence so formidable that \"if the subject were open to rational argument,\" the debate would be over.\n\nClayton Cramer, a historian, software engineer, gun enthusiast and early critic of Bellesiles, later argued that the reason \"why historians swallowed \"Arming America\"'s preposterous claims so readily is that it fit into their political worldview so well... \"Arming America\" said things, and created a system of thought so comfortable for the vast majority of historians, that they didn’t even pause to consider the possibility that something wasn’t right.\" Historian Peter Charles Hoffer, an advocate of gun control, lent support to Cramer's charge when, in a 2004 examination of the Bellesiles case, he noted that influential members of the historical profession had \"taken strong public stands on violence in our society and its relation to gun control.\" For instance, the academics solicited for blurbs by Bellesiles’ publisher Alfred A. Knopf \"were ecstatic in part because the book knocked the gun lobby.\"\n\nBellesiles energized this professional consensus by attempting to play \"the professors against the NRA in a high-wire act of arrogant bravado.\" For instance, he replied to Heston’s criticism by telling the actor to earn a Ph.D. before criticizing the work of scholars. He pointed out that Cramer was \"a long time advocate of unrestricted gun ownership\" while he was a scholar who had \"certain obligations of accuracy that transcend current political benefit.\" After Bellesiles claimed he had been flooded by hate mail, both the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians endorsed a resolution condemning the alleged harassment. As Hoffer later wrote, Bellesiles was convinced that whether the entire profession agreed with “his stance on gun ownership (and I suspect most did), surely academic historians would not let their expertise be impugned by a rank and partisan amateur like Cramer.” \n\nIn the end, the politics of the issue mattered less to historians \"than the possibility that Bellesiles might have engaged in faulty, fraudulent, and unethical research.\" As critics subjected the historical claims of the book to close scrutiny, they demonstrated that much of Bellesiles' research, particularly his handling of probate records, was inaccurate and possibly fraudulent. This criticism included noting several serious errors in the tables published in the book, as well as in the \"Journal of American History\" article, namely, that they did not provide a total number of cases and gave percentages that \"were clearly wrong.\"\n\nIn two scholarly articles, law professor James Lindgren of Northwestern University noted that in \"Arming America,\" Bellesiles had\n\nCritics also identified problems with Bellesiles's methods of citation. Cramer noted that Bellesiles had misrepresented a passage by George Washington about the quality of three poorly prepared militia units as if his criticism applied to the militia in general. (Washington had noted that the three units were exceptions to the rule.) Cramer wrote, \"It took me twelve hours of hunting before I found a citation that was completely correct. In the intervening two years, I have spent thousands of hours chasing down Bellesiles’s citations, and I have found many hundreds of shockingly gross falsifications.\"\n\nAs criticism increased and charges of scholarly misconduct were made, Emory University conducted an internal inquiry into Bellesiles's integrity, appointing an independent investigative committee composed of three leading academic historians from outside Emory. Bellesiles failed to provide investigators with his research notes, claiming the notes were destroyed in a flood.\n\nIn the initial hardcover edition of the book, Bellesiles did not give the total number of probate records which he had investigated, but the following year, after the \"flood,\" Bellesiles included in the paperback edition the claim that he had investigated 11,170 probate records. \"By his own account,\" writes Hoffer, \"the flood had destroyed all but a few loose papers of his data. It was a mystery how supposedly lost original data could reappear to enable him to add the number of cases to the 2001 paperback edition, then disappear once again when the committee of inquiry sought the data from him\" (Hoffer, 153). One critic tried, unsuccessfully, to destroy penciled notes on yellow pads by submerging them in his bathtub, in order to prove that water damage would not have destroyed Bellesiles' notes.\n\nThe scholarly investigation confirmed that Bellesiles' work had serious flaws, calling into question both its quality and veracity. The external report on Bellesiles concluded that \"every aspect of his work in the probate records is deeply flawed\" and called his statements in self-defense \"prolix, confusing, evasive, and occasionally contradictory.\" It concluded that \"his scholarly integrity is seriously in question.\"\n\nBellesiles disputed these findings, claiming to have followed all scholarly standards and to have corrected all errors of fact known to him. Nevertheless, with his \"reputation in tatters,\" Bellesiles issued a statement on October 25, 2002, announcing the resignation of his professorship at Emory by year's end. In 2012 Bellesiles was working as a bartender while continuing to write history.\n\nIn 2002, the trustees of Columbia University rescinded \"Arming America\"'s Bancroft Prize, the first such action in the history of the prize. Alfred A. Knopf, publisher of \"Arming America\", did not renew Bellesiles' contract, and the National Endowment for the Humanities withdrew its name from a fellowship that the Newberry Library had granted Bellesiles. In 2003, \"Arming America\" was republished in a revised and amended edition by Soft Skull Press. Bellesiles continued to defend the book's credibility and thesis, arguing that roughly three-quarters of the original book remained unchallenged.\n\nHistorians who initially admired \"Arming America\" ceased to defend Bellesiles. The nationally prominent historian Garry Wills, who had enthusiastically reviewed \"Arming America\" for the \"New York Times\", later said, in a 2005 interview on C-SPAN, \"I was took. The book is a fraud.\" Wills noted that Bellesiles \"claimed to have consulted archives he didn't and he misrepresented those archives,\" although \"he didn't have to do that,\" since \"he had a lot of good, solid evidence.\" Wills added, \"People get taken by very good con men.\"\n\nHistorian Roger Lane, who had reviewed the book positively in the \"Journal of American History\", offered a similar opinion: \"It is entirely clear to me that he's made up a lot of these records. He's betrayed us. He's betrayed the cause. It's 100 percent clear that the guy is a liar and a disgrace to my profession. He's breached that trust.\" Historian Pauline Maier reflected that it seemed historians had \"ceased to read carefully and critically, even in the awarding of book prizes.\"\n\nAs Hoffer concluded, \"Bellesiles's condemnation by Emory University, the trustees of the Bancroft Prizes, and Knopf provided the gun lobby with information to blast the entire history profession...Even though H-Law, the Omohundro Institute, the OAH, and the AHA rushed to his side and stated principled objections to the politicization of history, they hesitated to ask the equally important question of whether he had manipulated them and betrayed their trust.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Bagrut is a prerequisite for higher education in Israel. A Bagrut certificate is awarded to students who pass the required written (and in some cases oral) subject-matter examinations with a passing mark (55% or higher) in each exam. The Bagrut certificate however should not be confused with a high school diploma (\"te'udat g'mar tichon\", ), which is a certificate awarded by the Ministry of Education attesting that a student has completed 12 years of study.\n\n65.5% of Israeli high school 2014 graduates or other individuals studying for the 2014 exam (usually post-compulsory military service persons completing Bagrut requirements later in life in order to apply for higher education) had passed the requirements to be eligible to receive a Bagrut certificate. Of the overall population who was of high school graduation age in 2014, 52.7% were eligible to receive a Bagrut certificate.\n\nBagrut examinations assess knowledge on subjects studied in high school. They are frequently compared to the New York State Regents Examinations, the College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) tests, the British A-levels, and the German Abitur. Bagrut scores are one of the criteria examined in applications to elite military units and Israeli academic institutions. Other criteria include students' high school grades and the Psychometric Entrance Test.\n\nThe process of matriculation in Israel is supervised by the country's Ministry of Education. The exams of all compulsory subjects and most elective subjects are designed and written by the Ministry, thereby creating a standard measure of the students' knowledge throughout the country. In academically oriented high schools, the last two years of studies are geared to preparing students for the bagrut exams.\n\nMost exams are available in different levels of difficulty, expressed in \"units of study\". In most subjects, students may choose the number of units in which they are tested. In order to receive a \"full\" matriculation certificate, the student must take and pass at least one subject matter exam at the 5-unit level of difficulty and earn a total of at least 21 combined study units in all bagrut exams taken. Correspondingly, the make up of a student's classes during his or her high school years is matched to the student's expected units of study they will test in their bagrut exams. So for example, a student who is planning to take the 5-unit mathematics exam will take mathematics courses specifically designed for a 5-unit level of difficulty all throughout their high school career.\n\nA copy of the 2010 mathematics exam (in the four and five units levels) was leaked to students, but a teacher reported it to authorities and all tests were replaced.\n\nIn 2011, the percentage of 17-year-olds who passed the matriculation exams rose to 48.3 percent and the number of students sitting for the exams in both the Jewish and the Arab school systems increased.\n\n"}

The citation dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2–3 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on preferential attachment. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual.\n\nThe dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to technological progress, the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the citation dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the reference list of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references.\n\nIt has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted power-law. The probability that paper formula_1 is cited at time formula_2 after publication as:\n\nwhere formula_4 serves as the outcome variable for each particular paper formula_1 at time formula_2. Fitness, formula_7, captures the inherent differences between papers, accounting for the perceived novelty and importance of a discovery. formula_8 represents the cumulative number of citations acquired by a paper formula_1 at time formula_2 and formula_11 is a log-normal survival probability. The probability is equal\n\nwhere formula_2 is time; formula_14 is longevity, capturing the decay rate; and formula_15 indicates immediacy, governing the time for a paper to reach its citation peak.\nThe ultimate impact formula_16 represents the total number or citations that the paper receives during its lifetime.\n\nWhere formula_15 is a global parameter that has the same value for all publications. formula_19 represents the relative fitness of the paper.

In 1981 he was a co-founder of Chisenhale Dance Space and for much of that decade worked on diverse projects alongside musicians from the London Musicians Collective, choreographers and live artists. His music and sound collaborations include Slant (a trio with Philip Jeck and Sianed Jones). His radio program \"Music of Madagascar\" produced for BBC Radio 3 won a Sony Gold Specialist Award (now Radio Academy Awards) in 1995. Between 1994-2005 he and Sianed Jones were based in the most easterly English town of Lowestoft. He taught on the Performance Writing course from 1995 at Dartington College of Arts where he became a Research Fellow in interdisciplinary text (2000-2002). A large body of interdisciplinary performance writing was produced in collaboration with Kirsten Lavers under the author function Things Not Worth Keeping between 1999-2007. In 2005 he became a professor at Miami University in Ohio. He was Altman Fellow in The Humanities Center Miami University 2011-12, co-presenting the Networks and Power symposium and a conference on Network Archaeology from which an issue of the online journal Amodern, co-edited with Nicole Starosielski and Braxton Soderman, was published.

Through a process of auditions, the awarding school will identify the most talented students and allocate awards appropriately. The offer of an award is not based on the student's ability to finance their own training, but on their talent and potential ability in the fields of professional dance, drama, musical theatre or stage management. The award pays a substantial contribution towards the cost of attending the relevant course and in many cases, also includes a means tested maintenance grant, which can be used towards the student's contribution to the course fees, or the cost of accommodation and other expenses associated with attending full-time training.\n\nThe courses for which the awards are given are specially devised by Trinity College, London and, upon completion, provide a professional level qualification at either Level 5 or Level 6 on the National Qualifications Framework. Completion of one of these courses gives formal accreditation of the skills, knowledge and understanding that are acquired in training for employment as a professional actor, dancer, performing artist or in production roles supporting performance.\n\nThis series of qualifications are not intended to demonstrate academic achievement, but are vocational qualifications designed to prepare the student for a professional career in the performing arts industry, with the learning outcome being to achieve a high level of ability in the relevant skill rather than a high level of knowledge.

Developed and published in 1997 by J.P. Das, PhD of the University of Alberta and Jack Naglieri, PhD, then at Ohio State University, the CAS has its theoretical bases both in the neuropsychology of Luria as well as in cognitive psychology.\n\nCAS is based on the planning, attention-arousal, simultaneous and successive (PASS) cognitive processing theory (or the PASS Theory of Intelligence), a modern theory within the information-processing framework (Das, Naglieri & Kirby, 1994). Roots of CAS are in Luria’s (1973) organization of cognitive functions in the brain as well as in cognitive psychology of Baddeley, Estes, Posner and other contemporary psychologists. Their work has guided the selection and interpretation of CAS tests.\n\nThe Kaufman assessment battery for children or KABC by (Alan S. Kaufman, 1983\n) is perhaps the first battery of commercially available tests to provide a psychometric assessment of cognitive processes. K-ABC has used several references to the early research of Das and his colleagues (Das, Kirby & Jarman,1979) on simultaneous and successive processing, a precursor to PASS theory. KABC did not assess the Arousal-Attention, and Planning functions, as CAS did, until K-ABC II appeared in 2004. The latter provides two theoretical bases, one of them in Luria (1966) and by default, the 4 PASS processes) and the other in Cattell-Horn-Carroll model (CHC) which is essentially an elaboration of fluid and crystallized intelligence (McGrew 2005). Some may consider this a strength of KABC-II. However, two important features of CAS have set it apart from ability measures within fluid and crystallized abilities of CHC, and verbal-performance IQ:\n\n\nThe CAS standard battery consists of three subtests for each PASS Scale (12 subtests in all) whereas the basic battery has 2 subtests for each scale (8 in total). It takes an hour to administer the standard battery and 40 minutes for the basic battery (Naglieri & Das, 1997).\n\nThe CAS battery provides a standard score for each process as well as a Full Scale standard score. The average internal reliability coefficients across ages 15–17 for the PASS scales are:\n\n\nEach of these scales are described in detail below. For further explanation, see Naglieri, 1999 (B), Naglieri & Das (2005). Additional details on the origin of each of the 12 tests in CAS have been discussed at some length in Das, Naglieri &Kirby (1994) and more recently in a review by McCrea (2009).\n\nPlanning helps us select or develop strategies needed to complete tasks for which a solution is needed, and is critical to all activities where an individual has to determine how to solve a problem The Planning scale includes matching numbers, planned codes, and planned connections.\n\nIn the matching numbers subtest, children are presented with four pages containing eight rows of numbers. The child is instructed to underline the two numbers that are the same.\n\nThe planned codes subtest contains two pages, each with a distinct set of codes arranged in seven rows and eight columns. At the top of each page is a legend that indicates how letters relate to simple codes (e.g., A = OX; B = XX; C = OO). In the planned connections (a variation of Trails test) subtest the child is instructed to connect numbers in sequence that appear in a quasi-random order (e.g., 1–2–3, etc.). For these two tests, the child connects numbers and letters in sequential order, alternating between numbers and letters (e.g., 1-A-2-B, etc.).\n\nAll Planning subtests include strategy assessment. This is conducted after the administration of each subtest and recorded in two categories:\n\n\nAttention is a mental process that involves focusing on selected aspects of external events, internal events, or stimuli. Attention is controlled by intentions and goals. The Attention scale includes the expressive attention, number detection, and receptive attention subtests.\n\nExpressive attention (a variation of the Stroop test) has two forms, one for children 7 years and younger, and the other 8 & over.\n\nThe receptive attention subtest contains two separate tasks; in the first task, targets are letters that are physically the same (e.g., BB but not Bb). For the second task, targets are letters that have the same name (e.g., Bb but not Ab). This subtest is an adaptation of Posner & Boise (1971).\n\nSimultaneous processing is essential for organization of information into groups or a coherent whole. It requires both nonverbal and verbal processing for the analyses and synthesis of logical and grammatical components of language and comprehension of word relationships. The Simultaneous scale has nonverbal matrices, verbal spatial relations, and figure memory.\n\nNonverbal matrices items present a variety of shapes; it is similar to Progressive Matrices.\n\nVerbal spatial relations subtest measures the comprehension of logical and grammatical descriptions of spatial relationships. In this subtest, the child is presented with six drawings, arranged in a specific spatial manner, and a printed question (e.g., show me the triangle to the left of the circle). The child is instructed to choose one of the six drawings that best answers the question.\n\nIn Figure memory, a combination of Figure-Copying and Memory for Designs, the child is presented a two- or three-dimensional geometric figure for 5 seconds and then presented immediately with a response page, on which the original geometric figure is embedded in a larger, more complex geometric pattern. The child is asked to identify the original design.\n\nSuccessive processing is involved whenever information must be remembered or completed in a specific order or sequence. The Successive scale has word series, sentence repetition, and sentence questions.\n\nIn word series, the examiner reads the child a series of words and then asks to repeat the words in the same order.\n\nSentence repetition requires the child to read 20 sentences aloud one by one. After each sentence is read, the child is asked to repeat the sentence exactly as presented.\n\nThe sentence questions subtest uses the same type of sentences that are used in the sentence repetition subtest. However, now the child is read a sentence and asked a question about it. For example, the examiner reads “The blue yellows the green” and asks the child “Who yellows the green?” In a modified form, it has been used as a test of working memory.\n\nSpeech Rate (Ages 5 to 7) is an 8-item timed subtest that requires the child to repeat a string of 3 common words, such as dog-girl-book, over and over again as fast as possible until asked to stop. The score is the time it takes the child to complete 10 repetitions before stopping.\n\nCAS is used for understanding cognitive development of typical and atypical children, as well as cognitive impairment in adults. It has been used for research, diagnosis, and clinical evaluation by several professionals including educational and school psychologists because it provides good guidelines for educational interventions.\n\nResearch on the relationship between the CAS and achievement has shown that the PASS processes strongly predict academic achievement in spite of the fact that it does not include vocabulary (Naglieri and Rojahn, 2004). Similarly, CAS tests have been used for understanding, assessment of and intervention with educational problems associated with reading disabilities (Das, 2009\n) such as autism, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (Naglieri, 2005). CAS tests have also been used for clinical evaluation of mental retardation and cognitive changes in ageing (Das, 2003).\n\nDeserving of special mention is the use of CAS tests for fair assessment of minorities (Naglieri, 2005) and First Nation children whose chronic weakness in reading has been identified as a successive processing deficit compounded by poor home literacy (Das, Janzen & Georgiou, 2007) both of which can be improved through PASS-related intervention (Hayward, Das & Janzen, 2007).\n\nAdditionally, CAS with supplementary tests has been found useful for research related to executive decision making in management (Das, Kar, & Parrila,1996).\n\nCAS withstands adaptation and translation into other languages. CAS in Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Castillian), Norwegian and Swedish are commercially available. In addition, CAS has been used in Chinese, Greek, Norwegian and Dutch research.\n\nThe CAS meets at least two challenges, first in terms of its factor-analytic purity (Naglieri & Das,1997 Interpretive handbook), and second in extending its scope by supplementary tests, especially for assessment of Executive Functions.\n\nThe validity of CAS comprising the 4 PASS constructs is adequately supported by several books and studies (Das, Naglieri, & Kirby, 1994; Das, Kar & Parilla, 1996; Das, 2009). The CAS Interpretive Handbook, (Naglieri and Das, 1997) reported information about the factor structure of the CAS providing evidence that the PASS four-factor solution was the best solution based on the convergence of factor-analytic results, clinical utility of the four separate scores, evidence of strategy use and theoretical interpretation of the subtests.\n\nKeith and Kranzler (1999) challenged this position and argued that there was insufficient support. Naglieri (1999 B) and Puhan, Das & Naglieri (2005) responded with reasonable evidence and rational arguments in defense of the structure of the test and the validity of the 4-factor CAS. However, the issue has not yet been resolved as yet.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of using factor-analysis in support of theories of intelligence has not been supported by major contemporary theories of intelligence such as those advanced by Gardner, Robert Sternberg, Das (2004) or even by Jensen (2006) in his chronometric approach to general intelligence, Clocking the Mind. An insistence on factor analytic confirmation may even be a hindrance to the desirable goal of closing the gap between psychology and the business of intelligence test development. The challenge for CAS is to extend itself into new areas of cognitive importance such as Executive Functions, and evaluation of neuropsychological impairments in an aging population. Curiously enough, few if any of the existing assessment instruments for these areas have emphasized the necessity of factor analysis.\n\nInsofar as constructive criticism goes, supplementary tests are necessary for extending the application of CAS. To begin with existing tests, the Successive subtests should have a nonverbal measure, such as Luria’s test that asks participants to continue a series “+++__ __+++__ __+++__ __...”, or a motor response of tapping to dot sequences such as “… .. … .. … … .. ” as given in Das, Kirby & Jarman (1979).\n\nSimilarly, Attention subtests should include both a continuous performance test, and a more cognitively loaded vigilance test (Das, Naglieri & Kirby,1994). In regard to Executive Functions, one would notice that elements of it are already included in CAS : Expressive attention (Stroop) = inhibition of response; Planned Connection (Trails) = shifting. But the existing Planning scale must be supplemented by tests of complex planning (Das, Kar & Parrila,1996), and so-called ‘hot’ tests that involve affective decision making, such as the predicament test (Channon, 2004).\n\nIn conclusion, the CAS will increase its reach as a system for assessment of intelligence in keeping up with advances in psychological and neurological foundations of cognitive functions. Thus it may follow Cronbach’s (1975) advice for closing the gap between psychology and intelligence testing.\n\n\n\n"}

Among many \"firsts\" achieved by McElroy, he became the first African American to earn a master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri.\n\nGeorge McElroy was born 25 May 1922 in Houston, Texas to Hugh and Philomena McElroy. His father, Hugh George McElroy was a highly decorated war veteran who fought in the Battle of San Juan Hill against Pancho Villa and who fought alongside General John J. Pershing and President Theodore Roosevelt, and later was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery in service during World War I.\n\nGeorge McElroy was raised in the Third Ward area of Houston.\n\nAfter graduation from St Nicholas High School, he served in the United States Navy, usually stationed in Asia from 1940 to 1948, then as an information specialist at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston.\n\nAfter he was honorably discharged from the military, McElroy returned to his still-segregated home state of Texas. Due to segregation (separate, but equal) laws of the time, he was forced to attend Texas Southern University (then-called Texas State University for Negroes (TSUN)) after being denied admission to the University of Texas (UT). He had applied to the University of Texas following the landmark decision of Sweatt v. Painter. In his letter of denial from UT, he was told that UT and TSUN both offered the courses he was seeking. Being a Negro, according to segregation laws, he had to attend TSUN. He responded to the denial letter from UT stating that although the courses were offered at both universities, there was little else \"equal\" about the universities. \nMcElroy sued for the right to attend UT, but ultimately earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from TSUN in 1956.\n\nMcElroy received a scholarship from the Wall Street Journal to attend the University of Missouri. In 1970, he became the first African American to earn a master's degree in journalism from the university.\n\nIn 1937, McElroy landed a job as a youth column writer at the \"Informer\", the oldest African-American newspaper in Texas. He was paid $3 per column. Throughout his off-and-on 58-year tenure with the newspaper, he functioned in virtually every capacity of running the periodical. He retired in 1996, but served as \"Editor Emeritus\" until his death in 2006.\n\nAfter graduation from the University of Missouri, McElroy considered several job offers and accepted a position as a \"colored sports\" writer for the now-defunct Houston Post daily newspaper in 1954 \nand in 1956, he became a weekly columnist. \nHe was the first black reporter and the first black columnist at the paper which, at that time, was the largest morning newspaper in Texas. \nIn spite of his position as a regular columnist, his likeness in the paper above his column was a black and white sketch of his image as opposed to photos as presented for his white counterparts at the paper.\n\nIn response to question to him c. 1970 from a reader of his column, McElroy responded:\n\nThe world, the nation, the state, the city are all multicolored, as in a rainbow and multiracial. A professional journalist simply cannot afford to reside in a racial-isolation ward. He must travel and he must converse and he must observe and he must be curious.\nIn 1960, during an annual meeting of the Houston Press Club, the club presented a skit portraying the year's presidential candidates. (McElroy was the first African American member of the club). Local television reporter Dave Ward portrayed democratic candidate Lyndon Johnson. Performing in whiteface, McElroy portrayed the role of Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a vigilant segregationist, after no one else wanted to portray the independent candidate.\nThis portrayal made McElroy the first black cast member of the club's annual \"Gridiron Show\". Picketers lined the streets and the cast members received death threats leading to Houston mayor Louie Welch provided police protection for McElroy for 72 hours.\n\nAlso in 1960, thirteen students from Texas Southern, led by Eldrewey Stearns, held a sit-in at the counter at a Houston area Weingarten store in protest of segregation using a model laid out by experienced sit-in students at Fisk University. In planning how to attract press coverage for the sit-in, they contacted McElroy for input who committed to send a photographer from \"The Informer\" and advised on calling the police themselves. This tip proved to be instrumental in the protest. Over 100 people eventually participated in the protest which ended peacefully. The Houston television and printed press coverage dubbed the event as the \"first sit-in west of the Mississippi.\"\n\nMcElroy also served as the Texas correspondent for Jet Magazine and was elected as President of the Press Club of Houston. Throughout his career as a journalist, McElroy interviewed numerous persons of interest including Martin Luther King, Jr., Fidel Castro, Muhammad Ali, George Foreman and six American presidents.\n\nIn a 2000 interview, McElroy stressed the continued need for black press stressing that African Americans are closer to the issues concerning their own community and he credits black press for being first in bringing the effects of crack cocaine into the limelight long before it was deemed an issue in mainstream media. \n\nWe cover issues that the major dailies don't see or fail to see. We're closer to problems and concerns in our community. We see them first.\n\nSimultaneously with his journalism career, McElroy taught journalism in the Houston area for over four decades.\n\n\nGeorge McElroy was a pioneer for African Americans in the field of journalism. Throughout his life he became the first African American:\n\nMcElroy was also the first minority of any race to have a regular column in a Houston newspaper\n\nThroughout his life, McElroy received over 100 awards and honors including:\n\nSeveral journalism-related scholarships have been named in honor of George McElroy's contributions to journalism, including:\n\n\nFrom 1940-1943, McElroy served in the Navy during World War II and served in the United States Merchant Marines from 1944 through 1945. From 1951-1952 during the Korean War, he served as an Information Officer\nat Ellington Air Force Base where he met his second wife, Lucinda Martin McElroy, who was serving as a Corporal in the US Air Force.\n\nIn 1973, McElroy was commissioned by Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe to serve as an admiral in the state's navy. He declined the commission opting to continue his journalism career.\n\nMcElroy was first married to the late Maxine Prudhomme. They had one child, Madeline.\nHis second marriage was to Air Force veteran Lucinda Martin in 1950 with whom he had four more daughters, Toni, Linda, Kathleen and Sherridan. George and Lucinda were married nearly 45 years until her death in 1995.\n\nIn 2006, McElroy was hospitalized with respiratory illness. In September 2006, McElroy received word that he would be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Houston Association of Black Journalists at their 20th Annual Scholarship Gala. Although receiving medical treatment at the time, McElroy received permission from his attending physicians, and attended the event. McElroy received his award and gave his acceptance speech. Shortly after the event, McElroy fell gravely ill with acute pneumonia and died on October 6. His funeral services were held at St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church and his remains were interred at Houston National Cemetery in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n"}

This piece, based on his experience as a teacher and as an often-arrested activist in the civil rights movement, served as the title essay of his first book. Subsequent books were \"The University of Tomorrowland\" and \"A Field Guide to the Aesthetic Experience\". Since then he has published essays that include \"The Third Circle: On Education and Distance Learning,\" \"What Is Literature? What Is Art?

She is currently the Paul Ehrlich Professor of Immunology at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where she is researching anti-cancer and influenza vaccinations.\n\nArnon's father, Alexander Rosenberg was interested in science from a young age. After serving in the Jewish Legion during World War I, Rosenberg attended Technische Hochschule in Vienna. He realized his own interest in electricity in 1929 and moved with his wife and two children to Toulouse to complete studies in electrical engineering as well as earn a master's in mathematics. Rosenberg then returned to Palestine and worked for the Electrical Corporation until the mid 1960s. Ruth Arnon attributes her own love for science to her relationship with her father.\n\nRuth Rosenberg was born in Tel Aviv, June 1, 1933. Because her older siblings had already taught Ruth basic reading and arithmetic, she started school in the second grade. When she finished elementary school, her mother realized her potential and convinced Barukh Ben-Yehuda (1894-1990) to allow her to attend high school at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium. Along with many in the youth movement, Ruth wished to join the military. Being too young, she studied chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and joined the IDF special academic study program allowing her to study and spend summers doing military training. Arnon earned her master's degree in 1955, and served for two years as an officer in the IDF. During her time in the military, she married Uriel Arnon, an engineer at the Technion in Haifa. Ruth and Uriel Arnon had two children: Michal (b. 1957) and Yoram (b. 1961)\n\nRuth Arnon joined the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1960. She has focused most of her life on the field of immunology. While at Weizmann, Arnon served as the Head of the Department of Chemical Immunology, as the Dean of the Faculty of Biology and as Vice President of the Institute. In addition, Professor Arnon served as the Director of the Institute's MacArthur Center for Molecular Biology of Tropical Diseases from 1958-94. Much of Arnon's work has been in the development of vaccinations and cancer research. One of her largest contributions to science was working alongside Professor Michael Sela to develop a drug for multiple sclerosis called Copaxone.\n\nRuth Arnon served as the Chairperson of the Sciences division of the Israel Academy of Sciences from 1995 to 2001. She later was elected as President of the Israel Academy. She is also a member of the EMBO, the European Molecular Biology Organization. Arnon served as Secretary-General of the International Union of Immunological Sciences, the President of the European Federation of Immunological Societies, and is also a member of the European Union Research Advisory Board.\n\nProf. Arnon has been involved in the publishing of more than four hundred articles and books in biochemistry and immunology, and has been the recipient of many prestigious awards throughout her career, most of which are listed in the Awards and Honors section below.\n\nProf. Arnon and Prof. Sela developed a new drug application for the treatment of multiple sclerosis called Copolymer 1. Its chemical name is glatiramer acetate. It was submitted by the TEVA Pharmaceutical Company to the FDA for approval, under the name of Copaxone, on June 14, 1995. Since multiple sclerosis is an immunological disease, Cop 1 is an immunospecific drug, which is no surprise, as Arnon has focused the majority of her work in the field of immunology. It specifically aids neuroprotection and generation as well as prevents the demyelination of axons, a hallmark of diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In fact, studies by Arnon et al. have shown an increase in myelination as a result of Cop 1. In a 2004 article, Arnon and Aharoni state that glatiramer acetate is \"highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species.\"\n\nProf. Arnon is currently performing research on a universal, recombinant influenza vaccination, as well as cancer vaccine research. In a 2009 paper, Arnon speaks of research using virus-like particles (VLP) to induce an immune response. These particles cannot replicate, but possess the specific antigen presenting proteins that immune cells use to identify viruses. Therefore, a vaccine could introduce VLPs to an individuals immune system and bring about the production of memory cells. Arnon and Ben-Yedidia hypothesize that these vaccines would be effective against H5N1, a pandemic virus more commonly known as bird flu. They have tested the various synthetic vaccinations on mice and observed a significant immune response. In addition, they have put human lymphocytes in mice and also observed an immune response. Their research formed the basis of the company BiondVax, who have taken the universal flu vaccine into human clinical trials.\n\nIn 2017 Prof. Arnon was appointed co-chair of the UK-Israel Science Council, alongside Prof. Lord Robert Winston. She has been a founding member of the council since 2010.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52321558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52321558", "title": "Student Movement in the Philippines (1965–1972)", "text": "Student Movement in the Philippines (1965–1972)\n\nIt was in the late 1960s and early 1970s that the Philippines saw a surge in student activism. This could be chalked up to the onset of the Marcos administration and its declaration of Martial Law, which bore witness to tens of thousands of human rights violations, among many others. There are, however, several factors and events in Philippine history that contributed to the increase in student activism during this period. In fact, economic decline, increase in unemployment rates, the growth of intra-elite conflicts, and internal dissension and disruption all factored into the context of student activism in the Philippines. It was around this time that businesses in Manila tried to find opportunities to withdraw when the city started to be deemed unsafe. Five Communist oriented guerrillas in the countryside had also regained some of the momentum similar to the Huks had before they were contained by Magsaysay in the 1950s. The coming of a revolution was considered a possibility waiting to happen at one point as riots and demonstrations erupted, causing colleges to be closed down. All of these culminated in an effort to storm the Malacañang.\n\nThe mobilization of students during this period trained a huge number of activists who later joined the underground opposition, the New People’s Army, after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. This imposition caused democratic institutions that permitted these mobilizations to be closed down, forcing activists to turn to radicals. It was, however, introducing social reform as the focus of the ideology that drove the mobilization of Filipino students during the first phase. These moderates were organized and represented through the National Union of the Students of the Philippines (NUSP), a dominant force in the student movements during the late 1960s. In 1970, moderates initially led the student movements but due to the dynamics of the political conflicts, radicals soon gained the upper hand in these movements. The expansion of higher education and the atmosphere present in the country at that time gave way for Filipino students to become increasingly critical and collectively engaged.\n\nIt is worth noting that students were at the forefront of several movements and even became the most active and participative group in the scene of politics. In the years 1970 and 1971 alone, student activists participated in 214 demonstrations and 39 class boycotts, and as reported in The Manila Times, issued 72 statements. They joined forces and established coalitions with reformists and radical factions of working classes and even participated in 76 demonstrations alongside farmers and workers.\n\nThe CPP/PKP was one party that played an important role in mobilizing student movements in the country. While the CPP/PKP leadership initially dismissed them as \"unneeded,\" there were small underground cells in some schools that played support roles to the more important and bigger Party cells in the factories and among the peasantry.\n\nThe political value of students was recognized more by the Americans who realized that students were adept as publicity (propaganda) and pressure groups for government reforms and against the PKP-led Huk rebellion of the '50s. The Party only began recognizing their importance in the '60s when self-taught Marxists spearheaded an anti-clerical and nationalist campaign at the University of the Philippines. Radicals who were brought into the Party's fold formed Kabataang Makabayan (KM) in 1964.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, this youth faction was expelled from the party. Led by Jose Maria Sison, they “re-established” the CPP/PKP, calling it the Communist Party of the Philippines—Marxist–Leninist (CPP-ML), setting themselves apart from the original, lesser-known party solely known today as the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 (PKP-1930).\n\nWhat became the CPP-ML’s most immediate concern was cadre recruitment and training; being a party composed of practically urban intellectuals and students who lacked revolutionary experience but made up for it with their idealism, among others.\n\nThe nationwide student demonstration that took place on January 26, 1970 proved how militant student organizations had achieved a high level of organization and commitment from its followers. The violent demonstrations that would extend to March of that same year would become known as the First Quarter Storm.\n\nOn January 30, 1970, some 10,000 chanting students and laborers marched across Mendiola Bridge in an attempt to storm the Malacañang. Upon their arrival at the gates of the palace, they commandeered a fire truck and rammed it through the main gate. Despite their efforts to penetrate the palace, the Metropolitan Command (METROCOM) of the Philippine Constabulary repulsed them towards Mendiola Bridge.\n\nPrimitivo Mijares, in \"The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos\", recounts that what followed was the so-called \"Battle of Mendiola\" that pitted young boys and girls, armed with bamboo sticks and stones, facing Armalite-wielding 'shock troops' of Marcos from the Presidential Guard Battalion. \"It was a massacre,\" he adds.\n\nThe Diliman Commune was a nine-day uprising at the University of the Philippines-Diliman from February 1 to February 9, 1971. It started out as a peaceful rally in which students voiced their support for the ongoing strike against the oil price hike and escalated into an uprising in which students, supported by the school administration, protested against military incursions into the University.\n\nOn August 21, 1971, four grenades were hurled at the stage of the Liberal Party's grand miting de avance at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila, killing nine and wounding 95 others. A great number of the Party's leaders and senatorial candidates were seriously injured.\n\nThis caused a great wave of public outrage and sparked disgust towards a system that seemed to tolerate senseless acts of violence. This prompted Marcos to suspend the writ of habeas corpus a month later. It was restored on January 1972, with talks of an imminent revolution already rife.\n\nThe military used the suspension of the write of habeas corpus to their advantage to arrest well-known activists such as Luzvimindo David of KM and Gary Olivar of the Movement for a Democratic Philippines (MDP) and swoop down on headquarters of several mass movements.\n\nThe people responded by vigorously opposing the threat of a fascist rule. Led by Jose W. Diokno, an enormous alliance of civil libertarians, progressive Constitutional Convention delegates, students, professionals, workers came together to form the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties (MCCCL).\n\nTheir three basic demands were as follows: a) lifting the writ of habeas corpus; b) release of political prisoners; and c) resistance of plan by Marcos government to declare martial law.\n\nThe alliance proved to be successful as they managed to forge unity among diverse groups such as those from the 'Nat-Dem' and 'Soc-Dem' groups as well as various civic organizations on the bases of these demands. In rally after rally attended by as many as 50,000 people, the MCCCL warned of the imminence of martial law even as \"the writ of habeas corpus\" was eventually restored. It held the biggest demonstration on September 21, 1972...”\n\nOn September 27, 1972, Marcos declared Martial Law.\n\nGregg Jones, an American author, writes, \"Martial law left the once-formidable legal protest movement in disarray, its leaders in hiding or in prison, its activists driven into the underground or cowering in fear.\" This is not to say that political protest vanished entirely, however; as he elaborates, \"In the late 1970s, against the backdrop of a weakening economy, communist efforts to rebuild an urban protest movement were beginning to bear fruit.\"\n\nAs far back as the 1950s, the University of the Philippines has been the breeding ground of many intellectuals and radical activists. It comes as no surprise, then, that in the 1960s and 1970s, the university played an active role in conducting demonstrations, marches, and rallies to raise awareness of sectoral struggles and to campaign against the Marcos dictatorship and land reform policy, among others. Some of the clear examples of the school's activism include the ratifying of the Diliman Declaration on March 1969.\n\nStudent activists from the university stirred up the masses of youth and the working class to conduct protest actions, from the March 1961 demonstration of 5,000 UP student demonstrators that scuttled the anti-communist witch hunt of the Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities (CAFA) to the 1970 First Quarter Storm that rocked the National Capital Region with almost weekly marches and rallies of 50,000 to 100,000 people campaigning against the administration.\n\nIn 1971, students who formed the \"Diliman Commune,\" supported by faculty members and non-academic personnel, occupied the Diliman campus and barricaded roads to protest deteriorating conditions in the country during the administration.\n\nSalvador P. Lopez, then president, urged his students, faculty, and employees to maintain the autonomy of the university as the military sought control of the campus in order to identify suspected leftists, activists, and critiques.\n\nSeveral activists from the Ateneo de Manila University (AdMU), most notably Edgardo Gil \"Edjop\" Jopson, founder of the single biggest student union at the time, National Union of Students in the Philippines (NUSP) and Ferdidand \"Ferdie\" Arceo, founder of Ligang Demokratiko ng Ateneo (LDA), played vital roles in campaigning to overthrow the dictatorship. Among the other well-known activists from the university are Lazaro \"Lazzie\" Silva, Jr. and William \"Bill\" Begg, active members of Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan sa Loyola (SDK-L) and Kabataang Makabayan-Ateneo (KM), respectively, and Artemio \"Jun\" Celestial, Jr., a member of the Student Catholic Action and the secretary-general of the student government.\n\nFerdie, together with like-minded students in AdMU, established LDA in 1970, the first radical activist organization in Ateneo. Members conducted discussion groups, recruited students, advised student leaders, and created a space for dialogue among members of the student body. Eventually, LDA split into two separate organizations, SDK-L and KM.\n\nDuring the NUSP's 13th annual conference in 1969, Edjop was elected as president. When delegates returned to Manila, they led a huge rally in front of congress; all while President Marcos was delivering his State of the Nation Address (SONA).\n\nUnder Edjop's two-term tenure, the National Union became participative in socio-political issues amidst the First Quarter Storm that brought forth the Second Propaganda Movement.\n\nAt the De La Salle University, then De La Salle College, student activists clashed with the school administration over matters involving the Brother Becker Case, NROTC, tuition fees, and student rights and academic freedom. The activists questioned the elitist orientation of the institution and campaigned for a more nationalistic education.\n\nThe prevalence of the affluent was one of the issues that was brought up in the 1960s; it was a question of whether the \"wide-cross section of the public\" could be \"represented.\" Questioning why a Philippine institution had an administrator who was American, textbooks that were written by foreigners, and instruction that was done in English, student activists urged the administration to adopt a \"more nationalistic\" stance. Included in this was their call for the \"Filipinization of education\" by ousting non-Filipino presidents of schools, colleges, and universities, and appointing qualified Filipinos to head the institutions in their place.\n\nOn Friday afternoon of December 6, 1968, more than 600 students held a four-hour demonstration to show their support for Brother Edward Becker FSC who was dismissed by the College. They circulated leaflets which divulged the imputations hurled against Becker.\n\nThis case provided the students the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding academic freedom as well as student rights. Arthur Aguilar, Student Council chairman, eventually managed to steer the dialogue away from the Becker case, in a meeting with Brother H. Gabriel Connon FSC and Dr. Waldo Perfecto, academic vice-president, on December 8, 1968 during the feast of the Immaculate Conception. He declared that the \"issue was only incidental and the Becker case was merely a catalyst, the 'final straw' so to speak which ignited student protest over school policies.\"\n\nOn July 17, 1971, some 600 cadets refused to attend an NROTC drill, with their refusal stemming from their dissatisfaction with the present NROTC system as well as their protest against the hazing of Shore Patrol trainees by probationary officers. The Student Council backed this boycott in a resolution.\n"}

It is based on research into long-term memory, and is a practical application of the spaced repetition learning method that has been proposed for efficient instruction by a number of psychologists as early as in the 1930s. \n\nAccording to the developers of SuperMemo and some other proponents of spaced repetition learning, the process can optimize long-term knowledge acquisition.\n\nThe method is available as a computer program for Windows, Windows CE, Windows Mobile, (Pocket PC), iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, (iTunes), Palm OS (PalmPilot), etc. It can also be used in a web browser or even without a computer.\n\nThe desktop version of SuperMemo (since v. 2002) supports incremental reading.\n\nThe SuperMemo program stores a database of questions and answers constructed by the user. When reviewing information saved in the database, the program uses the SuperMemo algorithm to decide what questions to show the user. The user then answers the question and rates their recall - did they answer the question easily, with hesitation, not at all, and so on - and their rating is used to calculate how soon they should be shown the question again. While the exact algorithm varies with the version of SuperMemo, in general, items that are harder to remember show up more frequently.\n\nBesides simple text questions and answers, the latest version of SuperMemo supports images, video, and HTML questions and answers.\n\nThe specific algorithms SuperMemo uses have been published, and re-implemented in other programs.\n\nDifferent algorithms have been used; SM–0 refers to the original (non-computer-based) algorithm, while SM-2 refers to the original computer-based algorithm released in the 1987 (used in SuperMemo versions 1.0 through 3.0, referred to as SM-2 because SuperMemo version 2 was the most popular of these). Subsequent versions of the software have further optimized the algorithm.\n\nAs of June 2016, the latest version of the SuperMemo algorithm is SM-17, released in 2016.\n\nThe SM-2 algorithm uses the performance on a card to schedule only that card, while SM-3 and newer algorithms use card performance to schedule that card and similar cards. The additional optimizations sometimes yield perverse results – answering \"hard\" on a card may yield an interval longer than answering \"easy\" on a card – and are criticized as reducing the robustness of the algorithm, making it more sensitive to variations – non-uniform difficulty of cards (a problem in versions 4 to 6, according to Woźniak), inconsistencies in studying, and so forth.\n\nWoźniak disagreed with the criticism, but noted that in practice the other factors affecting study make it not very important.\n\nSome of the algorithms have been reimplemented in other, often free programs such as Anki, Mnemosyne, and Emacs Org-mode's Org-drill. See full list of flashcard software.\n\nThe SM-2 algorithm has proven most popular in other applications, and is used (in modified form) in Anki and Mnemosyne, among others. Org-drill implements SM-5 by default, and optionally other algorithms such as SM-2.\n\n"}

Located in the centre of Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Tallinn University is one of the three largest institutions of higher education in the country. In the 2019 edition of QS World University rankings, it has been ranked among the top 1000 universities in the world.\n\nTallinn University's predecessor, Tallinn Teachers' Seminar, was founded in 1919. Tallinn University in its present form was established on 18 March 2005 as the result of a merger of several universities and research institutions in Tallinn: Academic Library of Estonia (1946), Baltic Film and Media School (1992/97), Estonian Institute of Humanities (1988), Institute of History (1946) and Tallinn Pedagogical University (1919/52/92). In 2015, Tallinn University underwent a structural reform, whereby its 20+ structural units (the legacy of the numerous mergers leading to its establishment) were reorganized into six schools in order to optimize funding and eliminate overlap between units in research and teaching.\n\nAs of 2016, about 8,000 degree students were enrolled at Tallinn University (with over 13,000 more taking part in continuing education programmes). This makes Tallinn University the third largest provider of higher education in Estonia. Among degree students, 8.7% were international. There are 837 full-time employees at the University, of which 409 are academic staff. 11.1% of the faculty are international.\n\nEducation and research at Tallinn University focus on five core interdisciplinary fields: educational innovation, digital and media culture, cultural competences, healthy and sustainable lifestyle and society and open governance. Each of the fields is represented by a school of the University: School of Educational Sciences, Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School; School of Humanities, School of Natural Sciences and Health, and School of Governance, Law and Society. The School of Digital Technologies is the sixth school, contributing to all of the fields.\n\nTallinn University's Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School is the only institution in Northern Europe teaching film, television and audiovisual production in English, and one of the largest film schools in the region. Its student body represents over 40 countries worldwide.\n\nTallinn University actively participates in international research projects. It is one of only three universities in the Baltics whose research intensity has been classified as \"very high\" by Quacquarelli Symonds.\n\nTallinn University was ranked among the top 1000 universities in the world (in the 800-1000 bracket) in the 2019 edition of QS World University Rankings. In 2018, Tallinn University placed 69th in the EECA (Emerging Europe and Central Asia) rankings published by Quacquarelli Symonds, up from 87th in the 2016 edition. In QS World University Rankings by Subject, Tallinn University placed in the 201-250 bracket in Sociology, making it the best university in the Baltic States in the discipline.\n\nTallinn University's main campus buildings have Latin names.\n\nTerra (Latin: earth) is the main and oldest building on Tallinn University's campus. It was built for the Tallinn English College in 1938. The building is under heritage protection (architects Alar Kotli and Erika Nõva).\n\nNova (Latin: new) houses the Baltic Film and Media School. Features include individual and group work rooms, lecture halls, a film studio, a television studio, sound studios, a cinema, a computer class and editing rooms. The building was completed in 2012, and was designed by architects Karli Luik, Maarja Kask and Ralf Lõoke.\n\nMare (Latin: sea) was designed to optimise the amount of light penetrating into the building. The building was completed in 2006; the architects were Mattias Agabus, Eero Endjärv, Raul Järg, Priit Pent and Illimar Truverk.\n\nAstra (Latin: star) is the newest building in the university. This building is features laboratories. The building was designed by Ignar Fjuk and completed in 2012.\n\nSilva (Latin: forest) was completed in 1982 and is a typical example of Soviet architecture. Designed by the architect Ester Liiberg.\n\nUrsa (Latin: bear) was built in 1964 and presently houses the Arts Department.\n\nInternationalisation is positioned as one of Tallinn University's goals, affecting its development strategies and priorities. The university offers a range of English-language academic programmes at all levels of study, as well as short courses aimed at international students. As of 2016, Tallinn University ranked third in the Baltic states by the percentage of international students, behind Tallinn University of Technology and slightly ahead of the University of Tartu. With international faculty comprising 11.1% of the total faculty, it was also ranked among the top 15 institutions in the Emerging Europe and Central Asia by the percentage of international faculty.\n\nTallinn University currently maintains over 40 inter-university agreements with universities in Europe, U.S., Japan, China, Russia, and several other countries as well over 400 Erasmus exchange agreements with universities from all over the European Union. The university also organises Summer and Winter Schools, which host about 300 participants from 50 countries every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43148573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43148573", "title": "Teach-back method", "text": "Teach-back method\n\nThe teach-back method, also called the \"show-me\" method, is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to \"teach-back\" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve health literacy.\n\nThere can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is. This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment. Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills. Case studies led by the National Quality Forum on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency.\n\nThe National Quality Forum describes the practice as follows:\nWho should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals\nWhat should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc.\nWhen to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process\nWhy is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information.\nHow→When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them.\n\nDepending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding.\n\nThe cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients.\n\nBeyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create feedback loops in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching where students explain what they just learned to other students. Retention is also most positively impacted in participatory learning environments, when students participate in group discussions, practice by doing, and teaching others.\n"}

The term was first coined in 2010 by filmmaker and internet pioneer Tiffany Shlain and husband UC Berkeley robotics professor Ken Goldberg. Shlain introduced the concept in a series of articles and films such as the Harvard Business Review after participating in The National Day of Unplugging, which began in 2008 by Reboot, a nonprofit think tank of Jewish professionals, based in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Technology Shabbat was inspired by the traditional Shabbat or Sabbath, a weekly day of rest in most popular religions. \n\nAlthough not named as such, the concept of a Technology Shabbat evolved as early on as the creation of the internet, with more people participating since the advent of portable devices, according to Mark Glaser, editor of MediaShift on PBS.org. In the mid-1980s, Secretary of State George Shultz would take an hour each week in his office for quiet reflection with only a paper and pen. Shlain first disconnected in 2008, when her father, Leonard Shlain was diagnosed with brain cancer. During his infrequent lucid moments, she'd turn off her cell phone. Soon after, she and her husband Ken Goldberg, as members of Reboots, participated in the first annual National Day of Unplugging, and contributed a poem to commemorate the day, which was turned into a film by Shlain called \"Yelp: With Apologies to Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'\". Around that time, their family began the ritual of Technology Shabbats. \nFor a Technology Shabbat, all screens are turned off for 24 hours, and many of those who partake chose Friday night until Saturday night. Suggested alternatives to technology include activities like reading books, taking walks, visiting new neighborhoods, engaging in outdoor activities and using pen and paper.\n\n“The Internet is a vortex,” Portland writer Tammy Strobel told the \"Oregonian\" as the reason she and her husband turn off the computer on Sundays to observe Tech Sabbath. “I can get lost in it for hours. And time is something we can never get back.”\n\nAmong the rabbis who advocate unplugging for the Jewish Sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset are New York City's Elliot J. Cosgrove of Park Avenue Synagogue.\n\nThe concept of Technology Shabbat has been featured in several films made by Shlain. These include \"\" in 2011, \"Yelp: With Apologies to Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'\" in 2011, \n\"Technology Shabbats\" in 2013, \"A Case For Dreaming\" in 2014, and \n\"Making of a Mensch\" in 2015.\n\n"}

The organization received popular attention during the 2014 Ebola Crisis, when it partnered with the Liberian NGO \"Camp for Peace\" to deploy Rumie tablets as part of a rehabilitation program for child soldiers. As a result of the Ebola epidemic, however, schools across the country were shuttered, and Rumie's tablets quickly became a resource for children to continue their education from home.\n\nIn 2015, Rumie began deploying its technology to assist children affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. At the time, a primary challenge was the deficit of free digital learning content for Syrian students. In response to this issue, Rumie announced during a 2015 presentation at Y-Combinator that it was opening the LearnCloud—a portal for free-license learning content, allowing users to find, share, and rate free digital educational resources.\n\nTariq Fancy, a former investment banker and private equity investor, founded Rumie with his personal savings, committing to work without salary until the organization became financially sustainable. In early 2014, Rumie raised $1 million in philanthropic donations from outside backers, including Ed Clark, the retired CEO of TD Bank, Rob McEwen, the chairman and CEO of McEwen Mining Inc., and Mark Wiseman, then the CEO of the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board.

It is now a nationwide organization in New Zealand, growing immensely since its formation in 2005. It helps children aged 11–17 learn about rock music, how to be part of a band, and how to successfully turn that \"garage band\" into a working, successful band.\n\nThe School of Rock is currently running in Wellington and there is also the Auckland School of Rock, a programme run by a team of professional musicians.\n\nThe school regularly accepts vocalists, guitarists, bassists, drummers and Keyboardists, while other instruments, such as saxophones, may be auditioned as necessary and contacts kept for needed circumstances.\n\nIn most cases bands are created from individual sign-ups. In some cases entire or partial bands sign up, looking for instruction and help obtaining new members. Students are encouraged, and eventually expected, to begin or continue to have private tuition for their chosen instruments.\n\nQuoted from the school's website: \"The School of Rock teaches young musicians how to be in a band. Rockers-in-training learn important life skills - like how to work together, improvise, prepare new material, and perform in front of an audience - all while learning classic and modern rock that will make them better musicians.

The main campus sits on in a suburban district of Riverside, California, United States, with a branch campus of in Palm Desert. In 1907 the predecessor to UCR was founded as the UC Citrus Experiment Station, Riverside which pioneered research in biological pest control and the use of growth regulators responsible for extending the citrus growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on citrus diversity and entomology, as well as science fiction and photography, are located at Riverside.\n\nUCR's undergraduate College of Letters and Science opened in 1954. The Regents of the University of California declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000 students by 2015, more than $730 million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999. Preliminary accreditation of the UC Riverside School of Medicine granted in October 2012 and the first class of 50 students was enrolled in August 2013. It is the first new research-based public medical school in 40 years.\n\nUCR is consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically and economically diverse universities in the United States. The 2016 \"U.S. News & World Report\" Best Colleges rankings places UCR tied for 58th among top public universities, tied for 121st nationwide and ranks 16+ graduate school programs including the Graduate School of Education and the Bourns College of Engineering based on peer assessment, student selectivity, financial resources, and other factors. \"Washington Monthly\" ranked UCR 2nd in the United States in terms of social mobility, research and community service, while \"U.S. News\" ranks UCR as the fifth most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving Pell Grants (42 percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation. Nearly two-thirds of all UCR students graduate within six years without regard to economic disparity. UCR's extensive outreach and retention programs have contributed to its reputation as a \"university of choice\" for minority students. In 2005, UCR became the first public university campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option.\n\nUCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the Big West Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of Box Springs Mountain. The UCR women's basketball team won back-to-back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.\n\nIn 2018, the university hired its first two Nobel Prize winners to its faculty. Richard Schrock and Barry Barish joined UCR's College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Southern California was a major producer of citrus, the region's primary agricultural export. The industry developed from the country's first navel orange trees, planted in Riverside in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the UC Regents established the UC Citrus Experiment Station (CES) on February 14, 1907, on of land on the east slope of Mount Rubidoux in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in fertilization, irrigation and crop improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, near Box Springs Mountain.\n\nThe 1944 passage of the GI Bill during World War II set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many UC Berkeley alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered liberal arts college next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman Philip L. Boyd and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature. Governor Earl Warren signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2 million for initial campus construction.\n\nGordon S. Watkins, dean of the College of Letters and Science at UCLA, became the first provost of the new college at Riverside. Initially conceived of as a small college devoted to the liberal arts, he ordered the campus built for a maximum of 1,500 students and recruited many young junior faculty to fill teaching positions. He presided at its opening with 65 faculty and 127 students on February 14, 1954, remarking, \"Never have so few been taught by so many.\"\n\nUCR's enrollment exceeded 1,000 students by the time Clark Kerr became president of the UC system in 1958. Anticipating a \"tidal wave\" in enrollment growth required by the baby boom generation, Kerr developed the California Master Plan for Higher Education and the Regents designated Riverside a general university campus in 1959. UCR's first chancellor, Herman Theodore Spieth, oversaw the beginnings of the school's transition to a full university and its expansion to a capacity of 5,000 students. UCR's second chancellor, Ivan Hinderaker led the campus through the era of the free speech movement and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside. According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker, the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for smog after the mayor asked Governor Ronald Reagan to declare the South Coast Air Basin a disaster area in 1971; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25% through 1979. Hinderaker's development of innovative programs in business administration and biomedical sciences created incentive for enough students to enroll at Riverside to keep the campus open.\nIn the 1990s, the UC experienced a new surge of enrollment applications, now known as \"Tidal Wave II\". The Regents targeted UCR for an annual growth rate of 6.3%, the fastest in the UC system, and anticipated 19,900 students at UCR by 2010. By 1995, African American, American Indian, and Latino student enrollments accounted for 30% of the UCR student body, the highest proportion of any UC campus at the time. The 1997 implementation of Proposition 209—which banned the use of affirmative action by state agencies—reduced the ethnic diversity at the more selective UC campuses but further increased it at UCR.\n\nWith UCR scheduled for dramatic population growth, efforts have been made to increase its popular and academic recognition. The students voted for a fee increase to move UCR athletics into NCAA Division I standing in 1998. In the 1990s, proposals were made to establish a law school, a medical school, and a school of public policy at UCR, with the UCR School of Medicine and the School of Public Policy becoming reality in 2012. In June 2006, UCR received its largest gift, 15.5 million from two local couples, in trust towards building its medical school. The Regents formally approved UCR's medical school proposal in 2006. Projected to be completed by 2013, it will be the first new medical school in 40 years built in California.\n\nUCR's main campus sits at an elevation of to near Box Springs Mountain, 3 miles (5 km) east of downtown Riverside, and comprises divided into eastern and western areas by the State Route 60 freeway.\n\nEast Campus, occupying approximately , hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the architecture of the major buildings followed the Mission Revival style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California.\nFurther major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more Modern style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a \"general campus\" of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east–west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway. The Bell Tower, one of only five carillons in California, was built in this period. Designed by A. Quincy Jones, the tower is tall and contains 48 bells, each weighing from to , covering four chromatic octaves.\n\nAfter the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the period include: Bourns Hall, completed in 1995; the Humanities & Social Science building, completed in 1996; and the Science Library, completed in 1998. The Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls were completed in 2000, and the Arts building was completed in 2001. Active construction projects include new buildings for Engineering and Materials Science, Psychology Research, and Genomics. The first phase of a new Commons was completed in 2007, and phase II is in development. Other ongoing projects include a new CHASS Instructional and Research Center and Students Academic Support Services Building. Since 1999, more than $730 million has been invested in construction projects.\nOf the of UCR property constituting West Campus, approximately along University Avenue have been developed. These include facilities such as University Extension, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Germplasm Repository, International Village (student housing), Human Resources and Highlander Hall. University Village, a mixed use commercial development, features a movie theater, stores, restaurants, office space, and an apartment complex, along with a parking structure and surface parking. Citrus groves and row crops occupy the remaining stretching northwest to the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Le Conte Drive. Plans for future expansion include converting a portion of these fields into new UCR infrastructure.\n\nThe University of California, Riverside, has recently united its three downtown arts presentation venues under the umbrella name of the UCR ARTSblock. The ARTSblock is composed of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, The Sweeney Art Gallery, and the Culver Center of the Arts, a media lab and presentation facility. The three institutions reside side by side in the heart of downtown Riverside's historic pedestrian mall.\n\nThe Richard J. Heckmann International Center for Entrepreneurial Management was founded in Palm Desert in 2001. After the Coachella Valley Agricultural Research Station, it is UCR's second institutional presence in the Coachella Valley. Initially by a $6 million gift from Richard J. Heckmann, a water treatment entrepreneur, the institution was planned as a teaching and research center of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management at the UCR School of Business Administration. The center encourages local entrepreneurship through the Coachella Valley Angel Network, an angel investment network. A further investment of $10 million from the State of California and a donation of of land from the City of Palm Desert allowed for the opening of an expanded graduate center on April 15, 2005, adjacent to the California State University, San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus. The center is also home to university researchers in conservation biology, technology transfer and Native American studies. Master's level instruction in business management and creative writing is available at the center.\n\nAs a campus of the University of California system, UCR is governed by a Board of Regents and administered by a president. The current president is Janet Napolitano, and the administrative head of UCR is Kim Wilcox. UCR's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.\n\nUCR is organized into four academic colleges, two professional schools, and several interdisciplinary divisions. UCR's liberal arts college, the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, founded in 1960, incorporated the CES as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974. UCR's newest academic unit, the Bourns College of Engineering, was founded in 1989. Comprising the professional schools are the Graduate School of Education, founded in 1968, and the UCR School of Business Administration, founded in 1970. These units collectively provide 81 majors and 52 minors, 48 master's degree programs, and 42 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs. UCR is the only UC campus to offer undergraduate degrees in creative writing and public policy and one of three UCs (along with Berkeley and Irvine) to offer an undergraduate degree in business administration. Through its Division of Biomedical Sciences, founded in 1974, UCR offers the Thomas Haider medical degree program in collaboration with UCLA. UCR's doctoral program in the emerging field of dance theory, founded in 1992, was the first program of its kind in the United States, and UCR's minor in lesbian, gay and bisexual studies, established in 1996, was the first undergraduate program of its kind in the UC system. A new BA program in bagpipes was inaugurated in 2007.\n\nInstitutional rankings of UC Riverside vary widely, depending on the criteria of the publication. For instance, UC Riverside was ranked the #15 college in the United States by the Social Mobility Index college rankings. In the 2018 edition of \"U.S. News & World Report\"'s \"America's Best Colleges\", UCR was ranked tied for 85th among national universities; criteria include professor peer assessment, student selectivity and retention, as well as faculty resources, financial resources, and alumni giving. In the 2018 edition of the \"Washington Monthly\" college rankings, UCR ranked 28th among national universities. \"Washington Monthly\" assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country). In the 2018 edition of \"Webometrics Ranking of World Universities\" based in Spain, UCR was ranked 67th among national universities and 127th among world universities. \"Money\" magazine ranked UC Riverside 32nd in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2018 Best Colleges ranking. The Daily Beast ranked UC Riverside 153rd in the country out of the nearly 2000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking. According to the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index published by \"Academic Analytics\" in 2006, UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications, citations, research funding and other honors. Since 1997, more than 110 UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Over the course of UCR's history, seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and more than 50 have received Guggenheim Fellowships.\n\nUCR operated under a $435 million budget in fiscal year 2005–06. The state government provided $153 million, student fees accounted for $111 million, the federal government financed $84 million, and $45 million came from university sales and services. Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $18 million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1 billion in California. Faculty members received nearly $87 million in research funding in 2005–06, mostly from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Total research expenditures at Riverside are significantly concentrated in agricultural science, accounting for 53% of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002. Top research centers by expenditure, as measured in 2002, include the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Center for Environmental Research and Technology, the Center for Bibliographical Studies, the Air Pollution Research Center, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.\n\nThroughout UCR's history, researchers have developed more than 40 new citrus varieties and invented new techniques to help the $960 million-a-year California citrus industry fight pests and diseases. In 1927, entomologists at the CES introduced two wasps from Australia as natural enemies of a major citrus pest, the citrophilus mealybug, saving growers in Orange County $1 million in annual losses. This event was pivotal in establishing biological control as a practical means of reducing pest populations. In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of gibberellic acid allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was the extension of the citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months. In 1980, UC Riverside released the Oroblanco grapefruit, its first patented citrus variety. Since then, the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the Melogold grapefruit, the Gold Nugget mandarin (or tangerine), and others that have yet to be given trademark names. To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products, UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park, which includes the City of Riverside and the County of Riverside. It also administers six reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System. UCR recently announced a partnership with China Agricultural University to launch a new center in Beijing, which will study ways to respond to the country's growing environmental issues. UCR can also boast the birthplace of two name reactions in organic chemistry, the Castro-Stephens coupling and the Midland Alpine Borane Reduction.\n\nAdmission to UC Riverside is rated as \"selective\" by \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nFor Fall 2015, UCR received 38,505 freshmen applications; 21,608 were admitted (56.1%). The average GPA of the enrolled freshmen was 3.69, while the average SAT scores were 545 for critical reading, 574 for math, and 549 for writing.\n\nIn 2006, 43.4 percent of admitted students were first generation college students, 38.7 percent came from low family income backgrounds, and 24 percent graduated from low-performing high schools as measured by Academic Performance Index (API) scores. In 2007, \"U.S. News\" ranked UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving Pell Grants (42 percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation.\n\nAccording to statistics released by the Education Trust, a national nonprofit, in 2005 UC Riverside graduated 65.3 percent of its students in six years, a figure consistent with national averages but behind the average set by the top five public research universities by as much as 22 percent. However, UCR's consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39 percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the National Center for Education Statistics, making the campus a model for successful approaches to diversity in higher education.\n\nTotal library collections at UCR comprise more than 2 million volumes, 14,017 electronic journals, 23,000 serial subscriptions, and 1.7 million microformats. Two large, four-story libraries house most of the physical collections. The Rivera library was constructed in 1954 and named after Tomás Rivera in 1985. It seats a capacity of 956 and houses general humanities and social science collections, as well as special collections, including the world's largest collection of science fiction, horror and fantasy literature, the 110,000-volume Eaton Collection. The Rivera Library also hosts the only U.S. Patent and Trademark Depository based on a UC campus. The Raymond L. Orbach Science Library, built in 1998, seats a capacity of 1,360 and houses 533,000 volumes in the physical, natural, agricultural, biomedical, engineering and computer sciences, with special strengths in the areas of citrus and sub-tropical horticulture, entomology, and arid lands agriculture. On November 3, 2009, the Science library was officially renamed the Raymond L. Orbach Science Library in honor of former Chancellor Raymond L. Orbach. Smaller libraries include the Media and Cultural Library, the Music Library, and a branch digital library in Palm Desert. The UCR Library is one of 116 members of the Association of Research Libraries, and is ranked 93rd in this group.\n\nUCR's academic colleges administer significant museum collections in the arts and sciences. The Citrus Variety Collection constitutes 1,800 trees representing two of each of the 640 types of Citrus and 28 other related genera in the Rutaceae family, the largest such collection in the world. The Herbarium houses more than 110,000 dried plant specimens from across the Western hemisphere. UCR is also home to of botanical gardens containing more than 3,500 plant species from around the world. The Gardens are located in the eastern foothills of the Box Springs Mountain on the University of California, Riverside campus. Over four miles (6 km) of trails wind through many microclimates and hilly terrain. The Entomology Research Museum contains more than three million insect specimens, with particular strengths in Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Aphelinidae, Thysanoptera and Meloidae. The UCR/California Museum of Photography and Sweeney Art Gallery house UCR's primary art collections. The UCR/CMP includes the world's largest holding of vintage stereographs, one of the three great public collections of photographic apparatus in the US, and the University Print Collection of contemporary and historical images by over 1000 photographers. Located adjacent to the UCR/CMP, the Sweeney Art Gallery holds approximately 650 unique works, with especially strong collections from the modern to contemporary periods, including pieces by Alexander Calder, Roy Lichtenstein, Millard Sheets and Kara Walker.\n\nMuch of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"New York Times\" to run stories stating that UCR is a \"campus of choice\" for minority students. UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) resource center in 1993, the first UC campus to offer a LGBT minor studies program in 1996, and the first campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option in 2005. In recognition of this, \"The Advocate\" recognized UCR as one of the nation's best campuses for LGBT students in 2006, although it did not make the top 20. The \"Princeton Review\" listed UCR as a \"Best Western College.\" While over 83 percent of students are non-white, there is a tendency for the different ethnic groups to self-segregate.\n\nUCR's residence halls consist of three structures—Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills—which housed 2,930 students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus apartment complexes such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959 students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls. Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007. About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus. Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.\n\nReflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include \"Unete a Mundo\", for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a gender-neutral community. UCR's three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.\n\nUCR hosts over 375 registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues. ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 16 elected senators, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment, 5 Executive Cabinet Officers (President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, and Vice President of Finance), and 6 Directors, who are in charge of the various parts of ASUCR, and a Judicial Council of 6, which adjudicates any cases involving personnel misconduct or interpretation of the Constitution. Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees. ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus, including student lobbying groups, a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999.\n\nOf the registered student groups, 40 are fraternities and sororities. Nine men's fraternities belong to the North-American Interfraternity Conference; seven women's sororities belong to the National Panhellenic Conference; seven men's fraternities and ten women's sororities represent the National Multicultural Greek Council, and two others fall under the campus Raza Assembly and are unique to UCR. Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted. Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000 hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year. Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through UCR Hillel.\n\nStudent media organizations include \"The Highlander\" student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, \"The Highlander\" remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however \"The Highlander\" is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue. In 2003, \"The Highlander\" published a comic depicting a stereotypical Asian American graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford. Other student news publications on campus include the \"Asian Community Times, Indian Time, Nuestra Cosa, Queeriosity\", and the \"X-Factor Student Newspaper\". Campus literary magazines include \"Mosaic\", published at UCR since 1959, and \"Crate,\" published by graduate students in UCR's master's level creative writing program since 2005. UCR broadcasts over radio as KUCR at 88.3 FM. The station programs a variety of independent music, news and commentary.\n\nOn-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Winter Soulstice, Homecoming Bonfire and Spring Splash.\n\nStill other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a \"party school\" stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.\n\nThe Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.\n\nUCR's varsity teams compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men's and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from NCAA Division II in 2000. While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men's baseball and women's volleyball. , UCR had produced 17 individual national champions, 175 All-Americans and many conference and regional champions. The men's golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back-to-back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country. In 2006, 2007, and 2010 the UCR women's basketball team represented the conference in the Division I tournament but lost all three times in the first round. In December 2008, the UCR women's basketball team upset the #16-seeded Vanderbilt Commodores.\n\nIn 2005 the women's soccer team competed in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In 2007, UCR's baseball team won their first Big West championship and reached the Division I postseason for the second time since 2003, and the cross country team sent its first two athletes to the national championships.\nFootball was played until 1975, and the team won two CCAA championships before the sport was discontinued because of low attendance and in anticipation of the impact of Title IX regulations.\n\nThe volleyball and basketball teams play home games in the Student Recreation Center Arena (SRC), which seats 3,168. The baseball team competes at the Riverside Sports Complex, just off campus at the corner of Blaine and Rustin streets. UCR graduate Troy Percival personally built UCR's baseball clubhouse to major league quality standards. Softball is played at the Amy S. Harrison Field, named after a UCR graduate who donated $300,000 towards its upgrade in 2004. Adjacent to the softball field are the soccer and track fields. The soccer field was resurfaced with artificial turf in 2007. In 2011, the old track and field facility, which had bleachers that dated back to the 1950s and a track surface that was over 15 years old, was completely torn out and replaced with a brand new facility.\n\nNon-varsity student sports clubs that compete with other area universities include the Rugby Football Club, established in 2006, which plays in the Southern California Rugby Football Union. The karate program is provided through the UC Riverside Recreation Center's Leisure Line classes. The classes are provided by top of the line USA Shotokan karate team coaches from the American JKA Karate Association, an association that has been in the city for over 40 years. It is one of the largest collegiate programs in the United States, that take competitors to local, national and international competitions. A Men's and Women's Club Soccer team also competes in the West Coast Soccer Association.\n\nIn 1954, UCR's founding class adopted the name \"Highlanders\", reflecting the campus' high altitude. After the student body passed a referendum to move to Division I competition in 1998, the bear mascot, formerly called \"Scotty\", was professionally redesigned to look more ferocious. The new mascot featured a half-blue face in homage to William Wallace, the subject of the movie Braveheart. In line with the Scottish motif, UCR assembles a bagpipe band made up of students and staff who play at graduation and other campus events. The blue and gold tartan worn by the pipe band and the mascot is a registered trademark of the University of California. For the women's basketball team's first appearance at the NCAA Tournament in 2006, UCR sent 22 members of the pipe band to play at halftime.\n\n\nMore than 94,000 alumni have graduated from UCR over the course of its history. A Alumni and Visitors Center was established in 2007. It is used as a central gathering place for alumni and holds several facilities for use including meeting rooms, a formal board room, a central lobby area, a library, several alumni affairs offices, and a café.\n\nSome of the most notable alumni include the following:\n\n\n"}
