The grades are:\n\nSince decimal fractions are common, a scale from 0 to 100 is often used to remove the decimal point. Then, 100 becomes the highest score, and 60 the minimum passing score. Depending on the school, the official certificate may use the range 0–100, or these may be converted back to the range 0–10, allowing for some rounding and truncation.\n\nAlthough the grades 0–59 are normally given in class or tests, they are not reported as such in certificates. When failed subjects are reported in written, they normally have a score of NA or N/A, standing for \"No Acreditada\" (Not Accredited) or \"No Aprobada\" (Not Approved).\n\nMajor works, such as a written thesis or doctoral dissertation, may not have a grade, but appear in certificates simply as AC, standing for \"Acreditada\" (Accredited).\n\nOccasionally, institutions, specially private schools, may use their own grading system, but there must exist conversion rules to convert those grades to their equivalent in the decimal system.\n\nGiven that the scale of grading ranges from 0 to 100, it is common that the grade indicates the percentage of correct answers in a given exam.\n\nGrades are most often absolute and not class-specific. Thus, it may be that the top student of the class gets a low grade of 70, while the passing threshold is still 60. That is, curve-adjustment of scores is rare.\n\nStudents in honor roll are usually those with an overall grade point average of 90 (very good) or more upon graduation. In that case, depending on the school or university, the student may be awarded a \"With Honors\" diploma.\n\nHigher-level educational institutions, such as degree-awarding universities, require a minimum score of 70 (average) to pass a subject, instead of the regular 60.\n\nIn many universities, such as federal institutes of technology, an overall grade point average of 90 (very good) or better entitles the student to graduate with honors, other requirements such as a final work or thesis being waived, and automatically awards him or her the professional license (\"cédula profesional\").\n\nStudents holding a Bachelor's degree require at least an overall grade point average of 80 (good) to be allowed to enrol for a master's or a doctoral degree.\n\nAt this level, the minimum passing grade is still 70, but students are required to obtain a minimum grade of 80 to be awarded their postgraduate degree. Also, a score of 80 may be required to maintain other benefits such as a federal scholarship.\n\nDue to influence of North American television shows and media, the common US grading system that uses letters is understood in Mexico, and a rough equivalence can be made to the Mexican system, specially when television shows are localized for the Mexican audience.\n\nFor example, \"a straight-A student\" may be translated as \"un estudiante de puro 10\", or \"a straight-10 student\".\n\nOther grading systems, such as those used in European countries, or the United States GPA values 0.0–4.0, are less known.\n"}

The key elements that make up Anji Play are its pedagogy, site-specific environments, unique materials and integrated technology. The focus of the program is the participating children's self-determination in choosing what, where, and with whom to play and the role of the teacher as observer, particularly in instances of physical risk. Anji Play is the full-time curriculum of all public kindergartens in Anji County.\n\nIn 1989, China signed United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 31 recognizes \"the rights of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.\"\n\nIn 1996, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China released the \"Standards for Kindergarten Education.\" It views play in kindergarten as a \"foundational activity to be included in every type of educational activity\" – i.e. play is a must in education.\n\nStarting in 2001, Anji Play was entirely developed outside of the influence of Western educational philosophy, though the program’s tenets and the methods used to develop it share resemblances with Montessori and Froebel. Although Anji Play’s initial development met resistance from parents, a parent outreach program was implemented to teach the value of play in education.\n\nToday Anji Play is internationally recognized as an early-childhood curriculum used in 130 public kindergartens in Anji County, China. It has expanded internationally and is being adapted in the United States beginning with One City Early Learning Centers in Madison, Wisconsin and by the Madison Public Library.\n\nIn Anji Play’s current implementation, children have at least two hours of free play every day. Play environments are outdoors with minimal structuring, and simple tools made of natural materials (i.e., ropes, light bamboo ladders, basic clay pots) are provided as toys, instead of objects sold and marketed as toys. During play time, teachers observe, document, and act as parallel participants.\n\nAnji Play is composed of simple tools made of natural materials such as clay pots, ropes, light bamboo ladders and other everyday objects like barrels and tires. Children in the Anji Play environment interact with these objects to create their own playground govern by their own rules. Inherently through Anji Play, children collaborate develop social and motor skills in order to play.\n\nAdults and instructors are advised to not intervene and instruct, but to observe. From an outside perspective, instructors are taught to trust the children and understand how children navigate conflict and collaboration.\n\nThis style of non-instructed play defines the phrase '\"True Play\"'. Anji Play outlines the True Play philosophy in several categories (split between \"Children's Rights\" and \"Teacher/adult responsibilities\"): \n\n\n"}

This was followed by the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University (Joint Program with University of Nottingham), Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University and Faculty of Medicine, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang as part of the first round (entrance by portfolio) of the Thai University Central Admissions System (TCAS) for the 2018 intake, after educational reforms in 2017.\n\nMost recently, for the 2018 intake, CEU Cardenal Herrara University in Spain, the University of Pécs in Hungary, the University of Rijeka and the University of Zagreb, both in Croatia, have started using BMAT as an entry requirement to courses such as Medicine and Dentistry\n\nBMAT is a 2-hour, pen-and-paper test, which consists of three sections. The first two sections are both multiple choice questions and the third section is a writing task.\n\nThis section is designed to test generic skills in problem-solving, understanding arguments, and data analysis and inference. It is made up of 35 questions, with 60 minutes to complete.\n\nThis section tests the ability to apply scientific knowledge typically covered in school Science and Mathematics by the age of 16 (for example, GCSE in the UK and IGCSE internationally). It is made up of 27 questions, with 30 minutes to complete.\n\nThis section tests the ability to select, develop and organise ideas, and to communicate them in writing, concisely and effectively. Applicants must complete one writing task from a choice of three questions, with 30 minutes to complete.\n\nCalculators and dictionaries, including bilingual dictionaries, cannot be used in the exam.\n\nFor Sections 1 and 2 the total raw marks for each section are converted onto the BMAT 9-point scale. The scores are given to one decimal place. Most candidates typically score around 5.0 (roughly half marks). Some candidates will score around 6.0 and a few exceptional candidates will score higher than 7.0.\n\nFor Section 3, candidates get two scores – one for quality of content (on a scale of 0–5, with 5 being the highest) and one for quality of written English (on the scale A, C, E, with A being the highest). Each BMAT essay is marked by two examiners and the two marks are combined to give an overall score ranging from 1E to 5A. An image of the candidate’s Writing Task is supplied to each institution to which the candidate has applied.\n\nBMAT is normally taken at authorised ‘open centres’ which are located around the world. For the test session that takes place in late October/early November, UK applicants can often take the test in their school or college.\n\nThe timing of the test is designed to fit in with the timescales for Medicine applications for the institutions across the world using the test.\nEach year, the following test sessions take place: \nTypically, for each test session, students must register themselves or be registered for the test, by their school, at least a month in advance. \nBMAT results are generally issued 3–4 weeks after the test has taken place, either by a Statement of Results or via the Metritests system.\n\nBMAT results are only valid in the year that the test is taken.\n\nBMAT results are used in a variety of ways by the different institutions using it: for example, Oxford University combines the results with GCSE grades to decide who is called for interview.\n\nOften it is seen as just part of the application process – previous examination results, a teacher’s reference, the applicant’s personal statement and predicted grades are also important.\n\nBMAT does not require a lot of extra study as it is designed to test skills and knowledge that candidates are expected to already have. Practice materials, including the test specification, practice questions, past papers, and an Assumed Subject Knowledge guide for Section 2 are available to candidates for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing website.\n\nThere are some companies that help with coaching for the BMAT, however these companies are not endorsed by Cambridge Assessment who administer the test.\n\n\n"}

Padwick\n\nConstance Evelyn Padwick (July 2, 1886 – 1968) known as Paddie by her friends was born at the Manor House, West Thorney, Sussex, England and grew up near Chichester, in the English countryside as well as in London. She was educated at home and then further trained as a teacher. She was known as one of the leading British women missionaries and one of the first women missiologists in the twentieth century who also worked with Church Mission Society for several years. She lived and worked in Cairo, Egypt and traveled to many different places from Fez to Lahore. In 1947 when conditions were bad because of the war she was asked to leave Jerusalem and went to Kordofan in Sudan. Padwick prepared textbooks for Christian schools for three years and then moved to Istanbul and then returned to England in 1957. She spent almost forty years in the Middle East where she developed her knowledge of Arabic and her knowledge of Mosques and devotees helped her write her best known published book which is the \"Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in Common Use.\"\n\nPadwick's father was a non-practising Barrister who farmed his own land. Her maternal Grandfather was the Reverend Thomas Pownall Boultbee who set up the London College of Divinity now St John's College, Nottingham. At the age of ten Padwick went to Finsbury Square, London where she was taught by her godmother and was also with other children through most of her teen years. This godmother was also the aunt, and governess to many other children of this household. The father of the children of this particular household was James Pratt, who was the grandson of Josiah Pratt, a founder in 1799 of C.M.S. After her teen years in this household in London she went with one of her cousins to Palestine in 1910 for a visit and fell in love with the Middle East. Near the end of her life she then lived with her sister Joy in Lower Odcombe, in Somerset, where she died.\n\nPadwick was educated from home and then went out to be trained as a teacher. After her teen years she went briefly to Paris and then back with her family in Sussex where she started studying the New Testament Greek and became active in the Student Christian Movement. She went to the University of London and studied Arabic, Arab folklore and the understanding of Islam, she also took her teachers training Certificate with distinction and was rewarded by a scholarship to the School of Oriental and African Studies within the University of London. Padwick also studied Greek and pedagogy and was a student of Oriental studies of the American University in Cairo. She worked from 1909 to 1916 on the home staff of the Church Mission Society as the editor of children's magazines.\n\nIn 1912 Padwick joined C.M.S and was the editor of children's magazines. Padwick was drawn to the Middle East through the reading of the biography of Douglas M. Thornton written by Temple Gairdner. She believed literature was a great evangelistic tool. “After looking very carefully at the different positions from which it would now be possible to serve the Moslem world by means of Christian literature, and after much prayer, I have come to the deliberate conclusion that it is as a C.M.S literature missionary, if C.M.S. will have me, that I want the privilege of serving. For both on a general view and on a detailed examination, it seems to me that God calls us now to strengthen the Cairo literature department of C.M.S (CMS 3)” But when she offered to work overseas with C.M.S., she was rejected because of ill health.\n\nPadwick nevertheless worked in Cairo with the Nile Mission Press until 1921 and then went back to the University of London where she wrote a thesis on Arab Folklore. In 1923 she went back to Cairo, Egypt under C.M.S. and became the editorial secretary for the Central Committee for Christian Literature for Muslims. She also served in Cairo under C.M.S. till the end of her career for over three decades which included her time in Palestine in 1937. After the war in 1947 she was asked to leave Palestine and go to the Nuba Mountains in Sudan where she wrote Arab text books for schools. She then spent three years at Katcha Kordofan which ended in November 1951 with serious illness at the age of sixty-five. Padwick wrote many different Arabic materials for those people and she ended her time in Sudan in 1951 when she became ill and retired in 1952 from C.M.S. but never really truly retired till 1957 in Dorset, Village Maiden Newton close to the heart of the Hardy country of Wessex. Somewhere in between this time she was first nursed at Omduran hospital and then by friends in Kenya until she was ready to travel to Istanbul where she spent four quiet years.\n\nConstance E. Padwick is most well known for her writing. While working for Church Mission Society she was an editor of children’s magazines, she was also one the editors of the \"Orient and Occident\" which is a Christian monthly published in Cairo. She is also known for writing biographies of Henry Martyn, Lilias Trotter and her colleague William Henry Temple Gairdner. She also wrote \"Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in common use,\" as well as \"Mackay of the great lake,\" \"The Master of the Impossible: Sayings for the Most part in Parable from the Letters and Journals of Lilias Trotter of Algiers\" (1938), and many more. She loved Muslims and writing about them, she developed specific materials for Muslim readers which included biographies about different missionaries who worked among Muslims. Many of her writings have helped youth deal with the stress of modern living and she saw her writings as a form of service in which she conducted with high standards, dedicated research and true objectivity. “Padwick's long career as missionary and missiologist bridges the gap between the female writers and strategists of the women's missionary movement and the contemporary female missiologists and mission strategists.” \"All that she wrote, she wrote out of a profound and missionary commitment to Christ as Christianity receives Him.\" \n\nIt was hard for women during Padwick’s time to be missionaries or to receive the respect that women deserved. Padwick wrote in and during a male-missionary-dominated era but she managed to make the transition, and was one of the first women to accomplish this. Her writings were published over a fifty-year period from 1918 to 1967 and her last one was published when she was 81.\nHer most well known book \"“Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in common use”\" analyzes the religious thought of Islam. According to Kenneth Cragg, her biography of Temple Gairdner was “one of the classics of missionary biography of this century.\"\n\nPadwick had a lifelong joy of external nature and loved flowers. She was accepted as a member by the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain. She also loved going to different little bookstores and searching for little hand held prayer books and pocket manuals to include in her work on Muslim Devotions. She desired to know Islam's inward spirituality and wanted this devotional book to speak to the heart of Muslims. This consumed her for more than twenty years. She gained respect through friends and learned from everyone and this book is now a valuable compendium of Muslim spirituality. \"Muslim Devotions, it may be truly said, is a worthy expression of Christian initiative and at the same time a comprehensive index to Muslim liturgy: It is a gesture of imagination inspired by one faith towards the inner genius of another.\" \"She attained a patient kinship with Muslim norms and themes and made their world her own.\" She also stated, \"for it is in knowing that we are known.\"\n\n\n"}

He also published research on the value of ultrasonic frequencies in sound reproduction, claiming that the time resolution of human hearing is 5 microseconds or better—which would correspond to a frequency of 200 kHz, requiring audio equipment ideally to have a flat response to that frequency.\n\nBlackmer attended High Mowing School in Wilton, New Hampshire. He started in audio at Lafayette Radio in Boston in the 1940s and studied electronics in the U.S. Navy and at Harvard University and MIT. He later worked at Trans-Radio Recording Studio, Epsco, Hi-Con Eastern and Raytheon, where he designed telemetry systems for the Mercury space program. He founded dbx in 1971, selling it to BSR in 1979 and staying on with the company for several years. In the late 1980s he formed Earthworks, producing studio microphones, preamplifiers and studio reference monitors. He also founded Kintek (now Colortek) and Instrumentation Laboratory, as well as running the Cafe Pierrot restaurant in Wilton for a time.\n\nBlackmer was a life member of the IEEE and a fellow of the Audio Engineering Society from 1976. He was also a great reader of science fiction. He had ten children.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for co-writing and co-directing the Oscar-nominated animated films \"Lilo & Stitch\" for Walt Disney Feature Animation, the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" film trilogy for DreamWorks Animation, and directed the \"Sigur Rós\" documentary/music film \"Heima\".\n\nDeBlois was born in Aylmer, Quebec. As a young boy, he was interested in comic books, which later influenced his drawing ability, sense of imagination and story-telling. Growing up poor, he visited on weekends a little smoke shop in a strip mall close to his house, where they let him read everything for free. Memorizing the comics, he went home and drew.\n\nDeBlois began his career as an assistant animator and layout artist for Hinton Animation Studios/Lacewood Productions in Ottawa, Ontario, while simultaneously attending Sheridan College's three year Classical Animation program in Oakville, Ontario. From 1988 to 1990, DeBlois contributed to such productions as \"The Raccoons\" (TV series), \"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\" (TV special), and \"The Nutcracker Prince\" (feature animated film).\n\nUpon graduation from Sheridan College in 1990, DeBlois was hired by Sullivan Bluth Studios in Dublin, Ireland. There, he worked as a layout artist, character designer, and storyboard assistant to Don Bluth on such feature animated films as \"A Troll in Central Park\" and \"Thumbelina\".\n\nIn 1994, DeBlois left Dublin for Los Angeles to begin work for Walt Disney Feature Animation as a storyboard artist, where he soon replaced his frequent collaborator, Chris Sanders, as Head of Story on \"Mulan\". Shortly thereafter, they re-teamed to create \"Lilo & Stitch\".\n\nFollowing its release in 2002, DeBlois sold several original live action feature film projects to write, direct, and produce, including an Irish ghost story (\"The Banshee and Finn Magee\"), a psychological thriller (\"The Lighthouse\"), and a family adventure series (\"Sightings\"), set-up at Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, and Universal Studios respectively.\n\nDeBlois' feature length music documentary film \"Heima\" chronicles the homecoming concert of Iceland's Sigur Rós.\n\nIn October 2008, DeBlois returned to feature animation to co-write and co-direct DreamWorks Animation's then-troubled \"How to Train Your Dragon\", once again re-teaming with Sanders. The duo re-envisioned the film's story and shepherded the production to its March 2010 release. The resulting film became the studio's top-grossing film in North America outside of the \"Shrek\" franchise.\n\nDuring that same time, DeBlois also directed another feature-length music film for Sigur Rós front-man Jónsi, entitled \"Go Quiet\", as well as a feature length concert film entitled \"Jónsi: Live at The Wiltern\".\n\nDeBlois wrote and directed the fantasy/action film \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\", a sequel to the original, which was released on June 13, 2014.\n\n\nDeBlois was born in Brockville, Ontario and raised in Aylmer, Quebec. DeBlois is openly gay, and told \"The Advocate\" that people in the industry \"knew that one of us was gay\" but mistakenly assumed it was his straight screenwriting partner Chris Sanders, because DeBlois \"hobbled in there looking like a redneck.\" DeBlois has been married since 2014.\n"}

He has been conferred with the Padma Shri which is the fourth highest civilian award awarded by the Republic of India.\n\nSingh earned his B.A. (Hons. – Maths) in 1975 and M.A. (Maths) in 1977 from St. Stephen's College, followed M.Phil (Maths) in 1978 from the University of Delhi. He did a PhD in Math from Imperial College London in 1981. He holds numerous honorary doctorates some of them being awarded by University of Edinburgh, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, University College Cork, Ireland. and University of Houston\n\nSingh started his career as Lecturer at St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi in 1981. Thereafter he joined Department of Mathematics, University of Delhi in 1987. He was the Head, Department of Mathematics, University of Delhi from December, 2004 to September, 2005. He served the University of Delhi as a Director, South Campus from 2005-2010. He officiated briefly as Pro Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi, before being appointed Vice Chancellor on 29 October 2010. His area of specialization include Functional analysis, Operator Theory, and Harmonic analysis. He is adjunct professor at the University of Houston and has also taught at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi. He is a recipient of Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honor awarded by the Republic of India. He is noted for being the brainchild and founder of Cluster Innovation Centre at University of Delhi , an inter-disciplinary, first of its kind research center particularly promoting undergraduate research.\n\n\nDinesh Singh's style of functioning has been termed by a section of Delhi University teachers as \"authoritarian\" and \"megalomaniac\". President of the Delhi University & College Karamchari (Worker) Union (DUCKU), publicly made an allegation that the Vice-Chancellor had created a terror-like atmosphere in Delhi University as there is absolutely no space for dissent. An elected member of the DU Executive Council claimed that, in an attempt to stifle any voice of dissent in the university, the VC allowed violence to happen against a senior professor at the Shri Ram College of Commerce. Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences principal Manoj Khanna resigned from his position after calling Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Dinesh Singh’s way of functioning as \"autocratic\". However, spokesperson of the University, Malay Neerav denied Manoj Khanna's allegations that colleges were forced by the Vice Chancellor to submit false affidavits to All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for getting approval to run BTech courses. Other high level administrators like Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of Examination had also resigned during the tenure of Dinesh Singh on the grounds of personal reasons but citing sources in the Delhi university, newspapers reported that these officials resigned due to differences with officials of the Vice-Chancellor's team.\n\nHis tenure has been controversial and he has been accused of financial and administrative irregularities. A ‘White Paper’ released by Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) alleged financial and administrative irregularities in functioning of Delhi University, like diversion of OBC funds for purchase of laptops or flagging off ‘Gyanodaya Express’. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, after approval of the President of India (who is also the Visitor of Delhi University) issued a showcause notice to Singh regarding these allegations. He is the first Delhi University Vice-Chancellor who has been served a show-cause notice to be removed from the post in the 93-year-old history. Singh responded to the showcause notice denying every charge but HRD ministry turned down his request for withdrawing showcause notice. Noted Academics including ex-President of the Indian National Science Academy, Krishan Lal, former Director General of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, SK Brahmachari, Keki N Daruwallla, ex-Vice President of the Indian Academy of Sciences and a host of academics from JNU, Jamia and Banaras Hindu University and Ex-DU Vice-Chancellor \"backed\" Prof. Dinesh Singh raising concern over the manner in which, \"the autonomy of the university was being compromised\". http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-academics-and-ex-du-vice-chancellor-back-dinesh-singh-2076233\n\nThe government decided not to process his reply to the showcause notice as he had barely few months left in his tenure and few senior Cabinet ministers pleaded for no action against him in order for him to finish his full term.\n\nThe HRD ministry, on 7 October 2015, requested the Visitor to send Dinesh Singh on 'forced leave' on the charge that Dinesh Singh tried to derail the process of appointment of his successor. However, the HRD ministry had to withdraw the request as the Visitor Pranab Mukherjee was not convinced if the DU VC should be punished with barely 20 days left of his term. The Visitor asked Dinesh Singh not to continue for a single day beyond the last day of his term. However, Dinesh Singh denied the charge of intentionally derailing the process of appointment of his successor and asserted that he will not continue a day beyond his tenure as is being speculated. In spite of just 20-odd days left for the completion of his term, a large number of teachers and students came out to protest in front of the Vice Regal Lodge demanding his ouster.\nDUTA has also recently charged Singh with plagiarism and has sought investigation into these plagiarism charges against him. \nSingh was instrumental in initiating Four Year Undergraduate Program (FYUP) which met with a lot of resistance from different quarters, after which the programme was scrapped as per the directives of the University Grant Commission(UGC) . Thereafter, Singh announced his resignation but later retracted it.\n\n"}

{"id": "7777797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7777797", "title": "Education Week", "text": "Education Week\n\nEducation Week is an independent news organization that has covered K–12 education since 1981. It is known for providing both news and analysis, along with explanatory and investigative journalism across a range of digital, print, and broadcast platforms as well as through live and virtual events. It is owned by Editorial Projects in Education (EPE), a nonprofit organization, whose mission is to raise awareness and understanding of critical issues facing American schools. It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland in Greater Washington DC.\n\nThe newspaper publishes 37 issues a year, including three special annual reports (\"Quality Counts\", \"Technology Counts\", and \"Leaders to Learn From\"). Other in-depth coverage includes regular, deep-dive topical reports on subjects like personalized learning, teacher recruitment, and assessment. \n\nIn 1957, Corbin Gwaltney, founder and then editor of \"Johns Hopkins Magazine\" for alumni of Johns Hopkins University, and a group of other university alumni magazine editors came together to discuss writing on higher education and decided to form Editorial Projects for Education (EPE), a nonprofit educational organization. Soon after, Gwaltney left Johns Hopkins Magazine to become the first full-time employee of the newly created EPE, starting in an office in his apartment in Baltimore and later moving to an office near the Johns Hopkins campus. He realized that higher education would benefit from a news publication. Gwaltney and other board members of EPE met to plan a new publication. In 1966, EPE published the first issue of \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\".\n\nIn 1978, EPE sold \"Chronicle\" to its editors and shifted its attention. With the support of several philanthropies, and using the successful model of \"Chronicle\", EPE went on to launch \"Education Week\" under the leadership of Ronald A. Wolk. The first issue of \"Education Week\" appeared on Sept. 7, 1981, and sought to provide \"Chronicle\"-like coverage of elementary and secondary education. It launched with a splash by running a scoop about efforts by President Ronald Reagan’s administration to downgrade the U.S. Department of Education, which was then still in its infancy. In August of 1981, EPE officially changed the name to Editorial Projects in Education.\n\n\"Education Week\" gained an online presence in 1996 with the website edweek.org, which features breaking news, interactive digital features and a host of news and opinion blogs.\n\nTargeted at teacher-leaders, Education Week Teacher features news relevant to teachers, along with opinion blogs and webinars.\n\nEdWeek Market Brief provides actionable intelligence about the marketplace of K-12 education. Created for both providers of education products and services and school district leaders, Market Brief’s original reporting, deep analysis and proprietary, data-driven research focuses on school district purchasing and the companies and products serving K-12 education.\n\nThe Education Week Research Center was founded in 1997 as the research-support team for the annual \"Quality Counts\" report.\n\nThe center conducts a range of original research each year for that report, as well as \"Diplomas Count\" (discontinued in 2016), \"Education Week\", edweek.org, and outside clients.\n\nIn 1997, \"Education Week\" launched \"Quality Counts\", an annual report that uses in-depth journalism and research to investigate important issues in education policy. The report also includes an annual report card on public education in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. From 1997 to 2010, \"Quality Counts\" was sponsored by the Pew Center on the States.\n\nIn addition to grading the states based on 3 categories: Chance for Success, the K-12 Achievement, and School Finance, each edition of the report has examined a topic of central concern to education policymakers and practitioners. Its themes have included: state efforts in early-childhood education; ensuring a highly qualified teacher for every classroom; school finance; and the role of state standards, assessments, and accountability in education.\n\n\"Technology Counts\", launched in 1997 and released annually, focuses on top issues related to technology and schools. Previous reports have explored digital content or curriculum, e-learning, and the impact of technology on assessment, among other topics.\n\nIn 2006, EPE launched \"Diplomas Count\", its annual report on high school graduation policies and rates. The report included graduation rates and patterns for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The report included downloadable highlights reports on each state. Diplomas Count ended in 2016.\n\nStarting in 2013, \"Education Week\" has honored innovative school district leaders through the Leaders to Learn From report. Featured leaders include superintendents, community engagement officers, nutrition services directors, curriculum specialists and directors of nursing.\n\nEducation Week Press was launched in 2002 to publish books and e-books on behalf of Editorial Projects in Education. Authors include both staff writers and external contributors.\n\nEducation Week TopSchoolJobs is an employment resource for job-seekers and employers in the education field, including job postings for teachers and K-12 administrators. TopSchoolJobs also offers a directory of professional development resources.\n\nOriginally EPE's website edweek.org primarily housed online versions of \"Education Week\" and \"Teacher Magazine\" print editions; it now provides daily breaking news and an array of other information resources, including such popular news blogs as Politics K-12, State EdWatch, Curriculum Matters, and an array of opinion blogs. It draws some 1.5 million visitors a month. Full access to the site requires a paid subscription, but readers can access a limited number of articles each month through free registration. Edweek.org is also home to free live chats and webinars on relevant educational topics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "309277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309277", "title": "Federico Santa María Technical University", "text": "Federico Santa María Technical University\n\nThe Federico Santa María Technical University () (UTFSM) (or simply Santa Maria University) is a Chilean university founded in 1926 in Valparaíso, Chile.\n\nIt is one of the most prestigious engineering universities in the country and Latin America, and gives special emphasis to basic sciences, engineering and technical fields with a more recent growth into economics and business sciences. The University has campuses in Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Santiago, Concepción and Rancagua, as well as an international campus in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The Federico Santa María Technical University is the alma mater of several prominent businessmen, engineers and Chilean scientists. Its students and alumni are known as \"Sansanos\".\n\nThe UTFSM was the first Chilean university to confer a doctorate in engineering in 1962 and the first higher-education institution in Latin America to confer this degree. The UTFSM university radio is the oldest campus radio in Latin America.\n\nThe university admission is very competitive and, it is known for its rigorous study requirements, demanding study program, and for being the only engineering university in Chile to require physical training as a compulsory part of the curriculum in its Valparaiso and Santiago Campuses. For the years 2011-2016, the UTFSM has an undergraduate retention rate of 81.0% by the first year of studies, and a 66.4% by the second year. Less than 1% of its students are international, and most of the available courses are imparted in Spanish.\n\nThe UTFSM has been historically perceived as one of the most prestigious engineering schools in the country and more recently, with the appearance of national and international rankings, has been placed among the top Universities in Chile and South America.It is ranked 1st in Chile and 2nd in South America by The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2014-2015.\n\nThe graduation date is held on the 20th of December every year, since it commemorates the anniversary of the death of the founder, Federico Santa Maria Carrera, on the 20th of December 1925.\n\nThe university takes its name from Federico Santa María, a Chilean philanthropist that lived in France. He raised a huge fortune as a broker in the sugar market in Paris. Before his death, he donated all his fortune to create a university in Valparaíso, his hometown. Although the amount of his fortune is unknown, it is believed to have been around 2 billion dollars of today's currency. While in Paris in 1920, in his testament, Santa María donated his fortune with the idea of building a high-standard technical and scientific institution.\n\nIn his will, Santa María manifested that his desired executors contribute to material progress and expand Chile's cultural horizons; altruistic ideas which sought to facilitate entry into the academic life of outstanding compatriots dispossessed but without further requirement than merit, skills and high academic achievement. This institution would accept and prepare the best students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to gain technical and scientific knowledge that contribute to the progress of the country.\n\nThe executors were chosen by Santa María to be Agustin Edwards Mac-Clure, Juan Brown Caces, Carlos van Buren and Andrew Geddes.\n\nFollowing his philosophy, on March 31, 1926, an institution was created to develop Santa María's legacy. Finally in 1931 the School of Crafts and Arts and School of Engineering José Miguel Carrera was founded. In 1935, its name changed to Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.\n\nThe condition imposed by Federico Santa María was that, during the first 10 years, the university must receive academics from the best schools of sciences and engineering. Following this imperative, the executor of this project, Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure, moved to Germany where he contacted Karl Laudien, who became the first rector of the university. From that moment, the university received a strong German influence in its engineering education. Several German engineers and scientists arrived before and after the second world war from institutions such as TU Berlin, Berlin University, Leipzig University among other German institutions. They brought to the University cutting edge knowledge in physics, chemistry and engineering. For example, Arnold Keller was involved in the development of the V-1 rockets during the second world war, as part of the team of Wernher von Braun. Research in new areas to the country such as Solar Energy, or Chemistry of Natural Products (National Sciences Prize 1971 and 1998) were created.\n\nIn 1934, the Scientia magazine is published, becoming the voice if the university academic work.\n\nIn 1937, the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria Radio was created, becoming the first university radio broadcaster in Chile and Latin America, focused to broadcasting information and cultural programs. The radio still broadcasts to this day, in the AM: 1.450 and FM: 99,7 signals in the Valparaiso region. The radio also has an online signal.\n\nIn 1939, the Alumni association was founded, known today as AEXA (Asociación de Ex-Alumnos).\n\nIn 1960, the Graduate School was created, and its first director was Herbert Appel (1960-1964), offering the PhD study lines for chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. In 1963 the university became the first higher-education institution in Latin America to confer a doctorate in engineering, in cooperation with the University of Pittsburgh. In the 1960s the University started a strategy of national and international expansion. In 1966 the Technical campus \"Viña del Mar\" was founded. In 1972 the campus \"Rey Balduino de Bélgica\" in the southeast city of Concepción with orientation in technical-professional areas was founded. The project received strong financial support from Baudouin King.\n\nIn 1964, the university grants for the first time a technical degree to a woman, the chemical technician Patricia Guzman. In 1965 Graciela Muñoz graduates as its first female engineer.\n\nThe UTFSM was the first university of the 8 existing universities in Chile at the time to restart its operations on 15 October 1973, after the Military coup of 11 September 1973.\n\nThe university has four campuses and two branch campuses (\"sedes\"). These are in four Chilean cities and Guayaquil, Ecuador:\n\n\nWhile the campuses are focused on undergraduate, graduate and university academical activities, \"sedes\" are mainly dedicated to technical degrees.\n\nThe main UTFSM campus (or \"Casa Central\") is located in Valparaíso, covering most of the front area of Los Placeres hill, on the grounds of the former Pudeto fort. The site faces the Pacific coast and it is visible from many parts of the bay of Valparaíso.\n\nThe building was designed by Josué Smith Solar, one of the most respected Chilean architects of the 20th century, and his son José Smith Miller. The American Neo-Gothic style campus is considered one of the foremost works of Chilean architecture. The campus is also recognised for its beautiful gardening, with native and exotic species.\n\nIn 2001, the illumination of the university frontis was renewed through a contest organised by the Chilean branch of Philips.\n\nThe main campus has a gothic scholastic architecture with a privileged view to the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 it was chosen as one of the most remarkable national architectural works of the 20th century.\n\nIn the 1960s, the University formulated an expansion plan. With financial assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the support of the Ford Foundation, advice from Dunwoody Industrial Institute in the US, and a donation of land by Chile's Agricultural Development Institute INDAP (from the Spanish \"Instituto de Desarrollo Agropecuario\"), a fully furnished building was constructed in 1971 in Viña del Mar, and it was named the \"Jose Miguel Carrera\" branch campus, following the testamentary vision of the University founder, the philanthropist Federico Santa María.\n\nThis branch is located on the border between the communes of Vina del Mar and Quilpué in Chile.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, the University planned to install six schools in different parts of the country.\n\nIn October 1965, the Kings of Belgium, Baudouin I and Fabiola de Mora y Aragon visited the University headquarters in Valparaíso, were introduced to its educational project and as a result initiated conversations for the construction of a branch campus in the city of Concepción.\n\nMeanwhile, our country strengthens their contributions: the government facilitates the exchange of funds provided by Belgium; local businesses such as the San Pedro Sawmills, Cementos Bio Bio, Pacific Steel Company, Fanaloza, Inchalam, Pizarreño, Glasses Lirquén, among others, also contributed in its construction. Additionally, a donation of Archbishop of Concepción provided the land needed for the building construction. Its construction began in 1969.\n\nAcademic activities started on April 26, 1971, offering the careers of Electronics, Electrical, Structural Mechanics, Maintenance Mechanics, and Chemistry. On February 14, 1972, the campus branch was inaugurated solemnly in the presence of the President of Chile, Salvador Allende Gossens, and the University rector, Jaime Chiang Acosta.\n\nFor 10 consecutive years, UTFSM has been ranked among the three best Universities in Chile in terms of quality perception given by more than 1000 important national business executives. In 2012, the University was ranked 5 between 9.500 schools of engineering in the world according to their impact factor in the last 5 years (Microsoft Academics), as the latinoamerican university with the largest normalized impact factor, and as the first school of engineering in South America. According to Times Higher Education Ranking 2014, UTFSM is among the first 300 best Universities in the World, 2nd in South America and 1st in Chile. The UTFSM has consistently been considered as one of the best engineering universities in Latin America, and appears regularly as a highly ranked university in many of the published world university rankings.\n\n\n\n\nThe current president of the UTFSM Academic Council is Mr. Roberto Medina Cantariño. The following table summarizes the different presidents the UTFSM has had in its history.\nThe current rector is Professor Darcy Fuenzalida O'Shee, for the Period 2014 - 2018. Some notable events:\nDue to the focused nature of the university, its organisation currently does not include different faculties, only different academic departments, which carry out research and graduate/undergraduate educational programs. Originally, faculties had been considered in the University organization, with the founding of the first three faculties in 1944, Chemical, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Faculties were subsequently abolished under Adolfo Arata's period as rector.\n\nWithin the Chilean campus level, there are 17 different academic departments, though not all of them are in every campus location, and not all degree levels are offered at every location, as the following table shows:\n\nUTFSM is the only Chilean engineering school where sports is an obligatory course in the curriculum during the first three semesters of all its study lines at its Valparaiso and Santiago Campuses.\n\nThe university offers careers of Commercial Pilot and Aeronautical Engineering in its Academia de Ciencias Aeronáuticas in a joint venture with Chilean airline Lan Chile.\n\nThe university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. The undergraduate degrees can be of 12 academic semesters (engineering), 10 semesters (engineering, pure sciences and architecture), 8 semesters (Applied Engineering) and 6 semesters (technical careers). The graduate degrees (Masters and Doctorate) have a structure that can be described as follows: 2 years for masters of science and 3 to 5 years for Doctorate degrees.\n\nThe engineering degrees at UTFSM (and throughout Chile) are offered in different degrees of difficulty. The highest degree corresponds to 12 academic semesters.\n\nTo differentiate it from the engineering studies of 10 semesters, the degree has the suffix of \"Civil\". For example, the degree for 12 academic semester in chemical engineering has the title of \"Ingeniero Civil Químico\", while the degree of 10 semesters has the title of \"Ingeniero Químico\".The following Bachelor Engineering degrees are granted by this University:\nThe following Masters of Science are granted by this University:\nThe following PhD Degrees are granted by this University:\n\nThe Chemical Engineering School at UTFSM was founded together with the foundation of the School of Engineers in 1935, being one of the oldest degrees offered by the university. The first Chilean and Latin American doctorate degree in chemical engineering was given to Walter Gaete Castro in 1962, with a cooperation between UTFSM and University of Pittsburgh, USA. Nowadays, the chemical engineering department has the name of Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering (\"IQA\", in Spanish), where Chemical Engineering and Environmental Engineering degrees are offered. The research topics at IQA are:\n\n\nThe Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering has 12 associate professors, 11 with PhD degrees (92%). The department offers the graduate programs of Master of Science and PhD in Chemical Engineering.\n\nThe Mechanical Engineering School at UTFSM was founded together with the foundation of the School of Engineers in 1935, being one of the oldest degrees offered by the university. Its first four mechanical engineers graduated in 1939. The mechanical engineering department was also among the first to offer a PhD program in 1964 (along with Chemical and Electrical Engineering Departments).\n\nThe mechanical engineering department has the following research areas:\nThe department has 20 full-time professors (2016 data), 17 with PhD degrees (85%). Additional to the Bachelor of Sciences in mechanical engineering (BSc.), the department offers the graduate programs of Master of Science (BSc.) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in mechanical engineering. The department has also made substantive efforts to connect with its alumni. A comprehensive list of the graduates of the department can be found online.\n\nThe UTFSM graduate school started its activities on the 1st of August, 1960, as a response to the increasing requirements for deeper and applied research in the country. The project was directed by Leroy Stutzman of the University of Pittsburgh, and doctors G.R. Fitterer and John F. Calver, who audited study programs and teaching methods for the project. The first director of the UTFSM graduate school was Herbert Appel, during the period 1960-1964. The school initially offered PhD study lines in chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. The first UTFSM PhD graduate was Walter Gaete Castro, with a PhD degree in chemical engineering, becoming the first PhD graduate in Latin America.\n\nSince 2010 UTFSM has been awarded with nearly US$8 million for 76 research projects. Many of these projects involve national and international collaborations with prestigious institutions in Latin America (ANDES Laboratory Project, RIABIN Biotechnology Network), Europe (CERN, Max Planck Institut, Politecnico di Milano), and USA (MIT, SLAC), among others.\n\nThe Federico Santa Maria University radio was created on the 7th of April, 1937, and it is the oldest university radio in Latin America. It can be heard on 1450 kHz in the AM spectrum, on 99.7 MHz in the FM spectrum, and online.\n\nThe Chamber Choir of the Federico Santa María Technical University was founded on August 4, 1951 in its Valparaiso Campus. During the choir's over 60 years of existence, it has interpreted an extensive repertoire, including all manifestations of choral western music, from the Middle Ages to the present day. The choir's first performance was at the closing ceremony of the academic year in December 1951, in the Aula Magna, main hall of events in the \"A\" building of the University's Main Valparaíso campus.\n\nDemosthenes Penna, engineering student of this campus, was its founder and first director until 1954. From March 1955, the choir was directed by Silvio Olate for over 28 years until March 1983. From 1983 to 1987, it was directed by Mauricio Pergelier. For the next 23 years, from 1987 to 2010, the choir was conducted by Eduardo Silva Cerda. From 2010, the choir has been conducted by Felipe Molina.\n\nThe Guayaquil campus in Ecuador also has formed a Choir in 2015, directed by Charles Sampertegui.\n\nThe university has a long history of musical expression, in particular through its folkloric ensemble \"Alimapu\"\n\nDifferent organizations, denominated AEXA (from the Spanish \"Asociacion de EX Alumnos\") have been created at several of the UTFSM campuses:\nThese organization are created and managed by the alumni themselves, and coordinate their action with the university through the UTFSM Alumni Network office.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4298096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4298096", "title": "Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff", "text": "Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Erdmannsdorff (18 May 1736 – 9 March 1800) was a German architect and architectural theoretician, and one of the most significant representatives of early German Neoclassicism during the Age of Enlightenment. His work included Wörlitz Palace in the present-day Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm, one of the earliest Palladian buildings on the European continent. His most well-known student was Friedrich Gilly, the teacher of Karl Friedrich Schinkel.\n\nErdmannsdorff was born in Dresden to the Saxon courtier, Baron Ernst Ferdinand von Erdmannsdorff, and his wife Henriette Margarethe, née von Heßler.\n\nAfter early stages of education with Jakob Mauvillon in Leipzig and at the Dresden knight academy from 1750 to 1754, Erdmannsdorff attended the University of Wittenberg in 1754–1758, where he encountered Prince Franz von Anhalt-Dessau, whose service he entered in 1758. His later fame is due his works for the prince in his Wörlitz pleasureground near the Dessau residence. At the age of twenty three Erdmannsdorff become a Freemason and was initiated at the illustrious \"Minerva Zu Den Drei Palmen\" (Minerva to the three palm trees) lodge on 23 August 1759.\n\nIn accordance with the educational ideals of the Enlightenment, the prince had the aim of reorganising his surrounding lands into a cohesive 'Garden Realm' (\"Gartenreich\") in the style of an English landscape garden. In addition to the beautification of the landscape, cottages of various architectural styles, antique temples, bridges and memorials were to be erected and to be made accessible to everyone. Franz employed his friend and architect Erdmannsdorff to design the architectural arrangement of the grounds.\n\nBetween 1761 and 1775 on several grand tours to Italy, Holland, England, France and Switzerland, Erdmannsdorff gathered ideas for the architectural arrangement of the Wörlitz grounds. Accompanying the Prince, he got to know the style of the Scottish architects Robert and James Adam (the \"Adams Style\"). At the same time he was impressed by the architect William Chambers. In Rome Erdmannsdorff made the acquaintance of the archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann and the painter Charles Louis Clérisseau, and contacted the master builder Giovanni Battista Piranesi and painter Jakob Philipp Hackert.\n\nThe contemporary art and culture of England made a particular impression on Erdmannsdorff as well as Prince Franz. The Palladian architecture in England, inspired by the Palladian Villas of the 16th century, can be seen replicated in Erdmannsdorff's later creations and was the strongest influence on his work next to the architecture and interior design of ancient Rome. In this artistic context he designed, amongst others, Wörlitz Palace, built from 1769 to 1773 for Prince Franz and his consort Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt.\n\nAlthough Erdmannsdorff favoured this particular architectural style, he also created buildings in the Neo-Gothic style preferred by Prince Franz. Among others, he converted the influences he had received on his trip to England into the building of the \"Gothic House\" in the Wörlitz Grounds.\n\nDuring his time in Anhalt-Dessau, Erdmannsdorff married Wilhelmine von Ahlimb in 1781, with whom he had two daughters.\n\nIn 1786 King Frederick William II of Prussia called on his services to redecorate the bedroom and study of his predecessor, Frederick the Great, in Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, as well a number of rooms in the Berliner Stadtschloss (Berlin City Palace). Consequently, the first consistently classical interior of the Potsdam and Berlin palaces was built to Erdmannsdorff's specifications. During his stay in Berlin and Potsdam which lasted until 1789, he became an honorary member of the 'Royal Academy of Arts and Mechanical Sciences' in Berlin. Apart from this work he was above all active as a consultant in the areas of art, culture and education in Brandenburg.\n\nBetween 1789 and 1790, Erdmannsdorff stayed again in Italy. In Rome he made the acquaintance of the painters Angelica Kauffman and Jakob Phillipp Hackert, as well as the sculptors Alexander Trippel, Antonio Canova and Bartolomeo Cavaceppi. After a trip to Weimar in 1791 with Prince Franz, he visited the courts of Gotha, Kassel and Karlsruhe. In 1796 he took over the artistic direction of the \"Chalkographische Gesellschaft\" in Dessau, founded in 1795, whose goal was to popularise artistic works through etchings. At this time he also worked as a lecturer at the Berlin School of Architecture, where he taught Friedrich Gilly among others.\n\nErdmannsdorff died in Dessau at the age of 64. His grave can be found at the New Graveyard (\"Neuer Begräbnisplatz\", today known as Historical Cemetery I) in Dessau.\n\nas well as a number of other garden follies.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25494160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25494160", "title": "Graduate real estate education", "text": "Graduate real estate education\n\nThe study of real estate development at the graduate school level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down to choosing between a traditional degree with a focus on real estate (e.g., MBA with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) focused wholly on real estate studies.\n\nStudents who opt to study in a full-time Master of Real Estate program, should expect to take courses in topics such as financial analysis, market analysis, contracts and deal-making, construction, design fundamentals, asset (property) management, construction management, building technology and design fundamentals. Some programs offer studio, capstone, or workshop courses in which students engage actual real estate development projects. Some also provide access to internships. There is no established accreditation system in the United States in real estate development education, so students should investigate offerings in each program.\n\nWhile there are many real estate \"finance\" programs available to students around the country, there are only a handful of real estate development graduate programs that tackle the broader educational task of engaging the full range of real estate development (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) --from property acquisition to planning and permitting, law and finance, design and construction, and culminating in marketing, commercial leasing, property, portfolio and asset management.\n\nHistorically, graduate level coursework in real estate was limited to a major or minor in business, or training in architecture and urban planning schools. While Business school programs might emphasize the business side of real estate, MBA students typically lack adequate understanding of real estate principles and processes. Over the last several decades, the real estate industry has matured to one with great complexity and an increasingly institutional ownership structure. The increased complexity of the industry created a demand for practitioners who possessed a comprehensive knowledge of real estate beyond that of traditional MBA generalists. One and two-year graduate level real estate degree programs originated with the founding of the New York University Real Estate Institute in (1967) (now known as the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate) and in 1983 with the formation of the MIT Center for Real Estate. Soon after, other schools followed with Harvard University (1983) Texas A&M University (1984), Columbia University (1985), the University of Southern California (1986), Johns Hopkins University (1989), and Cornell University (1996) all forming professional graduate programs focused solely on real estate education.\n\nAccording to the Urban Land Institute, during the mid-1990s strong academic interest in real estate \"was never greater, whether for repositioning products, redeveloping inner cities, or developing more affordable housing. Students seemed to be acting on the notion that it's a temporary downturn and graduate school is a good place for the moment.\" As enrollment grew, real estate programs responded by adding more course offerings to satisfy the demand..\n\nIn the early 2000s, prior to the Great Recession, the industry again acknowledged increasing need for graduates with superior qualifications — providing the research-based expertise necessary to solve complex problems in contemporary real estate development..\n\nThe late 2000s saw significant expansion of real estate programs to second-tier universities such as George Mason University, as well as additional coursework added by MBA programs that commonly did not have an emphasis on real estate. To deal with the complexity of the field and its far-reaching effects, today's industry professionals require advanced training to prepare them to operate in increasingly technical and interrelated areas..\n\nAs education needs have changed, business schools such as the University of Wisconsin, University of Pennsylvania, and University of California, Berkeley continue to cater to students interested in the flexibility of an MBA. Wharton's real estate program, for example, takes advantage of being housed in one of the top business schools in the United States and having some of the top real estate professionals in the world as advisers.\n\nRankings for graduate level education are not specifically formal as other professional disciplines. MBA programs with concentrations in real estate may be ranked according to organizations such as \"U.S. News & World Report\" or \"Business Week\", but are not relative to the depth of the real estate industry studied in an MBA concentration compared with a specialized master's degree in real estate or real estate development. Real estate education has increased in recent years to fill the demand for well-educated practitioners in the industry. However, there has been a great deal of debate on what elements should be an essential part of a graduate program in order to help students succeed in the industry. Rankings have been conducted by editorial board representation of faculty members at university real estate departments, however, these results prove to be ineffective in judging the program as a whole. Many graduate programs utilize adjunct professors or guest speakers from the industry, which do not sit on editorial boards of scholarly real estate journals.\n\nCurrently there are no rankings of graduate degree programs in real estate development. The best method to evaluate the various degree programs is through due diligence by individual applicants, including a review of each program's curriculum and how it applies to the students academic and career goals. While there are no formal rankings for graduate real estate education, and programs are subject to greater locational impact factors than are MBA programs (due to regional and local policy influence).\n\nA separate metric to evaluate the success of graduate real estate programs is the review of past winners in the Urban Land Institute Gerald D. Hines Student Competition. The Urban Land Institute is a non-profit research and education organization with membership by real estate developers, urban planners, architects and allied professionals. Each year graduate-level students form their own multidisciplinary teams (from real estate, urban planning and business schools) and have two weeks to devise a comprehensive design and development program for a real, large-scale site full of challenges and opportunities. Submissions will consist of boards that include drawings, site plans, tables, and a myriad of market-feasible financial data.\n\nMultidisciplinary teams are not limited to including students from real estate development graduate programs. Students may also come from Master of Landscape Architecture, Master of Architecture, Master of Urban Planning, Master of Urban Design or MBA.\n\nAn additional measure of the reputations of graduate real estate programs is the ARGUS Software University Challenge, which has been held in 2009, 2011 and every year thereafter. In the challenge, participating teams from universities around the world are required to simulate a comprehensive real-life development analysis of a fictitious commercial real estate project by modeling the provided assumptions specifically using ARGUS software. Team submissions are judged by a panel of industry and academic professionals. The winning teams receive cash prizes.\n\nThe Kellogg Real Estate Conference and Venture Competition is hosted by the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research and the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative. The Conference will provide industry and research updates and relevant market information. The Venture Competition showcases MBA students, who have the opportunity to pitch to a high-profile panel of judges. The winning team not only receives $100,000 in cash and prizes, but also the opportunity to secure as much as $10,000,000 in equity funding. The primary purpose of the competition is to encourage entrepreneurial real estate ventures. The event also serves as an opportunity to promote top student talent before prominent industry professionals.\n\nThe National Real Estate Challenge, a 20 team invitation-only real estate case competition hosted annually by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, is yet another metric to compare graduate real estate programs. The competition tests teams from universities across the United States on issues regarding real estate finance and private equity. The event is sponsored by firms such as JP Morgan, Equity Office Properties, and Hines. The 19 universities that competed in 2014 included: Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, Michigan, MIT, Northwestern, NYU, Rice, UCLA, UNC-Chapel Hill, USC, UT, Vanderbilt, Wharton, Wisconsin and Yale.\n\nArguably the most prestigious competition to gauge the quality of graduate real estate programs in the world, the CASE is an annual real estate competition that provides current graduate student teams from the world's top universities an opportunity to compete against one another, showcase their knowledge, and learn from each other through the analysis of a complex real world development site. The CASE is organized and hosted by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate.\n\nUnlike other master's degree competitions, The CASE focuses on real estate acquisition, development programming and financial underwriting at the asset level. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that students interested in real estate finance, acquisitions and development are likely to encounter after graduation. Past finalists included: Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT, Cornell, Wharton at UPenn, London Business School, Cambridge and Hong Kong Institute of Technology.\n\nAs with many MBA programs, undergraduate real estate education is commonly offered as a concentration, or focused area of study. Very few universities with varying academic reputation offer a bachelor's degree with a concentration in real estate (typically two courses during the senior year). An undergraduate degree in real estate is not a prerequisite for admission to a graduate real estate development program. Students from diverse backgrounds in geography, urban planning, business, economics, liberal arts, architecture or seeking a career change are encouraged to apply.\n\nThere are twenty-one multi-disciplinary real estate programs which focus on the academic study of real estate primarily, the Master of Real Estate Development, while the majority of the other programs typically housed as part of a business school offer a more focused degree on finance and investment. Graduate real estate programs may award any number of degrees (e.g. Master of Real Estate Development, Master of Science in Real Estate, Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate, Master of Design Studies in Real Estate), however, the key is to review each degree curricula independent of their respective naming conventions, as there are broad differences in their content and foci that may not necessarily be reflected in the degree's name.\n\nTwo examples of graduate real estate degree naming conventions include:\n\nThe Master of Real Estate Development degree (MRED) (or sometimes called the Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED)) largely focuses on specific areas within real estate rather than taking a more generalist approach. Areas of concentration may include: real estate development, finance and investment, planning and policy, infrastructure and construction, market analysis, and real estate law. Students are generally exposed to the full range of functions and most real estate product types (e.g. residential, retail, office, hospitality, and industrial). MRED programs typically teach the subject matter through case studies and field experiences and by way of traditional class lectures. Whether in the context of urban redevelopment, historic preservation, or suburban growth, MRED students learn from both the investor's and developer's perspective, the importance of relevant issues in law, economics, finance, market analysis, negotiation, lease analysis, architecture, planning, and management. Many focus on the entire spectrum of the real estate development process-from dirt-to-deal, finance to façade-and include industry topics presented by leading local and national developers, financiers, and other players in the market. Included in this is the analysis of existing real estate assets and partnership structures.\n\nThe Master of Science in Real Estate degree (MSRE) often combines learning comprehensive business management skills with the understanding of how real estate markets work. Graduate programs that award a Master of Science in Real Estate degree are sometimes the expansion of real estate courses in a Business school into a degree of increased specialty or they are organically formed real estate centers within a larger college. Students who complete Master of Science in Real Estate degrees oftentimes go on to careers as real estate \"project managers, asset management advisors, analysts, planners, and others.\" Most Master of Science in Real Estate degrees are completed in one year though two year options with the opportunity to complete a summer internship between the first and second year are available (e.g. the University of Washington) The Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate is also similarly found here, as it is simply a naming convention at Georgetown University and Cornell University.\n\nThe course work in real estate programs varies among universities. Many programs utilize HBS-style case studies of complex real estate scenarios to heighten the student's knowledge and strategic decision-making skills. Program lengths range from 30 to 72 credit hours. Programs that have more than 33 hours will sometimes allow its students to add a concentration. A required core curriculum is typical with the core curriculum's size and makeup being largely dependent on the length and focus of the program.\n\nExample core curriculum:\n\nIn addition to the core curriculum, most two-year programs and some one-year programs offer students the opportunity to pursue a concentration, a focus on a specialized area of interest within the real estate industry. Concentrations differ between programs and universities.\n\nExample areas of concentration:\n\nSome programs, such as the MS in Real Estate Development at George Mason University, offer students the opportunity to combine elective coursework from several disciplines including business management, public policy and civil engineering.\n\nThe practice of real estate development requires practitioners to work with selecting building types and designs, determining appropriate dimensions, programming internal spaces, shaping the site, and appropriately fitting the project to surrounding contexts. Some programs, including Harvard University's Master of Design and Columbia University's MSRED include design education in the study of real estate development. A new program established at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2015 emphasizes a capstone studio-workshop in which a multidisciplinary group of students under faculty supervision engage an actual real estate development problem for organizations acting as clients.\n\nExecutive degree programs in real estate offer practicing professionals the opportunity to learn while they are working. These programs are distinguished from distance programs through their uniquely blended model of residency classroom experience, distance education modules, and executive field study courses. Classes meet at the beginning of every semester, usually from five to seven days, and then complete the coursework through synchronous webinars, asynchronous discussion boards, and video lectures. Executive education in real estate is taught at numerous accredited institutions such as Auburn University.\n\nA number of universities around the world offer graduate degrees in real estate and related subjects. See the list in Graduate real estate programs outside the United States.\n\nReal estate programs and alumni donors sponsor research by real estate faculty in numerous areas of real estate including the economics of property markets, the impacts of regulation, and the sources of equity and debt financing. Additional research, in the form of faculty-supervised student thesis work, contributes to a growing inventory of new information. The research program is essential to promoting new knowledge, advancing teaching techniques, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Not all graduate real estate programs conduct research.\n\nProfessionals in real estate often hold degrees in related fields such as city planning, construction management, accounting, property management, architecture or law. One of the most common programs continues to be a Master of City Planning, regional planning, or urban planning degree with a real estate emphasis. Planning programs tend to emphasize land use planning, transportation or infrastructure development, land use law and policy and other planning topics; students who take a concentration in real estate development will learn how it relates to planning.\n\nBusiness degrees with real estate concentrations generally provide students with the opportunity to pursue a general management degree, but to specialize in real estate development or some segment of the real estate industry through a sequence or group of electives. For a long time, those wishing to study real estate had to content themselves with primarily pursuing a Master of Business Administration degree, perhaps with the option of concentration in real estate, and usually with a focus in finance. These MBA programs typically only include one or two courses focused in real estate. Many MBA programs do not specialize in real estate.\n\nFor those weighing an MBA versus graduate real estate education, there are some issues to consider:\n\nA limited number of MBA programs offer courses in real estate as part of the typical study in business.\n\nLoyola University of New Orleans offers a Real Estate Investment Course as an elective.\n\nA sample of careers include large public real estate companies; small private entrepreneurial organizations; regional investors; companies that specialize in a single product (e.g. office/retail/multi-family); non-profits involved in areas such as affordable housing; corporations that own real estate; companies that finance real estate; and companies that provide services such as design and architecture firms, brokerage companies, investment banks, REITs, and various consultancies. Careers in the public sector at the city, county, state, federal or military level offer interesting and rewarding career opportunities related to real estate. The skill sets are also transferable to other industries and sectors of the economy.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1871 as the Hungarian Royal Drawing School \"(Magyar Királyi Mintarajztanoda)\" and has been called University of Fine Arts since 2001.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, Hungarian artists were learning fine arts in Western European academies. The National Society of Hungarian Fine Arts (Országos Magyar Képzőművészeti Társulat) founded in 1861 was initiating the establishment of a Hungarian school of fine arts. Owing to this movement the Hungarian Royal Drawing School and Art Teachers’ College \"(Magyar Királyi Mintarajztanoda és Rajztanárképezde)\" was opened in 1871. The present-day building of the university was built in 1877, designed by Alajos Rauscher and Adolf Lang.\n\nIn later decades, the school developed programs for training not only painters and sculptors, but artist-craftsmen, mosaic- and gobelin-makers, stage designers, costumers, and restorers. Numerous prominent Hungarian artists taught there, including the painters Károly Ferenczy, János Vaszary, Viktor Olgyai, Róbert Berény, Aurél Bernáth, Jenő Barcsay, and Márta Lacza; sculptor Béni Ferenczy and other notable artists.\n\n\n\nBarcsay-hall (Barcsay-terem) is the biggest gallery to exhibit the student's and foreign's artworks.

It is charged with caring for the educational, pastoral, social and extracurricular needs of the undergraduate students of the Faculty of Medicine of Imperial College London, and is a constituent union of Imperial College Union.\n\nFormed in 1997 by the mergers of the Students' Unions of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School (formerly Charing Cross Hospital Medical School and Westminster Hospital Medical School) and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School.\n\nRivalry was abundant before and during the years or mergers. The 1954 film Doctor in the House was reportedly based on the behaviour of the St Mary's students.\n\nThe Union has one full-time sabbatical president supported by 16 student officers, each covering an area such as entertainments, education, welfare, clubs & societies, alumni & careers, or sites & services. The president is also the British Medical Association ISC Chair, as well as a delegate to Medgroup.\n\nThe three academic officers, along with the respective year representatives, look after the 6-year MBBS/BSc Course, the 5-year graduate entry MBBS course, and all students undertaking BSc courses.\n\nICSMSU runs a highly successful \"Mums and Dads\" programme which aims to match up new students with older students on the same course.\n\nThere are currently over 40 student-run clubs and societies especially for the members of ICSM. Many of the bigger clubs can trace their history back to the original hospital medical schools. Most of the clubs compete in the United Hospitals competitions, or send players to the combined teams. Notable clubs and societies include Imperial Medicals Rugby Club, ICSM Boat Club, ICSM Water Polo, and ICSM Light Opera.\n\nICSM also has a strong sporting ethos inherited from its predecessors. It enjoys frequent success against the other London medical schools in the United Hospitals and National Association of Medics' Sports competitions and in the BUCS league.\n\nWhile medical students may join ICU sports clubs (and non-medical students may join the medical clubs and societies), most prefer to participate in ICSM sports teams which, depending on the sport, may compete against Imperial College or other Imperial faculty teams such as the Royal School of Mines, such as in the annual Varsity competition, which involves teams from ICSM and IC. The competition culminates in the J.P.R. Williams Cup, named after the highly successful Welsh rugby player and doctor J.P.R. Williams, who graduated from St Mary's Hospital, London in 1973, with the 1st XVs of Imperial Medicals Rugby Club and ICU Rugby playing each other in front of a 1,500 strong crowd.\n\nSir Roger Bannister, another St Mary's Hospital Medical School alumnus gives his name to the trophy for the annual varsity athletics meet.\n\nICSMBC was formed in 1997 by merging the Medical School Rowing Clubs from St Mary's Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital and Westminster Boat Club. They row out of the University of London Boat Club boat house which is situated on the River Thames in Chiswick and train at ICBC boathouse in Putney. The current captain of ICSMBC is Luke Reader Predominantly the Club rows in United Hospital events, and is part of the United Hospital Boat Clubs, though they also take part in races through British Rowing such as Head of the River.\n\nImperial College School of Medicine Water Polo is the water polo team of Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. It came about pursuant to a merger of the Charing Cross Hospital, Westminster Hospital, and St Mary's Hospital water polo clubs.\n\nThe club in its modern form was founded in 1997 following the merger of the St. Mary's Hospital Water Polo Club with the Charing Cross and Westminster Hospitals Water Polo Club.\n\nIn 2008 the club agreed a joint venture into the BUCS league with the Imperial College Swimming and Water Polo Club. This brought immediate success with the Imperial College/Medicals side being crowned Tier Two Champions in 2009/10, and thus securing promotion to the Premier Tier for the 2010/11 season. The joint BUCS team performed strongly again in the 2012/13 season finishing third in the Premier Tier.\n\nThe club focuses its efforts on the London Universities Sports League (LUSL), formerly known as the ULU League, in which it enters a mixed gender team and plays weekly matches against other London universities. The Varsity match against the Imperial College water polo team is played annually in March.\n\nThe origin of the medical school's musical theatre society is a 1943 production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Trial by Jury\" by students at St Mary's. Despite a trend towards more modern musicals, the name was maintained during the 1997 merger to honour the society's history, which includes performances attended by then HRH Princess Elizabeth in 1945, HRH Princess Margaret in 1957, and HRH Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1981.\n\nEach year, Light Opera performs its main show in December and a so-called '24-Hour Opera' in April or May, hosts multiple 'Big Chill' open mic nights, and participates in other showcases. The 24-Hour Opera is a musical chosen, planned, and auditioned without revealing the show's identity. It is announced to the cast, crew, and public on one evening and performed the next; all proceeds are donated to charity.\n\nThe society maintains strong social traditions and also provides academic support for its numerous members. A significant proportion of the ICSMSU executive committee tend to be part of Light Opera.\n\nICSMSU runs a full social calendar, including long-standing events and traditions from the original medical schools. This includes Freshers' Fortnight, Shrove Tuesday Final Year Dinner, ICSM Summer Ball, Sports Dinner, RAG and Vision.\n\nThe main facilities for the medical students of ICSM are found in the Reynolds Building on the Charing Cross Hospital campus. Here you can find the Reynolds Bar, as well as meeting rooms, offices, two gyms, a dance studio and club storage rooms.\n\nICSM is housed in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building on the South Kensington Campus. Here ICSMSU has a suite of offices for use of the President and SU and club officers, as well as meeting rooms and a common room.\n\nICSMSU are responsible for the upkeep of the student facilities on all other teaching hospital sites, including Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and St Mary's Hospital, London.\n\n2004 saw the first set of ICSM doctors graduate, and so the ICSM Alumni Association was founded.

{"id": "3435226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3435226", "title": "Intelligent design in politics", "text": "Intelligent design in politics\n\nThe intelligent design movement has conducted an organized campaign largely in the United States that promotes a pseudoscientific, neo-creationist religious agenda calling for broad social, academic and political changes centering on intelligent design.\n\nThough creationism and intelligent design are not supported by any mainstream scientists, there are significant minorities in the general public in most developed countries that say they doubt or reject the theory of evolution, likely because of their religious beliefs. In underdeveloped countries where rates of religious belief are much higher, support of evolution is consequently lower.\n\nIn Europe, religion generally has much less influence on politics than in the United States or the developing world. Despite this, there are pockets of creationist and intelligent design activity.\n\nThe Council of Europe's Committee on Culture, Science and Education released a report in June 2007 entitled \"The Dangers of Creationism in Education\". One of the council members, Anne Brasseur said that the aim of the report was to anchor evolution in school curricula, and warned that there was still resistance in many European countries. She provided the following examples in an interview with German newspaper \"Der Spiegel\":\n\nUnlike in the United States the issue has never been the subject of a major Supreme Court case, nor does it figure prominently in the national media.\n\nIn Canada, education is the constitutional responsibility of the provinces. No province has taught creationism in its official public school curriculum in modern times, however, there are various different approaches to the teaching of evolution and religion across the country, as well as various exceptions for separate schools (publicly funded religious school, primarily Catholic), private schools, alternative schools, Reserve schools, charter schools, and so on. In most provincial curricula (excluding Quebec, where it has been mandatory in elementary schools since 2004) evolutionary theory is only required in Grade 11 or 12; however, it can be taught earlier at the discretion of local school boards and teachers.\n\nAround 63,000 Canadian children attend \"Christian\" (primarily evangelical) schools outside of the provincial systems (which include both the public [secular] and Catholic schools), where they are generally taught creationism rather than evolution.\n\nIn 2006, the ministry of education in Quebec ordered unlicensed private evangelical Christian schools to start teaching evolution and sexual education, otherwise the schools would be closed. In Ontario, private schools are not required to teach either evolution or sex education.\n\nIn 2009, the government under the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta introduced Bill 44 which allows parents to pull their children out of public school classrooms if they disagree with the controversial subject matter being discussed (such as evolution or homosexuality). Later amendments to the bill clarified that parents could choose to pull their children from religion classes, but not from science classes.\n\nA number of specific political strategies and tactics have been employed by intelligent design proponents. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with intelligent design proponents. The Discovery Institute has been driving force in most cases, providing a range of support from material assistance to federal, state and regional elected representatives in the drafting of bills to supporting and advising individual parents confronting their school boards.\n\nA feature of the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns has been extensive lobbying and public relations campaigns conducted on behalf of intelligent design proponents in order to overcome professional setbacks such as that of Guillermo Gonzalez, Richard Sternberg and Francis Beckwith. These efforts are focused on two efforts: the Teach the Controversy and Critical Analysis of Evolution campaigns. These campaigns gained prominence after the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial where Judge John E. Jones III ruled that teaching intelligent design or presenting it as an alternative to evolution was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because intelligent design is not legitimate science but essentially religious in nature.\n\nBoth the Teach the Controversy and Critical Analysis of Evolution strategies and resources for them come from the Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture, the hub of the intelligent design movement. These strategies are seen as another iteration of the Discovery Institute's campaign to \"defeat [the] materialist world view\" represented by the theory of evolution in favor of \"a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions\". According to the Center for Science and Culture's weblog, at least 10 state legislatures are now considering legislation reconsidering how evolution is taught. Many of these initiatives benefit from significant legal assistance from a number of conservative legal foundations including the Thomas More Law Center, the Alliance Defense Fund, and Quality Science Education for All (QSEA). All have litigated extensively on behalf of the movement.\n\nIn 1999 the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete references to evolution from Kansas science standards. This had the net effect of removing the teaching of evolution from the state's science curriculum. The move angered the mainstream science community which predicted a resulting loss of rigor and quality in science education. The Board's decision was in part influenced by the presence of recently elected conservative Christians to the board and heavy lobbying by the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, then known as the \"Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture\" (CRSC). Subsequent elections altered the membership of the school board and led to renewed backing for evolution instruction in 2001.\n\nElections in 2004 gave religious conservatives a contentious 6-4 majority. The board in 2005 was finalizing new science standards which would have guided teachers about how and what to teach students. A proposal advanced by conservatives and intelligent design proponents, with support from the Center for Science and Culture, was similar to the Critical Analysis of Evolution plan for which the Center lobbied the Ohio Board of Education in 2002. It would not have eliminated evolution entirely from instruction, nor would it require intelligent design to be presented as an alternative to evolution, but the \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" plan treated evolution as a flawed theory, a position that defied mainstream scientific views.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, the Kansas Board of Education, chaired by veterinarian Steve Abrams, approved new science teaching standards that included the \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\". The Discovery Institute was key in the drafting and adoption of the new standards which were approved by 6 to 4, reflecting the makeup of religious conservatives on the board.\n\nCritics of the new Kansas standards noted that they promoted the teaching of intelligent design. Kansas standards previously supported evolutionary theory, which held that all life had a common origin. Creationists claimed that theory had been challenged by their interpretation of fossils and molecular biology. They had also echoed the standard intelligent design argument that there is a controversy as to whether changes over time in one species can lead to a new species.\n\nAfter the board of education decided to include more criticism of evolution in its school science standards, a University of Kansas professor, Paul Mirecki, proposed to teach a class called \"Special Topics in Religion: intelligent design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies.\" The class was cancelled and the professor was forced to resign as chairman of the university's religious studies department. Mirecki had alleged that he was also assaulted and beaten by creationists who opposed his teaching of the class\n\nIn primary election held on August 1, 2006, pro-creationist conservative Republicans lost their 6-4 board majority when incumbent Connie Morris from Cheyenne County, Kansas, was defeated by moderate Republican Sally Cauble, of Liberal, Kansas. Another slot which until then was held by a retiring conservative whose son-in-law from Idaho, Brad Patzer, ran for her office, was won by Jana Shaver, a pro-science Republican from Independence, Kansas.\n\nMorris had described evolution in a taxpayer-funded constituent newsletter as \"an age-old fairy tale\" and \"a nice bedtime story\" unsupported by science.\n\nThe fate of Education Commissioner and former Koch brothers Kansas Policy Institute director, Bob Corkins, was sealed by the ouster of the anti-evolutionists in 2006. He was an appointee of the board's creationists and endured strong criticism for his lack of previous educational leadership experience. Republican state Sen. John Vratil, characterized Corkins' hiring as education commissioner as \"sort of like making Saddam Hussein president of the United States.\" The executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, Paul Houston, had written a letter referring to Corkins as an \"amateur.\"\n\nIn 2000, the leading intelligent design proponents operating through the Discovery Institute held a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., to promote intelligent design to lawmakers. Sen. Rick Santorum was (and continues to be) one of intelligent design's most vocal supporters. One result of this briefing was that Sen. Santorum inserted pro-intelligent design language into the No Child Left Behind bill calling for students to be taught why evolution \"generates so much continuing controversy,\" an assertion heavily promoted by the Discovery Institute.\n\nThe Santorum Amendment was a failed proposed amendment to the 2001 education act No Child Left Behind of 2001. The inclusion of the amendment in the Act was heavily lobbied for by the Discovery Institute, which also participated in the drafting of the original language of the amendment. Although only a modified form of the amendment appeared in the conference report, the amendment itself was not included in the legislation that President George W. Bush signed.\n\nIt was not the victory intelligent design proponents had hoped for. Conference reports do not carry the weight of law and are merely explanatory in nature, and, in any case, the amendment failed. Nonetheless, an email newsletter by the Discovery Institute contained the sentence \"Undoubtedly this will change the face of the debate over the theories of evolution and intelligent design in America.  ... It also seems that the Darwinian monopoly on public science education, and perhaps the biological sciences in general, is ending\" and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas cited the amendment as vindicating the 1999 Kansas school board decision (since overturned) to eliminate evolution questions from State tests. Consistent with the Wedge strategy its inclusion in the conference report on the failed amendment continues to be incorrectly cited by the Discovery Institute and other intelligent design supporters as providing federal sanction for intelligent design. Reps. John Boehner and Steve Chabot of Ohio and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, along with Santorum, have signed letters supporting the Discovery Institute's interpretation of the Santorum amendment. One of those letters was sent to the president and vice-president of the Ohio Board of Education in 2002; the other was sent to the Texas Board of Education in 2003, see below.\n\nThis bill directs that the state shall not print or distribute any material containing claims known to be false or fraudulent. It also specifically provides for any citizen to be able to sue the state using the provisions of this bill.\n\nA bill proposed by Rep. Gosselin (House Bill 4382) which sought to amend 1976 PA 451, \"The revised school code\". The bill directed that In the science standards, all references to \"evolution\" and \"how species change through time\" would be modified to indicate that this is an unproven theory, by adding the phrase \"all students will explain the competing theories of evolution and natural selection based on random mutation and the theory that life is the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator.\" The bill also directed that in the science standards for middle and high school, all references to \"evolution\" and \"natural selection\" would be modified to indicate that these are unproven theories, by adding the phrase \"describe how life may be the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator.\" And in the science standards for middle and high school, the bill directed all references to \"evolution\" and \"natural selection\" would be modified to indicate that these are unproven theories, by adding the phrase \"explain the competing theories of evolution and natural selection based on random mutation and the theory that life is the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator.\" The bill also would have required that the recommended model core academic curriculum content standards that are developed and periodically updated by the state board comply with these provisions. Also under the bill the State Board would have been required to make these revisions as soon as practicable after the effective date of the bill, if it had been enacted.\nText of HB4382 (PDF)\n\nThis bill directed teachers to distinguish between \"philosophical materialism\" and \"authentic science\", and extended to teachers the \"right\" to present and critique any scientific theory of the origins or life or species. Failed in committee.\n\nAn \"equal-time\" bill, described in its title as \"Providing for the teaching of creation science and evolution science on an equal basis in the public schools.\" HB2554 was introduced in the state legislature in February 2001, and died in committee.\n\nIn February 2001 a parent filed a complaint with the Kanawha County Board of Education claiming that science textbooks used there contain \"false and fraudulent\" information about evolution. The parent and 30 cosigners opposed to evolution asserted that the textbooks are in violation of state law because they are outdated or inaccurate. As evidence that textbooks which include evolution are flawed, they cited Jonathan Well's of the Discovery Institute book \"Icons of Evolution\". The board rejected the claim.\n\nIn 2001 Representative Jim Holt proposed a bill in the Arkansas legislature that would make it illegal for the state or any of its agencies to use state funds to purchase materials that contained false or fraudulent claims. A list of such claims was provided in the text of House Bill 2548 (HB2548). Much of the text of the examples given was either quoted verbatim from anti-evolutionary sources or was a close paraphrase of such materials. The sources cited in the bill included the cartoon tract, \"Big Daddy?\" published by Jack Chick. Critics of the bill alleged that many of the \"examples\" selected were themselves either false or misleading. March 21, 2001, Representative Holt invited his friend and controversial anti-evolutionist Kent Hovind to testify before a committee of the Arkansas Legislature in support of the bill. In April 2001 a motion was passed to postpone HB 2548 indefinitely for study during the interim by the Joint Interim Committee on Education.\n\nHouse Bill 588 by Rep. Joe Balyeat, R-Bozeman, was presented as an \"objectivity in science education\" measure, and would have directed the approval of evolution and creationism materials by an appointed six-member committee. The bill failed in committee.\n\nIn July 2001 the Pennsylvania Board of Education gave final approval to revised science standards. Language in early versions of the standards sought to raise questions about the status of evolution as science and a theory. Science educators and other Pennsylvania citizens expressed concern that the proposed standards might open the way to teaching creationism in science classes because of ambiguous or unclear wording. However, the final standards do not contain the contested language and the standards were approved by the legislature.\n\nIn March 2002 Ohio held hearings on revising the state science standards. The Discovery Institute's Stephen C. Meyer proposed to the Ohio Board of Education the Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution that featured intelligent design prominently in its curricula.\nConcurrently, a factitious redefinition of science to include God was proposed to the Ohio legislature, so that the legislature would then be able to get behind the set of standards that included intelligent design. The Discovery Institute's model lesson plan was adopted in part by the state for Ohio science teachers in October 2002, though the Board advised that the science standards do \"not mandate the teaching or testing of intelligent design\". This was touted as a significant victory by the Discovery Institute.\n\nIn February 2006, the Ohio Board of Education voted 11-4 to delete the science standard and correlating lesson plan adopted in 2002. The board also rejected a competing plan from intelligent design proponents to request a legal opinion from the state attorney general on the constitutionality of the science standards. Intelligent design proponents pledged to force another vote on the issue.\n\nIn 2002 the Cobb County school board required stickers placed in a science textbook. Stating that evolution was \"a theory, not a fact,\" the sticker was placed in the ninth-grade biology text after parents complained to the Cobb County school board that alternative ideas about the origin of life were not presented. A group of parents represented by the American Civil Liberties Union sued the school board, claiming the stickers violate the separation of church and state. The trial was resolved in January 2005 when U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled the sticker was unconstitutional. In the verdict he wrote, \"By denigrating evolution, the school board appears to be endorsing the well-known prevailing alternative theory, creationism or variations thereof, even though the sticker does not specifically reference any alternative theories.\" In December 2005 the federal appeal court panel made comments sharply criticising the lower court ruling in advance of releasing their decision. Judge Ed Carnes said that the words on the sticker are \"technically accurate,\" and that \"From nonlife to life is the greatest gap in scientific theory. There is less evidence supporting it than there is for other theories. It sounds to me like evolution is more vulnerable and deserves more critical thinking,\" suggesting that he did not understand the distinction between evolution and abiogenesis. In December 2006 Cobb County School Board agreed to settle the long-running legal case. The county will not order the placement of \"any stickers, labels, stamps, inscriptions, or other warnings or disclaimers bearing language substantially similar to that used on the sticker that is the subject of this action.\"\n\nIn 2003 The Texas State Board of Education was considering 11 different textbooks for inclusion in the 2004-2005 school year. Fellows of the Discovery Institute testified to the Board that whatever textbooks are adopted should introduce statements on the \"weaknesses of the theory of evolution\" and include \"competing theories, such as intelligent design.\" The DI had strong interest in the Texas debate because the state is the second largest purchaser of textbooks in the country. Thus any changes publishers make to cater to the state would likely be seen elsewhere.\n\nThe Sternberg peer review controversy arose over whether an article published in a scientific journal that supported the controversial concept of intelligent design was properly peer reviewed. The journal's editor, Richard Sternberg, was an active proponent of intelligent design with ties to the Discovery Institute, and the article's author, Stephen C. Meyer, is an official of the Discovery Institute. The journal's publisher ultimately withdrew Meyer's article saying Sternberg published it outside of the normal review process, a statement Sternberg disputes.\n\nIn the course of his defense Sternberg claimed he was the subject of religious discrimination due to his belief in intelligent design by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, where he served as an unpaid research associate. Sternberg's claim is contradicted by John G. West, Vice President and Senior Fellow of the Discovery Institute and Associate Director of the Institute's Center for Science & Culture who wrote, \"The first misunderstanding is the belief that intelligent design is based on religion rather than science. Intelligent design is a scientific inference based on empirical evidence, not on religious texts.\" Despite West's clear rejection of Sternberg's claim, Republican representatives, other Discovery Institute affiliates and intelligent design advocates Mark Souder and Rick Santorum authored a report supporting Sternberg's claim of discrimination. The report was commissioned by Souder in his capacity as subcommittee chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform but published by Souder as an individual representative without it gaining any official standing by the Committee, which never formally accepted it.\n\nOn March 16, 2005, a bill, HB 1007, promoting \"intelligent design\" creationism was introduced in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and referred to the Education Committee. If enacted, HB 1007 would add a section (\"Teaching Theories on the Origin of Man and Earth\") to the Public School Code of 1949. That new section would allow school boards to add \"intelligent design\" to any curriculum containing evolution and allow teachers to use, subject to the approval of the board, \"supporting evidence deemed necessary for instruction on the theory of intelligent design.\" The term \"intelligent design\" is not defined in the bill. Presumably attempting to prevent a challenge to its constitutionality, HB 1007 explicitly states, \"When providing supporting evidence on the theory of intelligent design, no teacher in a public school may stress any particular denominational, sectarian or religious belief.\"\n\nIn June 2005 John G. West and Seth Cooper of the Discovery Institute wrote a letter to Pennsylvania Representative Jess M. Stairs urging Stairs and the Pennsylvania legislature not to pass HB1007. This reflects a shift in the strategy of the intelligent design proponents. Anticipating legal challenges to the constitutionality of laws that mandate teaching of intelligent design, proponents feel including intelligent design content in science curricula under the guise of \"scientific criticisms\" or \"evidence against evolution,\" within the pretense of \"teaching the controversy\" is a more defensible strategy.\n\nA series of hearings instigated by the Discovery Institute held in Topeka, Kansas May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education to review changes how the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were boycotted by the scientific community, and views expressed represented largely those of intelligent design advocates. The result of the hearings was the adoption of new science standards by the fundamentalist-dominated board in defiance of the State Board Science Hearing Committee that relied upon the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan and adopted the institute's Teach the Controversy approach. In August 2006 conservative Republicans lost their majority on the board in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board.\n\nOn the 13th of February, 2007, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum which removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science. In the words of Dr Bill Wagnon, the board chairman, \"Today the Kansas Board of Education returned its curriculum standards to mainstream science\". The new curriculum, as well as a document outlining the differences with the previous curriculum, has been posted on the Kansas State Department of Education's website.\n\nIn 2004 the Dover, Pennsylvania Board of Education passed a resolution requiring 9th grade biology teachers to read a statement that the Pennsylvania Academic Standards require the teaching of evolution, but then the statement proceeds to seed doubts about evolution's validity and directs students to study intelligent design and the intelligent design textbook Of Pandas and People as an alternative. Three of the school board members in the minority of the vote resigned in protest, and science teachers in the district refused to read the statement to their ninth-grade students, citing the Pennsylvania code of education, which states that teachers cannot present information they believe to be false. Instead, the statement was read to students by a school administrator.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of eleven parents contending that the school board policy violates the First Amendment. A hearing (Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District) in Federal District Court was scheduled for September 2005.\n\nThe school board claims there are \"gaps\" in evolution, which it emphasizes is a theory rather than established fact, and that students have a right to consider other views on the origins of life. The school board claims it does not teach intelligent design but simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution. It denies intelligent design is \"religion in disguise,\" despite being represented in court by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian nonprofit which says it uses litigation to promote \"the religious freedom of Christians and time-honored family values.\"\n\nThe Discovery Institute's John West said the case displayed the ACLU's \"Orwellian\" effort to stifle scientific discourse and objected to the issue being decided in court. \"\"It's a disturbing prospect that the outcome of this lawsuit could be that the court will try to tell scientists what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not,\" West said. \"That is a flagrant assault on free speech.\"\" Opponents, represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Association of Biology Teachers contend that his statement is not just ironic, but hypocritical, considering that the Discovery Institute not only tries to tell scientists and academics what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not (in disputing philosophical naturalism), but as a matter of policy seeks to redefine what constitutes legitimate science.\n\nIn May, 2005, the publisher of Of Pandas and People, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), filed a motion seeking to intervene in the case. FTE argued that a ruling that \"intelligent design\" was religious would have severe financial consequences, citing possible losses in the neighborhood of half a million dollars. By intervening, FTE would have become a co-defendant with the Dover Area School Board, and able to bring its own lawyers and expert witnesses to the case. FTE's president Jon Buell implied that if allowed to intervene, FTE would bring William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer as expert witnesses. In his decision on the motion, Judge John E. Jones III ruled that FTE was not entitled to intervene in the case because its motion to intervene was not timely, describing FTE's excuses for not trying to become involved earlier as \"both unavailing and disingenuous.\" Judge Jones also held that FTE failed to demonstrate that it has \"a significantly protectable interest in the litigation warranting intervention as a party\" and that its interests will not be adequately represented by the defendants.\n\nIn a November 2005 election the citizens of Dover voted out their pro-intelligent design schoolboard.\n\nOn December 20, 2005, U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III, in his 139-page ruling on Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, struck down the school board's policy requiring a statement be read endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in 9th grade high school biology classes. In his ruling Jones wrote that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature. In response the Discovery Institute accused Judge Jones of being an \"activist judge\".\n\nA 2006 proposal before the Ohio Board of Education drafted by Conservative Board member Colleen Grady, would create a \"template\" based on the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan for use by 10th-grade science teachers for classroom discussions evolution, global warming, stem-cell research and cloning.\n\nGrady's proposal was widely regarded as an attempt to circumvent the board's February 2006 vote to retract a controversial model lesson plan and to remove the indicator on which it was based from the standards; the indicator, which called for students to be able to \"describe how scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory,\" was generally criticized as providing a pretext for instilling scientifically unwarranted doubts about evolution.\n\nCritics have noted that Grady's proposal will allow for the introduction of intelligent design in public schools, although the executive director of the Intelligent Design Network of Ohio, Roddy Bullock, says that the template would merely permit criticism of evolution, via a Teach the Controversy approach. However, in noting that the purpose of the template is to \"open up these topics to different points of view, to different lines of evidence, to different interpretations of the evidence, to give students a more objective approach to science education,\" and given that outside of creationism and intelligent design there are no alternatives to evolution, various groups such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State are in opposition to the proposal.\n\nIn fact, on July 11, Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a request under the Ohio open records law asking for copies of the Grady proposal as well as all documents and correspondence by the Board of Education and the Department of Education relating to proposed changes to the state’s science standards. The group's executive director, Rev. Barry W. Lynn, urged the Ohio board to reject any effort to reopen the dispute over science education, noting\n\"Public school students in Ohio deserve sound science education, not religious dogma masquerading as science. It’s time for Religious Right allies on the board to drop their unwise agenda and focus on policies that will benefit all of Ohio’s students.\"\n\nRepresentative Mike Lott (R-District 104) introduced House Bill 625 on January 9, 2007. If enacted the bill would \"authorize local school boards to allow for the teaching of creationism or intelligent design.\" Lott was quoted as saying, \"The school board of a school district may allow the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in the schools within the district. However, if the theory of evolution is required to be taught as part of the school district's science curriculum, in order to provide students with a comprehensive education in science, the school board also must include the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in the science curriculum\". Similar bills to include the teaching of creationism and intelligent design in public classrooms were submitted in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. None were adopted.\n\nIn February 2009 Senator Stephen R. Wise announced that he was sponsoring plans to introduce a bill requiring teachers who teach evolution to also discuss the idea of intelligent design.\n\nIn 2005, the constitutionality of presenting intelligent design in public high school science classes as a valid scientific alternative to evolution was considered by the court in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, the \"Dover trial.\" There plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution as an \"explanation of the origin of life\" thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his ruling, the judge found that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature and that \"ID’s backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny, which we have now determined that it cannot withstand, by advocating that the \"controversy\", but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.\"\n\nIn October 2005, the National Science Foundation and the University of California, Berkeley’s Museum of Paleontology were sued by intelligent design proponents for running a website for school teachers called 'Understanding Evolution'. The lawsuit was brought by Jeanne Caldwell and Larry Caldwell, the husband and wife founders of the anti-evolution, pro-intelligent design group Quality Science Education for All. The Caldwells argued that University of California was \"taking a position on evolution and attempting to persuade minor students to accept that position.\" Michael R. Smith, the assistant chancellor for legal affairs at Berkeley, said that the university would defend the lawsuit \"with vigor and enthusiasm.\"\n\nThe suit alleged that a university-maintained webpage that contains statements from 17 religious organizations endorsing the teaching of evolution and in so doing violated the separation of church and state. The Caldwells objected specifically to one web page that says it's a misconception that science and religion are incompatible.\n\n\"Basically, what we have is a page that deals with the misconceptions and challenges to the teaching of evolution, and we provided resources to teachers to answer them,\" said Roy Caldwell. \"One of those questions is, 'Aren't religion and evolution incompatible?' and we say, 'no,' and point to a number of sites by clerics and others who make that point.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these statements constituted a preference for certain religious viewpoints in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The suit was dismissed 13 March 2006 when judge granted the University of California's motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.\n"}

{"id": "12076893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12076893", "title": "Johanna Jachmann-Wagner", "text": "Johanna Jachmann-Wagner\n\nJohanna Jachmann-Wagner or Johanna Wagner (13 October 1828 – 16 October 1894) was a mezzo-soprano singer, tragédienne in theatrical drama, and teacher of singing and theatrical performance who won great distinction in Europe during the third quarter of the 19th century. She was a niece of the composer Richard Wagner and was the original performer, and in some respects the inspiration, of the character of Elisabeth in \"Tannhäuser\". She was also the original intended performer of Brünnhilde in \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", but in the event assumed other roles.\n\nJohanna Wagner was born in Seelze, Hanover. She was the natural daughter of a soldier named Bock von Wülfingen, and was adopted by Albert Wagner (1799–1874) (eldest brother of Richard) and his wife Elise (1800–1864). They had two other daughters. From Seelze the family moved to Würzburg in 1830, where both parents worked in the Royal Bavarian Theatre, father being an actor, singer and stage-manager. She received piano lessons from her mother, a Roman Catholic, and sang duets with the Landgräfin of Hessen, who took singing lessons from her father. Richard Wagner visited in 1833 (while composing \"Die Feen\") and often accompanied her singing Carl Loewe's ballad \"Edward\". Johanna knew the young Marie Seebach (later wife of Wagnerian singer Albert Niemann), who attended the same confirmation class.\n\nShe showed aptitude for the stage as a child. Owing to poor health she went to stay with her aunt Christine Gley, a singer and mother of the Vienna actress (1809–1866). In 1842 she accepted a contract as actress at Bernburg and Ballenstedt, and her father undertook her training as a singer. After appearing as a page in the new opera \"Les Huguenots\" at Ballenstedt, she began to give concerts with much success. In Bernburg she gained favourable notice by standing in to take the role of Marguerite de Valois in a performance attended by Duke Leopold.\n\nThe managing director moved his company to Halle during the summer, and Johanna studied Friedrich Schiller roles for the theatre, and operatic roles with her father in Daniel Auber's \"Maurer und Schlosser\", Albert Lortzing's \"Der Wildschütz\" and in \"Don Giovanni\". Her first important operatic appearance was as Catherina Cornaro in Fromental Halévy's \"La reine de Chypre\". In May 1844 Richard Wagner arranged an audition for her at the Dresden Royal Opera, where she gave guest appearances in these operas and received a three-year contract, being engaged as a Royal Saxon \"Kammersängerin\" before the age of 18.\n\nAt the time of her arrival in 1844, Dresden had recently witnessed the world premieres of \"Rienzi\" (1842) and \"Der fliegende Holländer\" (1843), and the singers Josef Tichatschek (tenor, the first Rienzi)), the baritone Anton Mitterwurzer, bass , and the celebrated dramatic soprano Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient (the original Adriano and Senta) were the principals with whom she worked. The latter (whom Johanna had first met in Ballenstedt) was an especially inspiring example, and Tichatschek became a lifelong friend. She also befriended Ferdinand Heine, an actor with great knowledge of theatrical costume, and Countess Helene Kaminska, who made several portraits of her.\n\nJohanna studied several roles with her uncle, especially Irene in \"Rienzi\", and as her family moved to the city they became part of Richard Wagner's circle there. As he was now composing \"Tannhäuser\", following his new musical conceptions, Johanna and Tichatschek sang the music of Elisabeth and Tannhäuser for him as it evolved. He had intended to premiere the opera to mark her 17th birthday, 13 October 1845, but she was ill, which forced its postponement for six days. The first performance, on 19 October, a six-hour staging beside Devrient as Venus, and with Dettmer and Mitterwurzer, was followed by a shortened version, with altogether eight repeats by the following January.\n\nIn 1846, after singing excerpts from Christoph Willibald Gluck's \"Orpheus\" in concert, with financial support from the King of Saxony she left for Paris to study with Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García (and/or with Pauline García-Viardot) for whom she sang Agathe's first aria in \"Der Freischütz\" to audition. After hearing Giulia Grisi as \"Norma\" she studied the role with him (in Italian), and also Valentine in \"Les Huguenots\" (in French), though his attempt to teach her Rosina met with less success. He suggested she should sing in Paris: she declined, but while there she saw Frédéric Chopin play, saw Rachel as Jean Racine's Phèdre, and Habeneck conduct Ludwig van Beethoven's 7th Symphony. At the end of the year she returned to Dresden, to perform Norma and Valentine, under a new contract.\n\nThe Dresden revolution of 1848/49, which resulted in Richard Wagner's exile and Mme Schröder-Devrient's temporary imprisonment, found Johanna singing in Hamburg, as Valentine and Leonore. Dresden vacillated so she accepted a contract at Hamburg where, as Fides in \"Le prophète\" she attracted Giacomo Meyerbeer's attention. He brought her to Berlin State Opera to sing it for her début there in May 1851, which she followed (June 1851) with Donna Anna, Reiza and a repeat of Fides. She also sang Fides in Vienna in 1850. Her Hamburg obligations discharged, she brought her famous interpretation of Bellini's Romeo to Berlin with great success.\n\nIn May 1852 Johanna accepted an invitation from Benjamin Lumley to sing at Her Majesty's Theatre in London. However the Royal Opera House management (Frederick Gye) sought to tempt her away, an offer which Albert Wagner (always Johanna's agent) accepted. In the ensuing row, including two famous lawsuits and equitable proceedings – \"Lumley v Gye\" and \"Lumley v Wagner\" – Albert Wagner offended H. F. Chorley and others by a widely quoted remark (from private correspondence which was produced in court) that \"one only \"could\" go to England to get money\": and Johanna went home without singing at all. However she returned in June and July 1856 (to Her Majesty's) and appeared repeatedly in her best roles, beginning (14 June) as Romeo, and then in \"Lucrezia Borgia\", Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" and Gioachino Rossini's \"Tancredi\". She gave a Court concert, after which Queen Victoria broke her rule and attended this theatre to hear her on stage.\n\nIn 1856 she sang in Weimar under Franz Liszt's direction, as Orfeo, Romeo, Lucrezia Borgia, in Gluck's \"Iphigénie en Tauride\", and in concert. After a Romeo she was given a standing ovation by the orchestra and crowned with a laurel wreath, and she had to give repeat performances for the Grand Duke and Duchess. Liszt, whose interest was not only musical, presented her with his portrait. Throughout the 1850s she sang repeatedly at Cologne, and at Stettin. In 1858 she made a debut at Leipzig, as Lucrezia, and performed Romeo, \"Tancredi\", \"Tannhäuser\" and \"Orfeo\", before going on to Dresden, where she rejoiced to sing \"Tannhäuser\" again with Tichatschek and Mitterwurzer.\n\nWagner, not then on friendly terms with Johanna, had intended her for his Brünnhilde in early plans for the Nibelungen operas, but it was in Heinrich Dorn's opera \"Die Nibelungen\" at Berlin, during Richard's exile, that she performed the role of this name. She also made some effect in the little-known \"Macbeth\" of Wilhelm Taubert, as Lady Macbeth. However, it was in the Berlin premieres of \"Tannhäuser\", in January 1856, that she rediscovered her place in Richard's pantheon, with such success that permission was also granted for the (belated) first Berlin production of \"Lohengrin\" in 1859, with Johanna as Ortrud. She also trained Luise Harriers-Wippern (1826–1878) as Elsa. For these productions was the manager, Albert Wagner the stage-manager and (in \"Lohengrin\") Wilhelm Taubert the conductor.\n\nIn May 1859 Johanna married Alfred Jachmann of Königsberg, diplomat, of an eminent Prussian family whom she had assisted financially at the collapse of their interests in 1858. Her first daughter was born in March 1860. After a very busy and triumphant tour of German towns in 1860 and a visit to Warsaw in rebellion (where she was first hissed, and then sang under police protection), she decided to make her farewell from the opera stage and to continue her career as a tragédienne. Her contract renegotiated, she studied the role of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Iphigenie under the guidance of , the actress whose mantle she was to inherit, and performed it in September 1861 at the Royal Theatre, Berlin, for Queen Augusta's birthday, and soon afterwards was Friedrich Schiller's \"Mary Stuart\", and Countess Orsina in \"Emilia Galotti\".\n\nShe now took the name Johanna Jachmann-Wagner for her new career. She was soon compared to Fanny Janauschek, the dramatic power of her performances giving hope of a rebirth of the German classic drama. Having sung at the coronation concert at Königsberg, her operatic farewell was as Orfeo in December 1861, but she repeated it at a centenary performance in October 1862. She did however continue to sing in various German towns through the 1860s, notably in concert and recital, in the performance of lieder. She made a return visit to Würzburg in 1866. From 1861 to 1869 she lived part of each year at Berlin and part at Trutenau. In 1868 and 1869 she gave the first performances of two dramas, \"Phädra\" and \"Catharina Voisin\" by \"Georg Conrad\", the pen-name of Prince George of Prussia. Her performances as Goethe's Iphigenie and in the classical drama, as Phädra and (Sophocles') Antigone became particularly her own. Her retirement became necessary after a paralysis of one side of her face, which occurred in 1869. After her dramatic farewells in 1871 and 1872, eulogised by Theodor Fontane, she was awarded a gold medal by the Emperor.\n\nIn May 1872 Johanna fulfilled a promise to her uncle Richard Wagner, singing alto in the solo quartet in the performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony at the foundation-stone laying of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. She also participated in the first Bayreuth Festival of 1876, taking the role of Schwertleite in \"Die Walküre\" and First Norn in \"Götterdämmerung\" in the original first full production of \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\". She was not now capable of Brünnhild as originally intended, but as the Valkyr, her dramatic control of the scenes, and the energy she infused into them, in rehearsal and performance, realised the composer's true intentions, and set a precedent which was later imitated. Her Norn similarly was invested with her full dramatic resources.\n\nAlfred Jachmann's fortune crashed again after the Franco-Prussian War, and at Würzburg Johanna, with her pension from the Berlin Hochspielhaus, continued her work as a singing teacher, and retained the friendship of kings and princes which she had long held. Her last public performance was at Würzburg in scenes from \"Orfeo\" in 1882. She moved then to Munich, where, in close contact with the Royal Court Theatre, she accepted the post of instructor in singing at the Royal Conservatoire of Music and the title Professor. Ludwig II of Bavaria presented her with a free seat in the Munich opera, and invited her to a private performance of \"Parsifal\" in his own theatre. She had many pupils, but, eventually dissatisfied with Munich, she returned to Berlin in 1888 and continued to teach, arranging public concerts for her pupils. She died in Würzburg of heart illness three days after her 66th birthday.\n\nA London reviewer is quoted to have written, \"Her range comprises the soft female loveliness of a soprano and is equally fine in the low tones of a contralto. On each occasion that a peculiarly fine change from one range to another was accomplished by this incomparable singer the effect was as overwhelming as it was unexpected... Deceit, passion, love, fear and despair were expressed in each note.\" Another is quoted: \"She is one of those rare artists who fills the stage with her attractive personality. ... her voice is one of the rarest beauty. One feels inclined to say that she is a soprano, but her range is so wide that the full tone covers three registers, from the high soprano to the alto range. Certainly no living singer can be compared in fullness of tone to Johanna Wagner.\"\n\nH.F. Chorley, embittered by Albert Wagner's national insult, found little to like in Johanna: \"Considered as a singer, the claims of Mademoiselle Wagner were very meagre. She must have had originally a fine \"mezzo soprano\" voice. She can never have learned how to produce, or how to use it. Whether as \"Romeo\", or \"Tancredi\", or \"Lucrezia Borgia\", the insubordinate toughness of the organ could not be concealed. Though she dashed at every difficulty, with an intrepidity only to be found in German singers, none was, in very deed, mastered.' Chorley, however, had no liking for German stagecraft, which he considered mannered and formulaic, nor for German theatrical singing, which he called \"tasteless declamation accompanied by an orchestra\".\n\nOn the other hand, Benjamin Lumley wrote of her 1856 appearance as \"Romeo\" in terms that make one imagine the Brünnhilde she ought to have been: \"She appeared: tall, stately, self-possessed, clothed in glittering gilded mail, with her fine fair hair flung in masses upon her neck: a superb air that seemed to give full earnest of victory, and a step revealing innate majesty and grandeur in every movement... She sang! The sonorous voice, which heralded the mission of the young warrior to his enemies, rang through the house as penetrating and awakening as the summons of a clarion.\"\n\n"}

He is credited as the founding father of Iran's first modern Medical School.\n\nJoseph Cochran's father, the Reverend Joseph Gallup Cochran (1817-1871), and his mother, Deborah Wilber Plumb (1820-1893), were first-generation American missionaries who traveled to Iran in 1848. They settled in Urmia, Western Azarbaijan, Iran, home to the people of the ancient culture of Urartu and of one of the earliest Christian churches, the Assyrian Church of the East. The family devoted their missionary zeal to the well-being of the local population, many of whom were devout Christians.\n\nThe young Joseph was one of the eight children of Cochran's family. He had a happy childhood in the company of his large family and friends. He learnt the local Assyrian, Azerbaijani and Kurdish, in addition to English and Persian. He left for America as a teenager in 1868, staying in Buffalo, N.Y. with the family of Stephen Mallory Clement (1825-1892), the father of Stephen Merrell Clement, who was to help finance not only Joseph Cochran's education, but also his hospital. He studied medicine at New York Medical College, from where he graduated in 1876. Subsequently he did two years of practical hospital work in surgery, infectious diseases and gynecology. During a travel to Minnesota he met his future wife, Katherine Hale.\n\nThe young couple went to Iran in 1878. Upon their arrival in Urmia they surveyed the medical and health needs of the community and found the existing small health clinic, which was working under the auspices of the Iranian Red Lion and Sun Society, inadequate. On Joseph's earnest request, the Board of Assyrian Missionary purchased a 15-hectare garden which was soon to become the site of a 100-bed hospital, named \"Westminster Hospital\", after the church in Buffalo, N.Y. that was the vehicle for supporting Dr. Cochran's work. The building of this hospital was completed within one year from its original planning and the hospital opened its doors in 1879.\n\nCochran resolved the problem of shortage in the local medical professionals by establishing a modern Medical School, the first of its kind in Iran. For this purpose he erected a wooden building, which included a research laboratory, near the hospital, where the future medical personnel were to be trained. Remarkably, this original wooden building, near the present-day Urmia Medical School, is still intact. An adjoining maternity hospital was built later, for which the required medical equipment arrived from America. \nAccording to the information provided by the official website of Urmia University, Joseph Cochran has been [the first] director of the Medical School in Urmia, established in 1878. In the course of Cochran's 27 years of directorship, 26 medical students graduated from this School. This School was closed on Joseph Cochran's death in 1905 and remained in this state until sixty years later when it was opened as one of several Schools of Urmia University. The historical archives of Urmia University is in the possession of documents that show that Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar and Joseph Cochran have personally signed and handed certificates to graduating students during the graduation ceremony of 1898 (1277 AH).\nDuring the above-mentioned period, Joseph Cochran was joined by other American medical doctors, including Dr Wright, Dr Homlz, Dr van Norden, and Dr Miller, who remained permanently in Iran. Their resting places are in Urmia.\n\nJoseph Cochran died in Urmia at the age of 50, on 18 August 1905, on the second floor of his wooden house in the Medical School. His death was mourned by many. According to reports, his funeral was attended by tens of thousands people. He was buried in the Assyrian Missionary Cemetery located on the side of \"Seer Mountain\" in Urmia facing his wooden house, close to the resting places of his wife Catherine and her parents. His epitaph reads: \"\"He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\" \n\nHis son, Joseph P. Cochran, Jr, returning to Iran in 1920, followed in his father's footsteps through his services in the American Mission Hospital. His daughter, Dorothy Cochran-Romson, served for a short time as a missionary nurse in Tabriz capital East Azerbaijan Province in Iran.\n\n\n\n"}

Competing methods include traditional linear fixed-form delivery and computerized adaptive testing. LOFT is a compromise between the two, in an effort to maintain the equivalence of the set of items that each examinee sees, which is found in fixed-form delivery, while attempting to reduce item exposure and enhance test security.\n\nFixed-form delivery, which most people are familiar with, entails the testing organization determining one or several fixed sets of items to be delivered together. For example, suppose the test contains 100 items, and the organization wished for two forms. Two forms are published with a fixed set of 100 items each, some of which should overlap to enable equating. All examinees that take the test are given one of the two forms.\n\nIf this exam is high volume, meaning that there is a large number of examinees, the security of the examination could be in jeopardy. Many of the test items would become well known in the population of examinees. To offset this, more forms would be needed; if there were eight forms, not as many examinees would see each item.\n\nLOFT takes this to an extreme, and attempts to construct a unique exam for each candidate, within the given constraints of the testing program. Rather than publishing a fixed set of items, a large pool of items is delivered to the computer on which the examinee is taking the exam. Also delivered is a computer program to pseudo-randomly select items so that every examinee will receive a test that is equivalent with respect to content and statistical characteristics, although composed of a different set of items. This is usually done with item response theory.\n"}

Reeves Archer (October 23, 1893 – April 1, 1948) was an American teacher and activist who fought to educate African Americans during the 1930s and 1940s. During this time, racial barriers limited a black student's access to education. They had limited resources compared to white children and were deprived education beyond seventh grade — when twelve grades was already common practice.\n\nA dedicated teacher, Louise Archer brought Vienna's African American community together in service to its school.\n\nLouise Reeves grew up in North Carolina and attended Livingstone College. She taught school in Southampton County, Virginia, where she married Romulus C. Archer Jr. in 1915. They moved to Washington, D.C., in 1922 and she continued her education, later earning a B.S. from Morgan State College.\n\nIn 1922 Archer became teacher and principal for a one-room segregated school in Vienna, Virginia. Devoted to her students, she often transported children to school herself and worked to improve their learning experience. She organized a Parent-Teacher Association to raise funds for supplies and a new building, which opened in 1939 with three rooms. In 1941 students, parents, and faculty raised $300, which paid for a music teacher, bus expenses, kitchen supplies, and the installation of electric lights. Archer also established one of Fairfax County's earliest 4-H Clubs for African Americans and her students participated in garden projects to raise vegetables for lunches prepared at school.\n\nArcher provided a high-quality education. In addition to the academic curriculum, she taught sewing, cooking, music, and poetry to her students in fifth through seventh grades, which was then the highest level of public education available to African Americans in the county. After Archer's death, families petitioned the county to name the school in her honor. Louise Archer Elementary School continues to remember her service to the community with an annual celebration in her honor.\n\nIn 1948, Mrs. Louise Archer died of a heart attack; the school was renamed Louise Archer in her honor in 1950.\n"}

Anarchy Enterprises described it as the \"first 3-D Sim game ever\", and noted that it has similarities to SimCity (which at the time was 2-dimensional).\n\nMoon Tycoon has three campaigns to play through, each with its own story-line and placed around the year 2021.\n\nCampaign 1: Earth is in a global energy crisis, and the only thing that can stop it is a precious ore called Helium 3 that can only be found on the moon.\n\nCampaign 2: The energy crisis is over, but competition begins to heat up as corporations battle for lunar domination as space borne epidemics, discontent over living conditions and space disasters become more frequent.\n\nCampaign 3: Mankind makes yet another leap as it begins the next stage of space exploration: the colonization of the asteroid belt beyond Mars.\n\nEach campaign has ten levels to play through each with varied levels of difficulty. All three campaigns make up a larger story, so they can only be played in order and starting with the first.\nThere is also a sandbox mode; where you can set the starting money, terrain type, ore quantity and average building life; it also lets you select the moon or asteroid.\n\nThe game is played on the Play Area, on which completed and under-construction structures are displayed. Players also use this screen to begin construction of buildings and alter the terrain. The play area is raised up from the surrounding view and can also have a grid.\n\nTo the right of the Play Area is the Building Menus, Colony Management, Disasters, and Options.\n\nThe building menu display the various types of structures available for construction. These buildings are divided into different categories: Housing and Medical, Tourism, Research, Rewards (earned by different objectives), utilities, and Industry.\n\nThe spiritual sequel, \"Deep Sea Tycoon\", often confused with \"Atlantis Underwater Tycoon\", is a 2003 video game developed by Anarchy Enterprises and published by Unique Entertainment. This game involves you building an underwater city in 3D. It has a sequel, \"Deep Sea Tycoon 2\", developed by Pixel after Pixel.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Deep Sea Tycoon\" involves choosing one of 24 different characters and creating an underwater city filled with different buildings and features, from Mermaid Palaces to Seafood Restaurants. Through the character they choose and the choices they make in their city, the player can become a ruthless oil-tycoon, or something similar, or an environmentalist.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Moon Tycoon. The player creates buildings on a flat piece of land, that must be connected to other buildings by a \"tunnel\". The only major differences is the scenario, and the types of buildings each game uses.\n\n\"Deep Sea Tycoon 2\" has been reviewed by X-Play, being given a 1 out of 5. Being noted for being boring by having \"ridiculously easy challenges\" and simple challenges of only having to \"click my mouse button twice\". As a final note in their review, Adam Sessler noted that \"Game Tycoon\" was more entertaining than \"Deep Sea Tycoon 2\".\n\n"}

Amongst the world's largest and most visited museums are the Louvre in Paris, the National Museum of China in Beijing, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the British Museum and National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and Vatican Museums in Vatican City.\n\nAs of the 2010s, the continuing acceleration in the digitization of information, combined with the increasing capacity of digital information storage, is causing the traditional model of museums (i.e. as static bricks-and-mortar \"collections of collections\" of three-dimensional specimens and artifacts) to expand to include virtual exhibits and high-resolution images of their collections that patrons can peruse, study, and explore from any location with Internet access. According to The World Museum Community, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.\n\nThe English \"museum\" comes from the Latin word, and is pluralized as \"museums\" (or rarely, \"musea\"). It is originally from the Ancient Greek Μουσεῖον (\"Mouseion\"), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the Muses (the patron divinities in Greek mythology of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the arts, especially the Musaeum (institute) for philosophy and research at Alexandria by Ptolemy I Soter about 280 BC.\n\nThe purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display items of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the education of the public. From a visitor or community perspective, the purpose can also depend on one's point of view. A trip to a local history museum or large city art museum can be an entertaining and enlightening way to spend the day. To city leaders, a healthy museum community can be seen as a gauge of the economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To a museum professional, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson's bequest, that would fund the Smithsonian Institution, stated he wanted to establish an institution \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"\n\nMuseums of natural history in the late 19th century exemplified the Victorian desire for consumption and for order. Gathering all examples of each classification of a field of knowledge for research and for display was the purpose. As American colleges grew in the 19th century, they developed their own natural history collections for the use of their students. By the last quarter of the 19th century, the scientific research in the universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting edge research moved from museums to university laboratories. While many large museums, such as the Smithsonian Institution, are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve artifacts for future generations. Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in aging documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings. All museums display objects that are important to a culture. As historian Steven Conn writes, \"To see the thing itself, with one's own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience can be enchanting.\"\n\nMuseum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the Canada Science and Technology Museum favored education over preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historic printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia. Some seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while some museums have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History Museum or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display.\nAlthough most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, Hampton Court Palace, palace of Henry VIII, opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in a slice of what Tudor life may have been.\n\nThis section lists the 20 most visited museums in 2015 as compiled by AECOM and the Themed Entertainment Association's annual report on the world's most visited attractions. For 2016 figures see List of most visited museums. The cities of London and Washington, D.C. contain more of the 20 most visited museums in the world than any others, with six museums and four museums, respectively.\n\nEarly museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and artifacts. These were often displayed in so-called wonder rooms or cabinets of curiosities. One of the oldest museums known is Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum, built by Princess Ennigaldi at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The site dates from c. 530 BCE, and contained artifacts from earlier Mesopotamian civilizations. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.\n\nPublic access to these museums was often possible for the \"respectable\", especially to private art collections, but at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but they also used the museum as a way to sort and \"manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced.\" \n\nOne of these naturalists and collectors was Ulisse Aldrovandi, whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was \"encyclopedic\" in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist. The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as \"the museums that contained this knowledge.\" The 18th-century scholars of the Age of Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on \"organization and taxonomy\" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.\nWhile some of the oldest public museums in the world opened in Italy during the Renaissance, the majority of these significant museums in the world opened during the 18th century:\n\n\nModern museums first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.\n\nThe first \"public\" museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day. The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.\n\nThe Ashmolean Museum, however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum. The collection included that of Elias Ashmole which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the Old Ashmolean, is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Thomas Wood.\n\nIn France, the first public museum was the Louvre Museum in Paris, opened in 1793 during the French Revolution, which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each \"décade\" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the French Republican Calendar). The \"Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts\" (National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As Napoléon I conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually returned to their owners (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe.\n\nChinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as \"bone amassing buildings\" or \"courtyards of treasures\" or \"painting pavilions\" or \"curio stores\" or \"halls of military feats\" or \"gardens of everything\". Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe’s World’s Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a 'hakubutsukan', a 'house of extensive things' – this would eventually became accepted as the equivalent word for 'museum' in Japan and China.\n\nAmerican museums eventually joined European museums as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called \"The Museum Period\" or \"The Museum Age\"). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome). Drawing on Michel Foucault's concept of liberal government, Tony Bennett has suggested the development of more modern 19th century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public. As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these \"new tasks of social management.\" Universities became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of the Second World War. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.\n\nThe late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains. In 1990, Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American \"cultural items\" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups. Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.\n\nThe roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution, but every museum has a hierarchy of governance with a Board of Trustees serving at the top. The Director is next in command and works with the Board to establish and fulfill the museum's mission statement and to ensure that the museum is accountable to the public. Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums.\nAccording to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, \"Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession.\"\n\nVarious positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums:\n\nOther positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer.\n\nAt smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary.\n\nAn exhibition history is a listing of exhibitions for an institution, artist, or a work of art. Exhibition histories generally include the name of the host institution, the title of the exhibition and the opening and closing dates of the exhibition.\n\nThe following is a list of major institutions that have complete or substantial exhibition histories that are available online.\n\nThe design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian John Cotton Dana. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community. According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs:\n\n\"The new museum…does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use.\" \n\nThe way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.\n\nQuestions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.\n\nIn terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a museum planning process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an interpretive plan are all developed as part of the museum planning process.\n\nSome museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions.\n\nIn recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities. Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the spectacular \"Guggenheim Bilbao\" was built in Bilbao, Spain in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project. Nonetheless, the gamble has appeared to pay off financially for the city, with over 1.1 million people visiting the museum in 2015. Key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao. A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was also built on the disused shipyards of Belfast, Northern Ireland. \"Titanic Belfast\" was built for the same price as the \"Guggenheim Bilbao\" (and which was incidentally built by the same architect, Frank Gehry) in time for the 100th anniversary of the Belfast-built ship's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland. In the United States, similar projects include the 81, 000 square foot \"Taubman Museum of Art\" in Roanoke, Virginia and \"The Broad Museum\" in Los Angeles.\n\nMuseums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The \"Taubman Museum of Art\" is an example of a museum which cost a lot (eventually $66 million) but attained little success, and continues to have a low endowment for its size. Some museum activists also see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that \"to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment.\"\n\nMuseums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%. Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation. The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55. Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding. Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.\n\nMost mid-size and large museums employ exhibit design staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research and evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the interpretive plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.\n\nExhibition design has as multitude of strategies, theories, and methods but two that embody much of the theory and dialogue surrounding exhibition design are the metonymy technique and the use of authentic artifacts to provide the historical narrative. Metonymy, or \"the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant,\" is a technique used by many museums but few as heavily and as influentially as Holocaust museums.\n\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., for example, employs this technique in its shoe exhibition. Simply a pile of decaying leather shoes piled against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, can be a very powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. Hansen-Glucklich explains, \"...when victims' possessions are collected according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess.\"\n\nWhile a powerful technique, Hansen-Glucklick points out that when used \"en masse\" the metonym suffers as the memory and suffering of the individual is lost in the chorus of the whole. While at times juxtaposed, the alternative technique of the use of authentic objects is seen the same exhibit mentioned above. The use of authentic artifacts is employed by most, if not all, museums but the degree to which and the intention can vary greatly. The basic idea behind exhibiting authentic artifacts is to provide not only legitimacy to the exhibit's historical narrative but, at times, to help create the narrative as well. The theory behind this technique is to exhibit artifacts in a neutral manner to orchestrate and narrate the historic narrative through, ideally, the provenance of the artifacts themselves.\n\nWhile albeit necessary to some degree in any museum repertoire, the use of authentic artifacts can not only be misleading but as equally problematic as the aforementioned metonymic technique. Hansen-Glucklick explains, \"The danger of such a strategy lies in the fact that by claiming to offer the remnants of the past to the spectator, the museum creates the illusion of standing before a complete picture. The suggestion is that if enough details and fragments are collected and displayed, a coherent and total truth concerning the past will emerge, visible and comprehensible. The museum attempts, in other words, to archive the unachievable.\" While any exhibit benefits from the legitimacy given by authentic objects or artifacts, the temptation must be protected against in order to avoid relying solely on the artifacts themselves. A well designed exhibition should employ objects and artifacts as a foundation to the narrative but not as a crutch; a lesson any conscientious curator would be well to keep in mind.\n\nSome museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in \"all\" museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology. As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development. Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead \"thinning out\" the objects presented \"for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them.\" This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.\n\nTypes of museums vary, from large institutions, covering many of the categories below, to very small institutions focusing on a specific subject, location, or a notable person. Categories include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, science, technology, children's museums, natural history, botanical and zoological gardens. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g. museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. Another type of museum is an encyclopedic museum. Commonly referred to as a universal museum, encyclopedic museums have collections representative of the world and typically include art, science, history, and cultural history. The type and size of a museum is reflected in its collection. A museum normally houses a core collection of important selected objects in its field.\n\nArchitectural museums are institutions dedicated to educating visitors about architecture and a variety of related fields, often including urban design, landscape design, interior decoration, engineering, and historic preservation. Additionally, museums of art or history sometimes dedicate a portion of the museum or a permanent exhibit to a particular facet or era of architecture and design, though this does not technically constitute a proper museum of architecture.\n\nThe International Confederation of Architectural Museums (ICAM) is the principal worldwide organisation for architectural museums. Members consist of almost all large institutions specializing in this field and also those offering permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries.\n\nArchitecture museums are in fact a less common type in the United States, due partly to the difficulty of curating a collection which could adequately represent or embody the large scale subject matter.\n\nThe National Building Museum in Washington D.C., a privately run institution created by a mandate of Congress in 1980, is the nation's most prominent public museum of architecture. In addition to its architectural exhibits and collections, the museum seeks to educate the public about engineering and design. The NBM is a unique museum in that the building in which it is housed—the historic Pension Building built 1882–87—is itself a sort of curated collection piece which teaches about architecture. Another large scale museum of architecture is the Chicago Athenaeum, an international Museum of Architecture and Design, founded in 1988. The Athenaeum differs from the National Building Museum not only in its global scope—it has offices in Italy, Greece, Germany, and Ireland—but also in its broader topical scope, which encompasses smaller modern appliances and graphic design.\n\nA very different and much smaller example of an American architectural museum is the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum in Frederick, Maryland. Similar to the National Building Museum, the building of the Schifferstadt is a historic structure, built in 1758, and therefore also an embodiment of historic preservation and restoration. In addition to instructing the public about its eighteenth century German-American style architecture, the Schifferstadt also interprets the broader contextual history of its origins, including topics such as the French and Indian War and the arrival of the region's earliest German American immigrants.\n\nMuseums of architecture are devoted primarily to disseminating knowledge about architecture, but there is considerable room for expanding into other related genres such as design, city planning, landscape, infrastructure, and even the traditional study of history or art, which can provide useful context for any architectural exhibit.\n\nThe American Society of Landscape Architects has professional awards given out every year to architectural museums and art displays. A few of the award-winning projects are:\n\nPerez Art Museum Miami: Resiliency by Design\n\nTeardrop Park: General Design Category\n\nMesa Arts Center: General Design Honor Award\n\nArchaeology museums specialize in the display of archaeological artifacts. Many are in the open air, such as the Agora of Athens and the Roman Forum. Others display artifacts found in archaeological sites inside buildings. Some, such as the Western Australian Museum, exhibit maritime archaeological materials. These appear in its Shipwreck Galleries, a wing of the Maritime Museum. This Museum has also developed a 'museum-without-walls' through a series of underwater wreck trails.\n\nAn art museum, also known as an art gallery, is a space for the exhibition of art, usually in the form of art objects\nfrom the visual arts, primarily paintings, illustrations, and sculptures. Collections of drawings and old master prints are often not displayed on the walls, but kept in a print room. There may be collections of applied art, including ceramics, metalwork, furniture, artist's books, and other types of objects. Video art is often screened.\n\nThe first publicly owned museum in Europe was the Amerbach-Cabinet in Basel, originally a private collection sold to the city in 1661 and public since 1671 (now Kunstmuseum Basel). The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford opened on 24 May 1683 as the world's first university art museum. Its first building was built in 1678–1683 to house the cabinet of curiosities Elias Ashmole gave Oxford University in 1677. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence was initially conceived as offices for the Florentine civil service (hence the name), but evolved into a display place for many of the paintings and sculpture collected by the Medici family or commissioned by them. After the house of Medici was extinguished, the art treasures remained in Florence, forming one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public. Another early public museum was the British Museum in London, which opened to the public in 1759. It was a \"universal museum\" with very varied collections covering art, applied art, archaeology, anthropology, history, and science, and what is now the British Library. The science collections, library, paintings, and modern sculptures have since been found separate homes, leaving history, archaeology, non-European and pre-Renaissance art, and prints and drawings. Underwater museum is another type of art museum where the Artificial reef are placed to promote marine life. Cancun Underwater Museum, or the Subaquatic Sculpture Museum, in Mexico is the largest underwater museum in the world. There are now about 500 images in the underwater museum. The last eleven images were added in September 2013.\n\nThe specialised art museum is considered a fairly modern invention, the first being the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg which was established in 1764.\n\nThe Louvre in Paris was established in 1793, soon after the French Revolution when the royal treasures were declared for the people. The Czartoryski Museum in Kraków was established in 1796 by Princess Izabela Czartoryska. This showed the beginnings of removing art collections from the private domain of aristocracy and the wealthy into the public sphere, where they were seen as sites for educating the masses in taste and cultural refinement.\n\nBiographical museums are dedicated to items relating to the life of a single person or group of people, and may also display the items collected by their subjects during their lifetimes. Some biographical museums are located in a house or other site associated with the lives of their subjects (e.g. Sagamore Hill which contains the Theodore Roosevelt Museum or The Keats-Shelley Memorial House in the Piazza di Spagna, Rome). Some homes of famous people house famous collections in the sphere of the owner's expertise or interests in addition to collections of their biographical material; one such example is The Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London, home of the Duke of Wellington, which, in addition to biographical memorabilia of the Duke's life, also houses his collection world-famous paintings. Other biographical museums, such as many of the American presidential libraries, are housed in specially constructed buildings.\n\nThere are one hundred and seven automobile museums in the United States, one in Canada, and one in the Republic of Georgia according to the National Association of Automobile Museums. Automobile Museums are for car fans, collectors, enthusiasts, and for families. “They speak to the imagination,” says Ken Gross, a former museum director who now curates auto exhibits at the fine arts museum.\nAs time goes by, more and more museums dedicated to classic cars of yesteryear are opening. Many of the old classics come to life once the original owners pass away. Some are not-for-profit while others are run as a private business.\n\nChildren's museums are institutions that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate informal learning experiences for children. In contrast with traditional museums that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are nonprofit organizations, and many are run by volunteers or by very small professional staffs.\n\nThe Brooklyn Children's Museum was established in 1899 by the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. It is often regarded as the first children's museum in the United States. The idea behind the Brooklyn Children's Museum implicitly acknowledged that existing American museums were not designed with children in mind. Although museums at the turn of the century viewed themselves as institutions of public education, their exhibits were often not made accessible for children, who may have struggled with simple design features like the height of exhibit cases, or the language of interpretive labels. Furthermore, touching objects was often prohibited, limiting visitors' ability to interact with museum objects.\n\nThe founders of the Brooklyn Children's Museum were concerned with education and realized that no other institution had attempted to establish \"a Museum that will be of especial value and interest to young people between the ages of six and twenty years.\" Their goal was to gain children's interest and \"to stimulate their powers of observation and reflection\" as well as to \"illustrate by collections of pictures, cartoons, charts, models, maps and so on, each of the important branches of knowledge which is taught in elementary schools.\"\n\nAnna Billings Gallup, the museum's curator from 1904 to 1937, encouraged a learning technique that allowed children to \"discover\" information by themselves through touching and examining objects. Visitors to the museum were able to compare the composition, weight, and hardness of minerals, learn to use a microscope to examine natural objects, and build their own collections of natural objects to be displayed in a special room of the museum. In addition to emphasis on allowing interaction with objects, Gallup also encouraged learning through play. She believed learning at the Brooklyn Children's Museum should be \"pure fun\", and to this end developed nature clubs, held field trips, brought live animals into the museum, and hired gallery instructors to lead children in classification games about animals, shells, and minerals. Other children's museums of the early twentieth century used similar techniques that emphasized learning through experience.\n\nChildren's museums often emphasize experiential learning through museum interactives, sometimes leading them to have very few or no physical collection items. The Brooklyn Children's Museum and other early children's museums grew out of the tradition of natural history museums, object-centered institutions. Over the course of the twentieth century, the children's museums slowly began to discard their objects in favor of more interactive exhibits. While children's museums are a more extreme case, it is important to note that during the twentieth century, more and more museums have elected to display fewer objects and offer more interpretation than museums of the nineteenth century. Some scholars argue that objects, while once critical to the definition of a museum, are no longer considered vital to many institutions because they are no longer necessary to fulfill the roles we expect museums to serve as museums focus more on programs, education, and their visitors.\n\nAfter the Brooklyn Children's Museum opened in 1899, other American museums followed suit by opening small children's sections of their institutions designed with children in mind and equipped with interactive activities, such as the Smithsonian's children's room opened in 1901. The Brooklyn Children's Museum also inspired other children's museums either housed separately or even developed completely independently of parent museums, like the Boston Children's Museum (1913), The Children's Museum of Detroit Public Schools (1915), and the Children's Museum of Indianapolis (1925). The number of children's museums in the United States continued to grow over the course of the twentieth century, with over 40 museums opened by the 1960s and more than 70 children's museums opened to the public between 1990 and 1997.\n\nInternational professional organizations of children's museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries, and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007. Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.\n\nA design museum is a museum with a focus on product, industrial, graphic, fashion, and architectural design.\nMany design museums were founded as museums for applied arts or decorative arts and started only in the late 20th century to collect design. Pop-up wndr museum of Chicago was purposefully made to provide visitors with interesting selfie backgrounds.\n\nIt may sometimes be useful to distinguish between diachronic and synchronic museums. According to University of Florida's Professor Eric Kilgerman, \"While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic.\"\n\nEncyclopedic museums are large, mostly national, institutions that offer visitors a plethora of information on a variety of subjects that tell both local and global stories. The aim of encyclopedic museums is to provide examples of each classification available for a field of knowledge. \"When 3% of the world's population, or nearly 200 million people, living outside the country of their birth, encyclopedic museums play an especially important role in the building of civil society. They encourage curiosity about the world.\" James Cuno, President and Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, along with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, are two of the most outspoken museum professionals who support encyclopedic museums. They state that encyclopedic museums are advantageous for society by exposing museum visitors to a wide variety of cultures, engendering a sense of a shared human history. Some scholars and archaeologists, however, argue against encyclopedic museums because they remove cultural objects from their original cultural setting, losing their context.\n\nEthnology museums are a type of museum that focus on studying, collecting, preserving and displaying artifacts and objects concerning ethnology and anthropology. This type of museum usually were built in countries possessing diverse ethnic groups or significant numbers of ethnic minorities. An example is the Ozurgeti History Museum, an ethnographic museum in Georgia.\n\nWithin the category of history museums, historic house museums are the most numerous. The earliest projects for preserving historic homes began in the 1850s under the direction of individuals concerned with the public good and the preservation of American history, especially centered on the first president. Since the establishment of America's first historic site at Washington's Revolutionary headquarters at Hasbrouck House in New York State, Americans have found a penchant for preserving similar historical structures. The establishment of historic house museums increased in popularity through the 1970s and 1980s as the Revolutionary bicentennial set off a wave of patriotism and alerted Americans to the destruction of their physical heritage. The tradition of restoring homes of the past and designating them as museums draws on the English custom of preserving ancient buildings and monuments. Initially homes were considered worthy of saving because of their associations with important individuals, usually of the elite classes, like former presidents, authors, or businessmen. Increasingly, Americans have fought to preserve structures characteristic of a more typical American past that represents the lives of everyday people including minorities.\nWhile historic house museums compose the largest section within the historic museum category, they usually operate with small staffs and on limited budgets. Many are run entirely by volunteers and often do not meet the professional standards established by the museum industry. An independent survey conducted by Peggy Coats in 1990 revealed that sixty-five percent of historic house museums did not have a full-time staff and 19 to 27 percent of historic homes employed only one full-time employee. Furthermore, the majority of these museums operated on less than $50,000 annually. The survey also revealed a significant disparity in the number of visitors between local house museums and national sites. While museums like Mount Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg were visited by over one million tourists a year, more than fifty percent of historic house museums received less than 5,000 visitors per year.\n\nThese museums are also unique in that the actual structure belongs to the museum collection as a historical object. While some historic home museums are fortunate to possess a collection containing many of the original furnishings once present in the home, many face the challenge of displaying a collection consistent with the historical structure. Some museums choose to collect pieces original to the period while not original to the house. Others, fill the home with replicas of the original pieces reconstructed with the help of historic records. Still other museums adopt a more aesthetic approach and use the homes to display the architecture and artistic objects. Because historic homes have often existed through different generations and have been passed on from one family to another, volunteers and professionals also must decide which historical narrative to tell their visitors. Some museums grapple with this issue by displaying different eras in the home's history within different rooms or sections of the structure. Others choose one particular narrative, usually the one deemed most historically significant, and restore the home to that particular period.\n\n cover the knowledge of history and its relevance to the present and future. Some cover specialized curatorial aspects of history or a particular locality; others are more general. Such museums contain a wide range of objects, including documents, artifacts of all kinds, art, archaeological objects. specialize in more archaeological findings.\n\nA common type of history museum is a historic house. A historic house may be a building of special architectural interest, the birthplace or home of a famous person, or a house with an interesting history. Local and national governments often create museums to their history. The United States has many national museums for historical topics, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Historic sites can also serve as museums, such as the museum at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C. The U.S. National Park Service defines a historic site as the \"location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure.\"\n\nHistoric sites can also mark public crimes, such as Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Robben Island, South Africa. Similar to museums focused on public crimes, museums attached to memorials of public crimes often contain a history component, as is the case at the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum. History museums may concern more general crimes and atrocities, such as American slavery. Often these museums are connected to a particular example, such as the proposed International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, which will treat slavery as an institution with a particular focus on slavery in Charleston and South Carolina's Lowcountry. Museums in cities like Charleston, South Carolina must interact with a broader heritage tourism industry where the history of the majority population is traditionally privileged over the minority.\n\nMany specialized museums have been established such as the National LGBT Museum in New York City and the National Women's History Museum planned for the National Mall. The majority of museums across the country that tell state and local history also follow this example.Other museums have a problem interpreting colonial histories, especially at Native American historic sites. However, museums such as the National Museum of the American Indian and Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways in Michigan are working to share authority with indigenous groups and decolonize museums.\n\nAnother type of history museum is a living history museum. A living history museum is an outdoor museum featuring reenactors in period costume, and historic or reconstructed buildings. Colonial Williamsburg is a living history museum in Virginia that represents the colony on the eve of the American Revolution in the 18th century. The 301 acre historic area includes hundreds of buildings, in their original locations, but mostly reconstructed.\n\nLiving history museums combine historic architecture, material culture, and costumed interpretation with natural and cultural landscapes to create an immersive learning environment. These museums include the collection, preservation or interpretation of material culture, traditional skills, and historical processes. Recreated historical settings simulating past time periods can offer the visitor a sense of traveling back in time. They are a type of open-air museum.\n\nTwo main interpretation styles dominate the visitor experience at living history museums: first and third person interpretation. In first person interpretation, interpreters assume the persona, including the speech patterns, behaviors, views, and dress of a historical figure from the museum's designated time period. In third person interpretation, the interpreters openly acknowledge themselves to be a contemporary of the museum visitor. The interpreter is not restricted by being in-character and can speak to the visitor about society from a modern-day perspective.\n\nThe beginnings of the living history museum can be traced back to 1873 with the opening of the Skansen Museum near Stockholm, Sweden. The museum's founder, Artur Hazelius, began the museum by using his personal collection of buildings and other cultural materials of pre-industrial society. This museum began as an open-air museum and, by 1891, had several farm buildings in which visitors could see exhibits and where guides demonstrated crafts and tools.\n\nFor years, living history museums were relatively nonexistent outside of Scandinavia, though some military garrisons in North America used some living history techniques. Living history museums in the United States were initially established by entrepreneurs, such as John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford, and since then have proliferated within the museum world. Some of the earliest living history museums in the United States include Colonial Williamsburg (1926), Greenfield Village (1929), Conner Prairie Pioneer Settlement (1930s), Old Sturbridge Village (1946), and Plimoth Plantation (1947). Many living history farms and similar farm and agricultural museums have united under an association known as the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM).\n\nMaritime museums are museums that specialize in the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just as there is a wide variety of museum types, there are also many different types of maritime museums. First, as mentioned above, maritime museums can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime setting. A second type is the maritime history museum, dedicated to educating the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and Mystic Seaport. Military-focused maritime museums are a third variety, of which the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and Battleship IOWA Museum are examples.\n\nMedical museums today are largely an extinct subtype of museum with a few notable exceptions, such as the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in Glasgow, Scotland. The origins of the medical museum date back to Renaissance cabinets of curiosities which often featured displays of human skeletal material and other materia medica. Apothecaries and physicians collected specimens as a part of their professional activities and to increase their professional status among their peers. As the medical profession placed greater emphasis on teaching and the practice of materia medica in the late 16th century, medical collections became a fundamental component of a medical student's education. New developments in preserving soft tissue samples long term in spirits appeared in the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century physicians like John Hunter were using personal anatomical collections as teaching tools. By the early 19th century, many hospitals and medical colleges in Great Britain had built sizable teaching collections. In the United States, the nation's first hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, already had a collection of plaster casts and crayon drawings of the stages of pregnancy as early as 1762.\n\nMedical museums functioned as an integral part of medical students education through the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Dry and wet anatomical specimens, casts, drawings, oil paintings, and photographs provided a means for medical students to compare healthy anatomical specimens with abnormal, or diseased organs. Museums, like the Mütter, added medical instruments and equipment to their collections to preserve and teach the history of the medical profession. By the 1920s, medical museums had reached their nadir and began to wane in their importance as institutes of medical knowledge and training. Medical teaching shifted towards training medical students in hospitals and laboratories, and over the course of the 20th century most medical museums disappeared from the museum horizon. The few surviving medical museums, like the Mütter Museum, have managed to survive by broadening their mission of preserving and disseminating medical knowledge to include the general public, rather than exclusively catering to medical professionals.\n\nMemorial museums are museums dedicated both to educating the public about and commemorating a specific historic event, usually involving mass suffering. The concept gained traction throughout the 20th century as a response to the numerous and well publicized mass atrocities committed during that century. The events commemorated by memorial museums tend to involve mostly civilian victims who died under \"morally problematic circumstances\" that cannot easily be interpreted as heroic. There are frequently unresolved issues concerning the identity, culpability, and punishment of the perpetrators of these killings and memorial museums often play an active research role aimed at benefiting both the victims and those prosecuting the perpetrators.\n\nToday there are numerous prominent memorial museums including the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Toul Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the District Six Museum in Cape Town, South Africa, and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City. Although the concept of a memorial museum is largely a product of the 20th century, there are museums of this type that focus on events from other periods, an example being the House of Slaves (Maisons des Esclaves) in Senegal which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and acts as a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nMemorial museums differ from traditional history museums in several key ways, most notably in their dual mission to incorporate both a moral framework for and contextual explanations of an event. While traditional history museums tend to be in neutral institutional settings, memorial museums are very often situated at the scene of the atrocity they seek to commemorate. Memorial museums also often have close connections with, and advocate for, a specific clientele who have a special relationship to the event or its victims, such as family members or survivors, and regularly hold politically significant special events. Unlike many traditional history museums, memorial museums almost always have a distinct, overt political and moral message with direct ties to contemporary society. The following mission statement of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is typical in its focus on commemoration, education and advocacy:\n\n\"The museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy.\"\n\nMilitary museums specialize in military histories; they are often organized from a national point of view, where a museum in a particular country will have displays organized around conflicts in which that country has taken part. They typically include displays of weapons and other military equipment, uniforms, wartime propaganda, and exhibits on civilian life during wartime, and decorations, among others. A military museum may be dedicated to a particular or area, such as the Imperial War Museum Duxford for military aircraft, Deutsches Panzermuseum for tanks, the Lange Max Museum for the Western Front (World War I), the International Spy Museum for espionage, The National World War I Museum for World War I, the D-Day Paratroopers Historical Center (Normandy) for WWII airborne, or more generalist, such as the Canadian War Museum or the Musée de l'Armée.\nFor the Italian alpine wall one can find the most popular museum of bunkers in the small museum n8bunker at Olang / Kronplatz in the heard of the dolomites of South Tyrol.\n\nMobile museum is a term applied to museums that make exhibitions from a vehicle- such as a van. Some institutions, such as St. Vital Historical Society and the Walker Art Center, use the term to refer to a portion of their collection that travels to sites away from the museum for educational purposes. Other mobile museums have no \"home site\", and use travel as their exclusive means of presentation. University of Louisiana in Lafayette has also created a mobile museum as part of the graduate program in History. The project is called Museum on the Move.\n\nMuseums of natural history and natural science typically exhibit work of the natural world. The focus lies on nature and culture. Exhibitions educate the public on natural history, dinosaurs, zoology, oceanography, anthropology, and more. Evolution, environmental issues, and biodiversity are major areas in natural science museums. Notable museums include the Natural History Museum in London, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in Oxford, the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nOpen-air museums collect and re-erect old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past. The first one was King Oscar II's collection near Oslo in Norway, opened in 1881. In 1907, it was incorporated into the Norsk Folkemuseum. In 1891, inspired by a visit to the open-air museum in Oslo, Artur Hazelius founded the Skansen in Stockholm, which became the model for subsequent open-air museums in Northern and Eastern Europe, and eventually in other parts of the world. Most open-air museums are located in regions where wooden architecture prevail, as wooden structures may be translocated without substantial loss of authenticity. A more recent but related idea is realized in ecomuseums, which originated in France.\n\nA concept developed in the 1990s, the pop-up museum is generally defined as a short term institution existing in a temporary space. These temporary museums are finding increasing favor among more progressive museum professionals as a means of direct community involvement with objects and exhibition. Often, the pop-up concept relies solely on visitors to provide both the objects on display and the accompanying labels with the professionals or institution providing only the theme of the pop-up and the space in which to display the objects, an example of shared historical authority. Due to the flexibility of the pop-up museums and their rejection of traditional structure, even these latter provisions need not be supplied by an institution; in some cases the themes have been chosen collectively by a committee of interested participants while exhibitions designated as pop-ups have been mounted in places as varied as community centers and even a walk-in closet.\nSome examples of pop-up museums include:\n\nScience museums and technology centers or technology museums revolve around scientific achievements, and marvels and their history. To explain complicated inventions, a combination of demonstrations, interactive programs and thought-provoking media are used. Some museums may have exhibits on topics such as computers, aviation, railway museums, physics, astronomy, and the animal kingdom. The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago is a very popular museum.\n\nScience museums traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic value, echoes of the 'curiosity cabinets' of the Renaissance period. These early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which emerged in the fifteenth century from 'an attempt to manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced. Science museums were institutions of authoritative, uncontestable, knowledge, places of 'collecting, seeing and knowing, places where \"anybody\" might come and survey the evidence of science. Dinosaurs, extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections, plant taxonomies, and so on – these were the orders of the day. By the nineteenth century, science museums had flourished, and with it 'the capacity of exhibitionary representation to render the world as visible and ordered... part of the instantiation of wider senses of scientific and political certainty' (MacDonald, 1998: 11). By the twentieth century, museums of science had built 'on their earlier emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation between the obscure world of science and that of the public.\n\nThe nineteenth century also brought a proliferation of science museums with roots in technical and industrial heritage museums. Ordinarily, visitors individually interact with exhibits, by a combination of manipulating, reading, pushing, pulling, and generally using their senses. Information is carefully structured through engaging, interactive displays. Science centers include interactive exhibits that respond to the visitor's action and invite further response, as well as hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor, In general, science centers offer 'a decontextualized scattering of interactive exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas usually presented in small rooms or galleries, with scant attention paid to applications of science, social political contexts, or moral and ethical implications.\n\nBy the 1960s, these interactive science centers with their specialized hands-on galleries became prevalent. The Exploratorium in San Francisco, and the Ontario Science Centre in 1969, were two of the earliest examples of science centers dedicated to exploring scientific principles through hands-on exhibits. In the United States practically every major city has a science center with a total annual visitation of 115 million New technologies of display and new interpretive experiments mark these interactive science centers, and the mantra 'public understanding of science' aptly describes their central activity.\n\nScience museums, in particular, may consist of planetaria, or large theatre usually built around a dome. Museums may have IMAX feature films, which may provide 3-D viewing or higher quality picture. As a result, IMAX content provides a more immersive experience for people of all ages.\n\nAlso new virtual museums, known as \"Net Museums\", have recently been created. These are usually websites belonging to real museums and containing photo galleries of items found in those real museums. This new presentation is very useful for people living far away who wish to see the contents of these museums.\n\nA number of different museums exist to demonstrate a variety of topics. Music museums may celebrate the life and work of composers or musicians, such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, or even the Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Other music museums include live music recitals, such as the Handel House Museum in London, England.\n\nIn Glendale, Arizona, the Bead Museum fosters an appreciation and understanding of the global, historical, cultural, and artistic significance of beads and related artifacts dating as far back as 15,000 years. Also residing in the American Southwest are living history towns such as Tombstone, Arizona. This historical town is home to a number of \"living history\" museums (such as the O.K. Corral and the Tombstone Epitaph) in which visitors can learn about historical events from actors playing the parts of historical figures like Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and John Clum. Colonial Williamsburg (in Williamsburg, Virginia), is another great example of a town devoted to preserving the story of America through reenactment.\nSouth Korea is host to the world's first museum devoted to the history and development of organic farming, the Namyangju Organic Museum, with exhibit captions in both Korean and English, and which opened in 2011.\n\nThe No Show Museum, based in Zurich and Johannesburg, is the world's first museum dedicated to nothing and its various manifestations throughout the history of art.\n\nMuseums targeted for youth, such as children's museums or toy museums in many parts of the world, often exhibit interactive and educational material on a wide array of topics, for example, the Museum of Toys and Automata in Spain. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the \"Borusseum\", the museum about Borussia Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany, are institutions of the sports category. The Corning Museum of Glass is devoted to the art, history, and science of glass. The National Museum of Crime & Punishment explores the science of solving crimes. The Great American Dollhouse Museum in Danville, Kentucky, depicts American social history in miniature. Interpretation centres are modern museums or visitors centres that often use new means of communication with the public. In some cases, museums cover an extremely wide range of topics together, such as the Museum of World Treasures in Wichita, KS. In other instances, museums emphasize regional culture and natural history, such as the Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin, Tarapoto, Peru. The Museum of Salt and Pepper Shakers shows the history and variety of an everyday item.\n\nA development, with the expansion of the web, is the establishment of virtual museums and online exhibitions. Online initiatives like the Virtual Museum of Canada and the National Museum of the United States Air Force provide physical museums with a web presence. Online curatorial platforms such as Rhizome or the Archive of Digital Art (ADA) developed online exhibitions that transform the museal experience within the digital space.\n\nSome virtual museums have no counterpart in the real world, such as LIMAC (Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima), which has no physical location and might be confused with the city's own museum. The art historian Griselda Pollock elaborated a virtual feminist museum, spreading between classical art to contemporary art.\n\nSome real life museums are also using the internet for virtual tours and exhibitions. In 2010, the Whitney Museum in New York organized what it called the first ever online Twitter museum tour.\n\nAlthough zoos and botanical gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are in fact \"living museums\". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop, and manage collections. They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. Notable zoos include the San Diego Zoo, the London Zoo, Brookfield Zoo at Chicago, Berlin Zoological Garden, the Bronx Zoo in New York City, Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and Zürich Zoologischer Garten in Switzerland. Notable botanic gardens include The New York Botanical Garden, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Chicago Botanic Garden, Taipei Botanical Garden, Bogor Botanical Garden, and Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2457647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2457647", "title": "National Computing Centre", "text": "National Computing Centre\n\nThe National Computing Centre (NCC) was an independent not-for-profit membership and research organisation in the UK.\n\nAfter the original organisation was liquidated in 2010, Redholt Limited changed its name to the National Computing Centre Limited (NCC Ltd) and acquired the assets of the original NCC through a pre-pack administration arrangement. This new for-profit company, formed in 2010, initially offered some of the same the services as the original NCC but in 2012 became a shell company as it had to file for protection from its creditors and make most of its staff redundant.\n\nThe National Computing Centre was founded on 10 June 1966 by the Labour government, as an autonomous not-for-profit organisation, in order to be the \"voice of the computer user\", encourage the growth of computer usage in the UK and ensure that the necessary education and training was made available. NCC was one of the visible outcomes from Harold Wilson's \"White Heat of Technology\" speech and the formation of a Ministry of Technology, the others being the computer company International Computers Limited (ICL) and chip maker INMOS (both now defunct).\n\nInitially, most income came directly from government grants, but with the growth of NCC's commercial operations this ceased in 1989. During the 1970s and 1980s NCC had a joint venture with Blackwell Publishing (NCC Blackwell) which was a significant publisher of academic computing books.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1996 NCC operated with five main divisions – education, consulting, escrow, membership services, and system engineering deriving income from membership fees and its commercial activities.\n\nIn 1996, the National Computing Centre sold its overseas education business, NCC Education, to stave off a financial crisis that occurred when the company breached its borrowing limits.\n\nIn 1999, it sold its commercial divisions (turnover of less than £10m), which provided escrow, consultancy, system engineering services to its existing management team supported by ECI ventures for £5m. This new company was named NCC Services Limited and later became NCC Group Limited of which the National Computing Centre held a 20% share. John Perkins became the new Managing Director of National Computing Centre, which remained a not-for-profit membership organisation.\n\nThe NCC Services Ltd management team of Managing Director Chris Pearse and directors John Morris, Peter Bird, and Chris Sadler was strengthened in March 2000 by the appointment of Rob Cotton as Finance Director and who also took over control of the Escrow division in May of that year, with Morris leaving at that time. Following a substantial fall off of revenues as Y2K came and passed, and due to the failure of the company before this date to invest in its general consultancy, security, system engineering and escrow business during the Y2K period, the group began to make monthly losses before the benefits of the changes to the escrow business instigated by Rob Cotton were felt and the company returned to profitability.\n\nRenamed NCC Group, in May 2000, and with escrow now the cornerstone of the group, Rob Cotton led a secondary management buy-out in 2003 valuing NCC Group at £30m and supported by Barclays Private Equity. At this point, the National Computing Centre sold its shares in NCC Group as did Pearse, Bird and Sadler who left the business. The NCC Group subsequently floated on the AIM stock market in 2004 for £55m and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007 with a market capitalisation of nearly £390m as of June 2014.\n\nNCC received substantial proceeds from the sale of NCC Group Limited (circa £11M between 2000 and 2003 plus dividends) and from the multi-million sale of its iconic Manchester city centre buildings (Armstrong House and Oxford House, now the home of NCC Group plc) to Bruntwood Group. Following the retirement of Perkins, Michael Gough was appointed as CEO in 2000 and NCC pursued a new strategy of rapidly developing and expanding its membership services by acquisition.\n\nIn 2002 NCC adopted a policy of vigorous support for open-source software.\n\nOver the six years from 2000, and particularly after the second sale of its shares in NCC Group in 2003, acquisitions accelerated until all of the company's funds had been used to acquire a number of related companies, membership organisations, publications, publishing rights and to fund joint ventures. The acquisitions included: Management Consultancy News; Conspectus; CIO Connect; The Construction Industry Computing Association; Certus; The Evaluation Centre; Institute of IT Training; The Impact Programme; and PMP. Publishing rights acquired included the Naked Leader and joint ventures included: the NCC/Ashridge Business School MBA; NCC/AQA Applied ICT; and ProfIT.\n\nFunds were also spent on a major refurbishment of offices in Manchester, developing a quickly redundant hosting centre and leasing opulent offices in London, all of which was entirely inappropriate for an organisation of this size. Additionally, funds were spent attempting to develop new products and services including The Open Source Academy, The Evaluation Centre and NCC Midas Web Hosting all of which proved commercially unsuccessful.\n\nThere was also an expensive re-branding exercise in which NCC re-branded as Principia, a brand that was quickly dropped and the NCC brand resumed, a move that seemed to echo a similarly named and equally disastrous re-branding of the UK Royal Mail to Consignia.\n\nThe strategy initiated and implemented by Michael Gough totally failed and the National Computing Centre diminished rapidly in size and turnover. With the many millions received now spent, NCC continued to make unsustainable losses but there was no change in strategic direction. By 2007 to stem the losses NCC was forced to rapidly close or dispose of many of the acquisitions at a vast loss to the organisation as well as to close a number of only recently established operations. Michael Gough left the business in February 2008.\n\nIn March 2008, Steve Markwell was appointed as Chief Executive but there was no improvement in the company's fortunes or significant change in strategic direction. The only significant asset remaining, Filetab, was transferred in 2009 to a new company called NCC Filetab whose Managing Director was also Managing Director of NCC. With losses and the size of the pension fund deficit increasing, the company was unable to meet its obligations and was placed into administration by its management.\n\nIn February 2010, NCC went into administration and ultimately liquidation. The few remaining assets and intellectual property rights were transferred in a \"pre-pack\" administration arrangement to Redholt Ltd a new private company, thus distancing the new company from the NCC creditors, which included a substantial pension fund liability resulting in the insolvency of the pension fund later that year. Redholt Ltd was owned by a group of six shareholders, including former managers and two Directors of the insolvent National Computing Centre\n\nRedholt Ltd, was renamed as The National Computing Centre Limited (NCC Ltd) in Feb 2011. In 2011 NCC Ltd extended its portfolio of services to include IT consulting, mainly as a virtual organisation through the use of independent associate consultants. The 'new' NCC Ltd was not a mutual not-for-profit organisation, but retained some of the member organisations of the liquidated company and initially it delivered some of the same products and services.\n\nBy the end of 2011, the 'new' NCC Ltd once again faced financial difficulties and in 2012 it sought voluntary arrangements with its creditors to step away from its debts. The company had run up substantial losses, had not paid suppliers and had not filed accounts. Nearly all staff were laid off and the business having already left its iconic building in 2010 it finally left Manchester. The company was formally recorded at Companies House as being insolvent and in a voluntary arrangement as of 2 March 2012. The insolvency practitioner dealing with the companies affairs was Wilkins Kennedy of London. It would appear that from this point NCC Ltd was no longer recognised by any trade body, association or any part of government as the \"voice of the computer user\" and offered no substantial services to its client base and became a shell company. In July 2013 the registered address was changed to an accommodation address in London and between then and July 2017 the operational address was at times listed as Aston Abbotts in Buckinghamshire, Bournemouth and Welwyn Garden City.\n\nIn July 2017 NCC Ltd changed its name to IT Accreditations Limited and the ncc.co.uk domain name and company name became the property of NCC Group plc, so ending 50 years of an organisation trading as The National Computing Centre.\n\n"}

{"id": "5481123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5481123", "title": "Re-Mission", "text": "Re-Mission\n\nThe Re-Mission games for young cancer patients were conceived by Pam Omidyar and designed based research by the nonprofit HopeLab Foundation, with direct input from young cancer patients and oncology doctors and nurses, and game developer Realtime Associates, among others. The games engage young cancer patients through entertaining game play while impacting specific psychological and behavioral outcomes associated with successful cancer treatment. HopeLab has made \"Re-Mission\" games available at no charge to young people with cancer and their families, as well as oncology healthcare workers and institutions around the world.\n\nThe original \"Re-Mission\" game was released in 2006 as a Microsoft Windows based third-person shooter based in the serious games genre. In \"Re-Mission\", the player controls an RX5-E (\"Roxxi\") nanobot who is designed to be injected into the human body and fight particular types of cancer and related infections such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia, at a cellular level. The player must also monitor patient health and report any symptoms back to Dr. West (the in-game doctor and project leader). Each of the 20 levels is designed to inform the patient on a variety of treatments, how they function, and the importance of maintaining strict adherence to those treatments. Various \"weapons\" are used, such as the Chemoblaster, Radiation Gun, and antibiotic rocket.\n\nCopies of \"Re-Mission\" were distributed at no charge to others, though donations were accepted. As of 2012, more than 200,000 copies of \"Re-Mission\" had been distributed in 81 countries, placing it among the most successful serious games to date. HopeLab engaged organizations and individuals worldwide to facilitate distribution of the game to teens and young adults with cancer. On May 30, 2007, Cigna HealthCare announced a partnership with HopeLab in which Cigna distributes copies of \"Re-Mission\" to its members at no cost. HopeLab has also partnered with Starlight Children's Foundation and the ESA Foundation to distribute Re-Mission.\n\n\"Re-Mission 2 is\" the follow-up game released in 2006. A collection of free online games, \"Re-Mission 2\" is designed to improve psychological and behavioral outcomes associated with cancer treatment adherence. Each game puts players inside the body to fight cancer with weapons like chemotherapy, antibiotics and the body’s natural defenses. Game play parallels real-world strategies used to fight cancer and win. More than 120 young people with cancer participated in the research and development of the games.\n\n\"Re-Mission 2\" applies insights from a brain-imaging study published in 2012 by HopeLab and Stanford University researchers, showing that the Re-Mission video game strongly activates brain circuits involved in positive motivation. This reward-related activation is associated with a shift in attitudes and emotions that helped boost players’ adherence to prescribed chemotherapy and antibiotic treatments in a previous study. As a result, each \"Re-Mission 2\" game is designed to boost positive emotion, increase self-efficacy, and shift attitudes toward chemotherapy.\n\nEach \"Re-Mission 2\" game puts players inside the body to defeat cancer, using weapons like chemotherapy, antibiotics and the body’s immune cells. The games are designed specifically for teens and young adults who are at risk of adverse cancer outcomes due to poor treatment adherence. Research on \"Re-Mission 2\" shows that the new games are as effective as the original \"Re-Mission\" game in increasing players’ self-efficacy, boosting positive emotions and shifting attitudes about chemotherapy.\n\"Re-Mission 2\" games are free to play online at re-mission2.org, and \"Re-Mission 2: Nanobot’s Revenge\" is available for download as a mobile app for iOS and Android devices. The browser-based games and mobile app offer a variety of game play styles for young cancer patients who spend time online and on mobile devices.\n\nHopeLab conducted an international, multicenter randomized controlled trial to gauge the efficacy of Re-Mission as it relates to compliance with prescribed chemotherapy and antibiotic treatments, cancer-related knowledge, and self-efficacy. The study enrolled 375 cancer patients aged 13–29 at 34 medical centers in the United States, Canada and Australia. Subjects received either computers pre-loaded with a popular commercial video game (the control group) or computers preloaded with the same control game plus Re-Mission. Study results indicated that playing Re-Mission led to more consistent treatment adherence, faster rate of increase in cancer knowledge, and faster rate of increase in self-efficacy in young cancer patients. These findings were published in August 2008 in the peer-reviewed medical journal \"Pediatrics\". Notably, to ascertain treatment compliance, researches used objective blood tests to measure levels of prescribed chemotherapy in the bodies of study participants rather than subjective self-report questionnaires, and electronic pill-cap monitors were used to determine utilization of prescribed antibiotics. Researchers concluded that a carefully designed video game can have a positive impact on health behavior in young people with chronic illness and that video-game–based interventions may constitute a component of a broader integrative approach to healthcare that synergistically combines rationally targeted biological and behavioral interventions to aid patients in the prevention, detection, treatment, and recovery from disease. HopeLab conducted additional research to understand the mechanisms of action that make \"Re-Mission\" effective. Results of an fMRI study of \"Re-Mission\" showing the impact of the game on neurological processes were presented in August 2008 at the 10th International Congress of the Society of Behavioral Medicine. This research informed HopeLab's development of \"Re-Mission 2\".\n\n\n"}

As principal of GBQC, select major projects include Pender Labs at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Police Headquarters, the Liberty State Park master plan, the Philadelphia Center City master plan, and his best-known work, the Dining Commons, Birch Garden, and Academic Building at the Institute for Advanced Study. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects; recipient of honorary doctorates from Princeton University, City College of New York, and the New Jersey School of Architecture/NJIT; recipient of the Topaz Award from the American Institute of Architects and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, and, along with his firm, is the recipient of the Architecture Firm Award.\n\nGeddes was born Robert Leon Goldberg on December 7, 1923 in Philadelphia, the only child of Louis J. Geddes (born Goldberg) and Kate Geddes (born Malmed), both of Ukrainian-Jewish families settled in Woodbine, New Jersey by Maurice de Hirsch. He grew up and attended elementary school in Ventnor City, New Jersey; John Burroughs Middle School in the Hancock Park, Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Angeles; and graduated from Atlantic City High School in 1941. He started university studies at the University of California, Berkeley, transferring to Yale University in the fall of 1942 due to concerns over transcontinental travel after the start of World War II. His university studies were interrupted by three years in the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945. He left Yale in 1947 for the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he earned an M. Arch. in 1950.\n\nArchitect\n\nIn 1953, he co-founded a collaborative practice, Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham: Architects (also known as GBQC Architects), in Philadelphia, later adding an office in Princeton. Prior to founding GBQC, he worked briefly for Hugh Stubbins, Jr. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. GBQC won national and international competitions and awards, starting with being runner-up in the Sydney Opera House design competition (1955). He was GBQC design partner or co-partner for the Pender Labs at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; the Police Headquarters of the City of Philadelphia; Richard Stockton College in New Jersey; Hill Hall at Rutgers University-Newark; the College of Liberal Arts of Southern Illinois University; the Architects Housing in Trenton, New Jersey; Princeton Community Housing’s Griggs Farm neighborhood; and probably best known, the Dining Hall and Birch Garden quad at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Design, and GBQC was awarded the highest professional honor of the American Institute for Architects, the Architecture Firm Award (1979), for “design quality, respect for the environment, and social concern.”\n\nUrbanist\n\nHe was the urban design consultant for the Center City Plan of Philadelphia (1988), and for the Third Regional Plan of New York for the Regional Plan Association (1996). GBQC won first prize in the international design competition for Vienna-South urban extension (1972), and the GBQC master plan for Liberty State Park was exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art (1979). He worked with the City University of New York’s Newman Institute on alternatives for the Hudson Yards in midtown Manhattan. He co-founded the civic association, Princeton Future, which created the concept design for the new plaza, housing and parking in downtown Princeton, New Jersey. For the United Nations Center for Human Settlements, he directed the “UNCHS Conference on Cities in North America”, produced its report “Cities in Our Future”, published by Island Press, and wrote for the journal American Prospect, “Metropolis Unbound: The Sprawling American City and the Search for Alternatives.”\n\nEducator\n\nAfter studying at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in the post-war Walter Gropius and Joseph Hudnut era, he taught architecture and civic design at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design (formerly University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts) from 1951 to 1965.\n\nHe moved to Princeton University in 1965 to become the first Dean of the School of Architecture, and is now William Kennan Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership over 17 years, the School of Architecture emerged as a major center for the exchange of architectural ideas, while retaining its small size and close connections with the rest of the university.\n\nIn 1990, he was appointed the Henry Luce Professor of Architecture, Urbanism, and History at New York University, and was elected a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities. \nHe pioneered in connecting architecture with the humanities and social sciences, and with public affairs and urban design, and is best known for his undergraduate course at Princeton and NYU, Architecture 101, “Buildings, Landscapes, and Cities.” He was co-author of the Princeton Report on Architectural Education for the American Institute of Architects (1967).\n\n• Pender Labs, Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania (1958, demolished 2003)\n• Sydney Opera House, Sydney, Australia.

{"id": "217914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217914", "title": "Rote learning", "text": "Rote learning\n\nRote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. The idea is that one will be able to quickly recall the meaning of the material the more one repeats it. Some of the alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, and active learning.\n\nRote methods are routinely used when fast memorization is required, such as learning one's lines in a play or memorizing a telephone number.\n\nRote learning is widely used in the mastery of foundational knowledge. Examples of school topics where rote learning is frequently used include phonics in reading, the periodic table in chemistry, multiplication tables in mathematics, anatomy in medicine, cases or statutes in law, basic formulae in any science, etc. By definition, rote learning eschews comprehension, so by itself it is an ineffective tool in mastering any complex subject at an advanced level. For instance, one illustration of rote learning can be observed in preparing quickly for exams, a technique which may be colloquially referred to as \"cramming\".\n\nRote learning is sometimes disparaged with the derogative terms \"parrot fashion\", \"regurgitation\", \"cramming\", or \"mugging\" because one who engages in rote learning may give the wrong impression of having understood what they have written or said. It is strongly discouraged by many new curriculum standards. For example, science and mathematics standards in the United States specifically emphasize the importance of deep understanding over the mere recall of facts, which is seen to be less important. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics stated: More than ever, mathematics must include the mastery of concepts instead of mere memorization and the following of procedures. More than ever, school mathematics must include an understanding of how to use technology to arrive meaningfully at solutions to problems instead of endless attention to increasingly outdated computational tedium.However, advocates of traditional education have criticized the new American standards as slighting learning basic facts and elementary arithmetic, and replacing content with process-based skills. In math and science, rote methods are often used, for example to memorize formulas. There is greater understanding if students commit a formula to memory through exercises that use the formula rather than through rote repetition of the formula. Newer standards often recommend that students derive formulas themselves to achieve the best understanding. Nothing is faster than rote learning if a formula must be learned quickly for an imminent test and rote methods can be helpful for committing an understood fact to memory. However, students who learn with understanding are able to transfer their knowledge to tasks requiring problem-solving with greater success than those who learn only by rote.\n\nOn the other side, those who disagree with the inquiry-based philosophy maintain that students must first develop computational skills before they can understand concepts of mathematics. These people would argue that time is better spent practicing skills rather than in investigations inventing alternatives, or justifying more than one correct answer or method. In this view, estimating answers is insufficient and, in fact, is considered to be dependent on strong foundational skills. Learning abstract concepts of mathematics is perceived to depend on a solid base of knowledge of the tools of the subject. Thus, these people believe that rote learning is an important part of the learning process.\n\nEugène Ionesco commented upon rote learning in his play \"The Lesson\".\n\nWhile the system is widely practiced in schools in Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Romania, Italy, South Korea, Turkey, Malta, and Greece, it has been criticised by numerous academics.\n\nRote learning is also used to describe a simple learning pattern used in machine learning, although it does not involve repetition, unlike the usual meaning of rote learning. The machine is programmed to keep a history of calculations and compare new input against its history of inputs and outputs, retrieving the stored output if present. This pattern requires that the machine can be modeled as a pure function — always producing same output for same input — and can be formally described as follows:\n\nRote learning was used by Samuel's Checkers on an IBM 701, a milestone in the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nSee also Memoization.\n\nThe flashcard, outline, and mnemonic device are traditional tools for memorizing course material and are examples of rote learning.\n\n"}

In a daily student migration, every school day they arrive in and exit from Hong Kong primarily through 5 land boundary control points: Lo Wu, Sha Tau Kok, Lok Ma Chau, Man Kam To, and Shenzhen Bay. They mainly study in Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, Tai Po while the majority in the North district.\n\nSince the 2001 Chong Fung Yuen “Right of abode” case, babies born in Hong Kong to mainland women are entitled the right of abode in Hong Kong. Favoured with the 2003 Individual Visit Scheme, a large number of mainland pregnant women came to Hong Kong to give birth for their children's right of residence. Accordingly, the number of cross-boundary students, who are also doubly non-permanent resident children, surged since 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, with the low-birth rate in Hong Kong, a portion of primary and secondary schools were\nforced to close down, especially those in rural areas. To maintain their operation, some schools\nwelcome these children to study under them to increase the admission rate. This results in a further elevation\nof the number of cross-boundary students.\n\nIn recent years, mainland schools no longer accept applications of children who do not have Hukou in\nmainland with only a Hong Kong citizenship. Children born in Hong Kong and live in mainland can either\nstudy in mainland international schools or schools located in Hong Kong. Despite the new policy rejecting\n“Double-not” pregnant women, the number of cross-boundary students will certainly continue rising until\n2017/18.\n\nAccording to the “Report on Primary One Admission 2012” around 20% of the Northern District students were sent to the 11th or onward primary school places. The growth of the cross-border students who are \"neither-is\" and \"either-is\" children. Thus, there are insufficient places for primary one in Northern district.\n\nHong Kong government suggested small group education to provide better education standards a few years ago. The growth of CBS in Northern District would lead to the increase of classes and the class size of primary one, from 27 to around 39-42 in 2013. Heavier workloads and more pressure are thus given to the teachers. The difference between \"neither-is\" or \"either-is\" children and local children in culture and abilities, placed stress on teachers as it was, and is, impossible for the schools to separate those \"neither-is\" and \"either-is\" students apart from locals. More resources are also needed for the schools to provide support to students who have special needs. This is because there is no special education in China, and parents in mainland prefer main line schools in Hong Kong rather than special schools for their children with special needs. Resulting in added pressure on the teachers in the Northern district to provide extra care for those children.\n\nLocal children are unable to secure places in Northern district primary schools. It is inconvenient for them to study in other districts. The increase of class size may affect the quality of education. The unnecessary transportation of CBS worsened the problems of transportation system in the Northern District.\n\nIn 2012, the Shenzhen government did not allow those \"neither-is\" or \"either-is\" children who are classified as Hong Kong residents to study in Shenzhen government schools. Thus, Shenzhen parents let their children to study in Hong Kong where there is also better education quality. They allow their children to live in Hong Kong due to the long travel time to Hong Kong. This can ultimately lead to unhealthy growth both mentally and physically of CBS due to the separation of family.\n\nCross-boundary students (CBS) have to attend school and return home every day, usually without the company of their parents. Ways for CBS to come to Hong Kong include Cross Boundary School Coaches (CBSC), nanny buses and public transport. Since the pick-up/drop-off points at the current boundary control points are limited, students may need to get on or off the coaches and nanny buses in crowded areas and are exposed to dangers of traffic accidents and kidnapping.\n\nGrowing concerns are also raised regarding the insufficient issues of Closed Road Permits necessary for CBCS and Closed Area Permits for students who take the nanny bus service. Though the government figure reveals a rise of issues per year, parents and schools are demanding for more quotas due to the increasing rates of cross-boundary students.\n\nThe difference between Hong Kong and Mainland China’s culture has led to difficulties for CBS to adjust their identity. With a lack of understanding in Hong Kong’s culture, systems and values, failure to naturalize and adapt in Hong Kong is common among CBS.\n\nLanguage differences result in communication difficulty since many of the CBS are more fluent in Mandarin than Cantonese. Further enhancing the difficulty of connecting with local students. Little participation of after-school extra–curriculum activities due to their shuffling across boundaries, are also common reasons for the lack of development socially.\n\nThe government starts the pilot scheme, allocates Closed Area Permits (CAP) for cross-boundary students in higher priority, issues special quotas for their coaches and provides travel subsidy for students.\n\nOn 23 March 2013, Undersecretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said that school places would be increased and students living in the Northern District can study through the Return System if they are allocated to study in Tai Po District.\n\nOn the 6th of February 2013, Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim declared that a new school net should be set up for the cross-boundary students.\n\nOn 6 February 2013, honorary chairman of Liberal Party James Tien Pei-chun suggested the Education Bureau to pay for the school places in Shenzhen and provide free education for the cross-boundary students.\n\n\nHuman migration\n"}
{"id": "707070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707070", "title": "Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)", "text": "Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)\n\nBorn in Nagoya, Japan in 1898, as one of twelve children, Shinichi spent his childhood working at his father's violin factory (current Suzuki Violin Co., Ltd.), putting up violin soundposts. A family friend encouraged Shinichi to study Western culture, but his father felt that it was beneath Suzuki to be a performer. He began to teach himself how to play the violin in 1916, however, after being inspired by a recording of Mischa Elman. Without access to professional instruction, he listened to recordings and tried to imitate what he heard.\n\nAt the age of 26, the Marquis Tokugawa, a friend of Suzuki, persuaded his father to allow him to study in Germany, where he studied under Karl Klingler. In Germany, he claimed to have spent time under the guardianship of Albert Einstein. He also met and married his wife, Waltraud Prange (1905–2000). Upon his return to Japan, he formed a string quartet with his brothers and began teaching at the Imperial School of Music and at the Kunitachi Music School in Tokyo and started to take interest in developing the music education of young students in violin. During World War II, his father's violin factory was converted into a factory to construct seaplane floats. Consequently, it was bombed by American war planes and one of his brothers died as a result. During this time, he and his wife finally evacuated to separate locations when conditions became too unsafe for her as an ex-German citizen, and the factory was struggling to operate due to lack of wood supply. Suzuki left with other family members for a rural mountainous region to secure wood from a geta factory and his wife had to move to a \"German village\" where other Germans and ex-Germans were sequestered. Once the war was over, he was invited to teach at a new music school being formed, and agreed to the position with the condition he would be allowed to develop teaching music to children from infancy and early childhood. He adopted into his family and continued the music education of one of his pre-wartime students, Koji, once he learned he was a wartime orphan. He and his wife were eventually reunited and moved to Matsumoto where he continued to teach.\n\nHe was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.\n\nShinichi Suzuki died at his home in Matsumoto, Japan on 26 January 1998, aged 99.\n\nShinichi Suzuki's experiences as an adult beginner and the philosophies that he held during his life were recapitulated in the lessons he developed to teach his students. Schools of early childhood education have combined his philosophies and approaches with pedagogues such as Orff, Kodály, Montessori, Dalcroze, and Doman.\n\n\"First, to set the record straight, this is not a 'teaching method.' You cannot buy ten volumes of Suzuki books and become a 'Suzuki Teacher.' Dr. Suzuki has developed a philosophy which, when understood to the fullest, can be a philosophy for living. He is not trying to create the world of violinists. His major aim is to open a world of beauty to young children everywhere that they might have greater enjoyment in their lives through the God-given sounds of music\" (Hermann, 1971). \n\nSuzuki developed his ideas through a strong belief in the ideas of \"Talent Education\", a philosophy of instruction that is based on the premise that talent, musical or otherwise, is something that can be developed in any child. At the 1958 National Festival, Suzuki said, Suzuki also collaborated with other thinkers of his time, like Glenn Doman, founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, an organization that studies neurological development in young children. Suzuki and Doman agreed on the premise that all young children had great potential, and Suzuki interviewed Doman for his book \"Where Love is Deep\".\n\nSuzuki employed the following ideas of Talent Education in his music pedagogy schools:\n\nThe epistemological learning aspect, or, as Suzuki called it, the \"mother tongue\" philosophy, is that in which children learn through their own observation of their environment, especially in the learning of their first language. The worldwide Suzuki movement continues to use the theories that Suzuki himself put forward in the mid-1940s and has been continuously developed to this day, stemming from his encouragement of others to continue to develop and research the education of children throughout his lifetime.\n\nSuzuki Talent Education or the Suzuki Method combines a music teaching method with a philosophy that embraces the total development of the child. Suzuki's guiding principle was \"character first, ability second\", and that any child can learn.\n\nIn 2014, 16 years after Suzuki's death, U.S. violin teacher Mark O'Connor, who sells a competing method, wrote a blog post claiming that Suzuki lied about his training in the 1920s. The allegations were quickly refuted by Lois Shepheard, a teacher of the Suzuki method who learned Japanese in Japan and studied with Suzuki, by the International Suzuki Association (ISA), by cellist Amy Sue Barston, and by Talent Education Research Institute (headquartered in Matsumoto, Japan). In particular, the Talent Education Research Institute provided the letters by Prof. Karl Klinger written to Suzuki when he was his student mentioning lesson dates and the pieces that he wanted Suzuki to study with him, and a self-portrait from Dr. Albert Einstein signed \"Dear Mr. Shinichi Suzuki, For our remembrance Albert Einstein.\"\n\n\nSuzuki wrote a number of short books about his method and his life, several of which were translated from Japanese to English by his German born wife, Waltraud Suzuki, including\n\n\nThere are also several biographies of Suzuki, including\n"}

This contrasts with formative assessment, which summarizes the participants' development at a particular time. Summative assessment is widely taught in educational programs in the United States. Scriven claims that while all assessment techniques can be summative, only some are formative.\n\nThe goal of summative assessment is to evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it against a standard or benchmark. Note, 'the end' does not necessarily mean the end of an entire course or module of study. Summative assessments may be distributed throughout a course, after a particular unit (or collection of topics) have been taught, and there are advantages to doing so. In many disciplines in the UK Higher Education sector, there has been a move away from 100% end of course assessments, to a model where summative assessments are distributed across a course, which helps to scaffold students' learning. Summative assessment usually involves students receiving a grade that indicates their level of performance, be it a percentage, pass/fail, or some other form of scale grade. Summative assessments are weighted more than formative assessments.\nFor example-test after 6 months in schools, Semester exams in B. Ed after each 6 months.\n\nSummative assessment is used as an evaluation technique in instructional design. It can provide information on an intervention's efficacy (its ability to do what it was designed to do). Summative evaluation judges the worth, or value, of an intervention at its conclusion.\n\nSummative assessment can be used to refer to assessment of educational faculty by their respective supervisor, with the object of measuring all teachers on the same criteria to determine the level of their performance. In this context summative assessment is meant to meet the school or district's needs for teacher accountability. The evaluation usually takes the shape of a form, and consists of check lists and occasionally narratives. Areas evaluated include classroom climate, instruction, professionalism, and planning and preparation.\n\nMethods of summative assessment aim to summarize overall learning at the completion of the course or unit.\n\n"}

A joint collaboration in materials science, mechanical and electrical engineering, and computer science, Tactile received popular media attention for its rapid pace of development, as well as its inventors all being women in STEM fields with disproportionally low female representation.\n\nTactile provides real-time translation of English text, captured by integrated camera, into braille dynamically rendered on a refreshable display. The end product is to display 36 braille characters at a time on a 5\" x 2\" interface with an intended retail price around US$100. With existing braille display devices priced in the range of $1,500 to $2,500, Tactile has been characterized as a potential \"quantum leap forward for the blind community.\"\n\nThe Tactile team was awarded a $10,000 grant in the MIT IDEAS Global Challenge and was accepted into the Microsoft Patent Program, receiving funding and legal counsel from Microsoft to apply for patent protection in the United States. The application was filed on September 16, 2016 and presently has patent pending status.\n\n"}
