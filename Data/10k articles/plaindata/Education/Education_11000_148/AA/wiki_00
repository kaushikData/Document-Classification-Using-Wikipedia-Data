{"id": "291422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=291422", "title": "Advanced Placement", "text": "Advanced Placement\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) is a program in the United States and Canada created by the College Board which offers college-level curricula and examinations to high school students. American colleges and universities may grant placement and course credit to students who obtain high scores on the examinations. The AP curriculum for each of the various subjects is created for the College Board by a panel of experts and college-level educators in that field of study. For a high school course to have the designation, the course must be audited by the College Board to ascertain that it satisfies the AP curriculum. If the course is approved, the school may use the AP designation and the course will be publicly listed on the AP Course Ledger.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the Ford Foundation created a fund that supported committees studying education. The program, which was then referred to as the \"Kenyon Plan\", was founded and pioneered at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, by the then-college president Gordon Chalmers. The first study was conducted by three prep schools—the Lawrenceville School, Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy—and three universities—Harvard University, Princeton University and Yale University. In 1952 they issued the report \"General Education in School and College: A Committee Report\" which recommended allowing high school seniors to study college level material and to take achievement exams that allowed them to attain college credit for this work. The second committee, the Committee on Admission with Advanced Standing, developed and implemented the plan to choose a curriculum. A pilot program was run in 1952 which covered eleven disciplines. In the 1955-56 school year, it was nationally implemented in ten subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, History, French, German, Spanish, and Latin.\n\nThe College Board, a non-profit organization based in New York City, has run the AP program since 1955. From 1965 to 1989, Harlan Hanson was the director of the Advanced Placement Program. It develops and maintains guidelines for the teaching of higher level courses in various subject areas. In addition, it supports teachers of AP courses and supports universities. These activities are funded through fees required to take the AP exams.\n\nIn 2006, over one million students took over two million Advanced Placement examinations. Many high schools in the United States offer AP courses, though the College Board allows any student to take any examination regardless of participation in its respective course. Therefore, home-schooled students and students from schools that do not offer AP courses have an equal opportunity to take AP exams.\n\nAs of the 2015 testing season, exams cost $91 each, though the cost may be subsidized by local or state programs. Financial aid is available for students who qualify for it; the exam reduction is $26 or $28 per exam from College Board plus an additional $8 rebate per fee-reduced exam from the school. There may be further reductions depending on the state. Out of the $91, $8 goes directly to the school to pay for the administration of the test, which some schools will reduce to lower the cost to the student.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, the College Board announced that four AP courses—French Literature, Latin Literature, Computer Science AB, and Italian Language and Culture—would be discontinued after the 2008–2009 school year due to lack of funding. However, the Italian Language and Culture test was again offered beginning in 2011.\n\nStarting July 2013 AP allowed students for the first time to both view and send their scores online.\n\nThe number of AP exams administered each year has seen a steady increase over the past decade. In 2003, 175,860 English Language and Composition exams were administered. By 2013, this number had risen to 476,277, or an increase of 171%. Such an increase has occurred in nearly all AP exams offered, with the AP Psychology exam seeing a 281% increase over the past decade. In 2017, the most taken AP exam was English Language and Composition with 579,426 students and the least taken AP exam was Japanese Language and Culture with 2,429 students.\n\nThe AP exams begin on the first Monday in May and last ten school days (two weeks).\n\nAP tests are scored on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:\n\nThe multiple choice component of the exam is scored by computer, while the free response and essay portions are scored by trained Readers at the AP Reading each June. The scores on various components are weighted and combined into a raw Composite Score. The Chief Reader for each exam then decides on the grade cutoffs for that year's exam, which determine how the Composite Scores are converted into the final grades. During the process a number of reviews and statistical analyses are performed to ensure that the grading is reliable. The overall goal is for the grades to reflect an absolute scale of performance which can be compared from year to year.\n\nSome colleges use AP test scores to exempt students from introductory coursework, others use them to place students in higher designated courses, and some do both. Each college's policy is different, but most require a minimum score of 3 or 4 to receive college credit. Typically, this appears as a \"CR\" grade on the college transcript, although some colleges and universities will award an A grade for a 5 score. Some countries, such as Germany, that do not offer general admission to their universities and colleges for holders of an American high school diploma without preparatory courses will directly admit students who have completed a specific set of AP tests, depending on the subject they wish to study there.\n\nIn addition, completing AP courses help students qualify for various types of scholarships. According to the College Board, 31 percent of colleges and universities look at AP experience when making scholarship decisions.\n\nBeginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, the College Board changed the scoring method of AP Exams. Total scores on the multiple-choice section are now based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers and, as was the case before, no points are awarded for unanswered questions. However, scoring requirements have also been increased.\n\nStarting with the May 2013 AP Examination Administration, the College Board launched an Internet-based score reporting service. Students can use their 2013 AP Number or Student Number (if one was indicated) along with a College Board Account, to access current and previous years' exam scores. This system can also be used to send scores to colleges and universities for which a four-digit institutional code is assigned.\n\nRecognizing that the cost could be an impediment to students of limited means, a number of states and municipalities independent of the College Board have partially or fully subsidized the cost. For example, the state of Florida reimburses schools districts for the exam costs of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the Montebello Unified School District, the Hawaii Department of Education, New York City Department of Education, and the state of Indiana subsidize all AP Examination fees in subjects of math and science, and the Edmonds School District in suburban Seattle currently subsidizes Advanced Placement fees of students who enroll in the free school lunch program. In addition, some school districts offer free tests to all students enrolled in any Advanced Placement class.\n\nThere are currently 38 courses and exams available through the AP Program. A complete list of courses can be found below:\n\n\n\nBelow are statistics from the 2014 year of exams showing the number of participants, the percentage who obtained a score of three (3) or higher, and the average score. (Students generally need a score of three (3) or higher to receive credit or benefit).\nOne issue to consider is the fact that not all AP students take their course's test. The College Board estimates that about 2/3 of students enrolled in an AP course take the course's AP test. On the other hand, a study of University of California system students found that only about 55% to 60% of AP students took their course's exam.\n\nHowever, \"It has recently become clear . . . that these estimations of overall participation rates mask the variability in participation rates across AP examinations.\" For example, one study of math and science AP courses showed that participation rates were 52.7% for AP Chemistry, 53.6% for AP Physics, 57.7% for AP Biology, and 77.4% for AP Calculus. The largest study on this topic found similar participation rates (49.5% for AP Chemistry, 52.3% for AP Physics, 54.5% for Biology, and 68.9% for Calculus). History exams tend to have slightly higher participation rates (57.9% for AP European History, 58.5% for AP World History, and 62.8% for AP U.S. History), and 65.4% of AP English students took either the AP English Language or AP English Literature exam. This same study found that for \"core AP subjects (i.e., no arts or language subjects)\", the overall test participation rate was 60.8%.\n\nIn February 2014 College Board released data from the previous ten years of AP exams. College Board found that 33.2% of public high school graduates from the class of 2013 had taken an AP exam, compared to 18.9% in 2003. In 2013 20.1% of graduates who had taken an AP test achieved a 3 or higher compared to 12.2% in 2003.\n\nIn the 21st century, independent educational researchers began to question whether AP could maintain high academic standards while experiencing explosive growth. Research has shown that the most popular AP tests tend to have the lowest passing rates, a possible indication that less academically prepared students are enrolling in AP classes. Whether the AP program can serve large numbers of students without decreasing academic rigor is a matter of debate within the education field.\n\nUniversity faculty, such as former professor and high school teacher John Tierney, have expressed doubts about the value of a passing AP score. Students who receive scores of 3 or 4 are being given college credit at fewer universities. Academic departments also criticise the increasing proportion of students who take and pass AP courses but are not ready for college-level work.\n\nIndependent researchers in education have since 2010 studied the impact of the Advanced Placement program on students' academic achievement. An early study published in \"AP: A critical examination of the Advanced Placement program\" found that students who took AP courses in the sciences but failed the AP exam performed no better in college science courses than students without any AP course at all. Referring to students who complete the course but fail the exam, the head researcher, Phillip M. Sadler, stated in an interview that \"research shows that they don't appear to have learned anything during the year, so there is probably a better course for them\".\n\nTwo other studies compared non-AP students with AP students who had not taken their course's AP exam, had taken the AP exam but did not pass it, or had passed the AP exam. Like Sadler's study, both found that AP students who passed their exam scored highest in other measures of academic achievement. The largest study of this sort, with a sample size of over 90,000, replicated these results and also showed that non-AP students performed with equal levels of academic achievement as AP students who did not take their course's AP exam—even after controlling for over 70 intervening variables. This led the authors to state that AP participation \"... is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses ...\"\n\nSeveral states use Advanced Placement data for accountability purposes, and U.S. News and World Report use data on Advanced Placement course offerings and participation to rank high schools. However, studies of local school districts and the United States as a whole show that increasing AP participation does not increase the overall academic achievement or school quality at the group (e.g., high school, racial/ethnic group, nation) level. This led one researcher to state, \"Clearly, offering AP alone will not magically turn a failing school into a successful one.\"\n\n\n"}

It began in 1996 in direct response to the National Endowment for the Arts' decision to stop funding individual artists.\n\nThe award comes with a grant of $25,000 and is designed to enable exceptional woman artists to further develop their work. Awardees are chosen on the basis of their past accomplishments, their originality and artistic growth, and the quality of their work. Since 1996, some 220 women have received the award and approximately 5.5 million USD has been awarded in total.\n\nThe award was founded by a New York artist who originally chose to remain anonymous. She named the award in reference to a line from Virginia Woolf’s book \"A Room of One’s Own\" and in recognition of all the women artists through the ages who have remained anonymous for various reasons. Nominators, who include art writers, curators, art historians, and previous winners, are likewise unnamed.\n\nIn July 2018, the artist Susan Unterberg was revealed as both the founder and funder of the award. Before 2018, she had remained anonymous so that her artwork would be evaluated in its own context, without being influenced by her contributions. In an interview, she described her reasons for coming forward, stating \"It’s a great time for women to speak up. I feel I can be a better advocate having my own voice,\" and that she can now work openly to further the organization's cause and to encourage philanthropists and women artists. On top of the awarded grants, Unterberg is considering other forms of programs, possibly seminars, to complement the grants.\n\nListed below are the winners of the award.\n"}

She was Republican National Committeewoman for Michigan from 1992 to 1997 and served as chair of the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000, with reelection to the post in 2003. She has advocated for the Detroit charter school system and she is a member of the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education. She has served as chair of the board of the Alliance for School Choice and the Acton Institute and headed the All Children Matter PAC, which has received wide criticism for allegedly meddling in elections at the state level.\n\nDeVos is married to Dick DeVos, the former CEO of the multi-level marketing company Amway, and is the daughter-in-law of Amway's billionaire co-founder, Richard DeVos. Her brother, Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, is the founder of Blackwater USA. Their father is Edgar Prince, founder of the Prince Corporation. In 2016, the family was listed by \"Forbes\" as the 88th-richest in America, with an estimated net worth of $5.4 billion.\n\nOn November 23, 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would nominate DeVos to serve as Secretary of Education in his administration. On January 31, following strong opposition to the nomination from Democrats, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions approved her nomination on a party-line vote, sending her nomination to the Senate floor. On February 7, 2017, she was confirmed by the Senate by a 51–50 margin, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie in favor of her nomination. This was the first time in U.S. history that a Cabinet nominee's confirmation was decided by the Vice President's tiebreaking vote.\n\nDeVos was born Elisabeth Prince on January 8, 1958. She grew up in Holland, Michigan, the daughter of Elsa (Zwiep) Prince (later, Broekhuizen) and Edgar Prince, a billionaire industrialist of Dutch ancestry. Edgar was the founder of Prince Corporation, an automobile parts supplier based in Holland, Michigan.\n\nDeVos was educated at the Holland Christian High School, a private school located in her home town of Holland, Michigan. She graduated from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business economics in 1979. During college, DeVos was \"involved with campus politics,\" according to \"Philanthropy\" magazine.\n\nDeVos grew up as a member of the Christian Reformed Church in North America. She has been a member and elder of Mars Hill Bible Church in Grand Rapids. Former Fuller Seminary president Richard Mouw, with whom DeVos served on a committee, said she is influenced by Dutch neo-Calvinist theologian Abraham Kuyper, a founding figure in Christian Democracy political ideology.\n\nSince 1982, DeVos has participated in the Michigan Republican Party. She served as a local precinct delegate for the Michigan Republican Party, having been elected for 16 consecutive two-year terms since 1986. She was a Republican National Committeewoman for Michigan between 1992 and 1997, and served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000. In 2004, the \"Lansing State Journal\" described DeVos as \"a political pit bull for most of [Gov. Jennifer] Granholm's 16 months in office,\" and said that if DeVos was not Granholm's \"worst nightmare,\" she was \"certainly her most persistent\". Bill Ballenger, editor of the newsletter \"Inside Michigan Politics\" and a former Republican state senator, called DeVos \"a good behind-the-scenes organizer and a good fund raiser\" as well as \"a true believer in core Republican issues that leave nobody in doubt on where she stands\". DeVos resigned the position in 2000. She said in 2000, \"It is clear I have never been a rubber stamp ... I have been a fighter for the grassroots, and following is admittedly not my strong suit.\" In 2003, DeVos ran again for party chairman and was elected to the post without opposition.\n\nDeVos personally raised more than $150,000 for the 2004 Bush re-election campaign, and hosted a Republican fundraiser at her home in October 2008 that was headlined by President George W. Bush. During the Bush Administration she spent two years as the finance chairperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and worked closely with the Administration on \"various projects\". The DeVos family has been active in Republican politics for decades, particularly as donors to candidates and the party, giving more than $17 million to political candidates and committees since 1989.\n\n\"The Atlantic\" noted that DeVos had indicated in a 1997 op-ed that she expects results from her political contributions. \"My family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party. I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence,\" she wrote. \"Now I simply concede the point. They are right.\" She also stated in the op-ed, \"We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues … We expect a return on our investment; we expect a good and honest government. Furthermore, we expect the Republican Party to use the money to promote these policies and, yes, to win elections.\"\n\nDuring the Republican Party presidential primaries for the 2016 election, DeVos initially donated to Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina before eventually supporting Marco Rubio. In March 2016, DeVos described Donald Trump as an \"interloper\" and said that he \"does not represent the Republican Party\".\n\nDeVos is chairwoman of the Windquest Group, a privately held operating group that invests in technology, manufacturing, and clean energy. DeVos and her husband founded it in 1989. With a commitment of $100 million, Betsy DeVos was one of the largest investors—and losers—in blood-testing company Theranos.\n\nDeVos and her husband were producers for a Broadway run of the stage play \"\", in 2012, based on the life of the famous evangelist and featuring a book and lyrics written by Kathie Lee Gifford. The show ran for three weeks, closing in December 2012 after receiving negative reviews.\n\nBetsy and her husband Dick are chief investors in and board members of Neurocore, a group of brain performance centers offering biofeedback therapy for disorders such as depression, attention deficit disorder, autism, and anxiety. The therapy consists of showing movies to patients and interrupting them when they become distracted, in an effort to retrain their brains. According to \"The New York Times\", a review of Neurocore's claims and interviews with medical experts suggest that the company's conclusions are unproven and its methods questionable. Democratic senators raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and questioned whether she and her family members would \"benefit financially from actions\" she could take as education secretary. DeVos announced that she would step down from the company's board but would retain her investment in the company, valued at $5 million to $25 million.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, said he was Trump's initial pick, but he rejected the offer. On November 23, 2016, Trump's transition team announced DeVos as the nominee to be the next Secretary of Education. Upon her nomination, DeVos said \"I am honored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The \"status quo\" in ed is not acceptable.\" DeVos's nomination was generally criticized by teachers unions and praised by supporters of school choice.\n\n\"Detroit Free Press\" editor Stephen Henderson expressed concerns over DeVos's nomination, writing that \"DeVos isn't an educator, or an education leader\". Rebecca Mead of \"The New Yorker\" questioned the efficacy of Michigan's charter school system, which DeVos has supported. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called DeVos \"the most ideological, anti-public education nominee\" since the position became a cabinet position. The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Michigan Democratic Party opposed DeVos's nomination.\n\nFormer presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney respectively called DeVos an \"outstanding pick\" and a \"smart choice\". Republican Senator Ben Sasse said DeVos \"has made a career out of standing up to powerful and connected special interests on behalf of poor kids who are too often forgotten by Washington\". In an opinion editorial, the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that \"DeVos has helped lead the national battle to expand education opportunities for children\".\n\nThe confirmation hearing for DeVos was initially scheduled for January 10, 2017, but was delayed for one week after the Office of Government Ethics requested more time to review her financial disclosures. On January 17, 2017 the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held the hearing, which lasted three-and-one-half hours and \"quickly became a heated and partisan debate\". Democratic senators directed several questions toward her regarding her wealth, including questions about her family's political donations to the Republican Party and whether or not she had personal experience with financial aid or student loans. Several media outlets reported that DeVos appeared to have plagiarized quotes from an Obama administration official in written answers submitted to the Senate committee. DeVos drew widespread media attention during the confirmation hearings for suggesting that guns might have a place in some schools due to a threat from grizzly bears. DeVos's comment was later lampooned by television personalities Kate McKinnon on \"Saturday Night Live\", Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and James Corden.\n\nPrior to DeVos's confirmation, numerous U.S. Senators from both parties reported tens of thousands of their constituents having contacted their offices in opposition to the confirmation of DeVos. More than 300 state lawmakers from across the U.S., overwhelmingly Democrats, voiced their opposition to DeVos's appointment in a letter to the U.S. Senate sent the day before a scheduled vote on her nomination. DeVos's nomination was supported by 18 Republican governors, including John Kasich and Rick Snyder, along with the nine Republican members of Congress from Michigan.\n\nOn January 31, DeVos's nomination was approved by the committee on a 12–11 party-line vote and was due to be voted on by the Senate. Later on February 1, 2017, two Republican U.S. Senators, Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, came out against the confirmation (despite supporting DeVos in committee when both of them voted to move her nomination to the floor), bringing the predicted confirmation vote on DeVos to 50–50 if all Democrats and independents voted as expected, meaning Vice President Mike Pence would have to break the tie. During an unusually early 6:30 a.m. vote on February 3, 2017, cloture was invoked on DeVos's nomination in the Senate, requiring a final vote on the confirmation to happen after 30 hours of debate.\n\nAhead of the scheduled final vote at noon on February 7, 2017, the Democrats in the Senate continuously spoke on the floor against the confirmation of DeVos the entire night before leading up to the vote, in protest of their strong disapproval of the nominee. As expected, there was a 50–50 tie on the final vote, with all Democrats and independents, along with two Republicans (Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski), voting in opposition to DeVos, while the other fifty Republican senators voted in support of the confirmation, including Senator Jeff Sessions, who himself had been nominated by the Trump administration for the post of United States Attorney General. Republicans scheduled Sessions's confirmation vote after DeVos's so that he would be able to cast his vote in support of DeVos. Had his confirmation vote been earlier than hers, he would have been forced to resign from the Senate, therefore losing a vital vote for the Republicans on the confirmation.\nSince there was a tie, Vice President Mike Pence had to step in to decide the vote as the President of the Senate. He cast his tie-breaking vote in favor of DeVos to officially confirm her as education secretary. This was the first tie decided by a vice president on any vote in the Senate since the George W. Bush administration.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, as DeVos made a visit to Jefferson Academy, a public middle school located in Southwest, Washington, D.C., in her first official appearance as Secretary at a D.C. public school, dozens of protesters showed up to prevent her appearance and physically blocked her from entering through the back entrance of the school. DeVos was eventually able to enter the school through a side entrance. Subsequent to the incident, the U.S. Marshals Service, rather than Education Department employees, began providing security for her. Education Department officials declined requests for information about the deployment of marshals or the current tasks of the Secretary's displaced security team normally assigned to her. Many of those security personnel are former Secret Service agents who have worked at the department for many years. Regarding the withdrawal of the department's team, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan said, \"That's a waste of taxpayer money,\" Duncan said of the use of U.S. Marshals. DeVos said that on the basis of her first few days in the job, she had concerns that some Education Department employees were sympathetic to the Obama administration. \"I . . . would not be surprised if there are also those that would try to subvert the mission of this organization and this department,\" she stated. Asked what she could do about that, she said, \"Whatever can be done will be done, and it will be done swiftly and surely.\"\n\nOn February 27, 2017, DeVos released a statement calling historically black colleges \"real pioneers when it comes to school choice\", causing controversy as some pointed out the schools originated after segregation laws prevented African-Americans from attending others. DeVos later acknowledged racism as an important factor in the history of historically black colleges.\n\nOn March 24, 2017, during a visit to the Osceola County campus of Valencia College, DeVos said she was considering the extension of federal financial aid for students that were year-round and interested in placing more focus on community colleges.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, DeVos delivered her first extended policy address at the Brookings Institution, stating an interest in implementing choice policies directed toward children as individuals and criticizing the Obama administration's additional funding of $7 billion for the U.S.'s worst-performing schools as \"throwing money at the problem\" in an attempt to find a solution.\n\nOn April 6, 2017, DeVos visited Florida International University, marking her first visit to a public university, where she toured an area designed to resemble a hospital ward and was confronted by around 30 protestors. The following day, the U.S. Marshals Service said after a threat evaluation was conducted in February that DeVos would be given additional security, projecting a cost of $7.8 million between February and September.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, DeVos undid several Obama administration policy memos issued by John King Jr. and Ted Mitchell which were designed to protect student loan borrowers.\n\nIn April 2017, DeVos praised the President's nomination of Carlos G. Muñiz as the Department's general counsel.\n\nIn April 2017, DeVos named Candice Jackson Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department's Office for Civil Rights, where she will be acting Assistant Secretary while that higher, Senate-confirmed appointment is vacant. DeVos named Jason Botel Deputy Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. Botel, a registered Democrat who supported President Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement, founded the KIPP Ujima Village Academy in Baltimore, after working for Teach For America.\n\nOn May 10, 2017, DeVos gave a commencement speech at Bethune–Cookman University, a historically black college, and during her speech a majority of the students booed DeVos, with about half of them standing up and turning their backs to her. She also received an honorary doctorate from Bethune–Cookman University.\n\nOn May 22, 2017, DeVos announced the Trump administration was offering \"the most ambitious expansion\" of school choice within American history. DeVos cited Indiana (which has the U.S.'s largest school voucher program) as a potential model for a nationwide policy, but did not give specific proposals. In a May 2017 House of Representatives committee hearing, Rep. Katherine Clark, said an Indiana private school which takes publicly funded vouchers maintains it is entitled to deny admission to LGBT students or those coming from families with \"homosexual or bisexual activity.\" Clark asked if she would inform Indiana that it could not discriminate in that way if it accepted federal funding, and asked her how she would respond in the event a voucher school rejected black students but a state \"said it was okay.\" DeVos answered: \"Well again, the Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX protections are broadly applicable across the board, but when it comes to parents making choices on behalf of their students...\" Clark stopped her saying, \"This isn't about parents making choices, this is about the use of federal dollars. Is there any situation? Would you say to Indiana, that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars? Or would you say the state has the flexibility?\" DeVos responded: \"I believe states should continue to have flexibility in putting together programs ...\" CBS reporter Lesley Stahl questioned her, in a March 2018 \"60 Minutes\" interview, about the documented failure of the DeVos programs to demonstrate a positive result, in Michigan, her home state: \"Your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan ... where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system.\" Stahl added, \"The public schools here are doing worse than they did.\" DeVos was unable to provide any actual examples of improvement, but stated there were \"pockets\" where schools had done better than public schools.\n\nOn June 2, 2017, DeVos announced her support of President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement the prior day.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, Devos said states' rights would determine private schools being allocated funds by the federal government during an appearance before members of a House appropriations committee.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, Democratic attorneys-general in 18 states and Washington, D.C., led by Massachusetts' attorney-general Maura Healey, filed a federal lawsuit against DeVos for suspending the implementation of rules that were meant to protect students attending for-profit colleges. The rules, developed during the Obama administration, were meant to take effect on July 1, 2017.\n\nOn July 13, 2017, Candice Jackson, who is a sexual assault survivor, organized a meeting with DeVos, college sexual assault victims, accused assailants, and higher education officials, and said she would look at policies on sexual assault accusations on campuses from the Obama administration to see if accused students were treated within their rights. Asked by CBS \"60 Minutes\" reporter Lesley Stahl about her repeal of Obama administration guidelines for colleges dealing with reports of sexual assaults, she said her concern was for men falsely accused of such assaults. \"Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\" said DeVos.\n\nIn October 2017, DeVos revoked 72 guidance documents of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services which outlined the rights of disabled students under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nIn January 2018, Devos said in a speech that the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) found that \"60 percent of its teachers reported having moderate to no influence over the content and skills taught in their own classrooms.\" In response, AFT noted that in the same survey of around 5,000 educators, 86% felt that Devos had disrespected them.\n\nIn March 2018, DeVos announced a School Safety Commission, to provide meaningful and actionable recommendations. Members were four Cabinet members, including herself. The organization held a meeting on March 28 and a gathering of school shooting survivors and families on April 17.\n\nIn mid-May 2018, \"The New York Times\" reported that under DeVos, the size of the team investigating abuses and fraud by for-profit colleges was reduced from about twelve members under the Obama administration to three, with their task also being scaled back to \"processing student loan forgiveness applications and looking at smaller compliance cases\". DeVos also appointed Julian Schmoke as the team's new supervisor; Schmoke was a former dean of DeVry Education Group, which was one of the institutions the team had been investigating. The investigation into DeVry was not the only one stopped, others include those of Bridgepoint Education and Career Education Corporation. The Education Department has hired more ex-employees and people affiliated with those institutions, such as Robert S. Eitel, senior counselor to DeVos, Diane Auer Jones, an advisor to the Department, and Carlos G. Muñiz, the Department's general counsel. Also reported by several news outlets was a sequence of payments made by DeVry to the DeVos Foundation.\n\nIn late May 2018, Devos said that she believed it was \"a school decision\" on whether to report a student's family to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if the student or their family are undocumented immigrants. However, under \"Plyler v. Doe\", the American Supreme Court ruled under the American constitution, schools are obligated to provide schooling irrespective of immigration status. The American Civil Liberties Union has said that because of this, it would be unconstitutional for schools to report students or their families to ICE.\n\nWhistleblower and former White House staffer, Omarosa Manigault Newman claimed that President Trump referred to her, after she left meetings, as \"Ditzy\" DeVos.\n\nOn September 12, 2018 DeVos lost the lawsuit brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia, which accused the Department of Education of improperly delaying implementation of regulations protecting student loan borrowers from predatory practices.\n\nDeVos was listed for many years on IRS form Form 990s as the foundation's vice president (hitherto called the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation). However, she testified under oath in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing, in response to Senator Maggie Hassan's questions, that she had nothing to do with the contributions made by her mother's foundation to conservative advocacy groups including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council.\n\nThe Dick & Betsy DeVos Family Foundation was launched in 1989. The foundation's giving, according to its website, is motivated by faith, and \"is centered in cultivating leadership, accelerating transformation and leveraging support in five areas\", namely education, community, arts, justice, and leadership. In 2015, the DeVos Foundation made $11.6 million in charitable contributions, bringing the couple's lifetime charitable giving to $139 million. \"Forbes\" ranked the DeVos family No. 24 on its 2015 list of America's top givers.\n\nThe DeVos Foundation has donated to hospitals, health research, arts organizations, Christian schools, evangelical missions, and conservative, free-market think tanks. Of the $100 million the foundation donated between 1999 until 2014, half of it went to Christian organizations. Organizations funded by the foundation include: Michigan's Foundation for Traditional Values; Center for Individual Rights; Acton Institute; Institute for Justice; Center for Individual Rights; Michigan's Pregnancy Resource Center; Right to Life Michigan Educational Fund; and Baptists for Life.\n\nWith respect to educational-focused donations, the foundation from 1999 to 2014 supported private Christian schools (at least $8.6 million), charter schools ($5.2 million), and public schools ($59,750). Specific donations included $2.39 million to the Grand Rapids Christian High School Association, $652,000 to the Ada Christian School, and $458,000 to Holland Christian Schools.\n\nIn 2016 the Foundation reported $14.3 million in donations to over 100 organizations including the X Prize Foundation, Mars Hill Bible Church, American Enterprise Institute.\n\nWhen DeVos was appointed US Education Secretary, it was revealed that she was an elder at Mars Hill Bible Church. During her tenure, she reportedly donated $431,000 to the church between 2002 and 2004 and $453,349 to Flannel, producer of the NOOMA video series.\n\nDeVos has served as chairperson, board member, and treasurer of the Acton Institute.\n\nDeVos was appointed by President George W. Bush to the board of directors of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 2004, and served until 2010. While she was on the board, she and her husband funded a center to teach arts managers and boards of directors how to fundraise and manage their cultural institutions. The couple donated $22.5 million in 2010 to continue the endeavor, which was given in the name of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management.\n\nAfter the announcement of the DeVoses' gift to the Kennedy Center, DeVos explained that she had been persuaded by Kennedy Center official Michael Kaiser's observation that millions of dollars are invested \"in the arts, and training artists\", but not in \"training the leaders who hire the artists and run the organizations\". The DeVoses' gift was intended to remedy this oversight. \"We want to help develop human capital and leverage that capital to the greatest extent possible\", she said, describing Kaiser's \"practice and approach\" as \"practical, realistic and creative\". The DeVoses' gift, part of which would be spent on arts groups in Michigan that had been hit hard by the recession, was the largest private donation in the Kennedy Center's history.\n\nIn 2009, Betsy DeVos's son Rick DeVos founded ArtPrize, an international art competition held in Grand Rapids, Michigan. approximately 16 percent of ArtPrize's $3.5 million annual budget was provided by various foundations run by the DeVos family, with the rest provided by other foundations and local and national businesses.\n\nDeVos in 2001 listed education activism and reform efforts as a means to \"advance God's Kingdom\". In an interview that year, she also said that \"changing the way we approach ... the system of education in the country ... really may have greater Kingdom gain in the long run\".\n\nDeVos believes education in the United States should encourage the proliferation of charter schools and open up private schools to more students via financial assistance programs, often called vouchers. She has stated that education is \"a closed system, a closed industry, a closed market. It's a monopoly, a dead end.\" DeVos believes that opening up the education market will offer parents increased choice, a view that critics call a drive to privatize the American public education system.\n\nDeVos is known as a \"a fierce proponent of school vouchers\" that would allow students to attend private schools with public funding. According to \"The New York Times\", it \"is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos\".\n\nDeVos served as chairwoman of the board of Alliance for School Choice. Until November 2016, she headed the All Children Matter PAC which she and her husband founded in 2003 to promote school vouchers, tax credits to businesses that give private school scholarships, and candidates who support these causes. DeVos and her husband gave millions of dollars to the organization. In 2008, All Children Matter was fined $5.2 million in Ohio for illegally laundering money into political campaign funds. DeVos was not named in the case. The fine remained unpaid , prompting calls by Democratic Party lawmakers for DeVos to settle the debt.\n\nHer other activities on behalf of public-school reform have included membership on the boards of directors of the Advocates for School Choice, the American Education Reform Council, and the Education Freedom Fund. She has chaired the boards of Choices for Children, and Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP).\n\nDeVos was chair of the American Federation for Children (AFC). Affiliated with the Alliance for School Choice, the AFC describes itself as \"a leading national advocacy organization promoting school choice, with a specific focus on advocating for school vouchers and scholarship tax credit programs\".\n\nDuring the 1990s, she served on the boards of Children First America and the American Education Reform Council, which sought to expand school choice through vouchers and tax credits. She and her husband worked for the successful passage of Michigan's first charter-school bill in 1993, and for the unsuccessful effort in 2000 to amend Michigan's constitution to allow tax-credit scholarships or vouchers. In response to that defeat, DeVos started a PAC, the Great Lakes Education Project, which championed charter schools. DeVos's husband and John Walton then founded All Children Matter, a political organization, which she chaired.\n\nDeVos has been an advocate for the Detroit charter school system. Douglas N. Harris, professor of economics at Tulane University, wrote in a 2016 \"The New York Times\" op-ed that DeVos was partly responsible for \"what even charter advocates acknowledge is the biggest school reform disaster in the country\". In the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Detroit had the lowest reading and mathematics scores \"by far\" over any city participating in the evaluation. According to Harris, she designed a system with no oversight in which schools that do poorly can continue to enroll students.\n\nRamesh Ponnuru of \"National Review\" argued that Harris overstates the failure of charter schools in Detroit. According to Ponnuru, the study referenced by Harris, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, did \"not sound nearly as helpful to Harris's case as he suggests\". Ponnuru pointed out that the study says \"some 47 percent of charter schools in Detroit significantly outperform[ed] traditional public schools in reading and 49 percent of charters significantly outperforming traditionals on math. Only one percent of charters were significantly outperformed by traditional public schools in reading and only 7 percent on math.\" Also defending DeVos's record in Michigan, Jay P. Greene, professor of education policy at the University of Arkansas, argued that Harris's \"The New York Times\" article misled readers on the evidence and \"falsely claimed that Detroit has failed to close failing charter schools\", noting that Detroit has closed more charters than Louisiana, a state Harris cites as a model for charter school legislation.\n\nIn a written response to a question about charter school performance posed during DeVos's confirmation hearing by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), asking \"why do you think their performance is so poor?\", DeVos defended the charter school system using graduation rates that were significantly higher than those used for state and federal accountability purposes. DeVos provided examples of several charter schools that she said had 4-year graduation exceeding 90%. These examples were contested by Columbia University professor Aaron Pallas and \"Education Week\" reporter Ben Herold on the basis that the actual graduation rates were roughly only half as large as DeVos had stated.\n\nDeVos and Joel Klein said in a May 2013 op-ed that residents of Maine \"are now given information on school performance using easy-to-understand report cards with the same A, B, C, D and F designations used in student grades\". This system, they argued, \"truly motivates parents and the community to get involved by simply taking information that education officials have had for years and presenting it in a way that is more easily understood.\"\n\nThe DeVoses have also established an annual scholarship, called the Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholars for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Scholarship, which is awarded to students earning a BBA or combined BBA/MBA at Northwood University.\n\nDeVos is a member of the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education (ExcelinEd), a think tank founded by Jeb Bush whose stated goal is to \"build an American education system that equips every child to achieve his or her God-given potential\".\n\nThe DeVos family is one of Michigan's wealthiest. Betsy DeVos's husband, Richard Marvin \"Dick\" DeVos Jr., is a multi-billionaire heir to the Amway fortune who ran Amway's parent company, Alticor, from 1993 to 2002. Dick DeVos is a major donor to conservative political campaigns and social causes, and was the 2006 Republican nominee for Governor of Michigan. They married in 1979, and have four grown children: Rick, Elissa, Andrea, and Ryan. Rick works for the Windquest Group as a consultant on urban development. Dick's father, Richard Marvin DeVos Sr., co-founded Amway and is also the owner of the Orlando Magic NBA basketball team. Richard DeVos was listed by \"Forbes\" in 2016 as having a net worth of $5.1 billion, making him America's 88th wealthiest individual.\n\nBetsy DeVos's brother, Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, is the founder of Blackwater USA, a private military services contractor.\n\nIn August 2018, a vandal untied DeVos's $40 million yacht that had been moored at a marina on Lake Erie, causing it to sustain $10,000 in damages. The vessel is one of ten yachts owned by her family, which has a net worth of $5.3 billion. The craft is registered in the Cayman Islands, so is not subject to state property tax.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38188634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38188634", "title": "Calendar (archives)", "text": "Calendar (archives)\n\nA calendar (sometimes historically spelled kalendar) is, in the context of archival science, textual scholarship, and archival publication, a descriptive list of documents. The verb \"to calendar\" means to compile or edit such a list. The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory.\n\nThe term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind. Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has no direct relationship to a table of dates.\n\nIn the British tradition, the word normally implies a full descriptive summary (often published) in which each document is the subject of a \"carefully controlled, rigorously consistent précis\". All significant elements in the text are recorded, so that the great majority of researchers will be spared the need to consult the originals: the completed calendar effectively becomes a substitute for the archival documents, and is often treated as a primary source in its own right. Trivial or incidental elements (\"common form and unnecessary verbiage\") are omitted; but all names, dates and significant statements are noted, and passages which appear to the editor to be of particular interest or importance may be quoted in full. Documents in archaic or foreign languages (particularly Latin) are normally calendared in the modern vernacular, but significant or ambiguous terms or passages may be given in the original language. A calendar is therefore less detailed or comprehensive than a series of full transcripts or translations; but considerably more detailed than an archival list or other finding aid.\n\nCalendars are at their most useful when published, giving remote users access to the contents of archival records. Well-known series of published calendars of British medieval and early modern sources include the \"Calendar of Charter Rolls\" (1903–1927); the \"Calendar of Close Rolls\" (1900–1963); the \"Calendar of Patent Rolls\" (1891–); the \"Calendars of State Papers\" (Domestic and Foreign) (1856–); the \"Calendars of Treasury Books and Papers\" (1868–1962) (all from material now in The National Archives); the \"Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland\" (published by the Public Record Office 1896–1960, and by the Irish Manuscripts Commission 1978–); the \"Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII\" (1864–1932); and the \"Reports and Calendars\" series on privately held archives published between 1869 and 2004 by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts.\n\nOne advantage of calendars in the era of print publishing was that a précis of a text took up less space than a full transcript or facsimile. This reasoning carries less weight in the age of electronic publishing; but calendars still have a role in providing readers with an accurate, comprehensive and accessible summary of a document which may be more readily comprehensible than a more faithful and complete version of the original.\n\nPaul Harvey emphasises that the editorial task of calendaring \"is not the soft option that editors have sometimes assumed\"; and that the process of summarising accurately without error or distortion can be \"significantly harder than straightforward editing\".\n\nIn the North American tradition, a \"calendar\" generally implies a briefer and more summary list or inventory than in Britain, arranged chronologically. Its intention is to provide a succinct indication of the documents' date, origin and subject-matter, but little more; and it is designed as a finding aid to locate the originals, not as a substitute for them.\n\n"}

{"id": "21545786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21545786", "title": "Corporate Education", "text": "Corporate Education\n\nCorporate Education refers to a system of professional development activities provided to educate employees. It may consist of formal university or college training or informal training provided by non-collegiate institutions. The simplest form of corporate education may be training programs designed \"in-house\" for an organization that may wish to train their employees on specific aspects of their job processes or responsibilities. More formal relationships may further exist where corporate training is provided to employees through contracts or relationships with educational institutions who may award credit, either at the institution or through a system of CEUs (Continuing Education Units).\n\nMany institutions or trainers offering corporate education will provide certificates or diplomas verifying the attendance of the employee. Some employers use corporate and continuing education as part of a holistic human resources effort to determine the performance of the employee and as part of their review systems.\n\nIncreasingly organisations appear to be using corporate education and training as an incentive to retain managers and key employees within their organisation. This win-win arrangement creates better educated managers for the organisation and provides the employees with a more marketable portfolio of skills and, in many cases, recognised qualifications. \n\nMost organisations tend to think of corporate education as corporate training. Corporate training programs are often competency based and related to the essential training employees need to operate certain equipment or perform certain tasks in a competent, safe and effective manner. The outcome of a corporate training program is a participant who is either able to operate a piece of equipment or perform a specific task in an effective manner according to pre-determined training criteria. \n\nThe primary role of corporate training is to ensure an employee has the knowledge and skills to undertake a specific operation to enable an organisation can continue to operate. Fundamentally, corporate training is centred on knowledge transfer, with an instructor teaching or demonstrating a particular function and the student learning and demonstrating they can apply what they have learnt to a particular operation.\n\nCorporate education, however, adds another dimension and depth to training by involving learners as participants in generating new knowledge that assists an organisation to develop and evolve, rather than maintain the status quo. Corporate education focuses on developing the capability of an organisation to be able to do things and, in particular, the right things in order to be a sustainable and successful organisation.\n\nCorporate education involves a facilitator, rather than an instructor or trainer, to engage participants and encourage them to think about the what, how and why of what they are doing and to challenge their current paradigms. Corporate education is centred on introducing learning techniques to stimulate employees to think about what their organisation does, where it is heading, potential new opportunities for the organisation and new and better ways of doing things. While the role of corporate training is to develop the operational competency of individuals, the purpose of corporate education is to promote the development of capability of both an individual and their organisation.\n\nIncreasingly organisations appear to be using corporate education as an incentive to retain managers and key employees within their organisation. This win-win arrangement creates better educated managers and employees for the organisation and gives individual employees a more marketable portfolio of skills and, in many cases, recognised qualifications.\n"}

It published 12 Reports from 2002 until 2015, and was then renamed, and relaunched under a new mandate as the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report, UNESCO, whose principal role is to monitor progress towards the education targets in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. It has been replaced by the Global Education Monitoring Report. \n\nIn April 2000 more than 1,100 participants from 164 countries gathered in Dakar, Senegal, for the World Education Forum.\n\nThe participants, ranging from teachers to prime ministers, academics to policymakers, non-governmental bodies to the heads of major international organizations, adopted the 2000-word Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments\n\nThe Education for All Global Monitoring Report was the prime instrument to assess progress towards achieving the six 'Dakar' EFA goals to which over 160 countries committed themselves in 2000. It tracked progress, identifies policy reforms and best practice in all areas relating to EFA, draws attention to emerging challenges and promotes international cooperation in favour of education.\n\nThe publication was targeted at decision-makers at the national and international level, and more broadly, at all those engaged in promoting the right to quality education – teachers, civil society groups, NGOs, researchers and the international community.\n\nWhilst the report had an annual agenda for reporting progress on each of the six EFA goals, each edition also adopted a theme, chosen because of its importance to the EFA process. As of 1 January 2016, the EFA Global Monitoring Report became the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report), with a new mandate to monitor the new sustainable development goal on education (SDG 4). \nThe Education for All Global Monitoring Report aimed to inform education and aid policy through analysis of the challenges facing countries. While the prime audience consists of decision-makers such as ministers, policymakers, parliamentarians and education planners, other groups such as civil society, teachers, non-governmental organizations, university researchers and the media.are important.\n\nThe 'UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), based in Montreal, played the leading role in providing data for the report on students, teachers, school performance, adult literacy and education expenditure.\n\nThe institute collects data from over 200 countries and territories, but serious limitations in data coverage make it difficult to monitor certain aspects of Education for All, from public financing to education. To improve and accelerate data collection, UIS is helping governments to strengthen their own systems and analysis capacities. The report also draws on data from national household surveys, specially commissioned studies and other sources.\n\nThe report published quality-assured data, compiled so that statistics are comparable for the majority of countries, using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Not all countries use the same classification systems, however, which lead to discrepancies between national data and those published internationally.\n\nDifferences also stemmed from national population estimates. To calculate several indicators, UIS uses estimates from the United Nations Population Division, which can differ from those published by individual countries. More generally, the quality assurance process entailed a time lag between the collection (and often the publication) of data by national governments and their release by UIS for use in this and other reports. Where possible, the report identified discrepancies and data gaps.\n\nThe publication was funded in the majority by multilateral and bilateral agencies, and benefited from the expertise of an international Advisory Board. During its annual meeting, the Board discussed the scope and contents of the Report underway and provides advice on its future development.\n\nEach Report was developed over a 12 to 18-month period. It drew on scholarship and expertise from governments, NGOs, bilateral and multilateral agencies, UNESCO institutes and research institutions. Research Papers commissioned for each Report are available on the website.\n\nThe final version of the Report was submitted to the Director-General of UNESCO on an annual basis and considered by the High-Level Group on Education for All, comprising 24 members, including government ministers, representatives of donor organizations, UN agencies and non-governmental organizations. Its role, as stated in the Dakar Framework for Action (paragraph 19), was to sustain and accelerate the political momentum created at the World Education Forum.\n\nThe Report is translated into the UN and other languages so that its messages and findings may be shared.\n\nGlobal Education Monitoring Report 2019\n\n\"Migration\"\n\nGlobal Education Monitoring Report 2017\n\n\"Accountability in Education\"\n\nGlobal Education Monitoring Report 2016\n\n\"Education for people and planet: Creating sustainable futures for all\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2015\n\n\"Education for All 2000-2015: Achievements and Challenges\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2013/4\n\n\"Teaching and learning: Achieving quality for all\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2012\n\n\"Youth and skills: Putting education to work\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2011\n\n\"The hidden crisis: Armed conflict and education\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2010\n\n\"Reaching the marginalized\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2009\n\n\"Overcoming inequality: why governance matters\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2008\n\n\"Education for All by 2015: Will we make it?\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2007\n\n\"Strong foundations: Early childhood care and education\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2006\n\n\"Literacy for life\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2005\n\n\"Education for all: the quality imperative\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2003/2004\n\n\"Gender and education for all: the leap to equality\"\n\nGlobal Monitoring Report 2002\n\n\"Education for all: Is the world on track?\"\n\nAaron Benavot, 2015 Report \nPauline Rose, 2012, 2013/4 reports\nKevin Watkins, 2009, 2010, 2001 reports\nNick Burnett, 2006, 2007, 2008 reports\nChristopher Colclough, 2002, 2003/4, 2005 reports\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16577018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16577018", "title": "Education in Ivory Coast", "text": "Education in Ivory Coast\n\nEducation in Ivory Coast continues to face many challenges. The literacy rate for adults remains low: in 2000, it was estimated that only 48.7% of the total population was literate (60.8% of males and 38.6% of females). Many children between 6 and 10 years are not enrolled in school, mainly children of poor families. The majority of students in secondary education are male. At the end of secondary education, students can sit the Baccalauréat examination. The country has universities in Abidjan (Université de Cocody), Bouaké (Université de Bouaké), and Yamoussoukro (Institut national polytechnique Félix Houphouët-Boigny).\n\nThe education system comprised three stages: primary school lasted six years, leading to a certificate of primary studies; secondary school lasted seven years, leading to a certificate or baccalauréat. University education, available only in Abidjan, culminated in a university degree. A large number of technical and teacher-training institutions also provided post primary and post secondary education. There was no system of adult education, although many adults attended night courses or, in rural areas, received literacy and other instruction via radio.\n\nMost public schools were tuition free, although students pay an entrance fee and buy uniforms. Most supplies were free, and some students received government scholarships, usually in return for a period of government employment after graduation.\n\nIn 1980 approximately 14 percent of primary schools and 29 percent of secondary schools were private. Most of these were Catholic, staffed by religious and lay teachers, with salaries partially subsidized by government funding. Catholic schools operated primarily in the south and east but were also located throughout the country. Religious instruction was not permitted in government schools. Quranic schools were common in the north and were tolerated, but not supported, by the government. Some students attended both public and Quranic schools.\n\nThe school year was divided into three terms, beginning in September and separated by short Christmas and Easter holidays and a two-month summer recess. The average week consisted of approximately 30 hours of classes, Monday through Saturday morning. Most instruction encouraged mental discipline more than analytical thinking or creativity, by emphasizing rote memorization and oral recitation.\n\nApproximately 9.5 million pupils attended primary school in 1987, representing about 75% of boys and 50% of girls below age 15. Primary-school enrollments increased at a rate of about 7.2% per year from 1960 to 1980, climbing to 9.1% between 1976 and 1980. This rate slowed after 1980, averaging 4.2% from 1981 to 1984 and 2.2% in 1999.\n\nIn 2009, 79.6% of children attended secondary school. By 2012, this figure had risen to 94.2%, meaning that Côte d'Ivoire was on track to reach the Millennium Development Goal of primary education for all.\n\nChildren entered primary school at the age of seven or eight and passed through six grades, divided into preparatory, elementary, and intermediate levels. In the first six months, students mastered French, the language of instruction. Classes in reading, writing, and arithmetic were taught, gradually supplemented by history, geography, natural sciences, music, art, and physical education. Rural schools required students to work in school gardens and learn basic agricultural methods. Standard school-leaving exams led to the certificate of elementary education (certificat d'étude primaires élémentaires—CEPE) and determined entrance to secondary institutions.\n\nAbout 250,000 students, or about 19 percent of primary-school graduates, attended government-funded secondary schools in 1987. Most of those preparing for university attended a collège or lycée, both of which included seven years of study divided into two cycles. Significant differences between these two institutions almost disappeared in the decades following their introduction by the French, but the lycée was generally administered by the national government and the collège by the municipal government with national funding.\n\nAfter the first cycle or four years of secondary school, students took exams and were awarded the certificate of the lower cycle of secondary study (brevet d'étude du premier cycle—BEPC). This qualification generally allowed them to continue at the collège or lycée, enter a teacher-training institution, or find an entry-level job in commerce or government. After the second cycle of three years of study, graduates earned the baccalauréat, which indicated a level of learning roughly equivalent to one or two years of university study in the United States. In Ivory Coast, as in France, it qualified a student for university entrance.\n\nSecondary-school enrollments grew at a rate of about 11 percent per year from 1960 to 1984, but that rate has declined since 1984. The dropout rate was especially high for girls, who made up only 18 percent of the student body during the last two years of secondary school. An average of one-fourth of secondary students received the baccalauréat.\n\nComplementary courses were the most common type of alternative secondary education, administered as four-year programs to improve the academic education of those who did not qualify for collège or lycée. Complementary courses were established during the 1950s, when expanding educational opportunities was a high priority. They were held throughout the country to compensate for the urban bias in secondary education. Complementary courses often provided a combination of academic and practical training, leading to an elementary certificate (brevet élémentaire—BE) or the BEPC, and enabled some students to enter the second cycle at a collège, lycée, or vocational training institution.\n\nAdditional secondary-level courses were administered by religious organizations, most often the Catholic Church. These courses consisted of seven years of study divided into two cycles, with a certificate of completion awarded after each cycle. Teacher training was available, often as an alternative to academic university preparation, at a variety of postprimary levels. Secondary-level teacher training could lead to a BE certificate and admission to a normal school (école normale), which might be attended by students who left lycées or collèges after the first four years of study.\n\nVocational training, attended by 47,000 students in 1982-83, was available at postprimary institutions. This training included courses in agriculture, engineering, public works, transportation management, secretarial and commercial subjects, and building trades. Graduates often worked as apprentices or pursued further training at higher technical institutes.\n\nIn 2013, 39.08% of children attended secondary school.\n\nThe national Université de Côte d'Ivoire was founded in Abidjan in 1959 as the Center for Higher Education. It was renamed the Université d'Abidjan in 1964. In 1987, the university had a student roll of 18,732, including 3,200 women. Among students, about 10,000 were Ivoirian citizens. Heavily dependent on French assistance,the university had faculties of law, sciences, and letters and schools of agriculture, public works, administration and fine arts. Other institutions of higher learning, known as grandes écoles, awarded certificates of training in specialized fields in cooperation with, but not as part of, the national university. Other universities have since been founded.\n\nIn 2012, there were 57,541 students enrolled at post-secondary diploma level, 23,008 students studying for a bachelor's or master's degree and 269 PhD students. Enrolment in tertiary education suffered during the political crisis, dropping from 9.03% to 4.46% of the 18-25-year cohort between 2009 and 2012. Whereas there were 156,772 students enrolled in higher education in 2007 (including post-secondary diplomas), this figure had halved to 80,818 by 2012. The drop was greatest among students enrolled in a bachelor's, master's or PhD degree, where numbers shrank from 95,944 in 2007 to just 23,277 in 2012.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, five classes of teachers were distinguished by their educational preparation and salary level: professors, who taught at the secondary or university level; assistant professors at the secondary level; and instituteurs, instituteurs adjoint, and monitors at the primary level. Teachers' salaries were generally higher than salaries of civil servants with similar qualifications in the mid-1980s, although many people left teaching for more lucrative professions. The government responded to teacher shortages with training programs and short courses and by recruiting expatriates to teach at the secondary and postsecondary levels.\n\nTeachers were organized into unions, most of them incorporated into the government-controlled central union federation (General Workers Union in Côte d'Ivoire—UGTCI). The National Union of Secondary School Teachers of Ivory Coast (SYNESCI) and two smaller unions remained outside the UGTCI and were outspoken in their criticism of government education policies and education finances in particular. Despite this tradition of criticism, many government officials achieved political office through leadership positions in the teachers' union.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Ivory Coast spent a higher share of its gross national product and of its national budget on education than any other country in the world. Although this served as an indication of the nation's high regard for education, expatriate teachers' salaries accounted for a disproportionate share of expenditure, reducing the benefits to the nation. Generous scholarships for secondary school students reduced funds available for younger children.\n\nIn 2000, Ivory Coast devoted 3.7% of GDP to public education. By 2015, the government had increased this share to 5.03% of GDP, according to an estimation by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Higher education receives more than one-quarter of public education spending: 0.82% of GDP in 2000 and 1.08% of GDP in 2015.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research assigned highest priority to problems of financing education development and reducing the number of school dropouts. Reducing regional inequities was also important; in 1986 enrollments in the south averaged about four times those in the north. The government employed innovative methods to improve the education system—including the use of televised instruction in primary schools in the 1970s—a project that was abandoned as too expensive. Computers and automated data processing equipment were used at the national university in 1987 and were to be introduced at lower levels of the education system by 1990. By the late 1980s, the government was producing its own text books, previously purchased in France, to reflect local cultural values.\n\nThe internal efficiency of the education system was relatively low, partly because of the large number of students who repeated courses and the high dropout level. The number of school-age children was expected to grow at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent by 1995, increasing the school-aged population by 50 percent. Unfortunately, teacher-training programs could not keep pace with these changes, and education planners were in particular demand. The link between education and employment was weak, exacerbated by the economic recession of the 1980s. Graduates, in effect, expected more than society could give them.\n\nAs in many countries, academic institutions and personnel often annoy government officials with their criticism of national policies. Mechanisms are used to co-opt or intimidate dissident leaders, although a few of their criticisms have been received favorably and have produced policy changes. Some outspoken teachers have been offered government jobs, in effect to receive the brunt of criticism they have generated.\n\nSome students have been expelled from the university. The campus was closed down following antigovernment demonstrations in 1982, and campus organizations were banned. Secondary-school teachers who protested against the elimination of their housing benefits in 1983 found their professional organizations banned as well.\n"}

The awards are funded by a bequest from a retired high school mathematics teacher named Edyth May Sliffe, of Emeryville, California. Her purpose was to award high school teachers whose students have done well on the AHSME, now the AMC 12. She felt students who won in math competitions received honors, but their teachers never received any recognition.\n\nEdyth May Sliffe, a retired teacher who taught at Emery High School, felt that teachers also needed recognition for their contributions toward the students' success. In 1978 she contacted the Governor of the Northern California Section of the MAA, Professor Kenneth Rebman. Kenneth Rebman then told the President of the MAA, Professor Henry Alder, and arranged a meeting with Sliffe. She decided to use her estate to recognize 20 teachers of the highest scoring teams annually. Edyth Sliffe died on December 11, 1986. In accordance with her will, over $250,000 was donated to the MAA. Since 1989, about 20 high school teachers from the top 60 American and Canadian schools have received the award annually. In 1995, the MAA Committee extended the award to middle school teachers. Five teachers are selected from each of the ten American Mathematics Competition Regions.\n\nThree students from each of the top 60 highest scoring teams in the AMC 12 are asked to nominate a teacher they felt contributed most to their success.\n\nAward-winning teachers win a cash prize of $350-$750, a letter from the president of the MAA, a certificate signed by the president of MAA, Chair of the Committee on the AMC 12, and the Executive Director of the American Mathematics Competitions. In addition, they get one year free membership in the MAA, and recognition in national and regional professional publications. The award ceremony is arranged by the school administrators. For middle school teachers, the award is $100.\n\n\n"}

Bullitt was instrumental in the desegregation of Seattle public schools.\n\nKatharine \"Kay\" Bullitt was born in 1925 in Boston and was raised in Arlington, Massachusetts. Her mother had a long career as dean of women at Colorado College before marrying in her late 30's and having three daughters. Kay was the middle child between Marion (\"Barney\") and Margaret (\"Margie\"). Bullitt attended the Shady Hill School in Cambridge.\n\nBullitt's interest in civic projects began early and focused on education and peace. She attended Radcliffe College which both her mother and sister had attended. While in college, Bullitt worked in a community center in Cambridge which primarily serviced African-American children. Kay's sister had written her thesis on the difference between African-American students from Barbados and the South. Kay's own senior thesis was on the role of Federal Government in Education. During World War II, Bullitt spent a summer at the Hampton Institute in Virginia as part of an interracial farm project. Bullitt was also active with the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practice.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Bullitt worked in Germany for two summers.\n\nAfter college, Bullitt taught at the Shady Hill School in Cambridge which she had attended as a child. She taught the fourth grade there for five years. Inspired by the ability that she had observed in the young African-Americans she had worked with, Bullitt decided to take a trip across the country to observe what education and work experience was like for children. In her wanderings, Bullitt came to Seattle and decided to stay in 1951.\n\nIn the 1960s, Bullitt hosted an integrated day camp at her home on Capitol Hill. At first, Bullitt said that the camp was \"self-serving,\" as she had three older (step-)children and three under six, all with different interests. She recruited teachers and counselors from the League of Women Voters and The Little School in Seattle. From after the World's Fair in 1962 through the early seventies, the camp was integrated and grew to host 100 children and 35 teenagers running it.\n\nAlso during this time in the 1960s, Bullitt began work in Seattle to integrate schools through voluntary transfer. Her children were going to Lowell Elementary School in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and they began a partnership with Madrona School, a primarily African-American school in Seattle, and had about 50 children going between the schools. Bullitt also started the Voluntary Instruction Program (VIP) which brought in volunteers to teach subjects in small groups, starting with Madrona, but then went to other Central District schools. The program disappeared when they were unable to convince the district to fund a directorship position.\n\nBullitt briefly headed a program called School Affiliation Service which was based on her visits to Germany after World War II. Bullitt wanted to have people come from the South to see how the integration in Seattle was working. This program eventually evolved into the Coalition for Quality Integrated Education (CQIE) in 1968.\n\nIn 1963 after reading an article in the local paper about the \"Wawona\", an historic schooner, Bullitt began efforts to save and restore the ship. The 165 foot-long ship was launched in 1897 and was initially used to haul lumber up and down the Pacific Coast. The schooner also served as a fishing schooner in the Bering Sea and was a military barge during Word War II. After 46 years and numerous fundraising and volunteer efforts, it was determined it would be too costly to restore and they were unable to secure permanent moorage. The ship, which was profiled in \"Shipbuilders, Sea Captains and Fishermen\" by Joe Follansbee, was dismantled in 2009, with portions being saved for the Seattle Museum of History & Industry.\n\nBullitt was instrumental in founding several Civic and community projects in Seattle. She helped found Bumbershoot, an annual international music and arts festival in Seattle, which takes place every Labor Day Weekend at the Seattle Center. In the seventies, Bullitt helped found a savings and loan bank for women, called Sound Savings & Loan. Bullitt helped restore Pioneer Square.\n\nIn 1982 Bullitt, then a director of the Municipal League, helped organize Target Seattle, which was a week-long symposium on the dangers of nuclear war. Speakers included Louis Harris, David Brower, Dr. Jonas Salk, Dr. John E. Mack, Richard Wall Lyman, and Archibald Cox.The event finished with a speech by Cox at the Seattle Kingdome and with an attendance of 10,000- 20,000 people.\n\nEvery year for 60 years, on Wednesday evenings in July, Bullitt hosted a picnic for family and friends at her Capitol Hill home. Bullitt also hosted Seattle's Middle East Peace Camp for Children for a number of years on the property. Bullitt, with her former late husband, Stimson Bullitt, donated the property to the city to be a park after her death.\n\nBullitt has many awards including a United Nations Human Rights Prize.\n\nIn 1954, Bullitt was married to Stimson Bullitt, son of Dorothy Stimson Bullitt, the founder of KING Broadcasting Company. Their marriage lasted for 25 years, ending in divorce in 1979. Stimson Bullitt was the President of KING Broadcasting in Seattle from 1962-72. He was also an attorney, author, judge and outdoorsman.\n\nIn addition to her step-children, Ashley, Scott -- who changed his name to Fred Nemo, and Jill, Kay and Stim had three more children: Dorothy, Ben (who preceded her in death in Nov, 1981), and Margaret.\n\n"}

It brings in school and community groups to perform in the parks and/or take part in workshops or clinics. Types of groups include:\n\nDisneyland: Groups wishing to perform must send in a video of the group and pass an audition. Groups that do not pass may not perform in the park but may participate in a workshop.\nWalt Disney World: Groups wishing to perform must send in a video audition and picture with their application. All groups must purchase tickets through Disney Magic Music Days. They may perform in the parks or participate in a workshop. Groups that do not pass may not perform in the park but may participate in the workshop. \nHong Kong Disneyland: Groups must send in a video, picture and proposed song list with their application. All groups must purchase tickets through Disney Magic Music Days.\n\nDisneyland: Dance and Instrumental groups may perform at the Carnation Plaza Gardens stage located to the west of Sleeping Beauty Castle or at the Hollywood Backlot stage in Disney's California Adventure (DCA). On rare occasions the Small World mall area has been used for performances. Bands march down Disneyland's parade route as a pre-parade, a show directly before the parade. Bands might also march down DCA's performance corridor as a pre-parade or as a pre-show to the High School Musical Pep Rally.\n\nWalt Disney World: Orchestras may play on an outdoor stage at the marketplace, an outdoor shopping center. At Epcot, groups may also perform on a stage that is encased by a temporary \"shell\", this is located next to Innoventions West. The stage faces a small seating area with a control booth at the rear of the area. Magic Kingdom: Groups performing in the Magic Kingdom may have the opportunity to perform Cosmic Ray's Starlite Cafe in Tomorrowland. Groups may also perform at the Disney Springs stage in front of World of Disney. For those groups that are marching, the bands perform a march down the parade route at various times but may or may not coincide with one of Disney's actual parades. They may also march at Epcot around the World Showcase or Future World.\n\nHong Kong Disneyland: Vocal and dance groups may perform at the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad station located in Main Street, U.S.A. inside the park. March bands may march down Main Street, U.S.A. starting from the first-aid station. Orchestras may play on the castle forecourt in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. During Christmastime, groups may also perform in the front lobby of Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and Disney's Hollywood Hotel.\n\nDisneyland: Disneyland workshops are run by current and former Disneyland Cast Members who work professionally outside of Disneyland in the industry of the workshop they are running. Instrumental clinicians often conduct, arrange, direct, or perform music for major television and movie studios. Workshops are 90 minutes long and are designed to give students a taste of what professional studio musicians, singers, or dancers go through. Dance workshops are run like an audition. Instrumental workshops and Choral workshops cover multiple song segments from Disney animated and live action movies and are dubbed onto the film using a click track. Groups participating in a Workshop often receive a DVD of their work.\nWalt Disney World: WDW clinics are run by Disney World Cast Members. Some of these clinicians also work professionally in their field outside of Walt Disney World. Instrumental clinics are three hours long, cover one Disney medley piece, played back with Disney animation clips, much like a movie trailer. A Disney character, usually Mickey or Goofy, makes an appearance at the end of the workshop to thank the students for their work. Groups participating in a Workshop receive a DVD of their work.\n\nDisneyland: Directors receive any signs displayed in Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure which displayed their group's name, a plaque thanking the group for its efforts in arts, and a gift bag courtesy of the Yamaha corporation. Each participant receives a Disneyland specific Magic Music Days shirt.\nWalt Disney World: For the groups that perform in the Magic Music Days program, the participants might receive a couple souvenirs from Disney. Past items include a commemorative pin from the Magic Music Days (this pin is exclusively reserved for just the participants) and a shirt with the Magic Music Days logo on the front. The director/organization receive a banner indicating their groups performance for the \"World\", a plaque that they can display, or a small statue of Mickey Mouse all dressed up as a director.\n\nGroups participating in the program are taken through backstage areas of the parks that guests normally cannot see. (Photography and videography are prohibited in these areas.) The group may have their picture taken by Disney and then either perform, take part in a workshop, or experience both.\nDisneyland: Participants enter backstage via access roads along the north side of the park, using changing rooms and the four-room rehearsal hall near the backside of Toontown. They can also catch glimpses of various warehouses and the adjacent Circle D Ranch where Disneyland's livestock are kept. During this time, they can purchase drinks or snacks through vending machines. \nEpcot: A Magic Music Days building is located behind the Italian pavilion. There, groups may change into their costumes/gowns, warm up, have rehearsals, or anything else the group may need to perform prior to appearing onstage. The groups may enter the park in two locations, one being located next to Italy, and the other between Imagination! and The Land Pavilions.\nMagic Kingdom: Students performing in the Magic Kingdom are escorted through a cast-members-only entrance next to Pirates of the Caribbean. From there, they make their way to changing locations to prepare for their performance.\n\n\nLudwig/Musser Percussion and Glaesel String Instruments from Conn-Selmer, Inc. are the Official Instrument providers of Disney Magic Music Days at the Walt Disney World Resort. The town of Kissimmee, FL is also a major sponsor for the entire Magic Music Days program at the Disney World Resort complex.\nYamaha is the Official Music provider of the Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.\n\n"}

Its administration center is located in the city of Ra'anana. , the Open University had taught around 39,000 students.\n\nThe university has more students than any other academic institution in Israel, coming from all over the world. The university is accredited to award undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, diplomas and certificates.\n\nThe Open University of Israel was conceived in 1971 and founded in 1974, modeled after the UK's Open University. The first semester of studies commenced on October 17, 1976. In 1980, the Open University was officially recognized as an institute of higher learning in Israel, and was accredited to award undergraduate or bachelor's degrees (BA). In 1982, 41 graduates were awarded BA diplomas at the university's first diploma ceremony.\n\nBy 1987, the university had 11,000 students and offered 180 courses. The university grew rapidly and by 1993, it had 20,000 students and 300 courses, and 405 new graduates. Then, in 1996, the university launched its postgraduate program offering courses towards a master's degree (MA). By 2002, the university had grown to 36,710 enrolled students and by 2003, more than 13,000 people had graduated the university with an academic degree.\n\nIn 2010, the Open University began offering online courses taught in Russian. Students could enroll worldwide for 24 courses, most of them with Israeli or Jewish content. According to the online program, examinations can be held at Israeli consulates and Jewish Agency offices around the world.\n\nThe Open University is open to anyone who wishes to study towards a bachelor's degree, without any prerequisites or screening process. However, the Open University still has high standards and demands academic achievements from its graduates. Another way in which the Open University is \"open\" is in the study path it offers to its students. When enrolling in the university, the student does not need to decide the primary focus of his or her degree, nor to determine in advance the pace of the degree (how many years the studies will take). In fact, it is possible to take only a single course or several courses without receiving a degree, or to take several courses per semester, until finally enough courses relevant to a certain academic area have been taken to be eligible for a degree.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the Open University employs distance education. The university has no single central campus, or rigid schedules, making it especially well-suited to those who are preoccupied with a job, army service, or their family.\n\nThe most important aspect of studying in the Open University is self-study from books. Each of the university's courses has a specially-prepared book with the course material and exercises, from which the students study on their own. The Open University's books and teaching aids have become quite popular in Israel's other universities and colleges as well.\n\nTo supplement the self-study, there are occasional group meetings, where the students can ask the teacher questions about the material, and talk to other students who take the same course. These meetings take place throughout Israel, and are optional to attend. The students can also use the university's Internet site (\"TELEM\") to communicate with the teachers or with other students. Some courses also feature video cassettes, multimedia CDs, and other audio-visual aids. Recently, video-conferencing technology has also enabled viewing a real-time lecture without the students all coming to a single campus. For each course, students must complete several required assignments, and take a final exam. To obtain a degree, students must participate in one or more seminar courses, depending on the academic program. The examination of seminar papers is carried out by academic staff members of Israel's universities.\n\nThe Open University also has master's degree programs for some of the areas it teaches, but they are not open to everyone and do have acceptance criteria. At present, the university does not offer doctoral programs.\n\nThe Open University, together with the other Israeli universities, has reached agreements that enable students to begin their undergraduate studies within the flexible framework of the Open University and after taking a cluster of courses, decide whether they would like to complete their degree at the Open University, or transfer to another institution. The courses studied at the Open University will shorten the duration of degree studies at the other academic institution.\n\nSince 2007, the transfer options are available to:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23721", "title": "Peter Singer", "text": "Peter Singer\n\nPeter Albert David Singer, AC (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher. He is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne. He specialises in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular, utilitarian perspective. He is known in particular for his book \"Animal Liberation\" (1975), in which he argues in favour of vegetarianism, and his essay \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\", in which he argues in favour of donating to help the global poor. For most of his career, he was a preference utilitarian, but he announced in \"The Point of View of the Universe\" (2014), coauthored with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek, that he had become a hedonistic utilitarian.\n\nOn two occasions, Singer served as chair of the philosophy department at Monash University, where he founded its Centre for Human Bioethics. In 1996 he stood unsuccessfully as a Greens candidate for the Australian Senate. In 2004 Singer was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. In 2005, the Sydney Morning Herald placed Singer among Australia's ten most influential public intellectuals. Singer is a cofounder of Animals Australia and the founder of The Life You Can Save.\n\nSinger's parents were Austrian Jews who immigrated to Australia from Vienna in 1938, after Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany. They settled in Melbourne, where Singer was born. Singer's father imported tea and coffee, while his mother practiced medicine. He has an older sister, Joan (now Joan Dwyer). His grandparents were less fortunate: his paternal grandparents were taken by the Nazis to Łódź, and were never heard from again; his maternal grandfather David Ernst Oppenheim (1881–1943), a teacher, died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Oppenheim was a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and he wrote a joint article with Sigmund Freud, before joining the Adlerian sect. Singer later wrote a biography on Oppenheim.\n\nSinger is an atheist, and was raised in a prosperous, happy, non-religious family. His family rarely observed Jewish holidays, and Singer declined to have a Bar Mitzvah. Singer attended Preshil and later Scotch College. After leaving school, Singer studied law, history, and philosophy at the University of Melbourne, gaining his BA degree (hons) in 1967. He has explained that he elected to major in philosophy after his interest was piqued by discussions with his sister's then-boyfriend. He received an MA degree for a thesis entitled \"Why should I be moral?\" at the same university in 1969. He was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, and obtained from there a BPhil degree in 1971, with a thesis on civil disobedience supervised by R. M. Hare and published as a book in 1973. Singer names Hare and Australian philosopher H. J. McCloskey as his two most important mentors. One day at Balliol College in Oxford, he had what he refers to as \"probably the decisive formative experience of my life\". He was having a discussion after class with fellow graduate student Richard Keshen, a Canadian, over lunch. Keshen opted to have a salad after being told that the spaghetti sauce contained meat. Singer had the spaghetti. Singer eventually questioned Keshen about his reason for avoiding meat. Keshen explained his ethical objections. Singer would later state, \"I'd never met a vegetarian who gave such a straightforward answer that I could understand and relate to.\" Keshen later introduced Singer to his vegetarian friends. Singer was able to find one book in which he could read up on the issue (\"Animal Machines\" by Ruth Harrison) and \"within a week or two\" he approached his wife saying that he thought they needed to make a change to their diet, and that he didn't think they could justify eating meat.\n\nAfter spending two years as a Radcliffe lecturer at University College, Oxford, he was a visiting professor at New York University for 16 months. He returned to Melbourne in 1977, where he spent most of his career, aside from appointments as visiting faculty abroad, until his move to Princeton in 1999. In June 2011 it was announced he would join the professoriate of New College of the Humanities, a private college in London, in addition to his work at Princeton. He also has been a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2001.\n\nAccording to philosopher Helga Kuhse, Singer is \"almost certainly the best-known and most widely read of all contemporary philosophers\". Michael Specter wrote that Singer is among the most influential of contemporary philosophers.\n\nSince 1968 he has been married to Renata Singer; they have three children: Ruth, Marion, and Esther. Renata Singer is a novelist and author and she also has collaborated on publications with her husband.\n\nSinger's \"Practical Ethics\" (1979) analyzes why and how living beings' interests should be weighed. His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment. All have an interest in avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few have an interest in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when diminishing marginal utility is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person's interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry.\n\nAmong the more important human interests are those in avoiding pain, in developing one's abilities, in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, in enjoying warm personal relationships, in being free to pursue one's projects without interference, \"and many others\". The fundamental interest that entitles a being to equal consideration is the capacity for \"suffering and/or enjoyment or happiness\". Singer holds that a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties. The journey model is tolerant of some frustrated desire and explains why persons who have embarked on their journeys are not replaceable. Only a personal interest in continuing to live brings the journey model into play. This model also explains the priority that Singer attaches to \"interests\" over trivial desires and pleasures.\n\nEthical conduct is justified by reasons that go beyond prudence to \"something bigger than the individual\", addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as \"somehow universal\", specifically in the injunction to 'love thy neighbour as thyself', interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one's own interests. This universalising step, which Singer traces from Kant to Hare, is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists, from Hobbes to David Gauthier, who tie morality to prudence. Universalisation leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues, on the strength of the thought that one's own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others. Taking these into account, one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that is most likely to maximise the interests of those affected; utilitarianism has been arrived at. Singer's universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them, whereas a Kantian's applies to the judgments of rational agents (in Kant's kingdom of ends, or Rawls's Original Position, etc.). Singer regards Kantian universalisation as unjust to animals. As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of \"Practical Ethics\", arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as 'the paradox of hedonism', which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it, and the need most people feel to relate to something larger than their own concerns.\n\nSinger's ideas have contributed to the rise of effective altruism. He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, \"The Most Good You Can Do\". He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.\n\nHis own organisation, The Life You Can Save, also recommends a selection of charities deemed by charity evaluators such as GiveWell to be the most effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYCS was founded after Singer released his 2009 eponymous book, in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\", in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the drowning child analogy, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined, so we clearly value a human life more than the value of our material possessions. As a result, we should take a significant portion of the money that we spend on our possessions and instead donate it to charity.\n\nPublished in 1975, \"Animal Liberation\" has been cited as a formative influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement. The central argument of the book is an expansion of the utilitarian concept that \"the greatest good of the greatest number\" is the only measure of good or ethical behaviour, and Singer believes that there is no reason not to apply this principle to other animals, arguing that the boundary between human and \"animal\" is completely arbitrary. There are far more differences, for instance, between a great ape and an oyster, for example, than between a human and a great ape, and yet the former two are lumped together as \"animals\", whereas we are considered \"human\" in a way that supposedly differentiates us from all other \"animals.\"\n\nHe popularised the term \"speciesism\", which had been coined by English writer Richard D. Ryder to describe the practice of privileging humans over other animals, and therefore argues in favour of the equal consideration of interests of all sentient beings. In \"Animal Liberation\", Singer argues in favour of veganism and against animal experimentation. Singer describes himself as a flexible vegan. He writes, \"That is, I'm vegan when it's not too difficult to be vegan, but I'm not rigid about this, if I'm traveling for example.\"\n\nIn an article for the online publication Chinadialogue, Singer called Western-style meat production cruel, unhealthy, and damaging to the ecosystem. He rejected the idea that the method was necessary to meet the population's increasing demand, explaining that animals in factory farms have to eat food grown explicitly for them, and they burn up most of the food's energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm. In a 2010 Guardian article he titled, \"Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate,\" Singer drew attention to the welfare of fish. He quoted (author) Alison Mood's startling statistics from a report she wrote, which was released on fishcount.org.uk just a month before the Guardian article. Singer states that she \"has put together what may well be the first-ever systematic estimate of the size of the annual global capture of wild fish. It is, she calculates, in the order of one trillon, although it could be as high as 2.7tn.\"\n\nSome chapters of \"Animal Liberation\" are dedicated to criticising testing on animals but, unlike groups such as PETA, Singer is willing to accept such testing when there is a clear benefit for medicine. In November 2006, Singer appeared on the BBC programme \"Monkeys, Rats and Me: Animal Testing\" and said that he felt that Tipu Aziz's experiments on monkeys for research into treating Parkinson's disease could be justified. Whereas Singer has continued since the publication of \"Animal Liberation\" to promote vegetarianism and veganism, he has been much less vocal in recent years on the subject of animal experimentation.\n\nSinger has defended some of the actions of the Animal Liberation Front, such as the stealing of footage from Dr. Thomas Gennarelli's laboratory in May 1984 (as shown in the documentary \"Unnecessary Fuss\"), but he has condemned other actions such as the use of explosives by some animal-rights activists and sees the freeing of captive animals as largely futile when they are easily replaced.\n\nIn the past, Singer has not held that objective moral values exist, on the basis that reason could favour both egoism and equal consideration of interests. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism on the basis that people's preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the \"point of view of the universe\" and \"an impartial standpoint\". But in the Second Edition of \"Practical Ethics\", he concedes that the question of why we should act morally \"cannot be given an answer that will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally\".\n\nHowever, when co-authoring \"The Point of View of the Universe\" (2014), Singer shifted to the position that objective moral values do exist, and defends the 19th century utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick's view that objective morality can be derived from fundamental moral axioms that are knowable by reason. Additionally, he endorses Derek Parfit's view that there are object-given reasons for action. Furthermore, Singer and Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek (the co-author of the book) argue that evolutionary debunking arguments can be used to demonstrate that it is more rational to take the impartial standpoint of \"the point of view of the universe\", as opposed to egoism—pursuing one's own self-interest—because the existence of egoism is more likely to be the product of evolution by natural selection, rather than because it is correct, whereas taking an impartial standpoint and equally considering the interests of all sentient beings is in conflict with what we would expect from natural selection, meaning that it is more likely that impartiality in ethics is the correct stance to pursue.\n\nWhilst a student in Melbourne, Singer campaigned against the Vietnam War as president of the Melbourne University Campaign Against Conscription. He also spoke publicly for the legalisation of abortion in Australia.\nSinger joined the Australian Labor Party in 1974, but resigned after disillusionment with the centrist leadership of Bob Hawke. In 1992, he became a founding member of the Victorian Greens. He has run for political office twice for the Greens: in 1994 he received 28% of the vote in the Kooyong by-election, and in 1996 he received 3% of the vote when running for the Senate (elected by proportional representation). Before the 1996 election, he co-authored a book \"The Greens\" with Bob Brown.\n\nIn \"A Darwinian Left\", Singer outlines a plan for the political left to adapt to the lessons of evolutionary biology. He says that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is \"right.\" He concludes that game theory (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially, Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for cooperation that also has been selected for during human evolution. Singer's writing in \"Greater Good\" magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley, includes the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.\n\nSinger has criticized the United States for receiving \"oil from countries run by dictators ... who pocket most of the\" financial gains, thus \"keeping the people in poverty.\" Singer believes that the wealth of these countries \"should belong to the people\" within them rather than their \"de facto government. In paying dictators for their oil, we are in effect buying stolen goods, and helping to keep people in poverty.\" Singer holds that America \"should be doing more to assist people in extreme poverty\". He is disappointed in U.S. foreign aid policy, deeming it \"a very small proportion of our GDP, less than a quarter of some other affluent nations.\" Singer maintains that little \"private philanthropy from the U.S.\" is \"directed to helping people in extreme poverty, although there are some exceptions, most notably, of course, the Gates Foundation.\"\n\nSinger describes himself as not anti-capitalist, stating in a 2010 interview with the New Left Project:\n\nCapitalism is very far from a perfect system, but so far we have yet to find anything that clearly does a better job of meeting human needs than a regulated capitalist economy coupled with a welfare and health care system that meets the basic needs of those who do not thrive in the capitalist economy.\n\nHe added that \"[i]f we ever do find a better system, I'll be happy to call myself an anti-capitalist\".\n\nSimilarly, in his book \"Marx\", Singer is sympathetic to Marx's criticism of capitalism, but is skeptical about whether a better system is likely to be created, writing: \"Marx saw that capitalism is a wasteful, irrational system, a system which controls us when we should be controlling it. That insight is still valid; but we can now see that the construction of a free and equal society is a more difficult task than Marx realised.\"\n\nSinger is opposed to the death penalty, claiming that it does not effectively deter the crimes for which it is the punitive measure, and that he cannot see any other justification for it.\n\nIn 2010, Singer signed a petition renouncing his 'right of return' to Israel, which called it \"a form of racist privilege that abets the colonial oppression of the Palestinians\".\n\nIn 2016, Singer called on Jill Stein to withdraw from the US presidential election in states that were close between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, on the grounds that \"The stakes are too high\". He argued against the view that there was no significant difference between Clinton and Trump, whilst also saying that he would not advocate such a tactic in Australia's electoral system, which allows for ranking of preferences.\n\nWhen writing in 2017 on Trump's denial of climate change and plans to withdraw from the Paris accords, Singer advocated a boycott of all consumer goods from the United States to pressure the Trump administration to change its environmental policies.\n\nSinger holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being's capacity to hold preferences, which in turn is essentially tied to a being's capacity to feel pain and pleasure.\n\nIn \"Practical Ethics\", Singer argues in favour of abortion rights on the grounds that fetuses are neither rational nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood.\n\nSimilar to his argument for abortion rights, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood—\"rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness\"—and therefore \"killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living\". Singer has clarified that his \"view of when life begins isn’t very different from that of opponents of abortion.\" He deems it not \"unreasonable to hold that an individual human life begins at conception. If it doesn’t, then it begins about 14 days later, when it is no longer possible for the embryo to divide into twins or other multiples.\" Singer disagrees with abortion rights opponents in that he does not \"think that the fact that an embryo is a living human being is sufficient to show that it is wrong to kill it.\" Singer wishes \"to see American jurisprudence, and the national abortion debate, take up the question of which capacities a human being needs to have in order for it to be wrong kill it\" as well as \"when, in the development of the early human being, these capacities are present.\"\n\nSinger classifies euthanasia as voluntary, involuntary, or non-voluntary. Voluntary euthanasia is that to which the subject consents. He argues in favour of voluntary euthanasia and some forms of non-voluntary euthanasia, including infanticide in certain instances, but opposes involuntary euthanasia.\n\nReligious critics have argued that Singer's ethic ignores and undermines the traditional notion of the sanctity of life. Singer agrees and believes the notion of the sanctity of life ought to be discarded as outdated, unscientific, and irrelevant to understanding problems in contemporary bioethics. Bioethicists associated with the Disability Rights and Disability Studies communities have argued that his epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability. Singer's positions have also been criticised by some advocates for disability rights and right-to-life supporters, concerned with what they see as his attacks upon human dignity. Singer has replied that many people judge him based on secondhand summaries and short quotations taken out of context, not his books or articles and, that his aim is to elevate the status of animals, not to lower that of humans. American publisher Steve Forbes ceased his donations to Princeton University in 1999 because of Singer's appointment to a prestigious professorship. Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal wrote to organisers of a Swedish book fair to which Singer was invited that \"A professor of morals ... who justifies the right to kill handicapped newborns ... is in my opinion unacceptable for representation at your level.\" Marc Maurer, President of the National Federation of the Blind, criticised Singer's appointment to the Princeton Faculty in a banquet speech at the organisation's national convention in July 2001, claiming that Singer's support for euthanising disabled babies could lead to disabled older children and adults being valued less as well. Conservative psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple wrote in 2010 that Singerian moral universalism is \"preposterous—psychologically, theoretically, and practically\".\n\nIn 2002 disability rights activist Harriet McBryde Johnson debated Singer, challenging his belief that it is morally permissible to euthanize new-born children with severe disabilities. \"Unspeakable Conversations\", Johnson's account of her encounters with Singer and the pro-euthanasia movement, was published in the \"New York Times Magazine\" in 2003. It also served as inspiration for \"The Thrill\", a 2013 play by Judith Thompson partly based on Johnson's life.\n\nSinger has experienced the complexities of some of these questions in his own life. His mother had Alzheimer's disease. He said, \"I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult\". In an interview with Ronald Bailey, published in December 2000, he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother. He did say that, if he were solely responsible, his mother might not continue to live.\n\nIn 1985, Singer wrote a book with the physician Deanne Wells arguing that surrogate motherhood should be allowed and regulated by the state by establishing nonprofit 'State Surrogacy Boards', which would ensure fairness between surrogate mothers and surrogacy-seeking parents. Singer and Wells endorsed both the payment of medical expenses endured by surrogate mothers and an extra \"fair fee\" to compensate the surrogate mother.\n\nSinger was a speaker at the 2012 Global Atheist Convention. He has debated with Christians such as John Lennox and Dinesh D'Souza. Singer has pointed to the problem of evil as an objection against the Christian conception of God. He stated: \"The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible to believe that the world was not created by any god at all. If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good. He must be either evil or a bungler.\" In keeping with his considerations of non-human animals, Singer also takes issue with the original sin reply to the problem of evil, saying that, \"animals also suffer from floods, fires, and droughts, and, since they are not descended from Adam and Eve, they cannot have inherited original sin.\"\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Peter Singer's work was the subject of a number of protests in Germany. A course in ethics led by Dr. Hartmut Kliemt at the University of Duisburg where the main text used was Singer's \"Practical Ethics\" was, according to Singer, \"subjected to organised and repeated disruption by protesters objecting to the use of the book on the grounds that in one of its ten chapters it advocates active euthanasia for severely disabled newborn infants\". The protests led to the course being shut down.\n\nWhen Singer tried to speak during a lecture at Saarbrücken, he was interrupted by a group of protesters including advocates for disability rights. One of the protesters expressed that entering serious discussions would be a tactical error.\n\nThe same year, Singer was invited to speak in Marburg at a European symposium on \"Bioengineering, Ethics and Mental Disability\". The invitation was fiercely attacked by leading intellectuals and organisations in German media, with an article in \"Der Spiegel\" comparing Singer's positions to Nazism. Eventually, the symposium was cancelled and Singer's invitation consequently withdrawn.\n\nA lecture at the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich also was interrupted by two groups of protesters. The first group was a group of disabled people who staged a brief protest at the beginning of the lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting \"Singer raus! Singer raus!\" (\"Singer out!\") When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage and grabbed his glasses, and the host ended the lecture. The first group of protesters was distressed by this second, more aggressive group. It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had questions to ask Singer. Singer explains \"my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally\" and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.\n\nIn 1991, Singer was due to speak along with R. M. Hare and Georg Meggle at the 15th International Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg am Wechsel, Austria. Singer has stated that threats were made to Adolf Hübner, then the president of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society, that the conference would be disrupted if Singer and Meggle were given a platform. Hübner proposed to the board of the society that Singer's invitation (as well as the invitations of a number of other speakers) be withdrawn. The Society decided to cancel the symposium.\n\nIn an article originally published in \"The New York Review of Books\", Singer argued that the protests dramatically increased the amount of coverage he got: \"instead of a few hundred people hearing views at lectures in Marburg and Dortmund, several millions read about them or listened to them on television\". Despite this, Singer argues that it has led to a difficult intellectual climate, with professors in Germany unable to teach courses on applied ethics and campaigns demanding the resignation of professors who invited Singer to speak.\n\nSinger was inducted into the United States Animal Rights Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nOn 11 June 2012, Singer was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for \"eminent service to philosophy and bioethics as a leader of public debate and communicator of ideas in the areas of global poverty, animal welfare and the human condition.\"\n\nSinger received \"Philosophy Now\"'s 2016 Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity for his efforts \"to disturb the comfortable complacency with which many of us habitually ignore the desperate needs of others ... particularly for this work as it relates to the Effective Altruism movement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20411847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20411847", "title": "School corporal punishment", "text": "School corporal punishment\n\nSchool corporal punishment refers to causing deliberate pain or discomfort in response to undesired behaviour by students in schools. It often involves striking the student either across the buttocks or on the hands, with an implement such as a rattan cane, wooden paddle, slipper, leather strap or wooden yardstick. Less commonly, it could also include spanking or smacking the student with the open hand, especially at the elementary school level.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, the use by schools of corporal punishment has historically been justified by the common-law doctrine \"in loco parentis\", whereby teachers are considered authority figures granted the same rights as parents to punish children in their care.\n\nAdvocates of school corporal punishment argue that it provides an immediate response to indiscipline and that the student is quickly back in the classroom learning, as opposed to suspension from school. Opponents, including a number of medical and psychological societies, along with human-rights groups, argue that physical punishment is ineffective in the long term, interferes with learning, leads to antisocial behavior as well as various forms of mental distress, disproportionately affects students of color, and is a form of violence that breaches the rights of children.\n\nPoland was the first nation to outlaw corporal punishment in schools in 1783. School corporal punishment is no longer legal in any European country. As of 2016, an estimated 128 countries have prohibited corporal punishment in schools, including all of Europe, and most of South America and East Asia. Approximately 69 countries still allow for corporal punishment in schools, including parts of the United States, some Australian states, and a number of countries in Africa and Asia.\n\nCorporal punishment in the context of schools in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been variously defined as: causing deliberate pain to a child in response to the child's undesired behavior and/or language, \"purposeful infliction of bodily pain or discomfort by an official in the educational system upon a student as a penalty for unacceptable behavior\", and \"intentional application of physical pain as a means of changing behavior\" (not the occasional use of physical restraint to protect student or others from immediate harm).\n\nCorporal punishment used to be prevalent in schools in many parts of the world, but in recent decades it has been outlawed in 128 countries including all of Europe, most of South America, as well as in Canada, Japan, South Africa, New Zealand and several other countries. It remains commonplace in a number of countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East (see list of countries, below).\n\nWhile most U.S. states have outlawed corporal punishment in state schools, it continues to be allowed mainly in the Southern and Western United States. According to the United States Department of Education, more than 216,000 students were subjected to corporal punishment during the 200809 school year.\n\nMuch of the traditional culture that surrounds corporal punishment in school, at any rate in the English-speaking world, derives largely from British practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly as regards the caning of teenage boys. There is a vast amount of literature on this, in both popular and serious culture. Britain itself outlawed the practice in 1987 for state schools and more recently for all schools.\n\nThe doctrine of \"in loco parentis\" lets school officials stand in for parents as comparable authority figures. The doctrine has its origins in an English common-law precedent of 1770.\nMany schools in Singapore and Malaysia use caning (for boys) as a routine official punishment for misconduct, as also some African countries. In some Middle Eastern countries whipping is used. (See list of countries, below.)\n\nIn most of continental Europe, school corporal punishment has been banned for several decades or longer, depending on the country (see the list of countries below).\n\nFrom the 1917 Russian revolution onwards, corporal punishment was outlawed in the Soviet Union, because it was deemed contrary to communist ideology. Communists in other countries such as Britain took the lead in campaigning against school corporal punishment, which they viewed as a symptom of the decadence of capitalist education systems. In the 1960s, Soviet visitors to western schools expressed shock at the caning of boys there. Other communist regimes followed suit: for instance, corporal punishment was \"unknown\" by students in North Korea in 2007. In mainland China, corporal punishment in schools was outlawed in 1986, although the practice remains common, especially in rural areas.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there are three broad rationales for the use of corporal punishment in schools: beliefs, based in traditional religion, that adults have a right, if not a duty, to physically punish misbehaving children; a disciplinary philosophy that corporal punishment builds character, being necessary for the development of a child's conscience and their respect for adult authority figures; and beliefs concerning the needs and rights of teachers, specifically that corporal punishment is essential for maintaining order and control in the classroom.\n\nSchool officials and policymakers often rely on personal anecdotes to argue that school corporal punishment improves students' behavior and achievement. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing that corporal punishment leads to better control in the classroom. In particular, evidence does not suggest that it enhances moral character development, increases students' respect for teachers or other authority figures, or offers greater security for teachers.\n\nA number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued statements opposing all corporal punishment in schools, citing such outcomes as poorer academic achievement, increases in antisocial behaviour, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning environment. They include the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the American Psychological Association, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Australian Psychological Society, as well as the United States' National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\nAccording to the AAP, research shows that corporal punishment is less effective than other methods of behaviour management in schools, and \"praise, discussions regarding values, and positive role models do more to develop character, respect, and values than does corporal punishment\". They say that evidence links corporal punishment of students to a number of adverse outcomes, including: \"increased aggressive and destructive behaviour, increased disruptive classroom behaviour, vandalism, poor school achievement, poor attention span, increased drop-out rate, school avoidance and school phobia, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatic complaints, depression, suicide and retaliation against teachers\". The AAP recommends a number of alternatives to corporal punishment including various nonviolent behaviour-management strategies, modifications to the school environment, and increased support for teachers.\n\nAn estimated 1 to 2 percent of physically punished students in the United States are seriously injured, to the point of needing medical attention. According to the AAP and the Society for Adolescent Medicine, these injuries have included bruises, abrasions, broken bones, whiplash injury, muscle damage, brain injury, and even death. Other reported injuries to students include \"sciatic nerve damage\" \"extensive hematomas\", and \"life-threatening fat hemorrhage\".\n\nThe AAP cautions that there is a risk of corporal punishment in schools fostering the impression among students that violence is an appropriate means for managing others' behaviour. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"Corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain\". And according to the Society for Adolescent Medicine, \"The use of corporal punishment in schools promotes a very precarious message: that violence is an acceptable phenomenon in our society. It sanctions the notion that it is meritorious to be violent toward our children, thereby devaluing them in society's eyes. It encourages children to resort to violence because they see their authority figures or substitute parents doing it [...] Violence is not acceptable and we must not support it by sanctioning its use by such authority figures as school officials\".\n\nThe Society for Adolescent Medicine recommends developing \"a milieu of effective communication, in which the teacher displays an attitude of respect for the students\", as well as instruction that is stimulating and appropriate to student's abilities, various nonviolent behaviour modification techniques, and involving students and parents in making decisions about school matters such as rules and educational goals. They suggest that student self-governance can be an effective alternative for managing disruptive classroom behaviour, while stressing the importance of adequate training and support for teachers.\n\nThe AAP remarks that there has been \"no reported increase in disciplinary problems in schools following the elimination of corporal punishment\" according to evidence.\n\nA number of international human-rights organizations including the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have stated that physical punishment of any kind is a violation of children's human rights.\n\nAccording to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, \"Children do not lose their human rights by virtue of passing through the school gates [...] the use of corporal punishment does not respect the inherent dignity of the child nor the strict limits on school discipline\". The Committee interprets Article 19 of the Convention on the rights of the child, which obliges member states to \"take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse […] while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child\", to imply a prohibition on all forms of corporal punishment.\n\nOther international human-rights bodies supporting prohibition of corporal punishment of children in all settings, including schools, include the European Committee of Social Rights and the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. In addition, the obligation of member states to prohibit corporal punishment in schools and elsewhere was affirmed in the 2009 Cairo Declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Islamic Jurisprudence.\n\nAccording to the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, all forms of corporal punishment in schools are outlawed in 128 countries as of 2016. (46 of these countries also prohibited corporal punishment of children in the home as of May 2015).\n\nBanned in 1813, corporal punishment was re-legalised in 1815 and punishments by physical pain lasted legally till 1884, when it was banned again unless there was a Court order. The instruments were rebenques, slappings in the face and others. All corporal punishment in children is prohibited everywhere (schools, home, etc) since 2016.\n\nIn Australia, laws on corporal punishment in schools are determined at individual state or territory level. While still legal in private schools in some states, in practice, very few schools impose corporal punishment.\n\nCorporal punishment in schools was banned in Austria in 1974.\n\nCorporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in Bolivia in 2014. According to the Children and Adolescents Code, \"The child and adolescent has the right to good treatment, comprising a non-violent upbringing and education... Any physical, violent and humiliating punishment is prohibited\".\n\nCorporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in Brazil in 2014. According to an amendment to the Code on Children and Adolescents 1990, \"Children and Adolescents are entitled to be educated and cared for without the use of physical punishment or cruel or degrading treatment as forms of correction, discipline, education or any other pretext\".\n\nCaning is commonly used by teachers as a punishment in schools. The cane is applied on the students' buttocks, calves or palms of the hands in front of the class. Tramline cane marks could be left. Sit-ups with ears pulled and arms crossed, kneeling, and standing on the bench in the classroom are other forms of corporal punishments used in schools. Common reasons for punishment include talking in class, not finishing homework, mistakes made with classwork, fighting and truancy.\n\nIn \"Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada\" (2004) the Supreme Court outlawed school corporal punishment. In public schools, the usual implement was a rubber/canvas strap applied to the hands, while private schools often used a paddle or cane administered to the student's posterior. In many parts of Canada, 'the strap' had not been used in public schools since the 1970s or even earlier: thus, it has been claimed that it had not been used in Quebec since the 1960s, and in Toronto it was banned in 1971. However, some schools in Alberta had been using the strap up until the ban in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada outlawed corporal punishment in all schools, public or private. The practice itself had largely been abandoned in the 1970s when parents placed greater scrutiny on the treatment of children at school. The subject received extensive media coverage, and corporal punishment became obsolete as the practice was widely seen as degrading and inhumane. Despite the fact that the tradition had been forgone for nearly 30 years, legislation banning the practice entirely by law was not implemented until 2004.\nSome Canadian provinces banned corporal punishment in public schools prior to the national ban in 2004. They are, in chronological order by year of provincial ban:\n\n\nCorporal punishment in China was officially banned after the communist revolution in 1949. The Compulsory Education Law of 1986 states: \"It shall be forbidden to inflict physical punishment on students\". In practice, beatings by schoolteachers are common, especially in rural areas.\n\nColombian private and public schools were banned from using \"penalties involving physical or psychological abuse\" through the Children and Adolescents Code 2006, though it is not clear whether this also applies to indigenous communities.\n\nAll corporal punishment, both in school and in the home, has been banned since 2008.\n\nCorporal punishment is outlawed under Article 31 of the Education Act.\n\nCorporal punishment was prohibited in the public schools in Copenhagen Municipality in 1951 and by law in all schools of Denmark in 1967.\n\nA 1998 study found that random physical punishment (not proper formal corporal punishment) was being used extensively by teachers in Egypt to punish behavior they regarded as unacceptable. Around 80% of the boys and 60% of the girls were punished by teachers, using their hands, sticks, straps, shoes, punches and kicks as most common methods of administration. The most common reported injuries were bumps and contusions.\n\nCorporal punishment in public schools was banned in 1914, but remained \"de facto\" commonplace until 1984, when a law banning all corporal punishment of minors, even by parents, was introduced.\n\nThe systematic use of corporal punishment has been absent from French schools since the 19th century. There is no explicit legal ban on it, but in 2008 a teacher was fined €500 for what some people describe as slapping a student.\n\nSchool corporal punishment, historically widespread, was outlawed in different states via their administrative law at different times. It was not completely abolished everywhere until 1983. Since 1993, use of corporal punishment by a teacher has been a criminal offence. In that year a sentence by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany (\"Bundesgerichtshof\", case number NStZ 1993.591) was published which overruled the previous powers enshrined in unofficial customary law (\"Gewohnheitsrecht\") and upheld by some regional appeal courts (\"Oberlandesgericht\", Superior State Court) even in the 1970s. They assumed a \"right of chastisement\" was a defense of justification against the accusation of \"causing bodily harm\" per \"Paragraph\" (=Section) \"223 Strafgesetzbuch\" (Federal Penal Code).\n\nCorporal punishment in Greek primary schools was banned in 1998, and in secondary schools in 2005.\n\nCorporal punishment is still used in most of India. The Delhi High Court banned its use in Delhi schools in 2000. 17 out of 29 states claim to apply the ban, though enforcement is lax. A number of social and cultural groups, including Shankaracharya, are campaigning against corporal punishment in India. In many states, corporal punishment is still practised within most schools. Society for Prevention of Injuries & Corporal Punishment (SPIC) is actively running awareness campaigns to educate the teachers and students through conferences and scientific publications.\n\nIn the law of the Republic of Ireland, corporal punishment was prohibited in 1982 by an administrative decision of John Boland, the Minister for Education, which applied to national schools (most primary schools) and to secondary schools receiving public funding (practically all of them). Teachers were not liable to criminal prosecution until 1997, when the rule of law allowing \"physical chastisement\" was explicitly abolished.\n\nCorporal punishment in Italian schools was banned in 1928.\n\nAlthough banned in 1947, corporal punishment is still commonly found in schools in the 2010s and particularly widespread in school sports clubs. In late 1987, about 60% of junior high school teachers felt it was necessary, with 7% believing it was necessary in all conditions, 59% believing it should be applied sometimes and 32% disapproving of it in all circumstances; while at elementary (primary) schools, 2% supported it unconditionally, 47% felt it was necessary and 49% disapproved. As recent as December 2012, a high school student committed suicide after having been constantly beaten by his basketball coach. An education ministry survey found that more than 10,000 students received illegal corporal punishment from more than 5,000 teachers across Japan in 2012 fiscal year alone.\n\nCorporal punishment in schools was banned in 1845 and became a criminal offence in 1974 (Aggravated Assault on Minors under Authority). \n\nCaning is a common form of discipline in many Malaysian schools. Legally it should be applied only to male students, but the idea of making the caning of girls lawful has recently been debated. This would be applied to the palm of the hand, whereas boys are typically caned across the seat of the trousers.\n\nBanned in 1920.\n\nCorporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control. Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.\n\nAs enacted, the law had a loophole: parents, provided they were not school staff, could still discipline their children on school grounds. In early 2007, a southern Auckland Christian school was found to be using this loophole to discipline students by corporal punishment, by making the student's parents administer the punishment. This loophole was closed in May 2007 by the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which enacted a blanket ban on parents administering corporal punishment to their children.\n\nCorporal punishment in Norwegian schools was strongly restricted in 1889, and was prohibited outright in 1936.\n\nSchool corporal punishment in Pakistan is not very common in modern educational institutions although it is still used in schools across the rural parts of the country as a means of enforcing student discipline. The method has been criticised by some children's rights activists who claim that many cases of corporal punishment in schools have resulted in physical and mental abuse of schoolchildren. According to one report, corporal punishment is a key reason for school dropouts and subsequently, street children, in Pakistan; as many as 35,000 high school pupils in Pakistan are said to drop out of the education system each year because they have been punished or abused in school.\n\nCorporal punishment is prohibited in private and public schools.\n\nIn 1783, Poland became the first country in the world to prohibit corporal punishment. Peter Newell assumes that perhaps the most influential writer on the subject was the English philosopher John Locke, whose \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" explicitly criticised the central role of corporal punishment in education. Locke's work was highly influential, and may have helped influence Polish legislators to ban corporal punishment from Poland's schools in 1783. Today, the ban of corporal punishment in all forms is vested in Constitution of Poland.\n\nCorporal punishment was banned in Soviet (and hence, Russian) schools in 1917. In addition, the Article 336 (since 2006) of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation states that any teacher who has used corporal punishment on a pupil shall be dismissed.\n\nCorporal punishment was first explicitly prohibited in schools in article 67 of the Law on Public Schools 1929, passed in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was then a part. Other now independent countries which belonged to Yugoslavia then and to which the 1929 Law applied are: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Slovenia. In Serbia, corporal punishment in schools is now unlawful under the Law on Secondary Schools 1992, the Law on Elementary Schools 1992 and the Law on the Foundations of Education and Upbringing 2003/2009.\n\nCorporal punishment is legal in Singapore schools (for male students only, it is illegal to inflict it on female students) and fully encouraged by the government in order to maintain strict discipline. Only a light rattan cane may be used. This must be administered in a formal ceremony by the school management after due deliberation, not by classroom teachers. Most secondary schools (whether independent, autonomous or government-controlled), and also some primary schools, use caning to deal with misconduct by boys. At the secondary level, the rattan strokes are nearly always delivered to the student's clothed buttocks. The Ministry of Education has stipulated a maximum of six strokes per occasion. In some cases the punishment is carried out in front of the rest of the school instead of in private.\n\nThe use of corporal punishment in schools was prohibited by the South African Schools Act, 1996. According to section 10 of the act:\nIn the case of \"Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education\" the Constitutional Court rejected a claim that the constitutional right to religious freedom entitles private Christian schools to impose corporal punishment.\n\nLiberal regions in South Korea have completely banned all forms of caning beginning with Gyeonggi Province in 2010, followed by Seoul Metropolitan City, Gangwon Province, Gwangju Metropolitan City and North Jeolla Province in 2011. Other more conservative regions are governed by a national law enacted in 2011 which states that while caning is generally forbidden, it can be used indirectly to maintain school discipline. It is still known to be practised.\n\nCorporal punishment in Spanish schools was banned in 1985.\n\nCorporal punishment at school has been prohibited in \"folkskolestadgan\" (the elementary school ordinance) since 1 January 1958. Its use by ordinary teachers in grammar schools had been outlawed in 1928.\n\nIn 2006 Taiwan made corporal punishment in the school system illegal, but it is still known to be practised (see Corporal punishment in Taiwan).\n\nIn Tanzania corporal punishment in schools is widely practised and has lead to lasting damage including death of a punished pupil. The Education Act of 2002 authorizes the minister in charge of education to issue regulations concerning corporal punishment. The Education (Corporal Punishment) Regulation G.N. 294 of 2002 gives the authority to order corporal punishment to the headmaster of a school who can delegate to any teacher on case by case basis. The number of strikes must not be more than 4 for each occurrence, The school should have a register where date, reason, name of pupil and of administering teacher together with the number of strikes is to be recorded .\n\nCorporal punishment in schools is illegal under the Ministry of Education Regulation on Student Punishment (2005) and the National Committee on Child Protection Regulation on Working Procedures of Child Protection Officers Involved in Promoting Behaviour of Students (2005), pursuant to article 65 of the Child Protection Act.\n\nThai proverb \"If you love your cow, tie it up; if you love your child, beat him.\" is still considered \"wisdom\" and is held by many parents and teachers.\n\nCorporal punishment was banned in Soviet (and hence, Ukrainian) schools in 1917.\nIn Ukraine, \"physical or mental violence\" against children is forbidden by the Constitution (Art.52.2) and the Law on Education (Art.51.1, since 1991) which states that students and other learners have the right “to the protection from any form of exploitation, physical and psychological violence, actions of pedagogical and other employees who violate the rights or humiliate their honour and dignity”. Standard instructions for teachers provided by the Ministry of Science and Education state that a teacher who has used corporal punishment to a pupil (even once), shall be dismissed.\n\nA federal law was implemented in 1998 which banned school corporal punishment. The law applied to all schools, both public and private. Any teacher who engages in the practice would not only lose their job and teaching license, but will also face criminal prosecution for engaging in violence against minors and will also face child abuse charges.\n\nIn state-run schools, and in private schools where at least part of the funding came from government, corporal punishment was outlawed by the British Parliament in 1986, following a 1982 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that such punishment could not be administered without parental consent, and that a child's \"right to education\" could not be infringed by suspending children who, with parental approval, refused to submit to corporal punishment. In other private schools, it was banned in 1998 (England and Wales), 2000 (Scotland) and 2003 (Northern Ireland). Schools had to keep a record of punishments inflicted, and there are occasional press reports of examples of these \"punishment books\" having survived.\n\nThe implement used in many state and private schools in England and Wales was often a rattan cane, struck either across the student's hands or (especially in the case of teenage boys) the clothed buttocks. \"Slippering\"—striking the buttocks with a rubber-soled gym shoe, or plimsoll shoe—was widely used in many schools, for example King's School, Macclesfield, a boys grammar school in Cheshire. In a few English cities, a strap was used instead of the cane. In Scotland a leather strap, the tawse, administered to the palms of the hands, was universal in state schools, but some private schools used the cane.\n\nPrior to the ban in private schools in England, the \"slippering\" of a student at an independent boarding school was challenged in 1993 before the European Court of Human Rights. The Court ruled 5–4 in that case that the punishment was not severe enough to infringe the student's \"freedom from degrading punishment\" under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The dissenting judges argued that the ritualised nature of the punishment, given after several days and without parental consent, should qualify it as \"degrading punishment\".\n\n\"R (Williamson) v Secretary of State for Education and Employment\" (2005) was an unsuccessful challenge to the prohibition of corporal punishment contained in the Education Act 1996, by several headmasters of private Christian schools who argued that it was a breach of their religious freedom.\n\nIn response to a 2008 poll of 6,162 UK teachers by the \"Times Educational Supplement\", 22% of secondary school teachers and 16% of primary school teachers supported \"the right to use corporal punishment in extreme cases\". The National Union of Teachers said that it \"could not support the views expressed by those in favour of hitting children\".\n\nThere is no federal law addressing corporal punishment in public or private schools. In 1977, the Supreme Court ruling in \"Ingraham v. Wright\" held that the Eighth Amendment clause prohibiting \"cruel and unusual punishments\" did not apply to school students, and that teachers could punish children without parental permission.\n\nAs of 2015, 31 states and the District of Columbia have banned corporal punishment in public schools, though in some of these there is no explicit prohibition. Corporal punishment is also unlawful in private schools in Iowa and New Jersey. In 19 U.S. states, corporal punishment is lawful in both public and private schools. It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools. Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even legal adults who have reached the age of majority are sometimes spanked by school officials. American legal scholars have argued that school paddling is unconstitutional and can cause lasting physical, emotional, and cognitive harm.\n\nCorporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in Venezuela in 2007. According to the Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents, \"All children and young people have a right to be treated well. This right includes a non-violent education and upbringing... Consequently, all forms of physical and humiliating punishment are prohibited\".\n\nIn Uganda, teachers usually keep their huge classes calm by corporal punishment. However, there is some movement, who wants them to change disciplining methods by using positive discipline. Teachers should better teach them how to improve, when they performed badly\n\n"}
{"id": "26656516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26656516", "title": "Science and technology in Iran", "text": "Science and technology in Iran\n\nIran has made considerable advances in science and technology through education and training, despite international sanctions in almost all aspects of research during the past 30 years. Iran's university population swelled from 100,000 in 1979 to 2 million in 2006. In recent years, the growth in Iran's scientific output is reported to be the fastest in the world. Iran has made great strides in different sectors, including aerospace, nuclear science, medical development, as well as stem cell and cloning research.\n\nThroughout history, Persia was always a cradle of science, contributing to medicine, mathematics, astronomy and philosophy. Trying to revive the golden time of Persian science, Iran's scientists now are cautiously reaching out to the world. Many individual Iranian scientists, along with the Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences and Academy of Sciences of Iran, are involved in this revival.\n\nScience in Persia evolved in two main phases separated by the arrival and widespread adoption of Islam in the region.\n\nReferences to scientific subjects such as natural science and mathematics occur in books written in the Pahlavi languages.\n\nThe Qanat (a water management system used for irrigation) originated in pre-Achaemenid Persia. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of Gonabad, which, after 2,700 years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people.\n\nPersian philosophers and inventors may have created the first batteries (sometimes known as the Baghdad Battery) in the Parthian or Sassanid eras. Some have suggested that the batteries may have been used medicinally. Other scientists believe the batteries were used for electroplating—transferring a thin layer of metal to another metal surface—a technique still used today and the focus of a common classroom experiment.\n\nWindwheels were developed by the Babylonians ca. 1700 BC to pump water for irrigation. In the 7th century, Persian engineers in Greater Iran developed a more advanced wind-power machine, the windmill, building upon the basic model developed by the Babylonians.\n\nThe 9th century mathematician Muhammad Ibn Musa-al-Kharazmi created the Logarithm table, developed algebra and expanded upon Persian and Indian arithmetic systems. His writings were translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona under the title: \"De jebra et almucabola\". Robert of Chester also translated it under the title \"Liber algebras et almucabala\". The works of Kharazmi \"exercised a profound influence on the development of mathematical thought in the medieval West\".\n\nOther Persian scientists included Abu Abbas Fazl Hatam, the Banu Musa brothers, Farahani, Omar Ibn Farakhan, Abu Zeid Ahmad Ibn Soheil Balkhi (9th century AD), Abul Vafa Bouzjani, Abu Jaafar Khan, Bijan Ibn Rostam Kouhi, Ahmad Ibn Abdul Jalil Qomi, Bu Nasr Araghi, Abu Reyhan Birooni, the noted Iranian poet Hakim Omar Khayyam Neishaburi, Qatan Marvazi, Massoudi Ghaznavi (13th century AD), Khajeh Nassireddin Tusi, and Ghiasseddin Jamshidi Kashani.\n\nThe practice and study of medicine in Iran has a long and prolific history. Situated at the crossroads of the East and West, Persia was often involved in developments in ancient Greek and Indian medicine; pre- and post-Islamic Iran have been involved in medicine as well.\n\nFor example, the first teaching hospital where medical students methodically practiced on patients under the supervision of physicians was the Academy of Gundishapur in the Persian Empire. Some experts go so far as to claim that: \"to a very large extent, the credit for the whole hospital system must be given to Persia\".\n\nThe idea of xenotransplantation dates to the days of Achaemenidae (the Achaemenian dynasty), as evidenced by engravings of many mythologic chimeras still present in Persepolis.\n\nSeveral documents still exist from which the definitions and treatments of the headache in medieval Persia can be ascertained. These documents give detailed and precise clinical information on the different types of headaches. The medieval physicians listed various signs and symptoms, apparent causes, and hygienic and dietary rules for prevention of headaches. The medieval writings are both accurate and vivid, and they provide long lists of substances used in the treatment of headaches. Many of the approaches of physicians in medieval Persia are accepted today; however, still more of them could be of use to modern medicine.\n\nIn the 10th century work of Shahnameh, Ferdowsi describes a Caesarean section performed on Rudabeh, during which a special wine agent was prepared by a Zoroastrian priest and used to produce unconsciousness for the operation. Although largely mythical in content, the passage illustrates working knowledge of anesthesia in ancient Persia.\n\nLater in the 10th century, Abu Bakr Muhammad Bin Zakaria Razi is considered the founder of practical physics and the inventor of the special or net weight of matter. His student, Abu Bakr Joveini, wrote the first comprehensive medical book in the Persian language.\n\nAfter the Islamic conquest of Iran, medicine continued to flourish with the rise of notables such as Rhazes and Haly Abbas, albeit Baghdad was the new cosmopolitan inheritor of Sassanid Jundishapur's medical academy.\n\nAn idea of the number of medical works composed in Persian alone may be gathered from Adolf Fonahn's \"Zur Quellenkunde der Persischen Medizin\", published in Leipzig in 1910. The author enumerates over 400 works in the Persian language on medicine, excluding authors such as Avicenna, who wrote in Arabic. Author-historians Meyerhof, Casey Wood, and Hirschberg also have recorded the names of at least 80 oculists who contributed treatises on subjects related to ophthalmology from the beginning of 800 AD to the full flowering of Muslim medical literature in 1300 AD.\n\nAside from the aforementioned, two other medical works attracted great attention in medieval Europe, namely Abu Mansur Muwaffaq's \"Materia Medica\", written around 950 AD, and the illustrated \"Anatomy\" of \"Mansur ibn Muhammad\", written in 1396 AD.\n\nModern academic medicine began in Iran when Joseph Cochran established a medical college in Urmia in 1878. Cochran is often credited for founding Iran's \"first contemporary medical college\". The website of Urmia University credits Cochran for \"lowering the infant mortality rate in the region\" and for founding one of Iran's first modern hospitals (Westminster Hospital) in Urmia.\n\nIn 1000 AD, Biruni wrote an astronomical encyclopaedia that discussed the possibility that the earth might rotate around the sun. This was before Tycho Brahe drew the first maps of the sky, using stylized animals to depict the constellations.\n\nIn the tenth century, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi cast his eyes upwards to the awning of stars overhead and was the first to record a galaxy outside our own. Gazing at the Andromeda galaxy he called it a \"little cloud\" an apt description of the slightly wispy appearance of our galactic neighbour.\n\nTusi believed that a body of matter is able to change but is not able to disappear entirely. He wrote \"a body of matter cannot disappear completely. It only changes its form, condition, composition, color, and other properties, and turns into a different complex or elementary matter\". Five hundred years later, Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) and Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743–1794) created the law of conservation of mass, setting down this same idea. However, it should be noted that Tusi argued for evolution within a firmly Islamic context—he did not, like Darwin, draw materialist conclusions from his theories. Moreover, unlike Darwin, he was arguing hypothetically: he did not attempt to provide empirical data for his theories. Nonetheless his arguments, which in some ways prefigure natural selection, are still considered remarkably 'advanced' for their time.\n\nJaber Ibn Hayyan, the famous Iranian chemist who died in 804 at Tous in Khorasan, was the father of a number of discoveries recorded in an encyclopaedia and of many treatises covering two thousand topics, and these became the bible of European chemists of the 18th century, particularly of Lavoisier. These works had a variety of uses including tinctures and their applications in tanning and textiles; distillations of plants and flowers; the origin of perfumes; therapeutic pharmacy, and gunpowder, a powerful military instrument possessed by Islam long before the West. Jabir ibn Hayyan, is widely regarded as the founder of chemistry, inventing many of the basic processes and equipment still used by chemists today such as distillation.\n\nBiruni was the first scientist to formally propose that the speed of light is finite, before Galileo tried to experimentally prove this.\n\nKamal al-Din Al-Farisi (1267–1318) born in Tabriz, Iran, is known for giving the first mathematically satisfactory explanation of the rainbow, and an explication of the nature of colours that reformed the theory of Ibn al-Haytham. Al-Farisi also \"proposed a model where the ray of light from the sun was refracted twice by a water droplet, one or more reflections occurring between the two refractions.\" He verified this through extensive experimentation using a transparent sphere filled with water and a camera obscura.\n\nThe Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology and the National Research Institute for Science Policy come under the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. They are in charge of establishing national research policies.\n\nThe government first set its sights on moving from a resource-based economy to one based on knowledge in its 20-year development plan, \"Vision 2025\", adopted in 2005. This transition became a priority after international sanctions were progressively hardened from 2006 onwards and the oil embargo tightened its grip. In February 2014, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced what he called the ‘economy of resistance’, an economic plan advocating innovation and a lesser dependence on imports that reasserted key provisions of \"Vision 2025\".\n\n\"Vision 2025\" challenged policy-makers to look beyond extractive industries to the country’s human capital for wealth creation. This led to the adoption of incentive measures to raise the number of university students and academics, on the one hand, and to stimulate problem-solving and industrial research, on the other.\n\nIran's successive five-year plans aim to realize collectively the goals of \"Vision 2025\". For instance, in order to ensure that 50% of academic research was oriented towards socio-economic needs and problem-solving, the \"Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan\" (2010–2015) tied promotion to the orientation of research projects. It also made provision for research and technology centres to be set up on campus and for universities to develop linkages with industry. The \"Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan\" had two main thrusts relative to science policy. The first was the \"islamization of universities', a notion that is open to broad interpretation. According to Article 15 of the \"Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan\", university programmes in the humanities were to teach the virtues of critical thinking, theorization and multidisciplinary studies. A number of research centres were also to be developed in the humanities. The plan's second thrust was to make Iran the second-biggest player in science and technology by 2015, behind Turkey. To this end, the government pledged to raise domestic research spending to 3% of GDP by 2015. Yet, R&D’s share in the GNP is at 0.06% in 2015 (where it should be at least 2.5% of GDP) and industry-driven R&D is almost non‑existent.\n\n\"Vision 2025\" fixed a number of targets, including that of raising domestic expenditure on research and development to 4% of GDP by 2025. In 2012, spending stood at 0.33% of GDP.\n\nIn 2009, the government adopted a \"National Master Plan for Science and Education\" to 2025 which reiterates the goals of Vision 2025. It lays particular stress on developing university research and fostering university–industry ties to promote the commercialization of research results.\n\nIn line with the goals of \"Vision 2025\", policy-makers have made a concerted effort to increase the number of students and academic researchers. To this end, the government raised its commitment to higher education to 1% of GDP in 2006. After peaking at this level, higher education spending stood at 0.86% of GDP in 2015. Higher education spending has resisted better than public expenditure on education overall. The latter peaked at 4.7% of GDP in 2007 before slipping to 2.9% of GDP in 2015. \"Vision 2025\" fixed a target of raising public expenditure on education to 7% of GDP by 2025.\n\nThe result of greater spending on higher education has been a steep rise in tertiary enrollment. Between 2007 and 2013, student rolls swelled from 2.8 million to 4.4 million in the country’s public and private universities. Some 45% of students were enrolled in private universities in 2011. There were more women studying than men in 2007, a proportion that has since dropped back slightly to 48%.\n\nEnrollment has progressed in most fields. The most popular in 2013 were social sciences (1.9 million students, of which 1.1 million women) and engineering (1.5 million, of which 373 415 women). Women also made up two-thirds of medical students. One in eight bachelor’s students go on to enroll in a master’s/PhD programme. This is comparable to the ratio in the Republic of Korea and Thailand (one in seven) and Japan (one in ten).\n\nThe number of PhD graduates has progressed at a similar pace as university enrollment overall. Natural sciences and engineering have proved increasingly popular among both sexes, even if engineering remains a male-dominated field. In 2012, women made up one-third of PhD graduates, being drawn primarily to health (40% of PhD students), natural sciences (39%), agriculture (33%) and humanities and arts (31%). According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 38% of master’s and PhD students were studying science and engineering fields in 2011.\n\nThere has been an interesting evolution in the gender balance among PhD students. Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38–39% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% but there was also a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16% of PhD students). Although data are not readily available on the number of PhD graduates choosing to stay on as faculty, the relatively modest level of domestic research spending would suggest that academic research suffers from inadequate funding.\n\nThe \"Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan\" (2010–2015) fixed the target of attracting 25 000 foreign students to Iran by 2015. By 2013, there were about 14 000 foreign students attending Iranian universities, most of whom came from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey. In a speech delivered at the University of Tehran in October 2014, President Rouhani recommended greater interaction with the outside world. He said that ‘scientific evolution will be achieved by criticism […] and the expression of different ideas. […] Scientific progress is achieved, if we are related to the world. […] We have to have a relationship with the world, not only in foreign policy but also with regard to the economy, science and technology. […] I think it is necessary to invite foreign professors to come to Iran and our professors to go abroad and even to create an English university to be able to attract foreign students.’\n\nOne in four Iranian PhD students were studying abroad in 2012 (25.7%). The top destinations were Malaysia, the USA, Canada, Australia, UK, France, Sweden and Italy. In 2012, one in seven international students in Malaysia was of Iranian origin. There is a lot of scope for the development of twinning between universities for teaching and research, as well as for student exchanges.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the number of (full-time equivalent) researchers rose from 711 to 736 per million inhabitants between 2009 and 2010. This corresponds to an increase of more than 2 000 researchers, from 52 256 to 54 813. The world average is 1 083 per million inhabitants. One in four (26%) Iranian researchers is a woman, which is close to the world average (28%). In 2008, half of researchers were employed in academia (51.5%), one-third in the government sector (33.6%) and just under one in seven in the business sector (15.0%). Within the business sector, 22% of researchers were women in 2013, the same proportion as in Ireland, Israel, Italy and Norway. The number of firms declaring research activities more than doubled between 2006 and 2011, from 30 935 to 64 642. The increasingly tough sanctions regime oriented the Iranian economy towards the domestic market and, by erecting barriers to foreign imports, encouraged knowledge-based enterprises to localize production.\n\nIran's national science budget was about $900 million in 2005 and it had not been subject to any significant increase for the previous 15 years. In 2001, Iran devoted 0.50% of GDP to research and development. Expenditure peaked at 0.67% of GDP in 2008 before receding to 0.33% of GDP in 2012, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The world average in 2013 was 1.7% of GDP. Iran's government has devoted much of its budget to research on high technologies such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, stem cell research and information technology (2008). In 2006, the Iranian government wiped out the financial debts of all universities in a bid to relieve their budget constraints. According to the UNESCO science report 2010, most research in Iran is government-funded with the Iranian government providing almost 75% of all research funding. Domestic expenditure on research stood at 0.7% of GDP in 2008 and 0.3% of GDP in 2012. Iranian businesses contributed about 11% of the total in 2008. The government’s limited budget is being directed towards supporting small innovative businesses, business incubators and science and technology parks, the type of enterprises which employ university graduates.\n\nThe share of private businesses in total national R&D funding according to the same report is very low, being just 14%, as compared with Turkey's 48%. The rest of approximately 11% of funding comes from higher education sector and non-profit organizations. A limited number of large enterprises (such as IDRO, NIOC, NIPC, DIO, Iran Aviation Industries Organization, Iranian Space Agency, Iran Electronics Industries or Iran Khodro) have their own in-house R&D capabilities.\n\n\"Vision 2025\" foresaw an investment of US$3.7 trillion by 2025 to finance the transition to a knowledge economy. It was intended for one-third of this amount to come from abroad but, so far, FDI has remained elusive. It has contributed less than 1% of GDP since 2006 and just 0.5% of GDP in 2014. Within the country’s \"Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan\" (2010–2015), a National Development Fund has been established to finance efforts to diversify the economy. By 2013, the fund was receiving 26% of oil and gas revenue.\n\nMuch of the US$3.7 trillion earmarked in \"Vision 2025\" is to go towards supporting investment in research and development by knowledge-based firms and the commercialization of research results. A law passed in 2010 provides an appropriate mechanism, the Innovation and Prosperity Fund. According to the fund’s president, Behzad Soltani, 4600 billion Iranian rials (circa US$171.4 million) had been allocated to 100 knowledge-based companies by late 2014. Public and private universities wishing to set up private firms may also apply to the fund.\n\nSome 37 industries trade shares on the Tehran Stock Exchange. These industries include the petrochemical, automotive, mining, steel, iron, copper, agriculture and telecommunications industries, ‘a unique situation in the Middle East’. Most of the companies developing high technologies remain state-owned, including in the automotive and pharmaceutical industries, despite plans to privatize 80% of state-owned companies by 2014. It was estimated in 2014 that the private sector accounted for about 30% of the Iranian pharmaceutical market.The Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO) controls about 290 state-owned companies. IDRO has set up special purpose companies in each high-tech sector to coordinate investment and business development. These entities are the Life Science Development Company, Information Technology Development Centre, Iran InfoTech Development Company and the Emad Semiconductor Company. In 2010, IDRO set up a capital fund to finance the intermediary stages of product- and technology-based business development within these companies.\n\nAs of 2012, Iran had officially 31 science and technology parks nationwide. Furthermore, as of 2014, 36 science and technology parks hosting more than 3,650 companies were operating in Iran. These firms have directly employed more than 24,000 people. According to the \"Iran Entrepreneurship Association\", there are totally 99 parks of science and technology, which operate without official permits. Twenty-one of those parks are located in Tehran and affiliated with University Jihad, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran University, Ministry of Energy (Iran), Ministry of Health and Medical Education, and Amir Kabir University among others. Fars Province, with 8 parks and Razavi Khorasan Province, with 7 parks, are ranked second and third after Tehran respectively. Iran has nearly 3,000 knowledge-based companies in 2016.\n\nAs of 2004, Iran's national innovation system (NIS) had not experienced a serious entrance to the technology creation phase and mainly exploited the technologies developed by other countries (e.g. in the petrochemicals industry).\n\nIn 2016, Iran ranked second in the percentage of graduates in science and engineering in the Global Innovation Index. Iran also ranked fourth in tertiary education, 26 in knowledge creation, 31 in gross percentage of tertiary enrollment, 41 in general infrastructure, 48 in human capital as well as research and 51 in innovation efficiency ratio.\n\nIn recent years several drugmakers in Iran are gradually developing the ability to innovate, away from generic drugs production itself.\n\nAccording to the \"State Registration Organization of Deeds and Properties\", a total of 9,570 national inventions was registered in Iran during 2008. Compared with the previous year, there was a 38-percent increase in the number of inventions registered by the organization.\n\nIran has several funds to support entrepreneurship and innovation:\n\n\nThe 5th Development Plan (2010–15) requires the private sector to communicate research needs to universities so that universities would coordinate research projects in line with these needs, with sharing of expenses by both sides.\n\nBecause of its weakness or absence, the support industry makes little contribution to the innovation/technology development activities. Supporting the development of small and medium enterprises in Iran will strengthen greatly the supplier network.\n\nAs of 2014, Iran had 930 industrial parks and zones, of which 731 are ready to be ceded to the private sector. The government of Iran has plans for the establishment of 50–60 new industrial parks by the end of the fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan (2015).\n\nA 2003-report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) identified the following impediments to industrial development:\n\n\nThe economic complexity ranking of Iran has increased by 1 places over the past 50 years from 66th in 1964 to 65th in 2014. According to UNCTAD in 2016, private companies in Iran need better marketing strategies with emphasis on innovation.\n\nDespite these problems, Iran has progressed in various scientific and technological fields, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aerospace, defense, and heavy industry. Even in the face of economic sanctions, Iran is emerging as an industrialized country.\n\nParallel to academic research, several companies have been founded in Iran during last few decades. For example, CinnaGen, established in 1992, is one of the pioneering biotechnology companies in the region. CinnaGen won \"Biotechnology Asia 2005 Innovation Awards\" due to its achievements and innovation in biotechnology research. In 2006, Parsé Semiconductor Co. announced it had designed and produced a 32-bit computer microprocessor inside the country for the first time. Software companies are growing rapidly. In CeBIT 2006, ten Iranian software companies introduced their products. Iran's National Foundation for Computer Games unveiled the country's first online video game in 2010, capable of supporting up to 5,000 users at the same time.\n\nTheoretical and computational sciences are highly developed in Iran. Despite the limitations in funds, facilities, and international collaborations, Iranian scientists have been very productive in several experimental fields such as pharmacology, pharmaceutical chemistry, and organic and polymer chemistry. Iranian biophysicists, especially molecular biophysicists, have gained international reputations since the 1990s. High field nuclear magnetic resonance facility, microcalorimetry, circular dichroism, and instruments for single protein channel studies have been provided in Iran during the past two decades. Tissue engineering and research on biomaterials have just started to emerge in biophysics departments.\n\nConsidering the country's brain drain and its poor political relationship with the United States and some other Western countries, Iran's scientific community remains productive, even while economic sanctions make it difficult for universities to buy equipment or to send people to the United States to attend scientific meetings. Furthermore, Iran considers scientific backwardness, as one of the root causes of political and military bullying by developed countries over developing states. After the Iranian Revolution, there have been efforts by the religious scholars to assimilate Islam with modern science and this is seen by some as the reason behind the recent successes of Iran to augment its scientific output. Currently Iran aims for a national goal of self-sustainment in all scientific arenas. Many individual Iranian scientists, along with the Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences and Academy of Sciences of Iran, are involved in this revival. The \"Comprehensive Scientific Plan\" has been devised based on about 51,000 pages of documents and includes 224 scientific projects that must be implemented by the year 2025.\n\nWith over 400 medical research facilities and 76 medical magazine indexes available in the country, Iran is the 19th country in medical research and is set to become the 10th within 10 years (2012). Clinical sciences are invested in highly in Iran. In areas such as rheumatology, hematology, and bone marrow trasplantation, Iranian medical scientists publish regularly. The Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center (HORC) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Shariati Hospital was established in 1991. Internationally, this center is one of the largest bone marrow transplantation centers and has carried out a large number of successful transplantations. According to a study conducted in 2005, associated specialized pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) services exist in almost all major cities throughout the country, where 43 board-certified or eligible pediatric hematologist–oncologists are giving care to children suffering from cancer or hematological disorders. Three children's medical centers at universities have approved PHO fellowship programs. Besides hematology, gastroenterology has recently attracted many talented medical students. The gasteroenterology research center based at Tehran University of Medical Sciences has produced increasing numbers of scientific publications since its establishment.\n\nModern organ transplantation in Iran dates to 1935, when the first cornea transplant in Iran was performed by Professor Mohammad-Qoli Shams at Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The Shiraz Nemazi transplant center, also one of the pioneering transplant units of Iran, performed the first Iranian kidney transplant in 1967 and the first Iranian liver transplant in 1995. The first heart transplant in Iran was performed in 1993 in Tabriz. The first lung transplant was performed in 2001, and the first heart and lung transplants were performed in 2002, both at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Iran developed the first artificial lung in 2009 to join five other countries in the world that possess such technology. Currently, renal, liver, and heart transplantations are routinely performed in Iran. Iran ranks fifth in the world in kidney transplants. The Iranian Tissue Bank, commencing in 1994, was the first multi-facility tissue bank in country. In June 2000, the Organ Transplantation Brain Death Act was approved by the Parliament, followed by the establishment of the Iranian Network for Transplantation Organ Procurement. This act helped to expand heart, lung, and liver transplantation programs. By 2003, Iran had performed 131 liver, 77 heart, 7 lung, 211 bone marrow, 20,581 cornea, and 16,859 renal transplantations. 82 percent of these were donated by living and unrelated donors; 10 percent by cadavers; and 8 percent came from living-related donors. The 3-year renal transplant patient survival rate was 92.9%, and the 40-month graft survival rate was 85.9%.\n\nNeuroscience is also emerging in Iran. A few PhD programs in cognitive and computational neuroscience have been established in the country during recent decades. Iran ranks first in Mideast and region in ophthalmology.\n\nIranian surgeons treating wounded Iranian veterans during Iran–Iraq War invented a new neurosurgical treatment for brain injured patients that laid to rest the previously prevalent technique developed by US Army surgeon Dr Ralph Munslow. This new surgical procedure helped devise new guidelines that have decreased death rates for comatosed patients with penetrating brain injuries from 55% of 1980 to 20% of 2010. It has been said that these new treatment guidelines benefited US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords who had been shot in the head.\n\nIran has a biotechnology sector that is one of the most advanced in the developing world. The Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines and the Pasteur Institute of Iran are leading regional facilities in the development and manufacture of vaccines. In January 1997, the Iranian Biotechnology Society (IBS) was created to oversee biotechnology research in Iran.\n\nAgricultural research has been successful in releasing high-yielding varieties with higher stability as well as tolerance to harsh weather conditions. The agriculture researchers are working jointly with international Institutes to find the best procedures and genotypes to overcome produce failure and to increase yield. In 2005, Iran's first genetically modified (GM) rice was approved by national authorities and is being grown commercially for human consumption. In addition to GM rice, Iran has produced several GM plants in the laboratory, such as insect-resistant maize; cotton; potatoes and sugar beets; herbicide-resistant canola; salinity- and drought-tolerant wheat; and blight-resistant maize and wheat. The Royan Institute engineered Iran's first cloned animal; the sheep was born on 2 August 2006 and passed the critical first two months of his life.\n\nIn the last months of 2006, Iranian biotechnologists announced that they, as the third manufacturer in the world, have sent CinnoVex (a recombinant type of Interferon b1a) to the market.\nAccording to a study by David Morrison and Ali Khademhosseini (Harvard-MIT and Cambridge), stem cell research in Iran is amongst the top 10 in the world. Iran will invest 2.5 billion dollars in the country's stem cell research over the next five years (2008–2013). Iran ranks 2nd in world in transplantation of stem cells.\n\nIn 2010, Iran begun mass-producing ocular bio-implants named SAMT. Iran began investing in biotechnological projects in 1992, and this is the tenth facility in Iran. 'Lifepatch' is the fourth bio-implant mass-produced by Iran after bone, heart valve, and tendon bio-implants. 12 countries in the world produce bio-tech drugs, among which Iran is one of them. According to Scopus, Iran ranked 21st in biotechnology by producing nearly 4,000 related-scientific articles in 2014.\nIn 2010, AryoGen Biopharma established the biggest and most modern knowledge-based facility for production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in the region. As at 2012, Iran produced 15 types of monoclonal/anti-body drugs. These anti-cancer drugs are now produced by only two to three western companies.\n\nIn 2015, Noargen company established as first officially registered CRO & CMO in Iran. Noargen uses the concept of CMO and CRO servicing to the biopharma sector of Iran as its main activity to fill the gap and promote developing biotech ideas/products toward commercialization.\n\nIran had some significant successes in nuclear technology during recent decades, especially in nuclear medicine. However, little connection exists between Iran's scientific society and that of the nuclear program of Iran. Iran is the 7th country in production of uranium hexafluoride (or UF). Iran now controls the entire cycle for producing nuclear fuel. Iran is among the 14 countries in possession of nuclear [energy] technology. In 2009, Iran was developing its first domestic Linear particle accelerator (LINAC).\nIt is among the few countries in the world that has the technology to produce zirconium alloys. Iran produces a wide range of lasers in demand within the country in medical and industrial fields.\nIn 2011, Iranian scientists at the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) have designed and built a nuclear fusion device, named IR-IECF. Iran is the 6th country with such technology.\n\nThe Center of Excellence in Design, Robotics, and Automation was established in 2001 to promote educational and research activities in the fields of design, robotics, and automation. Besides these professional groups, several robotics groups work in Iranian high schools. \"Sorena 2\" Robot, which was designed by engineers at University of Tehran, was unveiled in 2010. The robot can be used for handling sensitive tasks without the need for cooperating with human beings. The robot is taking slow steps similar to human beings, harmonious movements of hands and feet and other movements similar to humans. Next the researchers plan to develop speech and vision capabilities and greater intelligence for this robot. the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has placed the name of Surena among the five prominent robots of the world after analyzing its performance. In 2010, Iranian researchers have, for the first time in the country, developed ten robots for the nation's automotive industry using domestic know how.\n\n\"Ultra Fast Microprocessors Research Center\" in Tehran's Amirkabir University of Technology successfully built a supercomputer in 2007. Maximum processing capacity of the supercomputer is 860 billion operations per second. Iran's first supercomputer launched in 2001 was also fabricated by Amirkabir University of Technology. In 2009, a SUSE Linux-based HPC system made by the Aerospace Research Institute of Iran (ARI) was launched with 32 cores and now runs 96 cores. Its performance was pegged at 192 GFLOPS. Iran's National Super Computer made by Iran Info-Tech Development Company (a subsidiary of IDRO) was built from 216 AMD processors. The Linux-cluster machine has a reported \"theoretical peak performance of 860 gig-flops\". The Routerlab team at the University of Tehran successfully designed and implemented an access-router (RAHYAB-300) and a 40Gbit/s high capacity switch fabric (UTS). In 2011 Amirkabir University of Technology and Isfahan University of Technology produced 2 new supercomputers with processing capacity of 34,000 billion operations per second. The supercomputer at Amirkabir University of Technology is expected to be among the 500 most powerful computers in the world.\n\nResearch in nanotechnology has taken off in Iran since the Nanotechnology Initiative Council (NIC) was founded in 2002. The council determines the general policies for the development of nanotechnology and co-ordinates their implementation. It provides facilities, creates markets and helps the private sector to develop relevant R&D activities. In the past decade, 143 nanotech companies have been established in eight industries. More than one-quarter of these are found in the health care industry, compared to just 3% in the automotive industry.\n\nToday, five research centres specialize in nanotechnology, including the Nanotechnology Research Centre at Sharif University, which established Iran’s first doctoral programme in nanoscience and nanotechnology a decade ago. Iran also hosts the International Centre on Nanotechnology for Water Purification, established in collaboration with UNIDO in 2012. In 2008, NIC established an Econano network to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\nIran recorded strong growth in the number of articles on nanotechnology between 2009 and 2013, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science. By 2013, Iran ranked seventh for this indicator. The number of articles per million population has tripled to 59, overtaking Japan in the process. Few patents are being granted to Iranian inventors in nanotechnology, as yet, however. The ratio of nanotechnology patents to articles was 0.41 per 100 articles for Iran in 2015.\n\nOn 17 August 2008, The Iranian Space Agency proceeded with the second test launch of a three stages Safir SLV from a site south of Semnan in the northern part of the Dasht-e-Kavir desert. The \"Safir\" (Ambassador) satellite carrier successfully launched the Omid satellite into orbit in February 2009. Iran is the 9th country to put a domestically-built satellite into orbit since the Soviet Union launched the first in 1957. Iran is among a handful of countries in the world capable of developing satellite-related technologies, including satellite navigation systems. Iran's first astronaut will be sent into space on board an Iranian shuttle by 2019. Iran is also the sixth country to send animals in space. Iran is one of the few countries capable of producing 20-25 ton sea patrol aircraft. In 2013, Iran constructed its first hypersonic wind tunnel for testing missiles and doing aerospace research. Iran is the 8th country capable of manufacturing jet engines.\n\nThe Iranian government has committed 150 billion rials (roughly 16 million US dollars) for a telescope, an observatory, and a training program, all part of a plan to build up the country's astronomy base. Iran wants to collaborate internationally and become internationally competitive in astronomy, says the University of Michigan's Carl Akerlof, an adviser to the Iranian project. \"For a government that is usually characterized as wary of foreigners, that's an important development\". In July 2010, Iran unveiled its largest domestically-manufactured telescope dubbed \"Tara\". in 2016, Iran unveiled its new optical telescope for observing celestial objects as part of APSCO. It will be used to understand and predict the physical location of natural and man-made objects in orbit around the Earth.\n\nIran has achieved the technical expertise to set up hydroelectric, gas and combined cycle power plants. Iran is among the four world countries that are capable of manufacturing advanced V94.2 gas turbines. Iran is able to produce all the parts needed for its gas refineries and is now the third country in the world to have developed Gas to liquids (GTL) technology. Iran produces 70% of its industrial equipment domestically including various turbines, pumps, catalysts, refineries, oil tankers, oil rigs, offshore platforms and exploration instruments. Iran is among the few countries that has reached the technology and \"know-how\" for drilling in the deep waters. Iran's indigenously designed Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled to come online in 2016.\n\nIran possesses the technology to launch superfast anti-submarine rockets that can travel at the speed of 100 meters per second under water, making the country second only to Russia in possessing the technology. Iran is among the five countries in the world to have developed ammunitions with laser targeting technology. Iran is among the few countries that possess the technological know-how of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) fitted with scanning and reconnaissance systems. Iran is among the 12 countries with missile technology and advanced mobile air defense systems. Over the past years, Iran has made important breakthroughs in its defense sector and attained self-sufficiency in producing important military equipment and systems. Since 1992, it also has produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, sophisticated radars, guided missiles, a submarine, and fighter planes.\n\nIran annually hosts international science festivals. The \"International Kharazmi Festival in Basic Science\" and The \"Annual Razi Medical Sciences Research Festival\" promote original research in science, technology, and medicine in Iran. There is also an ongoing R&D collaboration between large state-owned companies and the universities in Iran.\n\nIranians welcome scientists from all over the world to Iran for a visit and participation in seminars or collaborations. Many Nobel laureates and influential scientists such as Bruce Alberts, F. Sherwood Rowland, Kurt Wüthrich, Stephen Hawking, and Pierre-Gilles de Gennes visited Iran after the Iranian revolution. Some universities also hosted American and European scientists as guest lecturers during recent decades.\n\nAlthough sanctions have caused a shift in Iran’s trading partners from West to East, scientific collaboration has remained largely oriented towards the West. Between 2008 and 2014, Iran’s top partners for scientific collaboration were the USA, Canada, the UK and Germany, in that order. Iranian scientists co-authored almost twice as many articles with their counterparts in the USA (6 377) as with their next-closest collaborators in Canada (3 433) and the UK (3 318). Iranian and U.S. scientists have collaborated on a number of projects.\n\nMalaysia is Iran’s fifth-closest collaborator in science and India ranks tenth, after Australia, France, Italy and Japan. One-quarter of Iranian articles had a foreign co-author in 2014, a stable proportion since 2002. Scientists have been encouraged to publish in international journals in recent years, a policy that is in line with \"Vision 2025\".\n\nThe volume of scientific articles authored by Iranians in international journals has augmented considerably since 2005, according to Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Iranian scientists now publish widely in international journals in engineering and chemistry, as well as in life sciences and physics. Women contribute about 13% of articles, with a focus on chemistry, medical sciences and social sciences. Contributing to this trend is the fact that PhD programmes in Iran now require students to have publications in the Web of Science.\n\nIran has submitted a formal request to participate in a project which is building an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France by 2018. This megaproject is developing nuclear fusion technology to lay the groundwork for tomorrow’s nuclear fusion power plants. The project involves the European Union, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation and USA. A team from ITER visited Iran in November 2016 to deepen its understanding of Iran’s fusion-related programmes.\n\nIran hosts several international research centres, including the following established between 2010 and 2014 under the auspices of the United Nations: the Regional Center for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development (UNESCO, est. 2010), the International Center on Nanotechnology (UNIDO, est. 2012) and the Regional Educational and Research Center for Oceanography for Western Asia (UNESCO, est. 2014).\n\nIran is stepping up its scientific collaboration with developing countries. In 2008, Iran’s Nanotechnology Initiative Council established an Econano network to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The Regional Centre for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development is also initially targeting these same countries. It is offering them policy advice on how to develop their own science parks and technology incubators.\n\nIran is an active member of COMSTECH and collaborates on its international projects. The coordinator general of COMSTECH, Dr. Atta ur Rahman has said that Iran is the leader in science and technology among Muslim countries and hoped for greater cooperation with Iran in different international technological and industrialization projects. Iranian scientists are also helping to construct the Compact Muon Solenoid, a detector for the Large Hadron Collider of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) that is due to come online in 2008. Iranian engineers are involved in the design and construction of the first regional particle accelerator of the Middle East in Jordan, called SESAME.\n\nSince the lifting of international sanctions, Iran has been developing scientific and educational links with Kuwait, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, China and Russia.\n\nScientists with an Iranian background have made significant contributions to the international scientific community. In 1960, Ali Javan invented first gas laser. In 1973, the fuzzy set theory was developed by Lotfi Zadeh. Iranian cardiologist Tofy Mussivand invented the first artificial heart and afterwards developed it further. HbA1c was discovered by Samuel Rahbar and introduced to the medical community. The Vafa-Witten theorem was proposed by Cumrun Vafa, an Iranian string theorist, and his co-worker Edward Witten. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation has been named after Mehran Kardar, notable Iranian physicist. Other notable discoveries and innovations by Iranian scientists and engineers (or of Iranian origin) include:\n\n\n\nAccording to the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Iranian researchers and scientists have published a total of 60,979 scientific studies in major international journals in the last 19 years (1990–2008). Iran science production growth (as measured by the number of publications in science journals) is reportedly the \"fastest in the world\", followed by Russia and China respectively (2017/18).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Theater and Film University has dedicated solely to the visual and performing arts. The chief founder of the University was a well-known Georgian theater actor and director, Lado Meskhishvili\n\nThe first attempt to create a drama school in Georgia related to School Dramas in the Seminaries of Telavi (1782) and Tbilisi (1855), where by law it was possible to play “a comedy or any other conspicuous play once a week.” In 1880, the Statute of the Dramatic Society provided for it to “hold theater classes and temporary courses to prepare and train artists.\"\n\nIn 1912, Lado Meskhishivili attempted to establish drama courses and set up regulations.\n\nIn 1918, Giorgi Jabadari founded a studio and brought to it internationally acclaimed actors such as V. Anjaparidze, U. Chkheidze, A. Vasadze and Sh. Ghambashidze.\n\nIn 1922, a Drama Studio established under the leadership of A. Pagava, which according to the Resolution of the Council of People's Commissars dated October 10, 1922 (Protocol N 31), became the basis of the \"Institute of Performing Arts.\" Studio participants enrolled to the second year. An additional enlistment for courses also announced.\n\nThe first rector of the Institute was Akaki Paghava, the Artistic Director was Kote Marjanishvili, and the teachers were prominent scientists: I. Javakhishvili, D. Uznadze, G. Chubinashvili, A. Shanidze, G. Akhvlediani, A. Natishvili. The theater Directors were A. Akhmeteli, M. Koreli, and the writers K. Gamsakhurdia, G. Robakidze, N. Shiukashvili. In 1924, the first 21 graduated from the Institute. Among the graduates were: A. Khorava, V. Godziashvili, S. Takaishvili, T. Tsulukidze, M. Mrevlishvili, P. Kobakhidze, P. Kandelaki, P. Murghulia, G.Kuprashvili, N. Shengelaia, S.Chelidze, and others.\n\nIn 1927, the Institute ceased to function. New studios formed at the studio of the Rustaveli Theater in 1927-1935, which together with Sandro Akhmeteli was led by Akaki Vasadze, and later in 1935-1939 by Akaki Khorava.\n\nThe Training Program of the Studio and the level of graduate specialists is equivalent to other modern colleges. The Studio has trained actors for the theaters of Batumi, Abkhazia, Ossetia, Checheno-Ingushetia.\n\nThe Rustaveli Theater Studio taught 152 actors between 1927, and 1939.\n\nA Studio was also established also in the Marjanishvili theater, where D. Janelidze had worked.\n\nIn 1933, A. Paghava built “Higher Courses of Performing Arts.\" Film Actor’s Courses founded at the 'State Film Industry.'\n\nOn September 1, 1939, by resolution of the Government in the Akaki Khorava and Akaki Pagava initiative, the Theater Institute was reestablished by the Rustaveli Theater and other Studios. The rector was A. Khorava and the deputy minister A. Paghava.\n\nAfter A. Khorava the rectors were: D. Aleksidze, M. Kveselava, L. Kiknadze, I. Tavadze, E. Gugushvili, G. Zhordania, G. Lortkipanidze, G. Margvelashvili, N. Chkhaidze, G. Margvelashvili.\n\nIn 1992, the Theater Institute was renamed as the State Theater and Film Institute.\n\nIn 2002, the Institute was transformed into a university.\n\nGraduates of the Shota Rustaveli Theater and the State Film University graduates have had a defining effect on the cultural development and the character of twentieth-century Georgian theater.\n\nIn 2005 the Shota Rustaveli Theater and Georgian State Film University was joined by the Ekvtime Takaishvili State University of Culture and Arts.\n\nThe University trains actors of drama and film, musical theater, puppetry, marionettes, and pantomime, directors of drama, film, and television, cinematographers, theater and film critics, art historians, specialists of television and other media, choreographers, managers of tourism and experts in the cultural-educational sector.\n\nStudents have gained international success and the highest awards in various film and theater festivals and competitions.\n\nThe University has the D. Aleksidze theater, a scientific library, laboratories, and an educational, scientific institute, which prepares encyclopedias of Georgian theater and cinema.\n\nThe University has faculties of Drama, Film, and Television, Humanities, Social Sciences and Management and Georgian Folk Music and Dance, where over a thousand students study for Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees.\n\nThe University played a huge role in training specialists of theater and cinema for the entire Caucasus Region. The University brought together professionals for Russian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Abkhazian, Ossetian, Ingush, Chechen and other theaters. Some now famous theaters founded by the training and diploma performances of the University (such as the Cinema Actors Theater, Meskhetian Theater, Theater Metekhi, Akhmeteli Theater, Theater of Saingilo, Pantomime Theater, and others).\n\nThe University maintains creative and scientific relations with other universities in different countries.\n\nThe University traditionally trains specialists who make a significant contribution to the development of Georgian Regional Theaters.\n\nThe University publishes a newspaper \"Duruji.\" In 2005-2009, its publishing house issued a paper “Culture,\" which was a joint publication of three art universities. The “Centaur” publishing house produces textbooks, manuals, scientific works and monographs written by professors of the University and also a journal, \"Art Science Studies.\"\n\nThe University locates in two buildings: the first building at Rustaveli Ave. N 19-23, the second building at David Agmashenebeli Ave. N40.\n\nThe Education programs in Shota Rustaveli Theater and Georgia State Film University implement through two certified programs and three Bachelor programs.\n\nThe history of the Faculty closely links with the history of the University, which established in 1923 as Institute of Performing Arts by the studio founded in 1922 by Akaki Paghava. The studio members enrolled in the Institute's second year.\n\nAmong the first graduates of the institute in 1924 were A. Khorava, V. Godziashvili, T. Tsulukidze, S. Takaishvili and M. Mrevlishvili. The professors were Akaki Paghava, Kote Marjanishvili, Mikheil Koreli, Sandro Akhmeteli and Niko Shiukashvili.\n\nKote Marjanishvili was the artistic director of the Institute. Instead of faculties, there were studios of drama and opera, and also schools of opera choir, plasticity, and rhythmic gymnastics. Lectures got delivered by I. Javakhishvili, D. Uznadze, G. Chubinashvili, A. Shanidze and others.\n\nIn 1926, the institute ceased to function. In 1927-39 only the Rustaveli Theater Studio was working.\n\nIn September 1939, the studios of Rustaveli and Marjanishvili Theaters merged with the studio of Film Fabric and the theater Institute has been restored. The members of these studios were accepted in the second, third and fourth courses of the studio.\n\nIn 1940, the Faculty of Drama Direction established in the Theater Institute.\n\nOver the years, the department of actor's mastery and drama course was led by Akaki Khorava.\n\nIn 1956, the Institute expanded again, Music Department added to the Drama Faculty. In 1970, the Puppet Theater Actors specialization joined the Drama Faculty. Its founders were Shota Tsutsqiridze and Givi Sarchimelidze.\n\nSince 1969, the Pantomime Theater Actor’s specialty became he part of the Drama Faculty, in 1978, the Pantomime Theater Actor specialization founded under the guidance of Amiran Shalikashvili\n\nOver the years, the department of actor's skills and stage direction was headed by D.

Gatserelia; the Department of Stage Speech was led by Maliko Mrevlishvili and Babulia Nikolaishvili; Heads of the Department of Stage Movement were Constantine (Kotso) Badridze and Yuri Zaretski.\n\nAt the Drama Faculty, worked: A. Vasadze, G. Tovstonogov, D. Aleksidze, A. Mikeladze, K. Pataridze, V. Kushitashvili, M. Tumanishvili, A. Dvalishvili, and others.\n\nThe older generation of directors formed the core methodological principles of education, which in its essence bases on K. Stanislavski system as a foundation for training actors.\n\nM. Tumanishvili, who was a student of G. Tovstonogov, developed training methodology, conducted bold experiments that subsequently would make it easier for graduates which would help to adjust and adapt to the new theater groups. Thus was created the renowned Film Actors Theater.\n\nIn subsequent years on the faculty worked: Shalva Gatserelia, Gaioz Jirdania, Medea Kuchukhidze, Akvsenti Gamsakhurdia, Anzor Kutateladze, Levan Mirtskhulava, Nana Demetrashvili, Konstantine Surmava, Temur Abashidze; head of stage speech department Leila Kapanadze, head of stage movement department Natela Ionatamishvili, masters of artistic reading Zinaida Kverenchkhiladze and Guram Sagaradze and others.\n\nFilm and TV Faculty of Shota Rustaveli Theater and Film State University established in 1972.

In the case at the center of the controversy, Rachel Marsden, then a student, and Liam Donnelly, a swimming coach, accused each other of sexual harassment. \n\nFollowing an internal hearing that the coach declined to participate in, he was dismissed, but reinstated after the case went public. The case was widely reported in the Canadian press because of the topic of sexual harassment, and controversy over the procedures for investigating it. Ultimately, the case led to the resignation of university president John Stubbs and the reopening and reversal of eleven prior sexual harassment decisions by the university as well as the revision of its harassment policies.\n\nIn late 1996, Simon Fraser University (SFU) student Rachel Marsden and SFU swimming coach Liam Donnelly lodged complaints with the SFU harassment office against one another over events that occurred in 1994 and 1995. Marsden's formal complaint involved \"seven allegations of unwanted sexual attention, two allegations of intimidating behaviour and a general charge of psychological sexual harassment.\" Donnelly denied any romantic relationship with Marsden and claimed that she sexually harassed him.\n\nThe university harassment procedures required a hearing before a panel made up of three members of the university community. On the advice of his lawyer, the coach dropped his own complaint against Marsden and took it instead to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). No charges were laid after Donnelly made the complaint. In addition, he did not attend the hearing of Marsden's complaint against him. The panel met, heard Marsden's evidence, and finalized its decision. The result was that Donnelly was fired on May 23, 1997.\n\nThe panel's report, however, was later leaked to the media. In it the panelists admitted that the specific incidents about which the student complained appeared insignificant and innocuous, but when \"the sum total\" was considered, it was determined that her complaint was true on a balance of probability. The panel's report, issued on October 11, 1996, recommended that Donnelly be dismissed and that Marsden be financially compensated, given counselling, and be helped with her academic career.\n\nAfter dismissing his lawyer and hiring another, Donnelly appealed the ruling and went public with his side of the story. At this time, his colleagues and team-members corroborated his version of events. SFU refused to reopen the hearing, insisting that Donnelly's boycott of the hearing was itself sufficient justification for his dismissal. University policy, however, allowed for employees to file for arbitration in dismissal cases, which Donnelly did. Marsden was invited to participate, but declined. As a first step in the arbitration process, Donnelly and the university went into voluntary mediation. They agreed to reinstate Donnelly on the grounds that \"the findings of the harassment panel were based on Ms. Marsden's credibility. Inconsistencies between her statements before the panel and her response to Mr. Donnelly's harassment complaint cast doubt on her credibility.\" However, Marsden was not a party to this arbitration and the case never went to any court.\n\nSFU rehired Donnelly and committed to pay his legal fees up to $35,000, a sum that was raised to $60,000 a year later.\n\nThe SFU administration was heavily criticized for its handling of the case, including criticism from the faculty. The president of SFU, John Stubbs, approved a secret settlement with Marsden by which she was given $12,000 to compensate her for a scholarship she failed to receive, lost summer employment and injuries to her feelings.\n\nAs a result of the case, SFU radically revised its policies for dealing with harassment. John Stubbs, who had endorsed Donnelly's dismissal, resigned in December 1997 as university president in the wake of the scandal, although he remained on the university faculty. SFU also reopened ten other harassment cases and reversed their decisions.\n\nDue to the controversy, media in Canada have been much more cautious about reporting on harassment claims prior to them being presented in the courts.\n\n\nThe following links come from Waybackmachine\n"}

The program is administered during school hours, but by law must be conducted outside school property. Weekday Religious Education classes are offered in school districts in several states, most of them rural.\n\nIn 1914, the Superintendent of Schools in Gary, Indiana, requested that local ministers teach principles of Christianity to school students during the school day. In 1946, Erwin L. Shaver wrote an article entitled, \"The Movement for Weekday Religious Education\" for the journal, \"Religious Education\" In 1948, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in re: \"McCollum v. Board of Education\" that religious classes held on public school property are unconstitutional. However, classes continued in locations where the program was held outside school grounds. (See also \"Criticisms\", below.) The Supreme Court later ruled, in re: \"Zorach v. Clauson\", that religious classes held outside school grounds, but during the school day, did meet constitutional requirements dictating the separation of church and state.\n\nWeekday Religious Education classes are currently offered in several school districts in the United States. The following is a partial list, sorted by state:\n\n\nIn Fort Wayne, Indiana, classes are offered to children in the third, fourth, and fifth grades. Classes in the third grade focus upon introducing students to a \"personal relationship with Jesus Christ\". Third graders also learn about \"Hebrew traditions\", among which are \"Sabbath, the Greatest Commandment, synagogue school and Jesus visiting Jerusalem\". Fourth grade classes incorporate lessons about the patriarchs and other figures from the Old Testament. In the fifth grade, students are taught that the Bible is the \"inspired Word of God.\" Classes in Fort Wayne, Indiana use the Good News Bible.\n\nOther Indiana programs are supported by the Gideons, International and use the New King James Version of the Bible. Some programs teach Creation Science, Old and New Testament Survey and the Life of Christ as young as second grade.\n\nDahlia Lithwick, in her article for Slate magazine, summarized several criticisms of the Weekday Religious Education program as administered at that time in Staunton, Virginia. Among these criticisms is that communities in which WRE classes are taught ostracize those students who elect to opt out of the program; that WRE classes subtract from classroom time, making education mandated by federal programs such as the No Child Left Behind Act more difficult; that WRE inherently discriminates against those who aren't Christians; and that WRE promotes an Evangelical denominational or sectarian viewpoint.\n"}
