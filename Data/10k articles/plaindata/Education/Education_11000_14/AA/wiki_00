{"id": "13134912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13134912", "title": "Alphabet book", "text": "Alphabet book\n\nAn alphabet book is a book primarily designed for young children. It presents letters of the alphabet with corresponding words and/or images. Some alphabet books feature capitals and lower case letter forms, keywords beginning with specific letters, or illustrations of keywords. Alphabet books may consist of sentences, paragraphs, or entire pages highlighting letters and corresponding keywords in a variety of creative and imaginative formats.\n\nAlphabet books introduce the sounds and letters of the ordered alphabet. These books provide a non-threatening genre in which children engage in a variety of both fiction and non-fiction texts. Alphabet books provide opportunities for:\n\n\nThe oldest alphabet book known is Thomas Petyt’s \"The BAC Bothe in Latyn and in Englysshe\" (1538). The first alphabet book to be accompanied by pictures is John Hart’s \"A Methode; or, Comfortable Beginning for All Unlearned\" (1570). \n\nThe hornbook, a form of ABC book, was common by Shakespeare's day. It consisted of a piece of parchment or paper pasted on a wooden board and protected by a leaf of horn. Hornbooks displayed letters of the alphabet, a syllabary and prayers for novice readers. Andrew Tuer described a typical hornbook with a line separating the lower case and capital letters from the syllabary. This syllabarium or syllabary, likely added to the hornbook in 1596, taught pronunciations of vowel and consonant combinations.\nThese syllables are possible ancestors to the modern instructional practice of new readers working with onsets and rimes in word families. From the first hornbook, the alphabet format cemented the learning progression from syllables to words.\n\nAn example of the reliance on the alphabet for reading instruction is found in John Bunyan's, \"A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rhymes for Children.\"\nAs referenced in this verse, it was an expectation of the period that “babes” began as readers with knowledge of the alphabet. Armed with the letters of the alphabet from the hornbook, children encountered other early forms of reading materials.\n\nThe child’s alphabet book is considered one of the oldest literary genres of American literature.\n\nThe battledore was an instrument like a small racket, used for playing badminton. The term was applied to the wooden or cardboard tablets, which gradually replaced the hornbook as a device for teaching children to read. The wording printed on them varied greatly, but usually featured an alphabet, and, unlike the hornbook, entertainment was provided as well as instruction in the form of illustrations. They first appeared in the 1750s and were produced until the middle of the nineteenth century. The battledore was a more complex type of horn book printed on thick paper folded in three parts containing enlarged text with word to object illustrations for each of the capital letters bordering the four sides. The letter-word associations provide insight into eighteenth century religious and sociocultural priorities.\n\nTuer's \"Royal Battledore\" illustrated the lower case alphabet letters with a for Apple; j, k, q, and x for Judge, King, Queen and Xerxes; m for Mouse and z for Zany jester. In fact, some battledores' upper and lower borders contained this rhyme:\n\nThere is evidence of a gradual shift to more secular topics for general reading instruction from predominantly religious material.\n\nExperienced with both hornbooks and battledores, children graduated on to the modern concept of a small book, multiple paper pages covered with a thick, protective layer. Early reading booklets or religious primers contained both the alphabet and increasingly complicated lists of alphabetized syllables along with selected excerpts from the Bible. From tablet to booklet, the ABC format served as the most common framework for additional reading materials. The first church primers paralleled the introduction of school textbooks known as “the ABC”. Both colonial primers and ABC spellers employed the alphabet as an organizational feature for literacy instruction and spiritual study.\n\nOriginally imported from England, children’s reading textbooks aligned with the educational emphasis on the alphabet. While students were first trained to recite the alphabet, moralistic readings were framed around the letters of the alphabet. During the American colonial period the more secular “ABC” spellers quickly fell out of favor in comparison with the more religious primers; nevertheless, the alphabet remained the most systematic means of ordering the written contents of schoolbooks.\n\nDating back to 1683, the \"New England Primer\" contained rhyming couplets for each letter of the alphabet. These patterned rhymes were often supported by gloomy woodcut illustrations. The content of these paired lines varied from overwhelmingly religious to somewhat secular depending upon the particular version of the New England Primer.\n\nThe standard \"Primer\" beginning 'In Adam's fall, we sinned all' remained consistent throughout the numerous published texts; however, rhymes were occasionally edited for religious or political purposes, as demonstrated by the 1729 edition of the New England Primer. The passage, ‘our KING the good, No man of blood’ illustrated the letter K Due to the conflict with the English monarchy, The K couplet was altered and appeared in the revised 1777 edition as ‘Proud Korah's troop, was swallowed up.’ Similarly, in the same 1777 version, 'The dog will bite, a thief at night' was replaced by a Biblical reference. 'The deluge drowned the earth around’ was inserted for ‘the watchful dog’. Referring to mortal sin, the original U for 'Uriah's beauteous wife made David seek his life’ was censored by omitting U and skipping to V. The alphabet letters were used to teach the moral code aspired by society and religion.\n\nIn the \"New England Primer\", the couplets were followed by alphabetized Biblical sentences; the “Alphabet of Lessons for Youth” was designed for further reading practice and lifelong moral instruction. Both the 1777 and 1843 editions of the Primer maintained the same sentence excerpts from the Bible. The following are a few examples highlighting letters A, D, K and U:\n\nClearly, the immensely popular \"New England Primer\" continued to influence educational practice even beyond the revolutionary period. Of parallel longevity, the battledore continued to be published well into the 18th century. Believed to be the inventor of battledores in 1746, Benjamin Collins actually printed 100,000 copies between 1771 and 1780\n\nExemplifying the move away from strictly religious texts to more moral works, an outstanding example of the next generation of readers was the 1742 version of \"The Child’s New Plaything\". Sensitive to a youthful audience, the anonymous author introduced the alphabet with a lettered story about an appetizing apple pie.\n\nI wish I had a Piece of it now in my Hand.\n\nLater versions of the rhyme, now known as the Apple Pie ABC, became more elaborate and diversified.\n\nIn addition, \"The Child’s New Plaything\" contained the alphabet story, \"A was an Archer\", which was also to go through many later editions.\n\nToday there are many diverse kinds of alphabet books that captivate a reader’s interest through alliteration, onomatopoeia, creative narratives, poetry of all kinds, clever three-dimensional illusions, mysterious visual treasure hunts, humor, and curiosity. Electronic alphabet books are now on the market, with various animations and audio features. However, educators have criticised alphabet books for focusing on teaching the names of the letters, which often sound different from the sounds they produce, as interfering with the process of learning to read.\n\n\n"}

There are four or five(path to network designers) levels of certification: Entry (CCENT), Associate (CCNA/CCDA), Professional (CCNP/CCDP), Expert (CCIE/CCDE) and recently Architect (CCAr: CCDE previous), as well as nine different paths for the specific technical field; Routing & Switching, Design, Industrial Network, Network Security, Service Provider, Service Provider Operations, Storage Networking, Voice, Datacenter and Wireless. There are also a number of the specialist technician, sales, Business, data center certifications, CCAI certified instructor (Cisco Academy Instructor).\n\nThe table below shows the different paths and levels for Cisco Certifications. All Certifications, except for CCAr, require passing one or more theoretical exams offered by Pearson VUE. CCIE Certifications also require a hands-on exam administered at special labs around the world.\n\nCisco Certified Entry Networking Technician represents the lowest level of certification which covers basic networking knowledge. Until its introduction, CCNA represented the first level of the certification program. It has appropriate use for an entry-level network support position. CCENT certified staff can install, manage and troubleshoot a small enterprise network, including basic network security. The first step towards a CCNA certification must start by having a CCENT.\n\nIn 2017, Cisco introduced new ICND1 and ICND2 exams (needed for the new CCNA Routing and Switching). ICND1: 100-105 (Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 1 v3.0) became the new exam required for CCENT. With this change, CCENT became a sufficient pre-requirement for CCNA Security, CCNA Voice and CCNA Wireless.\n\nExam Blueprints can be found here: https://learningcontent.cisco.com/cln_storage/text/cln/marketing/exam-topics/100-105-icnd1-v3.pdf\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nCisco Certified Technicians have the skills to diagnose, restore, repair, and replace critical Cisco networking and system devices at customer sites. Technicians work closely with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to quickly and efficiently resolve support incidents.\n\nAs of November 2017, there were 2 domains available for CCT certification:\n\nThe CCNA Routing and Switching certification covers skills necessary to administer devices on small or medium-sized networks. This certification requires the ICND1 100-105 and ICND2 200-105 exams. Examinees may take the exams separately or the composite 200-125 CCNA exam. It exists generally as a prerequisite to more advanced certifications, such as the CCNP exams and Cisco Design certifications, e.g. CCNP, CCDA, CCDP, etc.\n\nPearson VUE test centers conduct these exams.\n\nAll CCNA-certified individuals specialize by technology. Previously, specialized tracks required passing and maintaining a CCNA certification, but with the expiration of the 640 series tests this is no longer the case. As of autumn 2015, all CCNA Certifications have no prerequisites.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nCisco-Certified Design Associate (CCDA) certified engineers can design switched or routed networks of LANs, WANs and broadband services. The CCDA exam (200-310 DESGN) requires a CCENT at a minimum, though either CCNA or CCIE will serve as a prerequisite, as well SWITCH-level knowledge of Cisco-based LANs.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nIn this Internet of Everything (IoE) era, new and more valuable connections are being made every day around the world. IoE has a potential multitrillion U.S. dollar market value for companies and industries in the next decade. To take advantage of this opportunity, businesses are using\npublic, private, or hybrid cloud delivery models to deliver personalized services, real-time access to information, and instant communications anytime, anywhere, on any device. Cloud is a major enabler of the IoE, by providing access to applications and services over the network from any device.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nThe Cisco Certified Collaboration Associate certification is for Cisco engineers who specialize in Cisco's Unified Communications (UC) products. Collaboration engineers focus on the deployment and support of voice, video, and live text communication solutions across IP networks.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nToday's organizations are challenged with rapidly detecting cybersecurity breaches and effectively responding to security incidents. Teams of people in Security Operations Centers (SOC’s) keep a vigilant eye on security systems, protecting their organizations by detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe CCNA Cyber Ops certification prepares candidates to begin a career working with associate-level cybersecurity analysts within security operations centers.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nThe Cisco Certified Network Associate Industrial (CCNA Industrial) certification is for plant administrators, control system engineers and traditional network engineers in the manufacturing, process control, and oil and gas industries, who will be involved with the convergence of IT and Industrial networks.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nCCNA Security validates knowledge of security infrastructure, threats, and vulnerabilities to networks and threat mitigation. Required skills include installation, troubleshooting and monitoring of network devices to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and devices. To earn this certification one must pass the 210-260 IINS (Implementing Cisco IOS Network Security) exam, as well as hold a current CCNA certification. The CCNA-Security is a prerequisite to the CCNP Security certification. It represents the required exam to earn the certification and for continuing the security certification path to the CCNP.\n\nNote: The CCNA Security courseware holds compliance with the NSA and CNSS training standard of CNSS 4011. By remaining compliant, the CCNA Security program provides the required training for network security professionals who assist private sector entities and federal agencies of the United States, protects their information and aid in the defense of the United States IT infrastructure. Candidates who have passed the CCNA Security will receive a letter of recognition acknowledging they have met the CNSS 4011 training requirements.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nCCNA Service Provider focuses validates the ability to configure and implement baseline Cisco Service Provider Next-Generation networks. The\nrequired Exams are 640-875 Building Cisco Service Provider Next-Generation Networks, Part 1(SPNGN1) and 640-878 Building Cisco Service Provider Next-Generation Networks, Part 2 (SPNGN2). Standard CCNA certification is not a prerequisite. The class, \"Building Cisco Service Provider Next-Generation Networks\" is delivered in two parts.\n\nPart 1 is a 5-day instructor-led course that provides the basic knowledge and skills necessary to support a service provider network. The course provides knowledge of the major network components and helps learners to understand how service provider networks function. The course introduces IP Next-Generation Network (IP NGN) architecture. The course also includes remote labs that help gain practical skills for deploying basic Cisco IOS / IOS XE and Cisco IOS XR software features. Part 2 is a 5-day instructor-led course that provides knowledge of network construction and IP NGN architecture. The course includes additional remote labs.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nThe CCNA Wireless certification covers wireless LANs, including networking associates/administrators, wireless support specialists, and WLAN project managers. The certification validates skills in the configuration, implementation, and support of wireless LANs. 200-355 WIFUND (Implementing Cisco Wireless Networking Essentials) is the required exam.\n\nValid for 3 years.\n\nCisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) Certifications validate knowledge and skills required to install, configure, and troubleshoot converged local- and wide-area networks with 100 to 500 or more end-devices. One needs a valid CCNA certification to obtain a CCNP certification.\n\nThe CCNP validates the ability to plan, implement, verify, and troubleshoot local and wide-area enterprise networks and work collaboratively with specialists on advanced security, voice, wireless, and video solutions. In addition to CCNA Exams, professionals must pass three separate professional-level exams. The certification track changed in July 2010, with various migration paths available for those that had begun, but not completed, the CCNP certification process. In July 2014, Cisco released version 2.0 of the CCNP exams and training courses, \"to reflect the alignment with changing industry job roles and the addition of new study materials.\" 29 January 2015 was the last day to test using the v1.0 exams. As of 30 January 2015, only the v2.0 exam is offered.\n\nRequired exams (v1.0):\n\nRequired exams (v2.0):\n\nWith a CCDP certification, a network professional can discuss, design, and create advanced addressing and routing, security, network management, data center, and IP multicast enterprise architectures that include virtual private networking and wireless domains. An active CCDA certification acts as a prerequisite for this certification.\n\nRequired exams:\n\nNote that CCDP requires 300-101 ROUTE and 300-115 SWITCH. After passing CCNP and CCDA, CCDP requires only 300-320 ARCH.\n\nYou are required to pass these four exams:\n300-070 CIPTV1 Implementing Cisco IP Telephony and Video, Part 1 (CIPTV1)\n300-075 CIPTV2 Implementing Cisco IP Telephony and Video, Part 2 (CIPTV2)\n300-080 CTCOLLAB Troubleshooting Cisco IP Telephony and Video (CTCOLLAB)\n300-085 CAPPS Implementing Cisco Collaboration Applications (CAPPS)\nCCNP Data Center validates knowledge of data center design, equipment installation, and maintenance.\n\nFive required exams:\nOR\n\n\"Formerly Cisco Certified Security Professional (CCSP).\"\n\nThe CCNP Security certification program aligns to the job role of the Cisco Network Security Engineer, who has responsibility for security in routers, switches, networking devices, and appliances, as well as choosing, deploying, supporting, and troubleshooting firewalls, VPNS, and IDS/IPS solutions for their networking environments. The CCNP Security certification requires CCNA Security or any CCIE Certification.\n\nThe CCNP Service Provider certification replaced the retiring CCIP certification.\n\nRequired exams:\n\nCCNP Wireless covers all aspects of wireless networking principles and theory. This certification requires four tests, covering Wireless Site Survey, Wireless Voice Networks, Wireless Mobility Services, and Wireless Security. The prerequisite acts as a valid CCNA Wireless certification.\n\nRequired exams:\n\nCisco Certified Internetwork Expert represents Cisco's highest certification, comprising seven tracks at present, tracks are updated and retired frequently and are aligned to industry's latest technologies and trends. As of October 6, 2010, 25,810 people held active CCIE Certifications. \"CertMag\", voted it as the most technically advanced IT certification and statistics generally report it as the highest salaried certification in IT salary surveys.\n\nCCIE began in 1993, originally with a two-day lab, later changing to a one-day format. Fewer than 3% of Cisco-certified individuals attain CCIE certification and, on average, spend thousands of dollars and 18 months studying before passing. Many candidates build training labs at home using old equipment, then sell it to other candidates after passing. Alternatively, candidates may rent \"rack time\" online. The CCIE consists of a written exam and a \"lab\" exam (in each track). The written exam acts as a prerequisite of the lab exam and has a cost of $400 per attempt. The written exam consists of 100 questions that must be completed within 2 hours. Upon passing the written exam, the candidate has eighteen months to take the lab exam. The candidate has three years after passing the written exam to successfully complete the lab. The lab is an eight-hour, hands-on exam designed to demonstrate that the candidate knows Internetworking theory and demonstrates advanced hands-on mastery. Candidates that do not pass the CCIE lab in that interval must re-pass the written exam before again attempting the CCIE lab exam. The minimum waiting time between attempts is one month.\n\nAs of July 2014, the CCIE Lab costs $1600 per attempt and ten Cisco locations offer it worldwide. Some of these locations do not offer all CCIE tracks. According to a Cisco survey, $9050 represents the average cost to prepare for CCIE certification as of April 2006, which gets spent mostly on practice equipment and study material. No formal prerequisites currently exist for the CCIE written exam, but Cisco recommends at least 3–5 years networking experience. CCIE exists as the first \"Cisco Certified\" qualification and no other Certifications have existed previously. The associate and professional Certifications recognized the fact that CCIE is overkill for many networking personnel. Cisco has chosen not to make lower level Certifications prerequisites for the CCIE certification.\n\nOne may have the knowledge to hold multiple CCIE Certifications. As of September 9, 2008, 1,729 individuals held multiple CCIE Certifications. Of those, 274 hold three or more CCIE Certifications. Adam McCombs cited this qualification as \"essentially a PhD in the internet\" in Season 1 Episode 10 of Shark Tank.\n\nUpon successful completion of the lab exam, Cisco awards a CCIE number to a new CCIE. The first CCIE number allocated (in 1993) started at 1,024 and increased thereafter. As of August 2011, the highest CCIE number allocated reached just over 30,000. The first number they allocated to the first CCIE lab location, rather than to an individual, and featured as a plaque at the entrance to the lab. They awarded Number 1025 to Stuart Biggs, who created the first written exam and first lab exam. The first person to pass both CCIE written and lab exams, known as Terry Slattery, consulted at Cisco when the lab began development. Slattery held the first CCIE who did not work for Cisco. Each CCIE retains their number regardless of how many Certifications he or she receives. Every two years a CCIE has to take a written test to retain the certification. If not done, the certification becomes suspended. After one further year without passing, the certification becomes revoked. One can then only regain the certification by starting from scratch. Re-certification can occur up to 2 years before the expiration date. After certification/re-certification, a CCIE must wait 6 months before re-certifying.\n\nCCIE Lab Exams are administered only at special CCIE Lab Test Centers around the world. However, all the tracks for testing may not be available at a lab location.\n\nThe Cisco Certified Architect (CCAr) certification assesses the experience and competency of network designers who can support the increasingly complex networks of global organizations and effectively translate business strategies into technical strategies.\n\nThe Cisco Certified Architect certification is administered as a board exam. Candidates propose and defend an architecture solution to a set of business requirements. Candidates are asked to modify their proposals \"on the fly,\" based on additional requirements presented by the board. Prerequisites include a CCDE certification, approximately 10 years of industry experience, and acceptance into the program via an application process.\n\nResponsibilities of the Cisco Certified Architect:\n\nRouting and Switching seem by far the most popular track, with 35,272 worldwide certified individuals as of May 18, 2012. The certification covers a variety of networking concepts and protocols.\n\nCCDE runs in parallel with the more established CCIE program, in some areas providing a higher skill-set than CCIE. Specifically, CCDE identifies network professionals who have expert network design skills. Network design translates business requirements into end-to-end network designs and a solutions approach to network expansion and integration. CCDE focuses on network architecture and does not cover implementation and operations. CCDE supplies a vendor-neutral curriculum, testing business requirements analysis, design, planning, and validation practices. The course came about because employers needed a way to identify experienced network designers and architects who could address all aspects of existing and new networking technologies and trends. While engineers (including many CCIEs) had fulfilled this role, certification had not advanced beyond the CCDP certification. CCDE numbering adopts a different format than CCIE and appears split into a year and number within that year. It uses the same CCIE tools to verify qualified status. CCDE certified individuals can use CCIE qualification exams to re-certify and vice versa. CCDE provides advanced network infrastructure design principles and fundamentals for large networks. A CCDE can demonstrate an ability to develop solutions which address planning, design, integration, optimization, operations, security, and ongoing support focused at the infrastructure level.\n\nThe Voice track covers advanced topics in subjects such as Quality of Service, MGCP, Call Manager (Cisco's VoIP PBX), Cisco Unity Connection (Cisco's Voice Messaging platform), Unity Express, Unified Contact Center Express, Cisco Unified Presence Server, Cisco's HWIC-4ESW, and the 3750-24PS. Only 802 CCIE Voice certified engineers hold current certificates as of September 9, 2008. Most candidates pass after three or four lab attempts, but some have required more than six. Many have reputed that the lab exam seems as much a test of time management and planning as of technical expertise. The widely dissimilar platforms used sets the Voice lab exam apart from other CCIE lab exams. One must make configurations on the Windows 2003 Server environment, a CallManager web-based GUI, and the IOS command line. As such, it involves a lot of back-and-forth fine tuning between the numerous platforms.\n\nIn May 2013, Cisco announced it will retire the CCIE Voice track and introduce the new CCIE Collaboration track, including new topics such as virtualization, Jabber instant messaging and video. After protest from current and aspirant CCIE Voice holders, whom argued that the differences remain too few to warrant retiring the track with no option to transition to the new track, Cisco offered a transition path for existing Voice holders. The Collaboration written exam may have availability starting from November 21, 2013. The lab exam will transition from Voice to Collaboration on February 14, 2014.\n\nCisco has announced the September availability of a CCIE Data Center certification, which certifies the expert-level skills required to plan, prepare, operate, monitor, and troubleshoot complex data center networks. The CCIE Data Center written exam will be available Sept. 3, 2012; the lab exam should have availability in October.\n\nThe Security track covers advanced topics in subjects such as ASA, FirePower, IOS security, Wireless Security, Content Security, Antimalware Protection and many others.\n\nThe Cisco CCIE Service Provider (CCIE SP) certification validates expert level skills required of a Network Engineer to configure, build, troubleshoot, and optimize a complex highly available Service Provider IP NGN core infrastructure.

Cognitive deficits may be inborn or caused by environmental factors such as brain injuries, neurological disorders, or mental illness.\n\nOlder people with cognitive impairment appear to improve somewhat with light therapy.\n\nThere is evidence to indicate that parallel age trends have been similar over a vast amount of time, as with Schaie’s Seattle Longitudinal Study, which contained fifty years worth of data as well as seventy years in Wechsler tests. Studies such as these have demonstrated the different patterns in age trends have two specific patterns in cognition, a constant decrease in measures of processing abilities such as reasoning, and stability followed by a steady decline for knowledge previously acquired.\n\nA twelve-year study published in 2012 researched the effects of lifestyle activities on cognitive deficit in the hopes that a long study such as this could, to some degree, help older adults to ward off cognitive decline. The study looked at verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory to be influenced by physical, social, and cognitive activities. The results of the study concluded that maintenance of cognitive functions with normal aging can be maintained by keeping an active lifestyle. The results also seemed to conclude that the correlation between lifestyle activities and cognition is not a simple one, as not all cognitive abilities were related to changes in the daily activities. Therefore, further research of longitudinal design observing the matches between activities and cognitive abilities in cognitively impaired adults could be critical.\n\nLongitudinal studies using brain imaging have been done in an attempt to note early signs of cognitive decline on healthy individuals before changes noticed clinically occur. In this way the study attempted to find more biomarkers for early onset of degenerative diseases. The results from the study concluded that there are indeed patterns of brain abnormality that can be associated with brain decline.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated patients with mood disorders in comparison with a control group to see if there was a difference on the effect of aging between the groups. These patients were tested with the Central Nervous System Vital Signs, a neurocognitive battery test. The study examined subjects from ages 18 to 90, noticing a sharp decline in the patients with mood disorder compared to the normal group when subjects were ages 65 and up. These declines were observed in the cognitive areas of attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory.\n\nAlthough one would expect cognitive decline to have major effects on job performance, it seems that there is little to no correlation of health with job performance. With the exception of cognitive-dependent jobs such as air-traffic controller, professional athlete, or other elite jobs, age does not seem to impact one’s job performance. This obviously conflicts with cognitive tests given, so the matter has been researched further.\nOne possible reason for this conclusion is the rare need for a person to perform at their maximum. There is a difference between typical functioning, that is – the normal level of functioning for daily life, and maximal functioning, that is – what cognitive tests observe as our maximum level of functioning. As the maximum cognitive ability that we are able to achieve decreases, it may not actually affect our daily lives, which only require the normal level.\n\nSome studies have indicated that childhood hunger might have a protective effect on cognitive decline. One possible explanation is that the onset of age-related changes in the body can be delayed by calorie restriction. Another possible explanation is the selective survival effect, as the study participants who had a childhood with hunger tend to be the healthiest of their era.\n\n\n"}

In addition, connected learning is an approach to educational reform keyed to the abundance of information and social connection brought about by networked and digital media. Advocates of connected learning posit that this approach leverages new media to broaden access to opportunity and meaningful learning experiences. The connected learning model suggests that youth learn best when: they are interested in what they are learning; they have peers and mentors who share these interests; and their learning is directed toward opportunity and recognition. According to the proponents of connected learning, social support for interest-driven learning and connections to multiple sites of learning activity drive individual learning outcomes. These individual outcomes also lead to collective outcomes by building knowledge, capacity and expertise in diverse communities. Environments that support connected learning are generally characterized as having a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.\n\nConnected learning has been a term used in research since the early 1990s. The original usages piggybacked on the concept of , which emphasized the importance of context in the development of knowledge for women. Many articles from this time used the term connected learning in reference to hands-on education like fieldwork or internships which is tied to the concept of learning in context. The early research that used the term connected learning also shared the common theme of sociality being important to learning outcomes. From 2000, the term connected learning began to be used in research publications to refer variously to project-based, networked, social, and information-age learning.\nCronwell and Cronwell created the first \"framework and an organizing set of principles to guide educational research and development,\" (p. 17). This research was supported by the Center for Internet Research. This connected learning framework is based on the following set of principles:\nThis idea of connected learning is supposed to be an alternative to traditional in-school instruction. They label this connected learning framework as a work in progress that needs more research to support it. However, no further research has been completed on this framework.\n\nExamples of learning environments that integrate peer, interest, and academic pursuits including athletics programs that are tied to in-school recognition, certain arts and civic learning programs, and interest-driven academic programs such as math, chess, or robotics competitions. These connected learning environments embody values of equity, social belonging, and participation. Connected learning environments include a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures. Learning environments that embody principles of connected learning include:\n\nConnected learning since its recent ramp up has been well received from the global education community. Educators and policymakers have raised concerns regarding the new model of learning laid out by research and practitioner groups, which included:\n\nConnected Learning Research Network chair Mimi Ito responded to the criticism pointing out that, \"the connected learning principles were developed with a very diverse range of practitioners in K-12 and other learning institutions like museums and libraries, as well as people working in popular culture/media, technology, and university researchers. So while the research network hopes to provide a research component to feed the broader connected learning effort, we are by no means the driving force behind it.”\n"}

The system of education in Antigua & Barbuda is based on the British educational system. The school year begins in September and ends in June of the following year. In order to ensure that all costs related to schooling are covered by the government, there is an education levy on all basic wages in Antigua and Barbuda, with the funds used toward such costs as supplies, transportation, and school infrastructure maintenance. Primary education begins at the age of five years and normally lasts for seven years. Secondary education lasts for five years, with three years of lower secondary, followed by two years of upper secondary. In 2001, there were about 13,000 students enrolled at the primary schools and 5,000 students at the secondary schools. About 1,000 secondary school age students were enrolled in vocational programs. As of 2000 the primary pupil-teacher ratio was an estimated 19 to 1; the ratio for secondary school was about 13:1. The government administers the majority of the schools. In 2003, estimated spending on education was about 3.8% of the GDP. In 2000, about 38% of primary school students were enrolled in private schools.\n\nThere currently are three colleges. The University of Health Sciences Antigua, was founded in 1982. It had, in the 1990s, an enrollment of 46 students and 16 teachers. The University of the West Indies School of Continuing Studies (Antigua and Barbuda) was founded in 1949 and offers adult education courses, secretarial skills training programs, summer courses for children, and special programs for women.

On November 30, 2006, the couple became engaged. They married in a civil service on July 6, 2007, at a Paris city hall. They had a Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois Church in Paris on July 7, 2007.\n\nOn November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". In the divorce petition, Longoria requested that her maiden name be restored. She also sought spousal support from Parker. The couple had a prenuptial agreement that was signed in June 2007, a month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009.\n\nLongoria told her friend Mario Lopez she had discovered hundreds of text messages from another woman on her husband's phone. \"Extra\" identified the other woman as Erin Barry, the then-wife of Brent Barry, Parker's former teammate, and revealed that the Barrys also were in the process of divorcing. In light of the divorce, Longoria cancelled her scheduled appearance at the 2010 American Music Awards.\n\nOn November 19, 2010, Parker filed for divorce from Longoria in Bexar County, Texas, on the grounds of \"discord or conflict of personalities\", thus establishing a legal battle over where the divorce case would be heard. Unlike Longoria's divorce petition, Parker's did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties would \"enter into an agreement for the division of their estate\". The divorce was finalized in Texas on January 28, 2011, the same day Longoria's lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition.\n\nOn December 13, 2015, Longoria reported her engagement to Mexican businessman José Antonio \"Pepe\" Bastón Patiño, then the president of Televisa, the largest media company in Latin America. Bastón and Longoria met on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend in Mexico City; at the time, Bastón did not know who Longoria was and originally declined the invitation to meet her because of his busy schedule. The couple were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016.\n\nOn December 19, 2017, it was reported that Longoria was pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to her son, Santiago, on June 19, 2018.\n\nAccording to research done in 2010 by Harvard professor and \"Faces of America\" host Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. Oviedo, 1592), who immigrated to the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain. Longoria is the Castellanized form of this Asturian-language surname.\n\nIn 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.\n\nAccording to DNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Asian and Indigenous, and 3% African. After a computer compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, tests showed that she is genetically related to cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage. Since women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother's mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Mayan from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Mayans on both sides of her family.\n\nLongoria identifies as a \"Texican\"—a Mexican-American Texan.\n\n"}

{"id": "9633735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9633735", "title": "History of Upper Canada College", "text": "History of Upper Canada College\n\nThe history of Upper Canada College (UCC), located in Toronto, Ontario, began with its founding in 1829.\n\nUpper Canada College was founded in 1829 by then-Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Major-General Sir John Colborne (later Lord Seaton), to serve as a feeder school to the newly established King's College (later the University of Toronto). It was modelled on the great public schools of Britain, most notably Eton. Though now a private school, the college was created with public funds including an initial land grant of 6,000 acres of crown lands, later supplemented with an additional 60,000 acres. An announcement of the College's January opening appeared in the December 17, 1829, edition of the \"Canada Gazette\", and teaching at the College began on January 4, 1830, with 57 students; the first boy enrolled being Henry Scadding. By the end of the school's first semester, the enrolment had increased to 89. By the end of the first year of operation, UCC had admitted 140 pupils and employed a principal and eight masters.\n\nPrior to 1829, the College was called the Royal Grammar School; its first permanent buildings stood on Russell Square, on land that is now bounded by King, Simcoe, Adelaide and John Streets in downtown Toronto. Almost immediately after the College opened, plans were implemented for newer and more permanent buildings, and the 1831 school year began in new structures at the north-west corner of King and Simcoe Streets (now 212 King Street West).\nThe new school was praised by some; the Reverend Thomas Radcliffe stated in an 1833 letter: \"Future generations will bless the memory of Sir John Colborne, who, to the many advantages derived from the equity and wisdom of his government, has added that of a magnificent foundation [in Upper Canada College] for the purposes of literary instruction. The lowest salary of any of the professors of this institution is £30 per annum, with the accommodation of a noble brick house and the privilege of taking boarders at £50 per annum.\" However, the costs of the new buildings, combined with the large staff and their high salaries, led to criticism of the College and its expenses. In his publication \"Colonial Advocate\", William Lyon Mackenzie stated: \"The College here at York in Upper Canada is most extravagantly endowed... thousands of pounds are realised at will by its self-constituted managers from the sale of school lots and school lands [in fact, not true]... splendid incomes given to masters... and dwellings furnished to the professors... by the sweat of the brow of the Canadian labourer.\" In 1837, UCC's student militia offered help to Sir Francis Bond Head's Family Compact government in suppressing Mackenzie's pro-responsible government Upper Canada Rebellion. In 1852, Mackenzie's sons, William and George, were enrolled at UCC.\n\nOn March 4, 1837, the King's College charter was amended to take UCC in under the control of the university, with the principal to be appointed by the King, and the vice-principal and masters nominated by the Chancellor of King's College (the Lieutenant-Governor) at the approval of the King's College Council.\n\nIn 1838, UCC was searching for a new principal and asked the Archbishop of Canterbury William Howley for a suggestion. John McCaul was put forward. He accepted and took the post on 29 January 1839.\n\nIn 1842, Charles Dickens visited the College and said of it: \"a sound education in every department of polite learning can be had, at a very moderate expense... It has pretty good endowments in the way of land, and is a valuable and useful institution.\"\nBy 1887, despite an enrolment of 300 that was quickly outgrowing the 1831 buildings, UCC came close to closing its doors when a Liberal provincial government, which supported university federation and saw the College's endowment and downtown campus as sources of funds for such an expensive venture, came to power. That year a Notice of Motion was introduced to the Legislature by a Liberal Member named Waters: \"in the opinion of this House the time has come when Upper Canada College should be abolished... as the instruction given in the College can be obtained in any well conducted high school in the province,\" adding that the College's real estate should go to the province. In reaction to this, a group of Old Boys met, along with letters of support from various alumni, including Lieutenant Governor John Beverley Robinson, in an effort to stop the closing of the College. The meeting ended with a unanimous motion that the group's views be laid before the government. The story was covered widely in the papers of the time, with the \"Evening Telegram\" being most supportive, the \"Globe\" taking a more moderate stance, and the \"News\" criticizing the existence of the school. In the end, after much negotiation, a decision was reached to detach the school from King's College after fifty years of affiliation, and to operate it under the guidance of five trustees appointed by the Minister of Education. The College was also to be relocated to an area outside of the city, though this provision was not included in the statute.\n\nOn July 3, 1891, the bell at the Russell Square campus rang for the last time, and on August 29, a farewell cricket game was played. The Upper Canada College Old Boys' Association was created on the same day. UCC then moved to its current site, the Deer Park campus (), 200 Lonsdale Road at Avenue Road in Forest Hill, with the doors being officially opened on October 14, 1891.\n\n\"U.C.C. march\" for piano composed by J. Bedford Campbell is the Upper Canada College march and two-step. The music was published in Toronto; New York; Chicago by W.F. Shaw Pub. Co., circa 1896.\n\nIn 1902, a separate Preparatory School was built at the south edge of the campus, creating two physically separate schools.\n\nMore than 400 graduates perished during both the First and Second World Wars, the first being Lt. C. Gordon Mackenzie of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, on October 24, 1914. By the end of WWI, 176 Old Boys were dead.\nOne year later the Upper Canada College ambulance was presented to the forces, and was delivered to France at the beginning of 1916. By May the next year the vehicle had travelled almost three thousand miles, and carried five thousand wounded men.\n\nThe outbreak of the Second World War saw the College lose a number of its best masters, although the majority were too old to join and remained behind at the school. UCC welcomed a large number of war refugees; by May 1941 there were ninety seven. The increasing number led to some concern amongst the Board of Governors, as these students were not paying tuition. A war chest was also started for the purpose of sending packages to Old Boys, and help support the children of Old Boys killed or wounded in battle.\n\nHistorian Jack Granatstein, in his book \"The Generals\", demonstrated that UCC graduates accounted for more than 30% of Canadian generals during the Second World War, including General Harry Crerar, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the First Canadian Army, and Major-General Bruce Matthews, General Officer Commanding the 2nd Canadian Division and later Chairman of the College's Board of Governors. In total, 26 Old Boys achieved brigadier rank or higher in WWII.\n\nIn 1923 \"The War Book of Upper Canada College\" was published, commemorating each Old Boy who served in the \"Great War\" of 1914-1918. Those who gave their lives are contained in a separate section. There are also two gilt boards in the College's main foyer that commemorate the names of the dead, one for each World War.\n\nDuring the time of the Rev. Sowby's regime as principal, Vincent Massey rekindled his interest in the college, and, during the latter's time as Governor General, often discussed the College's circumstances with Sowby. They worked together to bring in distinguished guests to address the students and/or inspect the College. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent laid a cornerstone for the College's Memorial Wing, and Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery inspected the cadets, declaring them \"the best cadet corps he had encountered in his career.\" It was also during this time that the medieval office of Visitor was revived at UCC, with Prince Philip being the first occupant.\n\nUCC's chapel was built in the early 1950s, funded by Massey and dedicated to his wife, Alice Parkin, who was the daughter of UCC principal George Parkin. Sowby had a piece of the altar cloth used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II donated for use in the chapel, and the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral gave marble from the ruins of the parts of the structure destroyed by bombing during WWII.\n\nDuring one of Massey's visits to UCC, as Sowby was guiding the party through the main quadrangle, two ladies spotted the letters \"F-U-C-K\" chalked upside down on the bricks below one of the main tower windows. Massey stated \"it looks like Russian to me,\" but after donning his glasses, realised what it said, and assured the principal that these things happened in the best of schools. The offending students, both 14-year-olds, owned up to the crime, and were ordered to write an apology to the Governor General. Massey immediately responded to them.\n\nThe College faced a crisis at the end of the 1950s when it was discovered that the 1891 main building was decaying rapidly due to poor construction; cracks were appearing throughout, pipes split, and doors frames warped to the point where doors could no longer be opened or closed. Due to fear that the tower would collapse the building was condemned and evacuated by March 12, 1958; faculty offices were moved to the Prep building, the infirmary, and any other spare spaces, including the principal's residence, Grant House. Classes were conducted in portables.\n\nThat same year, a major fundraising campaign was launched as construction of a new building on the exact site of the old was started. Prince Philip visited in 1959 to assist with the fundraising, and money to reconstruct the iconic tower over the main entrance was donated by the media magnate, Ted Rogers. In the summer of 1959, Governor General Massey laid the cornerstone, however, the pleasure with progress was marred when tragedy struck that same year: an Italian construction worker fell from the tower to his death. None-the-less, Field Marshal Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein dedicated the new front doors on April 28, 1960, and the new building was officially opened by Vincent Massey and Edward Peacock on September 28. The $3,200,000 cost of the building was fully subscribed.\n\nUCC welcomed the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971 with the appointment of Pauline Mills McGibbon, although she resigned in 1974 upon her appointment to the post of Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. Five years following her departure, UCC celebrated its 150th anniversary in the presence of the College's Official Visitor, Prince Philip, at the College's first Association Day, and Sandi Ryder became the first woman elected to the College's Board of Governors.\nBy 1980 boarding for Prep students ended, with some of the dormitories being converted to computer labs where students learned the fostering technology.\n\nIn 1991, UCC was visited by the Hungarian President Árpád Göncz, who would soon after enrol his grandson at the school, and in 1993, Prince Philip again visited to officially open the Foster Hewitt Athletic Centre, the Eaton Building, as well as the rebuilt College gates, the Mara Gates, at the foot of the main avenue. Two years later the College decided to greatly alter its academic course and adopted the International Baccalaureate programme.\n\nJames FitzGerald, a UCC Old Boy himself, published a book in 1994 titled \"Old Boys; the Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College\". It stirred up some controversy in Canadian media due to its candid portrayal of life at the College, derived from excerpts of interviews that FitzGerald had conducted with former students, ranging from Conrad Black and Michael Ignatieff to unknowns who managed gas stations or worked in retail. Reactions varied; Charlotte Gray wrote in the \"Toronto Star\": \"My reaction to this book is fascinated revulsion - mainly because the school seems to have taught successive generations of boys that girls are some alien species that is both terrifying and stupid,\" while Jill Rigby said in the \"Toronto Sun\": \"Yeah, so what if some UCC teachers were pedophiles? All that stuff has been going on in educational institutions since Socrates met Plato.\"\n\nThe publication of the book had an effect on the College, both in its internal structure, as well as its relationship with the broader community. Peter Dalglish, the founder of Street Kids International, criticised the school heavily in his interview for \"Old Boys\", where he said \"A prime failing of UCC is that they have no sense of being a part of a community within the city or country. The school has to change; it is still very upper middle class.\" Subsequently, he was hired by the College to change school culture. Under his direction, along with Nanci Goldman, the former Toronto Board co-ordinator of inner city services, UCC students have since been partnered with inner city Toronto kids in the College's Horizon program.\n\nThe Eaton Building was extended in 1999 to accommodate the school's curricular expansion to include grades 1 and 2. Senior kindergarten was introduced in 2003.\n\nEarly into the new millennium, UCC followed the trend in environmentalism when the Board of Governors voted to establish the Green School initiative in 2002, wherein environmental education would become \"one of the four hallmarks of a UCC education.\" This education would include ecological literacy, environmental ethics, and contributions to broader society. which would see not only upgrades of the school's physical plant to meet environmentally sustainable standards, but also an integration of these new initiatives into the curriculum.\n\nThere is no definite date for the formation of the Upper Canada College Cadets, though beginnings can be traced to a willingness of students to participate in the defence against the 1837 rebellion in Upper Canada. Later in the 1800s, in schools throughout England, Canada and the United States, involvement in a military body was thought of to inspire patriotism in young men, as well as teaching discipline and obedience. By 1863, UCC students were paraded weekly, in an amateur fashion, under Major Goodwin, but with the beginning of Fenian troubles in Upper Canada in 1865, UCC students requested that the Cadets form into a company of The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. By 1866, the request was fulfilled, making UCC possibly the second school in Canada to have a proper Cadet Corps (the first being Bishop's College School in Lennoxville, Quebec).\n\nWhen the Fenians did attack Fort Erie, Ontario, on June 1, 1866 (see Fenian Raids), the UCC Cadets, along with the Bishop's College Cadets, were called to duty, but were instructed only to guard the armouries and official stores. None-the-less, this was the only time in Canadian military history where student Cadet Corps were called to duty.\n\nBy the 1890s, there was a lack of enthusiasm for the Cadets. It was an extra expense for a student's family to cover the costs of uniform, weapons, and even their drill instructor. As well, drill and practice time was beyond the commitment to scholastics and sport. Enrolment fluctuated over the next few decades, at one point the school's administration turning its eyes to the school the College had been modelled on, Eton, as well as Harrow, where Cadet participation was compulsory. No real action was taken by UCC in regards to the Cadets; however, by 1910 the population of the company had increased to 63, and in 1912 a Sergeant Carpenter was approached to act as an instructor. He was not to last long, as by 1914 he was in Europe as Sergeant-Major in the 9th Battalion of the 1st Canadian Overseas Contingent. Numbers in the UCC Cadets still stayed high during the First World War.\n\nBy around 1919, the UCC Cadets became compulsory, and principal Grant asked the army district headquarters if the Corps could be presented with Colours, both the King's Colour and College Colour. The College Colour was given by Elanor Gooderham in 1921.\n\nDuring the war, the Cadets' association with the Queen's Own Rifles had lapsed, and by 1923 two regiments, the Toronto Regiment and Queen's Own Rifles were requesting that the Corps affiliate itself with them. After some dispute between the three parties, the College settled on the Queen's Own again by 1927.\n\nFor thirty following years, the Cadets remained a part of College life, and by the middle of the Second World War boys were practising not only drills, but also spent time on lectures, map reading, military law, and signalling. The biggest ceremony of the school year was the Battalion Inspection Day, when the cadet corps would assemble in their dress uniforms, consisting of navy-blue uniforms and berets, black leather boots and spats, white gloves; officers also wore a sword and Sam Browne, sergeants a red sash. The guns carried were Ross .303s.\n\nBy the 1960s belief in the Cadets was faltering; religion and patriotism were not held in such high regard by youth, and rebellion was the more accepted behaviour for teenagers. Minutes of the Board of Governors meeting in 1965 recorded, for the first time in sixty years, poor discipline at the battalion parade. Principal Richard Sadlier disbanded the Cadet Battalion as a compulsory body in 1976, noting: \"The Battalion has been left with little beyond its ceremonial drill which is a pretty irrelevant exercise to many people today and difficult to defend when it becomes the be-all and end-all of a program.\"\n\nIn 1977, the voluntary Royal Canadian Army Cadets helped organize a course in military science at UCC, which also included battle drill, field craft, weapons training, and some parade-square drill. But, by the mid-1980s, interest in this programme had fallen to a bare minimum, and today UCC provides no formal military training.\n\nUCC began admitting ethnic minority students early in its history. The first black student enrolled in 1831 the first Jewish student in 1836 and the first aboriginal student in 1840; some graduates from the Ojibway peoples of Upper Canada having gone on to study at Dartmouth College and Harvard University.\n\nEven though there have been ethnic minority students admitted to UCC, the school continued to maintain a reputation as a \"bastion of WASP privilege\" through the first 150 years of its history. In relation to this, diplomat James George, a student between 1926 and 1936, said upon reflection about his time with other UCC graduates in the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs: \"If UCC really was a womb matrix for a bunch of WASP patriots, why did it produce so many internationalists?\"\n\nOther former students took a different view, some citing experiences of anti-Semitism. Graham Fraser, \"The Globe and Mail\"'s Washington Bureau Chief, who attended UCC between 1960 and 1964, recalled: \"Anti-Semitism was generally an unspoken undercurrent at UCC, but a couple of times I witnessed overt anti-Semitism... Before 1960, Toronto was a pretty narrow, close-minded, little Victorian town and Upper Canada College reflected that reality.\" At the same time, Peter C. Newman, who came to UCC from Czechoslovakia in 1940, and who is Jewish himself, said that anti-Semitism was \"virtually non-existent\" at the school.\n\nMichael Ignatieff, who was a student at the College from 1959 to 1965 stated: \"The UCC culture in my time was basically Tory, Anglican and fantastically patrician... The Canadian elite must be an open, permeable elite which is colour blind, religion blind and gender blind. There has to be an elite based not even on intelligence but character. They will mostly come from schools that bear no resemblance to Upper Canada College.\"\n\nIn the decades after the 1970s, some saw the ethnic composition of the school's enrollment as changing. In 1979, former Prep School Headmaster Richard Howard said in his book \"Upper Canada College, 1929-1979: Colborne's Legacy\": \"The growth of the enrolment has increased the number of boys from a wide variety of backgrounds and decreased the ratio of those from old Toronto families. The address list now reflects Toronto's ethnic variety and resembles a small United Nations.\" William Kilbourn also said that the College had been accepting, for many years before the 1980s, a number of foreign students, notably from Latin America and Asia, and that UCC had made a concentrated effort to recruit Quebec francophones into the student body. By the 1980s the school was offering financial assistance to the less affluent, and was making serious attempts to encourage boys from visible minorities to enroll. But, few applied, save for many Chinese, East Indian, and Japanese Canadians who were accepted into the Prep; in 1983 the numbers were 42 out of a total student population of 361. However, even into the 1990s some, while acknowledging the shift to a more multi-cultural student body, claimed anti-Semitism continued in some form. In 1990, \"The College Times\" featured an editorial stating that while UCC was no longer \"a white-bread, right-wing fortress: it has become much more multi-cultural and (dare I say it?) liberal... In my years at UCC I have faced anti-Semitism, ugliness, stupidity and bureaucracy.\"\n\nBy the late 1990s, the college was increasingly diverse, and in 1997 the daily recitation of the Lord's Prayer was replaced by the recitation of a prayer from different global faiths each day. In 2002, student Adam Sheikh created the Diversity Council to celebrate the cultural diversity of the school's student population. This council, a body of students independent from the school administration, organizes celebrations of Chinese, Jewish, and Ukrainian cultural events and traditions, as well as Canadian cultural events.\n\nUCC's website states that \"the College's boarding program welcomes Upper School students from all faiths and cultural backgrounds. Each year, more than 100 students from Year 1 to IB2 come together in this cross-cultural hub, where students benefit from each other's unique experiences.\"\n\nStudents from about 16 countries attend UCC. The international students typically come from among the wealthiest families in the countries of their origin.\n\nThe 1990 College Times also addressed alleged sexism at the school in the article \"The School On The Hill\" by Greg Tessaro, winner of the College Times' Ponton Prize for Journalism. The article stated:\n\nUCC did, however, appoint the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971; Pauline Mills McGibbon. The College also states:\n\nUpper Canada College has had a number of incidents in the decade following 1998 where staff were accused of statutory rape or of possessing child pornography. Only three ended in convictions. In early February 2007, the school mailed a letter to the entire UCC community apologizing for the sexual and physical abuse at the school and referring to the abuse of students as the most difficult issue the school has had to face in its 177-year history.\n\nClark Winton Noble\n\nDoug Brown\n\nAshley Chivers\n\nLorne Cook\n\nIn response to the allegations put forward, UCC formed a review team to assess school policies, and create new ones, under the direction of Sydney Robins, QC, a former Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and author of \"Protecting Our Students: A Review to Identify and Prevent Sexual Misconduct in Ontario Schools\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46319976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46319976", "title": "Homework coach", "text": "Homework coach\n\nA homework coach is a category of tutor whose mission is to help a student's overall academic success as opposed to providing remedial instruction in a specific subject. A parent might hire a homework coach when their child is struggling in school not because they have difficulties with the academic material but because of problems with study skills, organization, executive function skills and motivation. The goal of the coach is to teach the child to become a successful student by learning to plan assignments, organize materials, manage time effectively and, in the case of an ADHD student, learn ways to manage the symptoms of their attention deficit disorder. As such, the role of a homework coach is similar to ADHD coaching but is focused specifically on success in school. Some providers use the term \"homework helper\" as well as \"homework coach.\"\n\nA homework coach is indicated for any student whose poor performance in school or college appears to be more related to organization and study skills rather than difficulty understanding the instructional material. Such students may show signs of ADHD or Executive Function disorder. Current statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control show that as many as 11% of school children 4–17 years in age had received an ADHD diagnosis. Among ADHD students, about 33% will not graduate high school with their peers, which is about twice the rate of the non-ADHD student population. By hiring a homework coach, parents hope that the added support in building study skills, helping plan assign assignments, test-taking strategies and general homework monitoring will keep their children on track in school and increase their chances of graduating on time.\n\nThe efficacy of homework coaching is in general measured by parents in terms of higher grades and less discord in the household over their student's homework habits. One study of 110 ADHD college students found that coaching was \"highly effective in helping students improve executive functioning and related skills as measured by the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory.\" There are also many anecdotal news stories and case studies relating how a homework coach has helped students improve their grades and self-confidence.

A student who has made numerous appearances on the honor roll may be awarded some form of academic letter, or any other form of notification. A similar concept to honor rolls exists in colleges and universities in the United States, known as the Dean's List.\n\nIn other countries, the meaning of honours can refer either to a specific type of academic degree or to the level of distinction with which an undergraduate degree was earned.\n\nHonours degrees are usually four-year programs (sometimes also three-year programs, e.g., in England). A student who holds a \"de jure\" Honours degree is eligible for direct entry either to a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or to a two- to three years very-high-research Master's degree program.\n\n'Honours' can also mean that students have achieved their degree with a high overall average GPA and typically have undertaken a small final project, paper or essay (also known in the UK as a dissertation). See British undergraduate degree classification.\n\nA third meaning is a postgraduate \"with Honours\" or \"cum honored\" degree, which is (part of) an academic degree itself, e.g. the one-year Bachelor with Honours degree in Australia, the one-year Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree in Canada or the four-year integrated Master with Honours degree in Scotland. Postgraduate Honours degree programs generally involve completion of master's level courses and the submission of a long high-research thesis.\n\nSome researchers have questioned the validity of the honor roll as an effective form of positive reinforcement. It is argued that the pursuit of extrinsic reward is not an accurate reflection of intrinsic interest in course material. There are also questions on the effectiveness of separating high-achieving students from their peers, in the form of magnet schools or honors courses.\n\nAn honors course is a class in which the most advanced students are placed. Most students placed in honors courses are highly motivated and dedicated to their educational experience. Honors classes also cover advanced material, permit more in-depth study than a standard course of study and may require independent research.\n\nMotivation is the main quality that characterizes an honors student. In addition to being committed to academics, they are encouraged and many participate in volunteer work, organizations and clubs, cooperative education, research, study abroad and cultural activities.\n\nHonors programs have specific entrance requirements and completion criteria in order to graduate with Honors, or cum laude.\n\n"}

There are two modes in the game; Empire Mode and Sandbox Mode. Empire Mode sends the player to one of eight casinos starting with a small one and working up to the biggest casino. In each casino the player will have specific objectives to meet in a limited time in order turn the casino into a successful place. Not meeting the objectives in time will end the game. Sandbox mode allows the player to build whatever casino desired without any objectives to follow or limited time. In this mode, the player is limited to one kind of casino, but can unlock more upon winning them from the Empire Mode.\n\nThe player starts in a specific kind of building with a limited amount of starting money, certain areas of space to build, and starting at a First Level Status. A Level Status determines what kind of casino games and services can be built in the casino. Increasing a Level Status requires a sum of cash, a number of customers in the casino and a number of good ratings. The Level Status can go as high as four. The number of customers can be increased by introducing more games and services and the good ratings can be increased by introducing variety, room decor, building extensions, cash donations, deluxe services and satisfying customers' general requirements.\n\nGeneral requirements for customers include cash desks (and ATMs) to withdraw money for gambling, bathrooms, eating establishments, drinking establishments and hotel accommodations. If those general requirements are not met, customers may decide to leave the casino and give bad reviews. Cash donations can only keep dissatisfied customers happy temporarily. Customers come in different classes, ranging from Tourists who carry little cash to VIPs who have lots of money. When building games and services in the casino, maintenance is needed to keep the casino running. Service men are needed to maintain the slot machines, custodians keep the casino and bathrooms clean, waitresses serve drinks and security guards keep unwanted offenders out.\n\nEarning money legally is done by establishing sufficient services to the number of customers and accepting commercial stunt deals with agreements met. However money can be earned illegitimately by increasing the House Edge to Cheating Mode, accepting crooked deals such as money laundering. Such illegalities can lead to financial losses and degrading of ratings if found out by city authorities. While attempting to earn profit, the player must keep in mind the maintenance and employee wage expenses that present in the gameplay. If money goes below zero, then the player is in debt and cannot spend on anymore services or building until sufficient cash is earned.\n\n\"Hoyle Casino Empire\" received a number of mixed reviews.\n\n"}

{"id": "2666752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2666752", "title": "James W. Loewen", "text": "James W. Loewen\n\nJames William Loewen (born February 6, 1942) is an American sociologist, historian, and author, best known for his 1995 book, \"Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong\", which was republished in 2008, and again in 2018.\n\nLoewen was born in Decatur, Illinois, to Winifred and David F. Loewen, on February 6, 1942. His mother was a librarian and teacher, and his father was a medical director and doctor. Loewen grew up in Decatur. He was a National Merit Scholar as a graduate in 1960 from MacArthur High School.\n\nLoewen attended Carleton College. In 1963, as a junior, he spent a semester in Mississippi, an experience in a different culture that led to his questioning what he had been taught about United States history. He was intrigued by learning about the unique place of nineteenth-century Chinese immigrants and their descendants in Mississippi culture, commonly thought of as biracial. Loewen went on to earn a PhD in sociology from Harvard University based on his research on Chinese Americans in Mississippi.\n\nLoewen first taught in Mississippi at Tougaloo College, a historically black college founded by the American Missionary Association after the American Civil War. For 20 years, Loewen taught about racism at the University of Vermont, where he is now professor \"emeritus\" of sociology. Since 1997, he has been a visiting professor of Sociology at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.\n\nLoewen co-authored a United States history textbook, \"Mississippi: Conflict and Change\" (1974), which won the Lillian Smith Book Award for Best Southern Nonfiction in 1975. However, the book was rejected for use in Mississippi's public schools by the Mississippi Textbook Purchasing Board on the grounds that it was too controversial and placed too much focus on racial matters.\n\nLoewen challenged the Board's decision in a lawsuit, \"Loewen v. Turnipseed\" (1980). Judge Orma R. Smith of the U.S. District Court ruled that the rejection of the textbook was not based on \"justifiable grounds\", and that the authors were denied their right to free speech and press.\n\nThe American Library Association considers \"Loewen v. Turnipseed\", 488 F. Supp. 1138 (N.D. Miss. 1980), a historic First Amendment case and one of the foundations of the \"right to read freely.\"\n\nLoewen spent two years at the Smithsonian Institution, where he studied and compared twelve American history textbooks then widely used throughout the United States. He published his findings in \"Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong\" (1995). He concluded that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. Loewen points out in the book that many of the distortions found in American history texts are \"not even by the authors whose names grace the cover.\" In March 2012, the book's publisher, The New Press, listed \"Lies My Teacher Told Me\" as their top all-time bestseller.\n\nThe book reflects Loewen's belief that history should not be taught as straightforward facts and dates to memorize, but rather as analysis of the context and root causes of events. Loewen recommends that teachers use two or more textbooks, so that students may realize the contradictions and ask questions, such as, \"Why do the authors present the material like this?\"\n\nLoewen builds off of \"Lies My Teacher Told Me\" in \"Teaching What Really Happened: How to Avoid the Tyranny of Textbooks & Get Students Excited About Doing History\" and lays out an argument for how history should be taught at the elementary and secondary levels. The first four chapters get to the heart of Loewen’s argument on how history should be taught and chapters 5–10 are about specific issues in history and how to teach them effectively. Chapter one makes the argument that history teachers need to free themselves from the history textbooks and go more in depth with specific issues in history. In chapter two Loewen argues that teacher expectations play a role in student performance, and knowing this can help teachers to close achievement gaps among students. The third chapter lays out why historiography is and should be important to students. Chapter four gives teachers ways to help students “Do history, [and] not merely learn it”.\n\nChapters 5–10 treat special cases in history such as slavery and the South seceding from the United States. At the end of each chapter is a “Focused Bibliography\" which lists additional readings that Loewen feels are important to the chapter. The book is focused at current and future teachers, who may be frustrated with the way that history is usually presented at the elementary and secondary levels and provides ideas on how it should be taught and how to get students engaged.\n\nContinuing his interest in racism in the United States, Loewen wrote \"\", which was released in 2005. The book documents the histories of sundown towns, which are towns where African Americans, Jews, and other minority groups were forced (or strongly encouraged) to leave prior to sundown in order to avoid racist violence threatened and perpetrated by the towns' majority white populations. A review of the book, in the \"Washington Post\", noted that even though Loewen dedicated an entire chapter to research methodology, his claims regarding the number of communities which supported racial exclusion policies is both widely variable and vague. The review stated \"This vagueness, along with Loewen's almost evangelical passion for his material, raises questions of credibility – or at least of potential overstatement.\" Loewen has written about sundown towns repeatedly throughout his career, including in \"Lies Across America\", where he notably cited the affluent suburb of Darien, Connecticut as meeting his definition of a modern-day \"de facto\" sundown town.\n\n\"Sundown Towns\" garnered the illustrious Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award. It also gained excellent reviews in \"Publishers Weekly\" and \"Booklist\". The book inspired a nationwide online initiative to monitor and list sunset towns across the USA.\n\nIn 2010, Loewen and Edward H. Sebesta co-authored the book, \"The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader: The Great Truth about the Lost Cause\", an anthology containing a wide array of primary source documents pertaining to the Confederacy from the time of the American Civil War.\n\nAt present, Loewen is researching a new book, \"Surprises on the Landscape: Unexpected Places That Get History Right\". The book is planned as follow-up to \"Lies Across America\", which noted historically inaccurate or misleading historical markers and sites across the United States. \"Surprises\" will call attention to historical sites that are accurate and provide honest representations of events. His official website invites the public to comment on what towns and historical sites should be included in terms of presenting history right.\n\nLoewen has written the following works:\n\n\n"}

Deakin (1939–2014) was an Australian mathematician and mathematics educator. He was known for his work as a writer and editor of \"Function\", a mathematics magazine aimed at high school students, and as a biographer of ancient Greek mathematician Hypatia. He won the B. H. Neumann award of the Australian Mathematics Trust in 2003 for his \"rich and varied commitment to mathematics enrichment\".\n\nDeakin was born in August 1939. He grew up in Tasmania, and moved to Melbourne late in his high school education, taking a second matriculation year studying Latin at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne before entering the University of Melbourne in 1957. He completed a bachelor's degree with second-class honours in mathematics at Melbourne in 1961. He went on to earn a master's degree there in 1963, with a thesis on integral equations supervised by Russell Love.\n\nDeakin moved to the University of Chicago in 1963 for graduate study, and completed his Ph.D. in 1966. He became a lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne in 1967, but then in 1970 moved to Papua New Guinea to become reader-in-charge in the mathematics department of the Institute of Higher Technical Education. He returned to Monash as a senior reader in 1973. He earned a master's degree in education in 1975 from the University of Exeter, and remained at Monash for the rest of his career.\n\nHe died on August 5, 2014.\n\nIn 1976 a group of mathematicians at Monash University led by department chair Gordon Preston recognized the need for a journal focused \"mathematics as mathematicians themselves would recognise it, but addressed to secondary students\". A secondary but explicit goal was to encourage young women in mathematics, as at that time their under-representation was already recognized. Later, over beers with friends from other disciplines, Deakin found the name for the new journal, \"Function\". The journal was published from 1977 to 2004, and Deakin became a founding member of its editorial board, its most frequent contributor, and, for much of its existence, its editor-in-chief.\n\nDeakin published the first of his several articles on Hypatia in 1992 in \"Function\".\nIn 2007, he published the book \"Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician and Martyr\" (Prometheus Books). Aimed at a popular audience, the book is \"at least in part, a response to Maria Dzielska's \"Hypatia of Alexandria\"\", which had focused on the historical and literary legacy of Hypatia at the expense of her mathematics, and which Deakin had previously reviewed for the \"American Mathematical Monthly\". In his book, Deakin organizes the work of other scholars on Hypatia's mathematics, particularly relying on the earlier work of Wilbur Knorr, rather than formulating new theories on this aspect of Hypatia's work.\nHe argues that, unlike some other neoplatonists of her time,\nHypatia was not opposed to Christianity, and that the Christian mob that killed her likely misunderstood her philosophical position.\nHowever, his book has been criticized for treating Hypatia more as an idealized icon, or a caricature of a female mathematician, than as a realistic person of her times.\n\n"}

He was part of young generation of anthropologists who set new, professional standards of ethnography in Amazonia. He conducted extensive fieldwork among the Tiriyo of Surinam and among cattle ranchers of the Brazilian frontier.\n\nHis book, \"Individual and Society in Guiana\", today considered a classic of modern Amerindian anthropology, was regarded as \"the most elegant summary and review of the central findings and debates in the ethnography of the Amerindian peoples of Guiana over the last three decades.\"\n\nIn 2001, a group of his former students, today well established scholars in several major universities, edited a book celebrating his contributions to the field, where they underscored that:\n\n\"[His] commitment to and interest in the particularities of Amazonian social processes, is not an abstract interest in the 'particular', understood as a theoretical commitment in the manner of the Boasians. Rather, the particular is important as a means to connect theory, methodology, and context. Lowland South American groups are not bearers of distinctive traits to be inventoried and classified, but organized totalities responding to specific social rules, laws, and constraints. Interest in the particular, therefore, results from an appreciation of the necessity of accurate scholarship, no less than brave new worlds of theory, as Rivière's work on the dialectical relationship between cosmological schemas and forms of social organization demonstrates. \"\n\nIn recent years, his work has turned more historical. He edited reprints of the Victorian classics by John McLennan and John Lubbock for the University of Chicago and a collection on the history of Oxford anthropology (2007, 2009).

A similar status exists under a different name in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nAn undergraduate degree and successful completion of a teacher training programme is compulsory for QTS recommendation. One of the main routes to achieving QTS, for those already in possession of a degree, involves undertaking a postgraduate teacher training course, such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), or a School Direct programme. There are also some undergraduate degree qualifications leading to QTS, such as the Bachelor of Education. In England only, candidates must also pass professional skills tests. All candidates must have GCSEs at grade C or above in English and mathematics, and prospective primary teachers must also be in possession of (usually) a grade C in a science subject before embarking on teacher training.\n\nAll training which leads to qualified teacher status requires trainees to train across at least two key consecutive pupil age ranges, as defined in the Secretary of State's Requirements for Initial Teacher Training. The age ranges are:\n\nThe Teaching Regulation Agency in England and General Teaching Council for Wales maintain all registrations, as well as issuing QTS certificates.\n\nQTS is technically recognised only in the country it was awarded (England or Wales), but teachers can normally apply for QTS in other Home Countries relatively easily. QTS is also recognised by many other countries once the relevant paperwork has been completed, though many countries place a lot of importance on the route to QTS (such as requiring a PGCE, whilst not accepting the GTP). Teachers trained outside England and Wales must also apply to be awarded QTS if they wish to teach in these countries.\n\nAfter having been awarded QTS teachers must normally still pass an induction period (previously called 'probation') – normally their first year of teaching. Teachers who have gained QTS but have not yet completed the Induction period are known as NQTs. NQTs who fail the induction still retain their QTS, but cannot teach in state-run schools. The induction period normally lasts a year (three school terms).\n\nNot all European Union qualifications have been officially recognized yet, so one should confirm with one's education establishment as to whether one's qualifications are acceptable, or whether one needs to go through the recognition process.\n\nMany different qualifications and courses lead to QTS:\n\nThe PGCE is a one-year course for existing degree holders, and the most common postgraduate route into teaching. It is based at and coordinated by a university or other higher education institution, though students spend a large proportion of the course working in placement schools. The PGCE carries credits towards a master's degree.\n\nA SCITT programme enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to QTS. Some SCITT programmes also award a PGCE qualification. It is available in England only.\n\nThe GTP enables candidates to gain QTS while they are employed as an unqualified teacher in a school.\n\nBoth the graduate and registered teacher programmes (GTP and RTP) have been closed in England. The graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been replaced by the School Direct Training Programme (salaried).\n\nStudents can take a three or four-year undergraduate degree course that includes QTS. This enables a candidate to gain their QTS while they study for their degree, with teaching practice being undertaken over the course of the whole programme. These are usually Bachelor of Education (BEd) degrees, though some are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees.\n\nQTS as such does not exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, as is the case in England and Wales, all teachers in Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to register with either the General Teaching Council for Scotland or the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland; the General Teaching Councils will consider only graduates with teaching qualifications (such as a BEd, PGCE or PGDE) for registration.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, a one-year Induction programme (equivalent to the NQT programme in England and Wales) must be completed.\n\nIn Scotland, a one-year probation period (equivalent to induction in England and Wales) must be completed.\n\nThose holding English or Welsh QTS (or an equivalent from another country) must apply for registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. Each case is considered individually; even those with English or Welsh QTS are not guaranteed to be allowed to teach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nThere is no formal requirement for teachers at independent schools to have QTS.\n\nAs of 27 July 2012, there is no longer any requirement for teaching staff in academies to have QTS.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11876633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11876633", "title": "Reciprocal teaching", "text": "Reciprocal teaching\n\nReciprocal teaching is an instructional activity that takes the form of a dialogue between teachers and students regarding segments of text for the purpose of constructing the meaning of text. Reciprocal teaching is a reading technique which is thought to promote students' reading comprehension. A reciprocal approach provides students with four specific reading strategies that are actively and consciously used to support comprehension: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. Palincsar (1986) believes the purpose of reciprocal teaching is to facilitate a group effort between teacher and students as well as among students in the task of bringing meaning to the text.\n\nReciprocal teaching is best represented as a dialogue between teachers and students in which participants take turns assuming the role of teacher. -Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar\n\nReciprocal teaching is most effective in the context of small-group collaborative investigation, which is maintained by the teacher or reading tutor.\n\nThe concept of reciprocal teaching was first developed by Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown in 1986 .\nAs previously mentioned, reciprocal teaching was developed as a technique to help teachers bridge the gap for students who demonstrated a discrepancy between decoding skills and comprehension skills (Palincsar, Ransom, & Derber, 1989). That is, the process is aimed at aiding students who possess grade-level skills in letter-sound correspondence (\"sounding out\" words and \"chunking\"), but are unable to construct meaning from the texts they decode. Reciprocal teaching utilizes the strategy of prediction, whereby students predict before reading, and then use those predictions during reading to check if they are correct (Stricklin, 2011). \n\nReciprocal teaching is made up of four components: predicting, clarifying, questioning, and comprehension. In 2005, Oczkus coined the phrase the \"fab four\" to describe the processes involved with reciprocal teaching (Stricklin, 2011). Students then move on to clarifying things they do not understand by asking the instructor questions, or having the teacher ask questions during reading, in order to clarify difficult sections of text or point out areas where students should pay particular attention. After the text is read, questions are asked of a student or group of students to enhance retention and check how much was learned. Finally, comprehension is achieved by engaging the students in a summary of either a page or the entire text selection of what they just read (Stricklin, 2011). The teacher supports the students by rephrasing or elaborating on their answers, statements, and questions.\n\nReciprocal teaching is an amalgamation of reading strategies that effective readers are thought to use. As stated by Pilonieta and Medina in their article \"Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades: We Can Do It, Too!\", previous research conducted by Kincade and Beach (1996) indicates that proficient readers use specific comprehension strategies in their reading tasks, while poor readers do not (Pilonieta & Medina, 2009). Proficient readers have well-practiced decoding and comprehension skills which allow them to proceed through texts somewhat automatically until some sort of triggering event alerts them to a comprehension failure (Palincsar & Brown, 1984).\n\nThis trigger can be anything from an unacceptable accumulation of unknown concepts to an expectation that has not been fulfilled by the text. Whatever the trigger, proficient readers react to a comprehension breakdown by using a number of strategies in a planned, deliberate manner. These \"fix-up\" strategies range from simply slowing down the rate of reading or decoding, to re-reading, to consciously summarizing the material. Once the strategy (or strategies) has helped to restore meaning in the text, the successful reader can proceed again without conscious use of the strategy (Palincsar & Brown).\n\nAll readers—no matter how skilled—occasionally reach cognitive failure when reading texts that are challenging, unfamiliar, or \"inconsiderate\"—i.e. structured or written in an unusual manner (Garner, 1992; Wade, 2001). Poor readers, on the other hand, do not demonstrate the same reaction when comprehension failure occurs. Some simply do not recognize the triggers that signal comprehension breakdown. Others are conscious that they do not understand the text, but do not have or are unable to employ strategies that help. Some use maladaptive strategies (such as avoidance) that do not aid in comprehension (Garner, 1992). Mayer notes in his paper on Learning Strategies that reciprocal teaching can help even novice learners become more adept at utilizing learning strategies and furthering their understanding of a subject (1996). Mayer also notes that the reciprocal teaching process gives the students the chance to learn more by having the teachers as role models, and that the reciprocal teaching process gives beginners in an academic field a chance to learn from the experts by taking turns leading the class (Mayer, 1996).\n\nApproaching the problem from the perspective of Cognitive Strategy Instruction (Slater & Horstman, 2002), reciprocal teaching attempts to train students in specific and discrete strategies to prevent cognitive failure during reading. Palincsar and Brown (1984) identified four basic strategies that may help students recognize and react to signs of comprehension breakdown: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. These strategies serve dual purposes of being both comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring; that is, they are thought to enhance comprehension while at the same time affording students the opportunity to check whether it is occurring. The leader follows these four steps in this specific order:\n\nThe prediction phase involves readers in actively combining their own background knowledge with what they have gathered from the text. With a narrative text students imagine what might happen next. With an informational text, students predict what they might learn or read about in subsequent passages.\n\nPredicting involves combining the reader’s prior knowledge, new knowledge from the text, and the text’s structure to create hypotheses related to the direction of the text and the author’s intent in writing. Predicting provides an overall rationale for reading – to confirm or disconfirm self-generated hypotheses (Doolittle et al., 2006).\n\nThe \"Predictor\" can offer predictions about what the author will tell the group next or, if it's a literary selection, the predictor might suggest what the next events in the story will be. As Williams points out, predictions don't necessarily need to be accurate, but they need to be clear (2011). \n\nThe sequence of reading, questioning, clarifying, summarizing, and predicting is then repeated with subsequent sections of text.\nDifferent reading strategies have been incorporated into the reciprocal teaching format by other practitioners. Some other reading strategies include visualizing, making connections, inferencing, and questioning the author.\n\nWhen using the questioning strategy, readers monitor and assess their own understanding of the text by asking themselves questions. This self-awareness of one's own internal thought process is termed \"metacognition.\"\n\nQuestioning involves the identification of information, themes, and ideas that are central and important enough to warrant further consideration. The central or important information, themes, or ideas are used to generate questions that are then used as self-tests for the reader. Questioning provides a context for exploring the text more deeply and assuring the construction of meaning (Doolittle, Hicks, Triplett, Nichols, & Young, 2006)\n\nThe \"Questioner\" will pose questions about the selection:\n\nThe clarification strategy focuses on training students in specific steps to help with decoding (letter-sound correspondence, \"chunking,\" spelling, etc.), as well as fix-up strategies to deal with difficult vocabulary and lapses in concentration.\n\nClarifying involves the identification and clarification of unclear, difficult, or unfamiliar aspects of a text. These aspects may include awkward sentence or passage structure, unfamiliar vocabulary, unclear references, or obscure concepts. Clarifying provides the motivation to remediate confusion through re-reading, the use of context in which the text was written and/or read, and the use of external resources (e.g., dictionary or thesaurus) (Doolittle et al., 2006).\n\nThe \"Clarifier\" will address confusing parts and attempt to answer the questions that were just posed.\n\nSummarization requires the reader to perform the task of discriminating between important and less-important information in the text. It must then be organized into a coherent whole (Palincsar & Brown, 1984).\n\nSummarizing is the process of identifying the important information, themes, and ideas within a text and integrating these into a clear and concise statement that communicates the essential meaning of the text. Summarizing may be based on a single paragraph, a section of text, or an entire passage. Summarizing provides the impetus to create a context for understanding the specifics of a text (Doolittle et al., 2006).\n\nThe \"Summarizer\" will use his/her own words to tell the main idea of the text. This can happen anywhere in the story, and it should happen often for those students who are at-risk. It can happen first at sentence level, then paragraphs, then to whole text.\n\nReciprocal teaching follows a dialogic/dialectic process. Palincsar, Ransom, and Derber (1989) wrote that there were two reasons for choosing dialogue as the medium. First, it is a language format with which children are familiar (as opposed to writing, which may be too difficult for some struggling readers). Second, dialogue provides a useful vehicle for alternating control between teacher and students in a systematic and purposeful manner.\n\nReciprocal teaching illustrates a number of unique ideas for teaching and learning and is based on both developmental and cognitive theories. The strategies embedded in reciprocal teaching represent those that successful learners engage in while interacting with text. They are thought to encourage self-regulation and self-monitoring and promote intentional learning (Brown, 1980).\n\nReciprocal teaching also follows a very scaffolded curve, beginning with high levels of teacher instruction, modeling, and input, which is gradually withdrawn to the point that students are able to use the strategies independently. Reciprocal teaching begins with the students and teacher reading a short piece of text together. In the beginning stages, the teacher models the \"Fab Four\" strategies required by reciprocal teaching, and teacher and students share in conversation to come to a mutual agreement about the text (Williams, 2011). The teacher then specifically and explicitly models his or her thinking processes out loud, using each of the four reading strategies. Students follow the teacher's model with their own strategies, also verbalizing their thought processes for the other students to hear.\n\nOver time, the teacher models less and less frequently as students become more adept and confident with the strategies. Eventually, responsibility for leading the small-group discussions of the text and the strategies is handed over to the students. This gives the teacher or reading tutor the opportunity to diagnose strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and to provide follow-up as needed.\n\nReciprocal teaching encompasses several techniques involving the who, what, and where, of learning (Mayer, 475-476):\n\nThe reciprocal teaching model has been in use for the past 20 years (Williams, 2011) and has been adopted by a number of school districts and reading intervention programs across the United States and Canada. It has also been used as the model for a number of commercially produced reading programs such as Soar to Success, Connectors, Into Connectors\n. Unfortunately, according to Williams, most students and teachers in this country have \"never even heard of it\" (2011). Available from Global Ed in New Zealand, written by Jill Eggleton is the Connectors and Into Connectors Series. These two series have both non fiction and fiction text. (2015) Abrams Learning Trends publishers \"Key Links Peer Readers\" by Jill Eggleton (2016)\n\nReciprocal teaching is also being adopted and researched in countries other than the United States. For example, Yu-Fen Yang of Taiwan conducted a study to develop a reciprocal teaching/learning strategy in remedial English reading classes (2010). Yang's study concluded that \n\"...students expressed that they observed and learned from the teacher’s or their peers’ externalization of strategy usage. Students’ reading progress in the remedial instruction incorporating the RT system was also identified by the pre- and post-tests. This study suggests that there may be benefits for teachers in encouraging students to interact with others in order to clarify and discuss comprehension questions and constantly monitor and regulate their own reading\" (2010).\n\nIn a 2008 study presented effective implementation of reciprocal teaching to students diagnosed with mild to moderate forms of disability. Within this group, ten percent of students had difficulty in learning due to Down Syndrome. The average of the participants was around eighteen years of age. The researchers, Miriam Alfassi, Itzhak Weiss, and Hefziba Lifshitz, developed a study based on Palincsar and Brown's design of reciprocal teaching for students who were considered academically too low for the complex skills of reading comprehension. The study compared two styles of teaching, remediation/direct instruction to Palincsar/Brown reciprocal teaching. After twelve weeks of instruction and assessments, reciprocal teaching was found to produce a greater success rate in improving the literacy skills in the participants with mild to moderate learning disabilities. After the study was completed, researchers recommended reciprocal teaching so that students are taught in an interactive environment that includes meaningful and connected texts. This research for the European Journal of Special Needs Education, promotes reciprocal teaching for its structure in dialogues and how students learn to apply those dialogues based on the reading taking place in instruction.\n\nCurrently in the United States research has also been conducted on the use of reciprocal teaching in primary grades. Pilonieta and Medina conducted a series of procedures to implement their version of reciprocal teaching in elementary school students (2009). The researchers adopted an age-appropriate model for reciprocal teaching and called it \"Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades,\" or RTPG (2009). Their research shows that even in younger children, reciprocal teaching apparently benefited the students and they showed retention of the RTPG when re-tested 6 months later (2009).\n\nReciprocal teaching has been heralded as effective in helping students improve their reading ability in pre-post trials or research studies (Pearson & Doyle, 1987; Pressley et al., 1987) Further trials employing Reciprocal Teaching have consistently indicated the technique promotes reading comprehension as measured on standardized reading tests (Carter, 1997).\n\nIn \"Thought and Language\" Lev Vygotsky limns the profound connection between (oral) language,cognition and learning. Refer to \"Learning by Teaching\" for additional evidence. The intensive oral language component in Reciprocal Teaching is Vygotskian.\n\nReciprocal Teaching is a contemporary application of Vygotsky's theories; it is used to improve students' ability to learn from text. In this method, teacher and students collaborate in learning and practicing four key skills: summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting. The teacher's role in the process is reduced over time. Also, reciprocal teaching is relevant to instructional concepts such as \"scaffolding\" and \"apprenticeship\", in which a teacher or more advanced peer helps to structure or arrange a task so that a novice can work on it successfully.\n\nThe design of this instructional method was influenced primarily by the work of Vygotsky and his notion of a “zone of proximal development,” which he characterized as “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers” (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86). The assistance provided the learner is a good example of scaffolding in that both temporary and adjusted support is provided, according to the needs of the participants. The assistance is withdrawn when it is no longer needed. The sequence of teacher modeling, coaching, and then fading also provides an excellent example of the structure of a cognitive apprenticeship as outlined by Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989).\n\n\n"}

Located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it includes a library, museum, archive, research center and conference center. \n\nIt was founded in 1982 as a joint venture of the American Chemical Society and the University of Pennsylvania, as the Center for the History of Chemistry (CHOC). The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) became a co-founder in 1984. It was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) in 1992, and moved two years later to the institution's current location, 315 Chestnut Street in Old City. \n\nOn December 1, 2015, CHF merged with the Life Sciences Foundation, creating an organization that covers \"the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering.\" As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.\n\nThe Institute focuses not only on the history of chemistry but also on the history of science, the history of technology, trends in research and development, the impact of science on society, and relationships between science and art, among other subjects. It supports a community of research scholars and an oral history program. As of 2012, it was the largest US grantor of research fellowships for the history of science.\n\nThe idea of creating \"a library of reference and a chemical museum\" in the United States can be found in the Proceedings of the first meeting of the American Chemical Society in 1876. Impetus for the creation of the Science History Institute dates to 1976, when the nation's bicentennial and the centennial of the American Chemical Society (ACS) stimulated interest in both history and chemistry. John H. Wotiz of the Division of the History of Chemistry of the ACS organized a session on the history of chemistry as part of the ACS centennial activities and was a strong proponent of a national center for historical chemistry.\n\nIn 1979, the ACS formed a task force chaired by Ned D. Heindel to investigate the possibility of creating a national center for the history of chemistry. Arnold Thackray, a professor in the Department of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, and curator of the Edgar Fahs Smith Memorial Collection on the history of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, argued for the formation of such a center in Philadelphia. He was able to obtain promises of private support from chemist John C. Haas, and institutional support from the Dow Chemical Company and DuPont. In December 1981 the ACS approved the establishment of the Center for the History of Chemistry, with support of $50,000 per year for five years, in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania, which was to provide an equivalent in goods and services. An agreement to create the Center for the History of Chemistry was signed by officers of the American Chemical Society and the University of Pennsylvania on January 22 and 26, 1982. A policy council was appointed by the sponsoring institutions to oversee routine operations of the center, and Arnold Thackray was appointed part-time director of the center on April 29, 1982. The official inauguration of the center was held on March 11, 1983. The Center's first home was in several vacant basement rooms on the University of Pennsylvania campus. Its \"immediate aims\" included gathering oral histories of important chemists and inventorying papers and manuscripts in repositories throughout the country to map \"the largely unexplored territory of the history of chemistry and chemical technology.\"\n\nA National Advisory Board was also formed from a wide-ranging group of people in academia and industry. In 1982, its members included John C. Haas, historians Margaret W. Rossiter and Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. and at least three Nobel Prize winners, Christian B. Anfinsen, Herbert C. Brown, and Glenn T. Seaborg. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) became a co-founder of the Center, signing an agreement on August 27 and 28, 1984. In addition, the institution began to establish relationships with affiliated organizations such as The Chemists' Club, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, the Electrochemical Society and the American Society for Mass Spectrometry.\n\nAs early as 1983, the Center for the History of Chemistry expressed an interest in \"The Conservation of Historic American Chemical Instruments\", in discussions of a possible joint project with the Smithsonian. However, the center did not yet have exhibition or collections space to allow for the acquisition of any but the most limited quantities of documents. The center did curate a number of traveling exhibitions by collaborating with other organizations, including \"Joseph Priestley: Enlightened Chemist\", \"Polymers and People\", \"Scaling Up\", and \"Chemical Education in the United States\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, the center came to the attention of Arnold Orville Beckman. The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation provided a $2 million challenge grant in 1986 to stimulate expansion of the center as a research institute, the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry (BCHOC).\nBeckman challenged the center to define its mission more broadly, reaching out to academic, professional and trade organizations, and including biochemistry, materials science, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and instrumentation within its mandate. The National Foundation for History of Chemistry was established in 1987 as a supporting Pennsylvania nonprofit. The renamed Beckman Center began a major capital campaign, listing as its needs \"offices, an exhibit gallery, a reading room, library stacks, and archives and storage areas.\" It celebrated its inauguration on November 5, 1987. With support from the American Chemical Society's \"Campaign for Chemistry\", the Center was able to move to 3401 Walnut Street, on the University of Pennsylvania campus, as of March 9, 1988.\n\nIn 1989, the Center received a further challenge grant, this time from Donald F. Othmer and his wife, Mildred Topp Othmer. Donald Othmer was a quiet chemical engineering professor from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. The Othmers donated $5 million towards the creation of the Othmer Library of Chemical History. Again, efforts to match the grant were supported by the National Foundation for History of Chemistry and the American Chemical Society's Campaign for Chemistry. The new library was further supported by the donation of 8,500 monographs, textbooks and reference works from The Chemists' Club of New York.\n\nOn July 1, 1992, the National Foundation for History of Chemistry changed its name to the Chemical Heritage Foundation, in recognition of the international nature of chemical history. By 1994, the First National Bank at 315 Chestnut Street was being discussed as a possible permanent home for the Beckman Center and Othmer Library. The institution was able to purchase the bank and nearby property in 1995 in part through a matching grant from Donald Othmer. Soon afterward, its endowment was expanded by a bequest from Othmer's estate. The Chemical Heritage Foundation moved to 315 Chestnut Street on February 1, 1996. The buildings were renovated by Richard Conway Meyer occurred in two main phases over the next few years. Phase 1, providing temporary office space and book storage, was completed in 1998. Phase 2, a move to more permanent facilities, was completed in 2000. Phase 3, construction of the adjoining Ullyot conference space for meetings and events, began soon after.\n\nAcquisition of a permanent building finally made it possible for the institution to develop \"a public museum and display area\". One possible focus was the history of instrumentation. As early as 1989, the Beckman Center had requested the loan or gift of Beckman Instruments such as the Beckman pH meter and the DU spectrophotometer for display at the Center. Some of those instruments were included in an instrumentation exhibition organized by W. Richard Howe of the University of Pittsburgh for the Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy (PITTCON) in 1994, and expanded in 1999. In the early 1990s, inspired by John Ferraro, a committee was formed within the Society for Applied Spectroscopy (SAS), to pursue the creation of an instrumentation museum. Edward Brame and other members of that committee connected with Arnold Thackray and formed the nucleus of the institution's Chemical Instrumentation Museum Group (CIMG) in 1994. In 1997, on the recommendation of the CIMG, the Chemical Heritage Foundation's board approved a collections policy for the acquisition of \"historically significant chemical instruments and apparatus\". Instrumentation, however, was only one of several areas of interest as the institution began to expand its collections.\n\nThe Science History Institute is particularly interested in the origins of early science and chemistry. Its varied holdings have considerable depth both in alchemical books and fine-art depictions of early modern alchemists. The institution's collection of alchemy-related artwork, one of the largest in the world, builds upon two significant collections. Chester Garfield Fisher, founder of Fisher Scientific, started collecting alchemical art in the 1920s. In 2000, his collection of alchemical paintings was donated by Fisher Scientific International to the Chemical Heritage Foundation. In 2002, the institution received another gift from Roy Eddleman, founder of Spectrum Laboratories, whose collection contained paintings from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Together, the two collections contain more than 90 paintings and 200 works on paper illustrating the work of alchemists and their influence on the development of chemistry as a science.\n\nThe Chemical Heritage Foundation's collections include such pioneering and landmark instruments as a 1934 Beckman Model G pH Meter, a DuPont 900 Differential Thermal Analyzer, an early custom Electro-spray Ionization Mass Spectrometer used by John B. Fenn, a 1947 Mettler B5 Single-Pan Balance, a 1963 Perkin-Elmer Model 125 Infrared Grating Spectrophotometer, and a c. 1980's Automated Peptide Synthesizer created by Bruce Merrifield.\n\nThe foundation expanded its instrument collections slowly, mostly through donations of single instruments or small groups of instruments. In 2000, the CIMG was transformed into the Heritage Council Instruments and Artifacts Committee (HCIAC), which included staff and supporters and began meeting under founding chair W. Richard Howe. In 2002, the institution was given hundreds of instruments by Stephen P. DeFalco, president of PerkinElmer, after the company closed a plant in Überlingen, Germany. An interim exhibition of \"Revolutionary Tools\" was curated at the Chemical Heritage Foundation by David Brock, showing fifteen 20th-century instruments, including Arnold Beckman's pH meter.\n\nIn 2004, a list of \"50 Instruments That Changed the World\" was identified as a basis for further expansion. In 2008, the institution released a list of its ten most wanted instruments.\n\nAs early as 1996, the Chemical Heritage Foundation had envisioned a broadly-based museum of chemical progress in which instruments would have \"a major, but not exclusive role\". That vision was followed when Peter Saylor of Dagit•Saylor Architects created the public museum and conference space. The Arnold O. Beckman Permanent Exhibit and the Clifford C. Hach Gallery for rotating exhibitions opened in 2008. The Arnold O. Beckman permanent exhibition, \"Making Modernity\", was designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. It has been described as an \"art gallery for science\", and showcases objects from the institution's widely varying collections. \"The instruments are only a fraction of the objects on display. The exhibition also includes books, documents, and artwork from CHF's collection, as well as an array of consumer products.\" The exhibition is organized around thematic arcs illustrative of the history of science, particularly chemistry. Displays include the influence of alchemy in early chemistry, the development of the first plastics, the development of brilliantly colored synthetic dyes, scientific advocacy for public health in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the teaching of chemistry through books and chemistry sets.\n\nOn December 1, 2015, the Chemical Heritage Foundation merged with the Life Sciences Foundation, also founded by Arnold Thackray. Recognizing that the joint organization's interests extended beyond the field of chemistry, the organization began a two-year renaming process, whose outcome required the agreement of its founding partners, the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. On February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, extending from the chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.\n\nArnold Thackray, the institution's first president, was awarded the 1983 Dexter Award for his contributions to the history of chemistry. Thackray was succeeded by Thomas R. Tritton, under whose leadership (2008-2013) the history of science museum opened to the public in its present location, and the fellowship program expanded.\n\nThe Science History Institute holds many collections relevant to the history of chemistry. \n\n\nThe Science History Institute's magazine, \"Distillations\", appears three times a year. It presents stories about the history of science for a popular readership. \"Distillations\" first appeared in spring 2015, as a publication of the Chemical Heritage Foundation. It was predated by the \"Chemical Heritage Magazine\", published as a quarterly by the Chemical Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe Science History Institute offers many fellowships-in-residence, of varying lengths.\n\nThe Science History Institute presents a number of annual awards to recognize outstanding contributions to science and technology by researchers, business leaders and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe annual Heritage Day Awards honor achievements in science and technology and comprise the Othmer Gold Medal, \nthe Richard J. Bolte Sr. Award for Supporting Industries and, in conjunction with The Chemists' Club of New York, the \nWinthrop-Sears Medal.\n\nThe annual Affiliate Partnership Awards, presented in conjunction with affiliate organizations, recognize achievement with the \nBiotechnology Heritage Award,\nthe Franklin-Lavoisier Prize,\nthe Petrochemical Heritage Award \nand the Pittcon Heritage Award.\n\nThe Roy G. Neville Prize in Bibliography or Biography recognizes a biographical work in the field of chemical or molecular science. Established in 2006, the prize is awarded biennially.\n\n"}
{"id": "378410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378410", "title": "Secondary education in Japan", "text": "Secondary education in Japan\n\nSecondary education in Japan is split into junior high schools (中学校 \"chūgakkō\"), which cover the seventh through ninth grade, and senior high schools (高等学校 \"kōtōgakkō\", abbreviated to 高校 \"kōkō\"), which mostly cover grades ten through twelve.\n\nLower-secondary schools cover grades seven, eight, and nine. Ages are roughly 12-15 with increased focus on academic studies. Although it is possible to leave the formal education system after completing lower secondary school and find employment, fewer than 4% did so by the late 1980s.\n\nMost junior high schools in the 1980s were government-funded public schools; 5% were private schools. At ¥552,592 ($3,989 USD) per pupil, private schools had a per-student cost that was four times higher than public schools, at ¥130,828 ($934 USD).\n\nThe minimum number of school days in a year is 210 in Japan, compared to 180 in the United States. However, students will typically attend school for 240 to 250 days a year. A significant part of the school calendar is taken up by non-academic events such as sports days and school trips.\n\nTeachers often majored in the subjects they taught. Each class is assigned a homeroom teacher who doubles as counselor. Unlike elementary students, junior high school students have different teachers for different subjects. The subject teachers usually move to a new room for each 50-minute period. Usually students' lunch is provided by the school itself.\n\nInstruction tends to rely on the lecture method. Teachers also use other media, such as television and radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989 about 45% of all public lower-secondary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. Classroom organization is still based on small work groups, although no longer for reasons of discipline. Students are expected to have mastered daily routines and acceptable behavior.\n\nAll course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools. Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. The curriculum covers Japanese language, English, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, industrial arts, homemaking, health, and physical education. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention.\n\nMany students participate in after-school clubs. Sports clubs, such as baseball are especially popular among boys, while wind bands are the most popular club for girls. Soccer (football) clubs are gaining popularity. Judo clubs attract boys and girls. They may be inspired by the many Japanese judo athletes who have won medals at the World Judo Championships and the Olympic Games. Other popular sports clubs include tennis, basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In every sport, many games are held between schools and at the regional level, so students have opportunities to compete.\n\nFor cultural clubs, one that has gained popularity is the go club. Go is a strategic board game played with black and white stones. After a manga about the game was published (\"Hikaru no Go\"), more schoolchildren started enjoying go. Other options for students include choir and art clubs. Brass band, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement clubs are popular.\n\nSome junior high schools encourage students to take academic ability tests such as the STEP Eiken for English or the Kanji kentei for Japanese.\n\nStudents in the highest grades of elementary, junior high, and senior high schools also take trips lasting up to several days to culturally important cities such as Kyoto and Nara, ski resorts, or other places.\n\nEven though upper-secondary school is not compulsory in Japan, as of 2005 94% of all junior high school graduates entered high schools and over 95% of students graduated successfully from them compared to 89% of Americans.\n\nTo enter, students must take an entrance examination in Japanese, mathematics, science, social studies, and English, whether it is standardized for all public high schools in the prefecture or a test created by a private high school for that school alone. All upper-secondary schools, public and private, are informally ranked based on their success in placing graduates in freshman classes of internationally ranked and Imperial Universities. Success or failure on an entrance examination can influence a student's entire future, since the prospect of finding a good job depends on the school attended. Thus, students experience the pressure of this examination system at a relatively early age. Because of the importance of these exams in entering high school — even more than the scholastic record and performance evaluations from lower-secondary school — students are closely counselled in lower-secondary school so that they will be relatively assured of a place in the schools to which they apply.\n\nStudents walk, ride bicycles, or take public transportation to school. It is not uncommon for students to spend two or more hours each day on public transportation, taking time to sleep, study or socialize. What they can do on the way to and from school — chewing gum, consuming snacks, reading books while walking — anything that might reflect badly on the reputation of the school is heavily regulated to protect that reputation. Some schools even require students to leave seats open on buses and trains for other passengers \"to demonstrate consideration.\" Each school has a unique uniform that makes its students easily identifiable to the public.\n\nEvery high school has a set of lockers for students to exchange their street shoes for a set of slippers, which in some schools are color-coded for gender.\n\nHigh schools typically begin at 8:30, when teachers meet for a five-minute meeting, followed by homeroom. Students assemble in their homerooms of an average of between 40 and 45 students each, with some schools having a weekly schoolwide assembly beforehand. Homeroom teachers are in charge of morning and afternoon homeroom times, both about five minutes each, as well as a weekly one-hour long homeroom period.\n\nThe latter meeting \"provides an opportunity for teachers to concentrate on student guidance. Typical activities include helping students develop greater awareness of themselves as high school students, encouraging them to reflect on their summer vacations, or perhaps asking them to contemplate the forthcoming advancement from one grade to another. These discussion topics are planned by teachers and scheduled in advance for the entire school year.\"\n\nDuring the daily homerooms the students themselves conduct what they call \"toban\" — taking attendance, making announcements, etc. — that are shared on a rotating basis. Two class leaders, one male and one female are elected every trimester, and many students are assigned to specific task committees in their homeroom class.\n\nRegular classes begin at 8:45 AM and there are four classes of 50 minutes each before lunch. Students go to different classrooms for physical education, laboratory classes, or other specialized courses; otherwise, teachers change classrooms instead of the students for the entire day. Students typically attend between ten and fourteen courses a year; however, \"you don't have all of your classes every day. The schedule rotates throughout the week, and in every classroom you enter you will find a schedule taped to the wall.\"\n\nMost schools do not have their own cafeteria, students eating in their homerooms instead, and unlike elementary and middle schools high schoolers do not have government-subsidized lunches. Because of this many students bring a box lunch (bento) - from home with foods such as rice, fish, eggs, vegetables, and pickles.\n\nAfter lunch students have two more classes. All students then participate in a fifteen-minute cleaning the school (\"osoji\"). The students work in assigned groups of between four and six students, known as han, to clean their classrooms, corridors, and school grounds.\n\nAfter osoji and the afternoon homeroom meeting, or at 3:30 PM, students are free to attend extracurricular activities.\n\nSaturday schooling, when offered, ends at 1 PM after four courses. (As discussed below, Saturday courses were officially done away with in 2002 but many schools have either kept them or are trying to bring them back).\n\nIn most schools, there are two types of extracurricular clubs: \n\nNew students usually choose a club after the school year begins and only rarely change for the rest of their high school careers. Clubs meet for two hours after school every day, many times even during school vacations. Although there is a teacher assigned to each club as a sponsor, they often have very little input in the club's daily activities. These clubs are an important chance for students to make friends and learn the social etiquette and relationships like the \"senpai\" (senior)/\"kohai\" (junior) dynamic that will be important in their adult lives.\n\nHowever, most college bound students withdraw from club activities during their senior year to devote more time to preparation for university entrance examinations. Homeroom teachers work with students and their parents at this time to discuss their admission prospects or career plans.\n\nOutside of school and cram schools, research done in the late 1990s showed students doing approximately two hours of homework on weekdays and about three hours of it on Sundays. Every day students spent an average of two hours watching television, 30 minutes listening to the radio, an hour reading for fun, and less than half an hour hanging out with peers. Parents and teachers strongly discourage teenage dating, and most young people do not begin to do so until after high school. More recently, social media such as Line are popular.\n\nAs of the late 1990s Japanese students spent 240 days a year at school, 60 days more than their American counterparts even with the amount of time spent preparing for school festivals and events. Traditionally Japanese students attended class on Saturdays; although education reforms from 2002 have made them no longer mandatory, many schools have begun to bring them back to have more time to cover the rigorous material required by the Ministry of Education.\n\nSchools have limited autonomy in developing their curriculum or choosing their textbooks. Instead, although the latter are written and produced in the private sector, the Ministry of Education has the final say over any and all content and materials. Typically students take three years each of mathematics, social studies, Japanese, science, and English, with additional courses including physical education, music, art, and moral studies. In particular social studies in Japan is broken down into civics, geography, Japanese history, world history, sociology, and politics/economics.\n\nBecause the amount of mandatory courses, electives are few. All the students in one grade level study the same subjects, although it is in upper-secondary school that differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged.\n\nMost upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their major fields although they teach a variety of courses within their disciplines. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal of covering the very demanding curriculum in the time allotted. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.\n\nThe most common type of upper-secondary schools has a full-time, general program that offered academic courses for students preparing for higher education.\n\nAccording to 2005 research, while almost 90% of Japanese students attend public schools from kindergarten through the ninth grade, over 29% of students go to private high schools. A late-1980s study by the Ministry of Education had found that families paid about ¥300,000 (US$2,142) a year for a public high school and about twice as much for a private high school; however, as the name suggests, the 2010 \"Act on Free Tuition Fee at Public High Schools and High School Enrollment Support Fund\" did away with all public high school tuition.\n\nBesides being free to attend, public schools are more popular because many students and experts have found the quality of education to be much better than that at private schools. Because of this entrance exams for public high schools are much more competitive among students than their private counterparts.\n\nJapanese vocational and technical programs include several hundred specialized courses, such as information processing, metal works, fish farming, business English, and automotive industry. Business and industrial courses in particular accounted for 72% of all students in full-time vocational programs in 1989.\n\nThe first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as Japanese language, English, mathematics, and science.\n\nTraining of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.\n\nA small number of schools offer part-time classes, night school, or correspondence education.\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its Japan Exchange and Teaching Program. By 2005 participants numbered over 6,000. In the last few years, several school boards in Japan have relied on ALTs (Assistant Language Teacher) from private dispatch companies.\n\nAs part of the movement to develop an integrated curriculum and the education reform movement of the late 1980s, the entire Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools was revised in 1989 and took effect in the 1992–93 school year. A main aim of the reform is to equip students with the basic knowledge needed for citizenship. In some measure, this means increased emphasis on Japanese history and culture, as well as understanding Japan as a nation and its relationships with other nations of the world. The course of study also increased elective hours, recommending that electives be chosen in light of individual student differences and with an eye toward diversification.\n\nA further revision to the Fundamental Law of Education was carried out on 22 December 2006. The revised law leaves the structure of schooling basically the same but includes new emphases on respect for Japanese culture (Article 2.5), school discipline (Article 6.2), and parental responsibility (Article 10).\n\nTwo problems of great concern to educators and citizens began to appear at the lower-secondary level in the 1980s: bullying, which remains a major problem, and the school-refusal syndrome (toko kyohi; manifested by excessive absenteeism), which was on the rise. In 2008, there were 42,754 incidents of problematic behavior in junior high schools, according to a government survey.\n\nExperts disagreed over the specific causes of these phenomena, but there is general agreement that the system offers little individualized or specialized assistance, thus contributing to disaffection among those who can not conform to its demands or who are otherwise experiencing difficulties. Another problem concerns Japanese children returning from abroad. These students, particularly if they have been overseas for extended periods, often need help in reading and writing — and in adjusting to rigid classroom demands. Even making the adjustment does not guarantee acceptance. Besides having acquired a foreign language, many of these students have also acquired foreign customs of speech, dress, and behavior that mark them as different.\n\nThe upper-secondary curriculum underwent thorough revision in 1989. That year a new Course of Study for Upper-Secondary Schools was announced that was to be phased in beginning with the tenth grade in 1994, followed by the eleventh grade in 1995 and the twelfth grade in 1996. Among noteworthy changes is the requirement that male and female students take a course in home economics. The government is concerned with instilling in all students an awareness of the importance of family life, the roles and responsibilities of family members, the concept of cooperation within the family, and the role of the family in society. The family continues to be an extremely important part of the social infrastructure, and the ministry clearly is interested in maintaining family stability within a changing society. Another change of note was the division of the old social studies course into \"history-and-geography\" and \"civics\" courses.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1869, SIUC has historically been the largest of the campuses of the Southern Illinois University system. The university enrolls students from all 50 states as well as more than 100 countries. SIU Carbondale offers 3 associate's, 100 bachelor's, 73 master's, and 36 Ph.D programs in addition to professional degrees in architecture, law and medicine.\n\nAn Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created Southern Illinois Normal College, the second state-supported normal school in Illinois. Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870. The first historic session of Southern Illinois Normal University was a summer institute, with a first faculty of eight members and an enrollment of 53 students.\n\nThe university continued primarily as a teacher's college until Delyte W. Morris took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest-serving president (1948–1970). During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine and Dentistry. Since World War II, higher education has been emphasized as a goal for more students. Southern Illinois University grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 24,800 students between 1950 and 1991.\n\nIn 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville. This school, now known as Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, is an independent university within the SIU system.\n\nRandy Dunn was the eighth president of the Southern Illinois University System. Dr. Dunn served as president at two other state institutions and was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. His career in education includes classroom teaching, serving as principal at two school districts, serving as superintendent for two Illinois school systems, and holding the rank of professor at two universities including SIUC. Dr. Dunn has served on a number of committees, councils and task forces, and he contributes to a variety of scholarly publications. \nDunn received his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991. He graduated from Illinois State University with a master's in administration and foundations in 1983, and the B.S. in education in 1980.\nBefore coming to Southern Illinois, he served as president at two other state institutions — Murray State University in Kentucky (2006-2013) and Youngstown State University in Ohio (2013-2014). Before that, Dunn was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. He is not a stranger to the SIU System, having held the rank of professor in the Department of Educational Administration and Higher Education at SIUC. Dunn started at the Carbondale campus as an associate professor in 1995 and was named department chair in 2000, before leaving to assume the state superintendency. During his term as chair, he also taught in the joint doctoral program in educational leadership at SIU Edwardsville. Dunn began his academic career as an assistant professor in the Department of Leadership at The University of Memphis for two years before taking his faculty post at Southern Illinois University.\nIn July 2018 Randy Dunn stepped down as SIU system president, and was replaced by J. Kevin Dorsey, as interim president. Dorsey was the former dean of the SIU school of medicine.\n\nCarlo Montemagno, a professor of engineering, became chancellor of SIU Carbondale on August 15, 2017. His appointment was approved by the university's Board of Trustees July 13, 2017, at the recommendation of SIU System President Randy Dunn.Dr. Montemagno is an internationally recognized expert in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering, focusing his work on linking multiple disciplines to solve problems in areas of health, energy and the environment. Prior to his appointment at SIU, he founded the interdisciplinary Ingenuity Lab based at the University of Alberta in Canada. In addition to leading the lab, which connects organizations and researchers from across the Province of Alberta, he served as director of the biomaterials program for the Canadian Research Council's National Institute for Nanotechnology as well as research chair in intelligent nanosystems for the Canadian National Research Council.\n\nSIU offers more than 300 academic degree programs across all levels: bachelors, masters, and doctoral. It also offers professional programs in architecture, business, law and medicine. Since 1989, SIU has offered an MD/JD dual degree program, leading to the concurrent award of both degrees after completion of six years of coursework.\n\nThe Carnegie Foundation categorizes Southern as: \"RU/H: Research Universities (high research activity).\" In the academic year 2013-2014 the University was awarded over $127 million in research grants, the largest of which were to the School of Medicine and the College of Science.\n\nSIU Carbondale ranked #226 as a \"National University\" overall in the 2019 edition of annual college rankings by \"US News\". At SIU, 59% of the classes have 19 or fewer students; 82% of classes have less than 29 students, only 5% of classes include 50 or more students. The ratio of students to faculty is 15 to 1 and the percentage of full-time faculty is 83 percent. Additionally, the National Science Foundation ranks SIU No. 75 among public universities in the U.S. for total research and development expenditures, and No. 64 among earned doctorates.\n\n\"The Princeton Review\" ranked SIU in its 2017 list of \"Best Midwestern\" and \"Green Colleges\" as well as ranking it #43 in the \"Top 50 Game Design: Ugrad\" list.\n\n\nThe College of Agricultural Sciences consists of four academic departments: Agribusiness Economics, Animal Science, Food & Nutrition, Forestry, and Plant, Soil & Agricultural Systems. There are eight majors and twenty-six specializations. The college's Ph.D. program was added in December 2007. The Ph.D. in Agricultural Sciences is a research degree that prepares graduates for developing and funding their own research program, and for teaching graduate and undergraduate students.\n\nSince its inception as the Vocational Technical Institute, CASA has undergone continuous change to address the workforce needs in the southern Illinois region, the state and the nation. The College presently includes four schools which house three master's degree programs, fourteen baccalaureate, and two associate degree programs. The masters of science in Medical Dosimetry and one baccalaureate program, Fire Service Management, are offered off-campus only.\nCASA provides off-campus opportunities to receive baccalaureate degrees in the areas of Aviation Management, Electronic Systems Technologies, Fire Service Management, Health Care Management, and Medical Dosimetry.\nThe baccalaureate degree in Information Systems Technologies is offered online. Forty-nine hours of upper-level and selected elective courses are available to students at various locations throughout the country.\n\nMorris Library is the main library for the Southern Illinois University Carbondale campus. The library holds more than 4 million volumes, 53,000 current periodicals and serials, and over 3.6 million microform units. Morris Library also provides access to the statewide automated library system and to an array of electronic sources. These figures make Morris Library among the top 50 largest research libraries in the United States. Library users have access to I-Share (the statewide automated library system) and to a comprehensive array of databases and other electronic data files. As the campus center for access to academic information and collaborative academic technology projects, Morris Library provides a wide range of services, including reference assistance, instructional and technical support, distance learning, geographic information systems (GIS), and multimedia courseware development. Morris Library is a member of the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI), Association of Research Libraries (ARL), and the Greater Western Library Alliance (GWLA). Delyte's, a new coffee shop named after former SIU President Delyte W. Morris operates near the entrance of the library.\n\nThe SIU Law Library provides legal research resources for lawyers, law students, SIU faculty and staff and members of the community. Located in the Lesar Law Building, the library has evolved to meet the changing nature of legal research and user expectations by providing wireless access to a wide array of electronic legal materials.\n\nWith over of floor space, the SIU Student Center is one of the largest student unions in the nation. The programs and services offered provide SIU students, faculty, and staff a place to relax, gather a group to study or grab a bite to eat. The Student Center hosts multiple dining locations, the University Bookstore, ATM and Western Union stations, bowling & billiards facility, check cashing services, the ID Card office, and Debit Dawg activations and deposits all under one roof. The Student Center offers several ballrooms and smaller, expandable conference rooms for small or large gatherings. Student-run radio station WIDB 104.3 FM broadcasts from the Student Center, and the Black Affairs Office, International Student Council, Student Programming Council or \"SPC,\" student governments and the Greek Council are among the organizations with their offices in the building.\n\nThe Student Recreation Center, or \"Rec,\" is the university's primary hub for intramural and fitness activities with more than 220,000 square feet, the SIU Recreation Center is also one of the largest among universities in the nation. Although SIU's Recreation Center doesn't receive state support, it operates on a $4.8 million budget, most of which is raised by a student recreation fee that is included in student fee's. The rest of the money is revenue generated by instructional programs, camps and community citizens who pay for membership.\n\nIndoor facilities include an Olympic-sized pool\n\nPool Features:\nThe 770,000 gallon natatorium is surrounded by a closed gutter filtration system which drastically reduces water turbulence helping to increase the swimmers' speed.\n\nThe facility also houses areas for basketball, volleyball, racquetball, handball, squash, weightlifting, martial arts, aerobics, and programs for the disabled. There are over 180 fitness stations distributed throughout the building. Other on campus outdoor recreation include tennis courts at three campus locations, a frisbee golf course, and 100 acres of playing fields. Picnic areas, and boat dock facilities are available at Campus lake.\n\nConnected to the Student Recreation Center on the east side of campus, the 57,000-square-foot health center offers students a continuum of care under one roof. Services include the medical clinic, pharmacy, wellness resources, psychiatry clinic, sports medicine and physical therapy and counseling and psychological services. Community partners Southern Illinois Dermatology and the Marion Eye Center also provide services in the new health center.\n\nThe Southern Illinois Salukis are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were known as the \"Maroons.\" Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The saluki, the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as \"Little Egypt.\"\n\nThe Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC). Men's swimming is part of the Mid-American Conference (MAC).\n\n\nSouthern Illinois University has a vibrant student culture and is home to more than 400 Registered Student Organizations (RSO). Organizations include honor societies, sports clubs and student activity groups, and 11 fraternities, 8 multicultural fraternities and 9 sororities. The largest RSO on campus is the Student Programming Council (SPC).\n\nSIU has two primary bodies of student government responsible for distributing part of the Student Activity Fee to the RSO's:\nAdditionally, one student is elected as one of the \"Student Trustees\"; the other is elected at SIUE and appointed by the governor as a voting member of the SIU Board of Trustees.\n\n\"The Daily Egyptian\" or \"DE\" for short, is an award-winning student-run newspaper. The \"DE\" is published weekly on Wednesdays during the fall and spring semesters with a distribution of 78,000 copies, and an online edition on Friday. The \"Daily Egyptian\" has received more than 25 awards from the Illinois College Press Association. In 2002, the paper was the recipient of the National Newspaper Pacemaker Award for General Excellence, the nation's most prestigious college journalism award.\n\nFounded in 1959, the Saluki Patrol is one of the oldest student security teams in the country. The student members assist the Department of Public Safety in their duties.\n\nOn-Campus housing at SIU is provided in residence halls and apartments and is offered for students who are undergraduates, graduates, parents, domestic partners, or married.\n\nThere are two main residence hall areas, each with a commons building containing a dining hall, known as East Campus and West Campus. The traditional residence hall contract includes a furnished room, wi-fi, cable, utilities and a dining plan. Residence hall rooms are fully furnished, and many have been modified to meet the needs of specific types of disability.\n\nApartment housing is available in Evergreen Terrace, Wall & Grand, and Elizabeth Apartments.\n\nThe SIU Housing Policy states: All single students under the age of 21, not residing with their parents or legal guardians, with fewer than 26 credit hours earned after high school are required to live in University-owned and operated residence halls. Students are considered to hold freshman status if they have earned fewer than 26 credit hours after high school.\n\nThe Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).\n\nThe idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. Buckminster Fuller, then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of \"doing the most with the least,\" and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 40 years later, it is still happening. Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.\n\n\nThere are currently over 220,000 graduates of Southern Illinois University Carbondale worldwide.\nNotable SIU alumni include:\n\n\n\nIn the cult hit-comedy movie \"Animal House\" the famous \"College\" shirt worn by actor John Belushi was created for him while attending house parties with his brother, actor James Belushi, who was a student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.\n\nIn the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Super Franchise Me,\" it is revealed that the character Gil Gunderson was two credits short from graduation from Southern Illinois University. Also in the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Sky Police,\" Gil Gunderson shouts \"Go Southern Illinois\" and along with Homer and Bart does the Saluki Strut, which is not a Southern Illinois University tradition. Nevertheless, the local Carbondale newspapers reported that Southern Illinois University was mentioned on \"The Simpsons\".\n\n\n"}

Cross (born 1958, in Tennessee, United States) is an educational psychologist, the Jody and Layton Smith Professor of Psychology and Gifted Education at The College of William & Mary. He has previously served as the George and Frances Ball Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Gifted Studies Ball State University (2000-2009), the founder and Executive Director of both the Center for Gifted Studies and Talent Development (2003-2009), and the Institute for Research on the Psychology of Gifted Students (2007-2009).\n\nOver thirty years, he made important contributions to the field of gifted education, including the development of the school-based conception of giftedness, the information management model, and the continuum of visibility, and was also influential in applying social-cognitive theory and stigma theory to gifted children.\n\nHe is the Executive Director of the Center for Gifted Education, and President Emeriti of the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC). Cross has published well over 150 articles and book chapters, and ten books. He has been the editor of five journals in the field of gifted education (Gifted Child Quarterly, Roeper Review, Journal of Secondary Gifted Education, and Research Briefs), and is the current editor of the Journal for the Education of the Gifted.\n\nDr. Cross' research interests include the social and emotional lives of gifted children, the psychology of gifted children including personality differences, the phenomenology of giftedness, and suicidology concerns of gifted individuals. His long-time collaboration with Dr. Laurence J. Coleman has result in many articles and two books. Coleman had adapted Erving Goffman's (1963) social stigma theory to gifted children, providing a rationale for why children may hide their abilities and present alternate identities to their peers. The first edition of Coleman and Cross' book, \"Being Gifted In School\", is a widely cited reference in the field of gifted education. In the chapter on Coping with Giftedness, the authors expanded on the theory first presented in a 1988 article. According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited at least 110 times in the academic literature.\n\nErving Goffman's (1963) social stigma theory describes stigmatizing conditions as those attributes which do not conform to the expectations of society and result in social disapproval. Coleman and Cross identified giftedness as a stigmatizing condition, based on research with gifted students and, in part, on a book that was written and edited by 20 teenage, gifted individuals. Psychologists had already known that adolescence is a time of identity development in which children struggle with the desire to have a unique identity yet still conform to the expectations of society. The fact that children viewed their own giftedness as a stigmatizing condition was a new perspective. Being gifted sets students apart from their peers and this differentness interferes with full social acceptance. Different social expectations that exist in the various social contexts that children must navigate and the value judgements that may be assigned to the child result in the child's use of social coping strategies to manage his or her identity. Unlike other stigmatizing conditions, giftedness is a unique type of differentness because it can lead to praise or ridicule depending on the audience and circumstances. Gifted children learn when it is safe for them to display their giftedness and when they should hide their giftedness to better fit in with a group.\n\nThe Information Management Model (IMM) is a model of the process by which children decide to employ coping strategies to manage their identities. This model is based on Bandura's (1986) social-cognitive framework and Goffman's work on the management of identity. In situations where the child feels different, she or he may decide to manage the information that others know about him or her. Strategies include: disidentification with giftedness, trying to maintain a very low visibility (invisibility), or creating a high-visibility identity (playing a stereotypical role associated with giftedness). This range of strategies is called the \"Continuum of Visibility\".\n\nIn 2009, Cross received the lifetime achievement award from Mensa in recognition of a lifetime of contributions to the field of intelligence and related subjects.\nMensa had previously recognized his work with four Mensa Outstanding Research Awards, one in 2008 and two in 2007.\n\nCross has received the Distinguished Service Award from the Association for the Gifted and NAGC (2007), the Early Leader Award (1996), Early Scholar Award, and Distinguished Scholar Awards from NAGC (1997).\n\n"}
{"id": "12441901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12441901", "title": "Tuition freeze", "text": "Tuition freeze\n\nTuition freeze is a government policy restricting the ability of administrators of post-secondary educational facilities (i.e. colleges and universities) to increase tuition fees for students. Although governments have various reasons for implementing such a policy, the main reason cited is improving accessibility for working- and middle-class students. A tuition fee freeze is a common political goal of the Canadian student movement, especially the Canadian Federation of Students.\n\nA tuition freeze is best known as a Canadian political construct, and can accurately be applied only to other countries that offer post-secondary education at a cost. However, the practice of regulating the rates paid by consumers, a formal regulatory process known as utility ratemaking, is carried out in many countries, including the United States, where many industries are classified as public utilities. Although the classification of public utilities has changed over time, typically such businesses must constitute a \"de facto\" monopoly (or \"natural monopoly\") for the services they provide within a particular jurisdiction. Since a monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity, it can be argued that colleges are an enterprise, or group of businesses that have sole access to a market of higher education, as they are the only supplier of a college degree, and are thus comparable to the monopoly of a group electric companies, who are the sole supplier of electricity.\n\nIn Canada, where government regulation of college tuition is practiced, it is applied (currently) at the provincial level, as education (including post-secondary education) is a provincial responsibility under the division of powers between provincial and federal governments. Currently, the provinces of Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland have tuition fee freezes in place. The provinces of British Columbia and Ontario have previously had tuition fee freezes.\n\nIn the US, the New Jersey government approved bill A2807 that prohibits most public and private colleges from raising tuition for 9 Semester after they enroll.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21792593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21792593", "title": "Wendel Dietterlin", "text": "Wendel Dietterlin\n\nWendel Dietterlin (c.1550–1599), sometimes Wendel Dietterlin the Elder, to distinguish him from his son, was a German mannerist painter, printmaker and architectural theoretician. Most of his paintings are now lost, and he is best known for his treatise on architectural ornament, \"Architectura\", published in its final edition in Nuremberg in 1598.\n\nDietterlin was born at Pfullendorf in Württemberg; his original name was Grapp and he may have been a member of a family of artists in Swabia, spent most of his life in Strasbourg (then Strassburg), where he married Catharina Sprewer on 12 November 1570, and where he is known to have painted frescos for the \"Bruderhof\", the Bishop's residence, in 1575, but he is later recorded in Hagenau in 1583 and in Oberkirch in 1589. He also worked on large projects in Stuttgart for some time (see below). He died in Strasbourg.\n\nIn Strasbourg, Dietterlin worked on the decoration of the \"Neuer Bau\" (currently the building of the Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie) in 1589. Between 1590 and 1592 he was employed in Stuttgart with the execution of a large (57 metres long and 20 metres wide) ceiling painting in the upper hall of the \"Neues Lusthaus\", a building constructed by Duke Ludwig of Württemberg for entertainment purposes. In addition to the ceiling, Dietterlin painted the walls of the hall. The Renaissance \"Lusthaus\" having later been rebuilt several times and almost entirely replaced in 1845 by the new \"Hoftheater\" (which was destroyed in a fire in 1902, when some of the remains of the original building came to light), nothing is now preserved of the paintings from the hall, but they are depicted in a 1619 etching by the Strasbourg-based painter and engraver Friedrich Brentel showing the interior of the large room. Other of his paintings are known from engravings by Matthäus Greuter and by his own grandson Bartholomäus Dietterlin. The style, with \"exaggerated foreshortenings\", appears influenced by North Italian models, such as Giulio Romano's frescos in Mantua, through German intermediaries.\n\nHis only extant painting is a \"Resurrection of Lazarus\" (in the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe), signed and dated 1582 or 1587.\n\nDietterlin's architectural treatise \"Architectvra: Von Außtheilung, Symmetria vnd Proportion der Fünff Seulen\" was first published in separate parts in 1593 and 1594, and finally in a combined and expanded edition in 1598. The book described the classical orders and their character and proper use, as was traditional in such books. Dietterlin, however, showed less interest in the proportions of the order than in their ornamentation. According to the architectural historian Torbjörn Fulton, Dietterlin treats the orders \"more as a basis or excuse for the development of a bizarre ornamental fantasy than as didactic examples of classical architectural ornamentation\". Like other theoreticians, he ascribed masculine and feminine qualities to the orders. In giving them an appropriate ornamentation that would agree with these qualities, he borrowed from older forms of ornament, including Gothic tracery. Dietterlin was dependent on many older models, and like other representatives of the Northern Renaissance (such as Hans Vredeman de Vries) he filled his surfaces with scrollwork, strapwork, gemshapes and grotesques. Dietterlin had Northern European contemporaries who likewise integrated Gothic elements in their designs, but he was unusual in the degree of blending of elements of different origin. While others kept Gothic elements clearly separate from Renaissance forms, Dietterlin would cover Renaissance elements in Gothic tracery or allow one to morph midway into the other.\n\n\n\n"}
