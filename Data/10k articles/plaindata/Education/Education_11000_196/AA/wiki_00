Fauci noted that whereas in the 1980s in America \"we had 30-40 percent of the hospital wards in inner-city hospitals occupied by people with advanced HIV disease, now because of the success of the therapies - which is great news - we don't have that.\"\n\nSome of the consequences of AIDS fatigue include the following:\n\nHIV infection is increasing at a rate of 12% annually among 13–24-year-old American men who have sex with men. Experts attribute this to \"AIDS fatigue\" among younger people who have no memory of the worst phase of the epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as \"condom fatigue\" among those who have grown tired of and disillusioned with the unrelenting safer sex message. The increase may also be because of new treatments.\n\n"}

This course is recommended for students with particularly strong abilities in music and college music majors.\n\nThe exam itself is divided into two broad sections: Section I, the multiple-choice section, and Section II, the free-response section. In turn, each section is divided into parts.\n\nSection I of the exam consists of four-choice multiple choice questions; the total amount varies each year. The first half of the section is listening-based; the proctor will begin playing a provided CD, and the exam will begin. Each question or group of questions is based on a musical selection or an auditory stimulus. The selection or stimulus is played, and the student must answer as many of the questions as possible. Each musical selection or auditory stimulus is usually played two or three times for each question or group of questions, though the exact number differs from question to question.\n\nSection II of the exam consists of three parts, all of which require student-produced responses. One part of the section is listening-based, one part is part-writing, and one part is sight-singing.\n\nThe listening-based part of the section contains two types of questions: melodic dictation, in which a one-part melody is played two or three times, a starting pitch, time signature, and key are given on the answer sheet, and the student must accurately record both the pitch and length of the played notes. The student must record two melodies; generally, one melody is in a major key and in a compound meter while the other melody is in a minor key and in a simple meter. One melody is written in the treble clef and the other is in the bass clef. The first melodic dictation question is in simple meter, while the second melodic question is in compound time. The reason for this is to test candidate AP Music Theory students in their ability to distinguish between simple and compound time signatures as well as being able to read bass clef and treble clef.\n\nThe second type of listening-based question is harmonic dictation. A four-part texture, traditional SATB, is played four times. The key, starting pitch for each part, and time signature are given on the answer sheet. The student must accurately notate only the bass and soprano lines, though the bass, tenor, alto, and soprano parts are played on the recording. The student must also provide a Roman numeral analysis of the chords in the progression with correct chord inversions.\n\nThe part-writing part of section II requires that the student, using knowledge of \"eighteenth century composition guidelines\" (as indicated on CollegeBoard's latest rubric and on the released 2003-2006 exams on AP Central), \"standard\" chord progressions, cadences, voicing, and part ranges, write a short (usually two or four measure) two- or four-part texture given starting pitches, a key, time signature, and another piece of information that varies with each question: figured bass notation and completed bass part, Roman numeral notation, or a completed soprano line.\n\nFor the question with the supplied figured bass notation and completed bass line, the student must write the Roman numeral notation of each chord and fill in the remaining tenor, alto, and soprano lines. For the question with the supplied Roman numeral notation, the student must write all four parts of the texture. For the question with the supplied soprano line, the student must develop a chord progression based on the given soprano line and write only an accompanying bass part.\n\nThe sight-singing part of the exam requires the student to analyze a given melodic line and perform the line as accurately as possible. Students perform two melodies one at a time; the written starting pitch will be played, and the student will have 75 seconds to practice aloud any parts he or she desires. Once the 75 seconds have ended, the starting pitch will be played again, and the student will have 30 seconds to perform the piece. Transposition of the key is allowed for voice comfortas stated on each year's directions. As with the melodic dictation part of the exam, one piece will generally be compound in meter and major in key, while the other will be simple in meter and minor in key. Students may sing the melody using solfège syllables, numbers, or a random syllable (la, la, la... ta, ta, ta etc...)\n\nThe grade distributions for the AP Music Theory exam since 2010 are:\n\n"}

It teaches grades 9 through 12. ASAS and its family schools, Avondale Elementary School and Avondale Alternative Elementary School, are part of the Toronto District School Board. Prior to 1998, the schools were part of the North York Board of Education. The school is temporarily housed (as of ) in the former Silverview Public School building on 24 Silverview Drive.\n\nAvondale's predecessor, Alternative Independent Study Program (known by the acronym AISP), was the first Board of Education operated alternative school in North York and one of the first such high schools in Toronto. AISP was founded in 1971 to meet the increasing demand of the students of North York for alternative education. Following the apparent success of Shared Experience Exploration and Discovery (known as SEED) in the City of Toronto, the North York Board of Education agreed to create an alternative program which began in September 1971 with admission of the first Grade 11, 12 and 13 students. Attendance of the first 160 was determined by lottery of the students who wished to attend, and whose numbers exceeded the allotted amount. The school had a full complement of teachers and a Programme Director instead of a Principal. The founding Programme Director was the Board's former history co-ordinator Jack Gillette. Catalysts were qualified volunteers engaged to assist with teaching specialized courses designed by the students and given Ontario Ministry of Education approval. A reunion of the original 160 students and teachers took place in a private home in Toronto on November 5, 2011. Many of the original students, now in their mid to late fifties, and most of the original teachers including Jack Gillette were in attendance. AISP changed with the times and became Avondale Alternative School in the 80s. An earlier reunion of the students of AISP took place at the school on May 27, 2010.\n\nTo allow construction of the new Avondale School building, the schools were temporarily relocated in the former Silverview Public School on 24 Silverview Drive on Yonge/Finch corridor. The new school will open in 2017 although Avondale Secondary will be potentially be built on 25 Oakburn Drive, the site of Oakburn Centre.\n\nIn addition to teaching all necessary courses required to earn an Ontario Secondary School Diploma, Avondale offers classes in guitar, drama, ceramics, drawing and painting, photography, French, business technology, law, philosophy, advanced functions, calculus and vectors, Canadian history, an introduction to anthropology, sociology, and psychology; biology, chemistry, physical education, gay and lesbian studies, and genocide and crimes against humanity. All classes are in the academic stream; applied and workplace classes must be taken via e-school or independent study.\n\nCeramics, photography, and painting and drawing are all taught by professionals in their respective fields contracted independently to teach at Avondale once a week. These teachers are known as 'catalysts'.\n\nGreat emphasis is placed on dialog-based learning within classes, particularly humanities. Examples of this include informal lectures open to questioning and criticism, class discussion on texts and ideas, and structured debates and discussions as formal evaluations.\n\n\n\n"}

It explores issues related to gender and other philosophical issues as expressed through the content of these shows in the fictional Buffyverse.\n\nNeda Ulaby of NPR describes \"Buffy\" as having a \"special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call 'Buffy Studies'\". Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term \"Buffy studies\" is commonly used amongst the academic \"Buffy\"-related writings.\n\nThe debut of \"Buffy\" (1997–2003) eventually led to the publication of a number of books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including sociology, psychology, philosophy, theology and women's studies. Since January 2001 \"Slayage: The Online Journal of Buffy Studies\" has published essays on the topic quarterly, and it continues to do so. \"\" was published in 2002, and since then many more \"Buffy\" books have been published by academic book publishers. There have also been a number of international conferences on the topic. \"College courses across the globe are devoted to the show, and secondary schools in Australia and New Zealand also provide Buffy classes.\" The topic can even be undertaken as part of a Master's degree in Cult Film & TV at Brunel University, London. Increasingly, \"Angel\" is being analyzed alongside its predecessor, e.g. in the 2005 publication, .\n\nThe creator of \"Buffy\", Joss Whedon, has responded to the scholarly reaction to his series: \"I think it's great that the academic community has taken an interest in the show. I think it's always important for academics to study popular culture, even if the thing they are studying is idiotic. If it's successful or made a dent in culture, then it is worthy of study to find out why. Buffy, on the other hand is, I hope, not idiotic. We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it... it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode.\"\n\nThe Third International Slayage Conference on the Whedonverses was held June 5–8, 2008 at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.\n\nThe response to this scholarly attention has had its critics.

{"id": "19522141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19522141", "title": "Directed listening and thinking activity", "text": "Directed listening and thinking activity\n\nThe directed listening and thinking activity (DLTA) is a strategy that was first identified by Stauffer (1980). It is used with early childhood students or students who are not yet successful independent readers. Teachers use this strategy to establish a purpose for reading with their students. With the use of this strategy students can become engaged in a text that they could not otherwise read on their own. Students are prepared to listen to a story that will be read by their teacher by being given specific information that they are to focus on as they listen. The strategy utilizes pre-reading, reading, and post-reading questions and discussions. Teachers use this strategy in an attempt to build on the knowledge that students already know and apply it to new information and situations. Students are provided with a framework to organize and recall information from storybooks. The directed reading and thinking activity is a very similar strategy that can be applied once this strategy is mastered and students become more advanced, independent readers.\n\nStudents need to be explicitly taught strategies for the comprehension of a story. The purpose of this strategy is to give the students skills so that they can eventually internalize reading skills such as, setting purposes for reading and summarizing what they have read. As a result of continuously using this strategy in the classroom students should develop metacognition of their own reading abilities and as a result a better comprehension, understanding, and connections to texts.\n\nThe teacher now begins to read the story. It is important to make sure that students can see all of the illustrations. The teacher should stop one or two times to discuss the story and to ask the students which previous predictions were correct. Students should also continue to make predictions at a few points in the story as well. It is important not to ask too many questions while reading the story. To help students to focus attention on the story, it is better to wait until after reading it through once to ask most of the questions about the students’ reactions, comments, and questions.\n\nThis is the final part of the directed listening and thinking activity. At this time there should be a discussion between the students and the teacher that is connected to the objectives and purposes for reading that were originally established. For example, if the skill that was established was sequencing the students will need to recall information about the order of the events in the story. The end is a way to tie together the skills that the students were focusing on and to summarize what they have learned as a result of listening to the story. If the students do not respond to particular questions that are asked about the story it is the teacher’s responsibility to model or scaffold their responses. This can be done by asking a question in a different or simpler way or by giving the student more information. This should also be a time to go back to the predictions that were initially listed and revise and discuss them. After the teacher has discussed the story and the objectives as a group an independent activity can be done to assess what the students have learned.\n\nThere are a wide range of objectives that you can use with this strategy. Basically any skill that pertains to the text can be employed. Examples of the different types of skills that the directed listening activity can be used to enhance are: literal information such as, sequencing and recalling facts, inferential responses such as, interpreting the feelings of characters, making predictions, relating story events to real-life experiences and visualizing, or critical responses such as, evaluating and problem solving. The strategy can also be used with various genres and story structures. However, it is important to remember that the three steps to using this strategy are always the same:\n\n\nIn a study conducted by Morrow (1984) children scored higher on comprehension tests when this strategy was utilized in the classroom because of its focus on many skills that are important to good readers. The study also proved that the modeling and scaffolding used by the teacher during this technique better prepared students to understand unfamiliar texts. When this strategy is used in classrooms it will allow students to better comprehend and connect with the texts that are being read to them. If this strategy is done correctly and frequently it will bring students more independence and reading readiness. It will lead to the creation of more engaged and skilled readers who possess the ability to think critically and analyze the texts that they have read.\n\n\n"}

In it he suggested that genocide develops in eight stages that are \"predictable but not inexorable\".\n\nThe Stanton paper was presented at the State Department, shortly after the Rwanda genocide and much of the analysis is based on why that genocide occurred. The preventive measures suggested, given the original target audience, were those that the United States could implement directly or use their influence on other governments to have implemented.\n\nIn April 2012, it was reported that Stanton would soon be officially adding two new stages, Discrimination and Persecution, to his original theory, which would make for a 10-stage theory of genocide.\n\nIn a paper for the Social Science Research Council Dirk Moses criticises the Stanton approach concluding:\n\nOther authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Helen Fein showed that pre-existing anti-Semitism and systems that maintained anti-Semitic policies was related to the number of Jews killed in different European countries during the Holocaust. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.\n\nM. Hassan Kakar wrote:\n"}

It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans for students, and established a National Teachers Corps. The \"financial assistance for students\" is covered in Title IV of the HEA.\n\nThe Higher Education Act of 1965 was reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008. Current authorization for the programs in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of 2013, but has been extended through 2015 while Congress prepares changes and amendments. Before each re-authorization, Congress amends additional programs, changes the language and policies of existing programs, or makes other changes.\n\nIn January 1965, Representative Edith Green of Oregon introduced H. R. 3220 as a bill to \"strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary education.\" Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon introduced the Senate version of the bill, S. 600. The bills sought to create an advisor council to review teacher training programs and to create a National Teacher Corps, which would recruit teachers to serve in low-income areas and train teachers through internships. Other provisions of the bills included financial aid, scholarships, work study, and library enhancements. Throughout 1965 numerous hearings were held by Special Subcommittee on Education and the Education Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held numerous hearings. Based on the recommendations of University administrators, educators and student aid officers, a new bill was introduced: H. R. 9567. It was passed by the House of Representatives on August 26 and the Senate passed the bill on September 2.\n\nIn signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 into law, President Johnson said that the act, along with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 as \"keystones of the great, fabulous 89th Congress\" that would spread \"the roots of change and reform\" throughout the nation.\n\nThe Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) was first authorized under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. Also in the amendments of 1998 is the Aid Elimination Provision, which prevents students with drug charges from receiving federal aid for colleges and universities. This is where question 31 on the FAFSA forms originates. The question asks whether the student has ever been convicted of a drug crime while receiving federal financial aid. This statutory provision was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in the face of a constitutional challenge by the ACLU in the case of \"Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings\".\n\nThe amendments also included a provision [HEA Section 487(a)(23)] requiring universities to make a good faith effort to encourage voter registration of students on their campuses. This requirement applies only to institutions located in states that require voter registration prior to election day and do not allow registration the day of the election. Institutions receive registration forms from the state after requesting them at least 120 days prior to the voter registration deadline, and must make them \"widely available\" to students.\n\nIn 2003, much of the Higher Education Act was set to expire. As a result, a number of minority groups united to ask for certain changes. Calling themselves the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, this group was made up of \"the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an advocacy group for historically black colleges and universities, [and they] presented their joint recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\" The Alliance aimed to help minority students enter fields where they seemed to be underrepresented and to give incentives to minorities to enter these programs. These incentives included more lenience on loan collection and full government funding for minority education. The Alliance also called for the government to create funding for students in graduate programs of universities serving the minority population.\n\nEven though the Alliance's request to change the Higher Education Act was heard, significant parts were denied. In 2003, the request for increasing the amount offered in a Pell Grant, to better cover a student's expenses, was denied by the Senate. Still, other issues were corrected. There was a section passed, by the House, that did allow more funds to go to institutions, in order to keep them current; and a grace period for colleges asking for more loans was eliminated. So, if more funding were needed, minority institutions would not have to wait.\n\nWith the changes proposed in 2003, the actual Higher Education Act was not reauthorized. Instead, many of its sections were renewed, with little radical change. Numerous extensions have followed, with the most recent extension lasting through August 15, 2008. The Senate passed an HEA reauthorization bill in July 2007, as did the House of Representatives in February 2008.\n\nOn August 14, 2008, the Higher Education Opportunity Act (Public Law 110-315) (HEOA) was enacted. It reauthorized the amended version of the Higher Education Act of 1965. This act made major changes in student loan discharges for disabled people. Previously, to qualify for a discharge, a disabled person could have no income. This has been changed to a no \"substantial gainful activity\" test, which is the same standard used by the Social Security Administration in determining eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The changes took effect on July 1, 2010.\n\nAlso included in the 2008 revision of the HEOA were provisions requiring action by U.S. colleges and universities to combat illegal file sharing. Following significant lobbying by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the additions to the HEOA of 2008 included requirements that all U.S. colleges and universities (1) release and annual disclosure to students regarding copyright laws and associated campus policies, (2) a written plan, submitted to the Department of Education, to combat copyright abuse using one or more technology-based deterrents, and (3) an offer to students of alternatives to illegal downloading. Significant controversy surrounded the inclusion of anti-P2P legislation into HEOA of 2008, resulting in a letter from a number of leaders in higher education.\n\nAdditionally, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (CCRA), a budget reconciliation bill signed into law in September 2007, made significant changes to federal financial aid programs included in HEA. In addition to increasing the maximum Pell Grant award and reducing interest rates on subsidized student loans, this bill capped loan repayment at 15% of an individual’s discretionary income, raised the income protection allowance, enacted loan forgiveness for public servants in the Direct Loan program, set publicly funded student loans to fixed rates from variable rate loans, and took actions to address problematic practices in the lending industry. Most CCRA provisions took effect on October 1, 2007.\n\nThe law for the first time also required post-secondary institutions be more transparent about costs and required the nearly 7,000 post-secondary institutions that receive federal financial aid funds (Title IV) to post net price calculators on their websites as well as security and copyright policies by October 29, 2011.\n\nAs defined in HEOA, the net price calculator's purpose is \"to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The [net price] calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student’s individual net price at a particular institution.\"\n\nThe law defines \"estimated net price\" as the difference between an institution's average total Price of Attendance (the sum of tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses including personal expenses and transportation for a first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive aid) and the institution's median need- and merit-based grant aid awarded.\n\nElise Miller, program director for the United States Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), stated the idea behind the requirement: \"We just want to break down the myth of sticker price and get beyond it. This is to give students some indication that they will not [necessarily] be paying that full price.\"\n\nThe template was developed based on the suggestions of the IPEDS' Technical Review Panel (TRP), which met on January 27–28, 2009, and included 58 individuals representing federal and state governments, post-secondary institutions from all sectors, association representatives, and template contractors. Mary Sapp, assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami, served as the panel's chair. She described the mandate's goal \"to provide prospective and current undergraduate students with some insight into the difference between an institution's sticker price and the price they will end up paying\".\n\nThe TRP faced the difficult challenge of creating one tool that could be used by a wide variety of institutions – from small, for-profit career schools to major research universities – while balancing simplicity for users.\n\nTo meet the requirement, post-secondary institutions may choose either a basic template developed by the U.S. Department of Education or an alternate net price calculator that offers at least the minimum elements required by law.\n\nAs part of its cost-transparency measures, HEOA of 2008 requires also on the College Navigator Web site a report giving the average institutional net price of attendance for first-time, full-time students who receive financial aid. This also forms the basis for transparency lists; a report on the College Navigator Web site the institutional net price of attendance for Title IV aid recipients by income categories; and for the U.S. Department of Education to develop a multi-year tuition and required-fees calculator for undergraduate programs for the College Navigator Web site.\n\nThe HEA has been criticized for establishing statutory pricing of federal student loans based on political considerations rather than pricing based on risk.\n\nThe 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act also maintained the requirement that universities must make an effort to register students to vote. A 2013 Dear Colleague letter from the U.S. Department of Education stated that universities “must make the voter registration forms widely available to [their] students and distribute the forms individually to [their] degree or certificate program students who are physically in attendance at [their] institution. Distribution by regular or electronic mail is permitted.”\n\nDuring this reform period of 2008, Title VI of the HEA was reviewed. \nTitle VI provides federal funds to 129 international studies and foreign language centers at universities nationwide. The objective of this act is to ensure and encourage diverse perspectives in order to enhance national security. As such, Title VI supplies grants for international language studies, business and international education programs as well as international policy. Moreover, the recipients of these funds are required to engage in ‘public outreach’ for K-12, teachers, educators and the general public.\n\nOver the past decade concerns have been raised over these title VI funded programs. Conservative critics have emphasized that many of the international programs funded engage in biased, anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric, with no offers of counterbalance.\n\nCertainly, a 2006 review mandated by Congress found that the programs were not reaching their goals. Seeking to rectify this, Congress expressed the need for greater oversight by the Department of Education, as well as an investigation to ensure these programs reflected \"diverse perspectives\".\n\nDespite these reforms, the issues within Title VI have been deemed endemic. Writing in \"The Hill\", Louis D. Brandeis Center Founder Kenneth L. Marcus argued that \"title VI doesn’t need to be tweaked-it needs to be overhauled\". This declaration followed a joint statement released by 10 groups on September 17, 2014, which the Brandeis Center coordinated.\n\nThis joint statement expressed the deep concerns over the misuse of tax payer money, arguing that \"these outreach programs, which have no congressional oversight, often disseminate anti-American and anti-Israel falsehoods.\" Furthermore, the groups voiced the opinion that \" too often exclude scholars with diverse perspectives while stifling discourse on critical issues. The biased learning environment that results suppresses the academic freedom of students and faculty with different views. At some institutions, students are afraid to disagree with their professors.\" \nThis statement was accompanied by a white paper published by the Brandeis Center as well as a report by the AMCHA Initiative underscoring the negative effects this biased perspective produces on campuses, UCLA specifically. The AMCHA study found that \"any time UCLA’s center sponsored or co-sponsored an event mentioning Israel from Fall 2010 to Spring 2013, 93% of the time the mention was negative and critical – as if Israel is a blight on the planet.\"\n\nUCLA's media relations office issued a statement saying that the university \"remains dedicated to complying with all federal laws and respecting the free and open exchange of ideas representing diverse viewpoints.\" \n\nIn light of such issues, the joint statement calls for changes in the Title VI program which would 1) \"[r]equire recipients of Title VI funds to establish grievance procedures to address complaints that programs are not reflecting diverse perspectives and a wide range of views\" and 2) \"[r]equire the U.S. Department of Education to establish a formal complaint-resolution process similar to that in use to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" \n\nResponding to this statement Amy W. Newhall, executive director of the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), asserted that MESA \"resolutely opposes all forms of hate speech and discrimination, including anti-Semitism,\" but \"is concerned that some of the reports issued by partisan political groups based outside academia may actually weaken efforts to combat anti-Semitism by portraying all criticism of Israeli policies as a form of anti-Semitism or as ‘anti-Israel.’\" \n\nHowever, as Kenneth L. Marcus asserts in a letter to the editor of \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" the co-signatories of the joint statement \" urge the opposite: accountability systems to ensure that these programs offer the diversity of perspectives that existing law requires.\"\nAs said statement concludes: \"Arguably, Title VI programs no longer serve a legitimate purpose... In 2011, Congress reduced Title VI funding nationwide by 40 percent, from $34 million to $18 million. Unless effective and necessary reforms can be enacted, Congress may have to consider reducing or eliminating Title VI funding from Middle East studies centers.\" \n\nAfter being reauthorized in 2008, the Higher Education Act was set to expire in 2013, but was re-extended to allow Congress time to work on the next reauthorization. In December 2017, House Republicans announced that they had finalized an overhaul of the act, authored primarily by Representative Virginia Foxx of (R - N.C.), the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The new bill is called the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act. The act aims to simplify the federal financial aid process and expand federal work study programs. It would also repeal two Obama-era programs - “gainful employment” and “borrower defense” - aimed at preventing financial exploitation of undergraduates, as well as bar their readoption.\n\nAccording to Committee spokesman Michael Woeste, “the reforms within the PROSPER Act are necessary to provide students with a high-quality education, and fix a system that has not been serving their needs.”\n\nSome concerns have been raised by advocacy groups about how the PROSPER Act would affect LGBTQ students. According to the Human Rights Campaign, “The PROSPER Act contains several provisions that would allow for the use of religion to justify otherwise prohibited discrimination that could negatively impact LGBTQ students.”\n\nAdditionally, the PROSPER Act includes a weaker version of the provision requiring universities to increase student voter registration, a requirement present in the Higher Education Act since 1998. Critics worry that this change will lead to lower youth turnout in elections, as voter turnout is already historically lowest among young voters.\n\n\n"}

The rule was subsequently adopted by several other scientific journals, and has shaped scientific publishing ever since. Historically it has also helped to ensure that the journal's content is fresh and does not duplicate content previously reported elsewhere, and seeks to protect the scientific embargo system.\n\nThe Ingelfinger rule has been seen as having the aim of preventing authors from performing duplicate publications which would unduly inflate their publication record. On the other hand, it has also been stated that the real reason for the Ingelfinger rule is to protect the journals' revenue stream, and with the increase in popularity of preprint servers such as arXiv, figshare, bioRxiv, and PeerJPrePrints many journals have loosened their requirements concerning the Ingelfinger rule. In a defense of the policy, the journal said in an editorial that the practice discouraged scientists from talking to the media before their work was peer reviewed.\n\nThe rule is named for Franz J. Ingelfinger, the \"NEJM\" editor-in-chief who enunciated it in 1969. An earlier version of the policy had been expressed in 1960 by Samuel Goudsmit, editor of the \"Physical Review Letters\", but did not become as well known.\n\n\n"}

Beginning with \"Uncle Roger\" in 1986, Malloy has composed works in both new media literature and hypertext fiction. She was an early creator of online interactive and collaborative fiction on The WELL and ArtsWire (website archived in 2002).\n\nMalloy has served as editor and leader for books and web projects. Her literary works have been exhibited worldwide. Recently she has been a Digital Studies Fellow at the Rutgers Camden Digital Studies Center (2016-2017) and a Visiting Lecturer at Princeton University in Social Media Poetics (2013) and Electronic Literature (2014).\n\nBorn in Boston a month after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Malloy was raised in Massachusetts. Her mother was a journalist and newspaper editor, and her father, a Normandy veteran, worked as an assistant district attorney in two Massachusetts counties and then as Chief Assistant US Attorney for Massachusetts. Malloy skied and played tennis, summering in New Hampshire, Cape Cod, and the Berkshires. Malloy felt an early calling to the visual arts and began painting and sketching as a child.\n\nAfter graduating from Middlebury College with a degree in literature and work in studio art and art history, Malloy took a job at the Library of Congress; she also traveled in Europe. In the next few years, while writing and making art, Malloy worked as a technical information specialist at the NASA contractor Ball Brothers Research Corporation, running their technical library and learning FORTRAN programming in order to identify relevant content for research. Malloy moved to the East Bay in the mid 1970s and lived in Berkeley where, in addition to installations and performances, she developed a series of artist's books that incorporated non-sequential narratives driven by words and images.\n\nHer papers are currently being collected by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Duke University.\n\nIn 1986, Malloy wrote and programmed \"Uncle Roger\", the first online hyperfiction project with links that took the narrative in different directions depending on the reader's choice. The \"Wall Street Journal\" mentioned \"Uncle Roger\" as the start of a future art form in their 1989 centennial publication. \"Uncle Roger\" was a three-part hypertextual \"narrabase\" (narrative database) that used keyword searching (including Boolean operators) and appeared on Art Com Electronic Network on the WELL.\n\nIn 1988, Malloy became the coordinating editor of FineArt Forum, under the Leonardo publishing umbrella, and developed F. A. S. T. (Fine Art Science and Technology), a resource on the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (The WELL) bulletin board. Malloy was the initial editor of \"Leonardo Electronic News\", 1991–1993, now \"Leonardo Electronic Almanac\". For Leonardo, she worked to make the work of new media artists more visible, creating the artists' \"Words on Works\" (WOW) Project, published in \"Leonardo Electronic News\" and \"Leonardo\".\n\nMalloy's hyperfiction work \"its name was Penelope\" was exhibited in 1989 at the Richmond Art Center and published in 1993 by Eastgate Systems. Also in 1993, Malloy was invited to XEROX PARC as an artist-in-residence, where she developed \"Brown House Kitchen\", an online narrative written in LambdaMOO. Malloy then wrote \"l0ve0ne\", published in 1994 by Eastgate Web Workshop as their first work. Malloy created Making Art Online] in 1994. One of the first arts websites, Making Art Online is currently hosted by the Walker Art Center.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, while working with PARC, Malloy and Cathy Marshall (hypertext developer) collaborated on \"Closure Was Never a Goal in this Piece\", an article published in the book \"Wired Women\" which documented their experiences working on their other project, \"Forward Anywhere: Notes on an Exchange between Intersecting Lives\", a hypernarrative work based on electronic communication that passed between the two in which they sought \"to exchange the remembered and day-to-day substance of our lives\".\n\nMalloy worked for Arts Wire, a program of the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) from its early origins in 1993. She began serving as editor of the online periodical \"Arts Wire Current\" in March 1996. She continued as editor through the periodical's name change to \"NYFA Current\" in November, 2002, until March 2004.\n\nMalloy is the editor of \"Women, Art & Technology\" (MIT Press, 2003), a documentation of the central role of female artists in the development of new media. The book lays out a historical outline of the female influence in art and technology including papers written by notable members of the field. She is also the editor of content | code | process (formerly called \"Authoring Software)\", a website of resources related to the authoring tools used for hyptertext and other forms of database-driven writing. Her most recent work is the 2010 new media poetry trilogy \"Paths of Memory and Painting\", the first part of which appeared in 2008 under the title \"where every luminous landscape\".\n\nHer work has been exhibited and published internationally including the 2008 Electronic Literature Conference, San Francisco Art Institute, Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, São Paulo Art Biennial, the Los Angeles Institute for Contemporary Art, Boston Cyberarts Festival, the Walker Art Center, Visual Studies Workshop, Berkeley Art Center, Finger Lakes Environmental Film Festival, Centenary of Carmen Conde, Cartagena, Spain, Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum and the Hellenic American Union in Athens, Houston Center for Photography, Richmond Art Center, San Antonio Art Institute, A Space, Toronto, Canada, National Library of Madrid, Eastgate Systems, E.

In May 2009 it was a finalist in the \"prix poésie-média 2009\" hosted by the \"Biennale Internationale des poetes\" (BIPVAL) in Val de Marne, France.\n\nMalloy is the editor of the forthcoming (July 2016) MIT Press book, Social Media Archeology and Poetics.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1344322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1344322", "title": "Katharine Coman", "text": "Katharine Coman\n\nKatharine Ellis Coman ( – ) was an American historian, economist, sociologist, educator, and social activist. Coman worked at Wellesley College for 35 years as an instructor, professor, and dean. Believing that the discipline of political economy could be harnessed to solve the pressing social problems of the day, Coman created new courses in the discipline. She specialized in research and teaching about the development of the American West, and British and American industrialism. In her work, she criticized capitalism and was supportive of the labor movement. She was the only woman co-founder of the American Economics Association, the author of the first important history of industry in the US, and the first female statistics professor in America. Throughout her life, she traveled widely to conduct her economics research. A social activist, Coman supported the settlement movement and the labor movement. She shared a home with poet Katharine Lee Bates for 25 years, and the two women often traveled together. Coman died of breast cancer in 1915. Wellesley College created the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History in her honor.\nComan was born on November 23, 1857, to Martha Ann Seymour Coman (1826–1911) and Levi Parsons Coman (1826–1889) in Newark, Ohio. Upon her birth, Coman's father reportedly said that he would show educators how a girl should be educated. Her mother had graduated from an Ohio female seminary, and her father had been educated at Hamilton College, and thus Coman's received much of her early education at home. She attended the University of Michigan for two years, left college to teach in Ottawa, Illinois for two years, and then returned to university. She earned the Bachelor of Philosophy (PhB) degree in 1880, one of only a handful of women to do so. She was heavily influenced by the work of John Stuart Mill, which is evident in her later work as economist and historian. Coman attended lectures about socialism while traveling in London. Later in her career, she became influenced by Alfred Marshall (1890), Francis Amasa Walker (1883), and social Darwinism. While at the University of Michigan, Coman studied under Professors Charles Kendall Adams of the German Historical School; James Burrill Angell, then president of the university; and Henry Carter Adams, a renowned statistician. After graduating with her PhB, she joined the faculty at Wellesley College, a newly established private college for women.\n\nComan was recruited to Wellesley College by Alice Freeman, Wellesley's president, whose goal was to attract idealistic women faculty members to teach young women how to rebuild American society after the economic and social ravages of the Civil War. Noting her talent for teaching, the president of the University of Michigan, James Burrill Angell, recommended Coman. She first taught English rhetoric, and in 1881 became an instructor in history. In 1883, she was promoted to full professor of history. Because Coman believed that economics could address social problems, she urged the Wellesley College administration to offer courses in economics, and in 1883, she taught Wellesley's first political economy class. To teach students about the practicality of applying economic theory to real world economic and social problems, Coman escorted her students on field trips to Boston's tenement houses, labor union meetings, factories, and sweatshops. In 1885, at the age of 28, she became professor of history and economics. That same year, she turned down the offer of a position as dean of women at the University of Michigan, stating that she preferred to remain at Wellesley and continue teaching. She was acting dean of Wellesley College from 1899 to 1900; during that period she established a new department of economics and sociology, becoming its head in 1900. She retired from full-time teaching at Wellesley in 1913, becoming professor emeritus. About the farewell dinner held in her honor, the \"New York Times\" wrote: \"Miss Coman has been so closely associated with the history and development of Wellesley for so long a time that her loss is felt very deeply by the whole college.\" Coman continued to research and write until her death in 1915.\n\nShe developed and taught new courses in economics, history, and rhetoric at Wellesley, including Statistical Study of Economic Problems, Industrial History of the United States, and Conservation of Our Natural Resources, all framed by sociological insights related to social justice. Coman was the first American woman to teach statistics. Wellesley was the only American women's college to offer statistics courses before 1900.\n\nAccording to historian Melinda Ponder, Coman was a popular teacher. Two of her students, Helen Frances Page Bates and Helen Laura Sumner Woodbury, were among the first American women to earn PhDs in economics. Woodbury is recognized as an important historian of labor and a noted economist, while Helen Bates became a noted social worker.\n\nComan's papers are held by the Wellesley College Archives. In 1921, Wellesley College established the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History to honor her service to the College.\n\nComan and Elizabeth Kendall coauthored the 1902 book \"A Short History of England for School Use\" based on research that Coman had conducted in England between the years 1886 and 1894. Coman published \"The Industrial History of the United States\" in 1910. Considered the first industrial history of the United States, the book was reprinted nine times before 1915. Her 1911 article, \"Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,\" was the first article published in the newly formed journal\"American Economic Review.\"\n\nHer 1912 work \"Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi\" was considered by contemporaneous scholars to be Coman's \"magnum opus,\" and \"one of the most important fruits of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\" The book outlined the economic history of the American West. In this work, Coman describes the historical economic processes that led to the Far West coming under the control of settlers. She found that settlers were more economically successful than explorers, traders, trappers, and indigenous peoples because the settlers built permanent settlements, reproduced at a higher rate, and established networks of collaboration.\n\nSettlement movement activist Jane Addams, a close friend, urged Coman to research social insurance programs in Europe in order to establish similar programs in the United States. Coman studied social insurance in England, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden, but poor health prevented her from continuing her research. Her manuscript, \"Unemployment Insurance: A Summary of European Systems\" was published after her death in 1915.\n\nComan was passionate about social and economic issues, especially women's education, poverty, immigration, and labor. Throughout her life, she was active in social reform movements, especially the labor movement and the settlement movement. She served as the president of the electoral board and chair of the standing committee of the National College Settlements Association in 1900. Coman organized a group of immigrant women who worked in Boston sweatshops, naming the group an \"Evening Club for Tailoresses,\" and attempted to found a tailor shop that could have been an alternative to sweatshops. She assisted in organizing the 1910 Chicago garment workers' strike, which involved 40,000 factory workers. Coman also worked with the Women's Trade Union League. Working with her economist and sociologist friend Emily Greene Balch and other women, Coman co-founded Denison House, a college women's settlement house located in Boston in 1892, serving as its first chair. Denison House provided a center for Boston's labor activists, and is thought to be the first settlement house on the East Coast.\n\nFor 25 years, Coman lived in a \"Boston marriage\" with Wellesley professor and poet Katharine Lee Bates, the author of \"America the Beautiful\". Such partnerships were so common among Wellesley faculty that they were called \"Wellesley marriages\". Coman and Bates shared a house they named \"the Scarab\" with Bates' mother, Cornelia, and her sister, Jeannie. The women reportedly enjoyed life together as family. Coman frequently traveled for her research on economic history; she visited Europe, the American West, Scandinavia, and Egypt. Bates accompanied her on many of these trips. Some scholars believe the two women were a lesbian couple.\n\nComan first discovered a lump in her left breast in the fall of 1911 and underwent two surgeries in the following months. At the time, medical doctors did not understand the nature of breast cancer, its causes or its treatments, so the prognosis for Coman was poor. Coman died at home in January 1915 at the age of 58. She died in a room the family had named Bohemia, as it looked out over the trees and gardens below. At the time of her death, Coman was working on an industrial history of New England.\n\nDuring Coman's illness, Coman and Bates' women friends—many of them also in Wellesley marriages—took Coman out for walks and visits, and invited her to stay at their country homes. They prepared meals for Coman and Bates, brought flowers and fresh vegetables, and performed tasks and services to keep Coman's spirits up.\n\nBates chronicled Coman's illness in her diary, noting hospital visits, surgical procedures, and details about Coman's pain and suffering. According to cancer historian Ellen Leopold, in the days after Coman's death, Bates wrote a memorial to Coman that was designed to be circulated privately among the women's close friends and family. Leopold believes that the book, \"For Katharine Coman's Family and Innermost Circle of Friends,\" is the first breast cancer narrative in American literature. Near the end of Coman's life, the two women exchanged loving farewells through reciting poems and psalms to each other. Several years after Coman's death, Bates continued to mourn and to recall Coman's suffering. In 1922, she published a book of poems about Coman's illness in the book \"Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance\". The book's title emerged from the fact that the \"two Katharines,\" as the women were known, would send each other sprigs of yellow clover as tokens of affection.\n\nA review of Coman's book \"Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi\" (1912) in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" stated that \"the author is one of those new women who have shown what may be accomplished in the way of research by method and industry and a great deal of enthusiasm.\" In a 1913 review of her book, economist Thomas Nixon Carver praises Coman's narrative style and lively prose. Also writing in 1913, economist Frederic Paxson criticized the book arguing that there were factual errors and inaccurate citations, and that the data for the book were already widely available in university research libraries. Paxson does credit Coman with having prepared an extensive bibliography and for providing extensive notes for the book. This two-volume book, is today hailed as a classic and was reprinted twice; Macmillan in 1925, and Kelly in 1969.\n\nIn 2011, the \"American Economic Review\" commemorated its first hundred years by publishing a list of the top twenty articles in the journal's history. Coman's 1911 article \"Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,\" published in 1911, was the first article published by the journal and was reprinted in the 2011 issue. The article analyzed water rights, access, and availability. Also in this issue of the \"American Economic Review,\" economist Gary D. Libecap noted that Coman's work continues to be relevant today, particularly for scholars interested in the economics of climate change. Elinor Ostrom, an American political economist, believes that Coman's article continues to provide \"insight into the problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American West.\"\n\nGerald F. Vaughn, a contemporary economist writing in 2004, proposes that Coman was America's first female institutional economist. Vaughn notes other important facts about Coman that frame her as a pioneer for women academics, including the fact that at the time, the discipline and profession of economics was dominated by men. She was the only woman among the group of economists who founded the American Economic Association in 1885 and she was the first American woman to become a statistics professor. Vaughn notes that her contributions to economics and social history went beyond being the \"first woman,\" and included being the author of the first article to be published in the \"American Economic Review\" in 1911, and the writer of the first industrial history of the US. The University of Michigan \"Naming Project\" notes that she was one of the first historians to use local newspaper articles and government documents as primary sources in her teaching and writing. Vaughn highlights the fact that she traveled and interviewed widely to gather the data for her work.\n\nAccording to Vaughn, Coman's extensive work on the processes of institutional change in the American West made her an influential industrial historian. Her text, \"The Industrial History of the United States\" (1905; revised 1910; republished by Arno Press 1973) was widely used as a textbook for decades.\n\n\n\n"}

Besides her medical practice and outreach, she led many efforts for the American women's suffrage movement through her local clubs and the Kentucky Equal Rights Association.\n\nThe eldest of the eight living children of Bernard and Eleanor Flemming Southgate, Louise Southgate was born February 20, 1857, in Walton, Kentucky. She was educated at Western College in Oxford, Ohio, then graduated with a medical degree from Laura Memorial College in Cincinnati, Ohio. She then spent two years studying in hospitals in New York and Europe, traveling as far as to the Pasteur Institute in France for advanced work. She lived with her younger sister Virginia and never married.\n\nDr. Southgate started practicing medicine at the Presbyterian Hospital in Cincinnati in 1893 and also taught at the Laura Memorial College in 1894. She then left for Europe where she practiced medicine for two years. Returning to the U.S. she took up as a clinician again at the Presbyterian Hospital and to the Laura Memorial College where she taught surgical pathology in 1897. She became a member of the American Medical Association, Cincinnati chapter. In 1910 she purchased her maternal grandmother's ancestral home, (the old Thomas Kennedy Home at 124 Garrard Street) and used it also for her private practice. Later, she also worked at the Booth Memorial Hospital as well as its auxiliary. She wrote scholarly articles, including for the State Medical Journal of Kentucky.\n\nDr. Southgate was part of the growing movement in women's reproductive health and family planning of the time. She spoke on hygiene (\"Care of the Growing Girl\"), birth control and eugenics (\"Sociological Status of Women\"), connecting this with women's rights (e.g., \"Women's Duties in Civil Affairs\") for women's clubs, Mothers' meetings, as well as for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Her work with schools and local clinics helped start the requirements for physical examinations for schoolchildren in Covington.\n\nIn 1905, Dr. Southgate spent some time at the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, eastern Kentucky, where she taught classes and practiced medicine. She was advocating for women's health concerns there long before the more famous Mary Carson Breckinridge of the Frontier Nursing Service or Jean Tachau worked in this area.\n\nHer work with women's clubs and suffrage organizations was extensive. A partial list of her memberships follows:\n\nIn 1910 she spoke at the 21st Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA) state convention in Covington on the \"Sisterhood of Women.\" She offered a resolution at that meeting that the KERA \"extend cordial greetings to the Ky. State Federations of Colored Women's Clubs.\" Dr. Southgate's influence was revealed in that it was also resolved at that convention that KERA formally requested that the State Board of Charitable Institutions appoint a woman physician at the state asylum for the Insane at Hopkinsville and that each local chapter would begin lobbying for establishing a juvenile court if there wasn't one already in that county.\n\nIn 1912 she spoke for suffrage in Cincinnati during the campaign for a suffrage amendment of the Ohio Constitution.\n\nDr. Southgate was an avid Egyptologist and collected many artifacts that decorated her historic home in Covington (now known as the Kennedy-Southgate House).\n\nAfter her sister Virginia died in September 1929, Dr. Southgate retired from medical practice. After a long illness and at 84 years old, she died on August 14, 1941, at the home of her sister Eleanor Green in Walton, Kentucky. She was buried in Linden Grove Cemetery in Covington. The St. Luke Hospitals named their Women's Center after her in 1990; and her legacy was honored by an entry in the Kentucky Women Remembered collection by the Kentucky Commission on Women in 2000.\n\n\n"}

His book \"The Black Riviera\" won the 1991 Poets' Prize. \"Questions for Ecclesiastes\" was a finalist for the 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award in poetry and won the 1998 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets and \"The Nation\" magazine.\"Bone Fires: New and Selected Poems\" won the 2013 Balcones Prize.\n\nMark Jarman was born while his father, Donald R. Jarman, was in seminary in Lexington, Kentucky. His parents, both Californians, moved back to California in 1954 and settled in Santa Maria, where his father served First Christian Church. In 1958, responding to a call from his denomination, Mark's father moved his wife Bo Dee, his son, and daughter Katie, to Scotland to serve a small church in Kirkcaldy, Fife, a linoleum factory town on the Firth of Forth across from Edinburgh. The three years he spent there were formative ones for the poet. The family returned to California in 1961, where his father served South Bay Christian Church in Redondo Beach and his sister Luanne was born. In 1970, Jarman entered the University of California at Santa Cruz and earned a B.A. with highest honors in English literature in 1974. There he met his wife, soprano Amy Kane Jarman and his friend and long-time collaborator, Robert McDowell. While at U.C.S.C., he studied with the poet and editor George Hitchcock (poet) and the short story writer and poet Raymond Carver. In 1974, Jarman entered the Iowa Writers' Workshop and earned an M.F.A. in poetry in 1976. At Iowa he studied with Donald Justice, Charles Wright, Stanley Plumly, and Sandra McPherson. His classmates included poets Chase Twichell, Brenda Hillman, James Galvin, and Rita Dove. In 1976, he was hired to teach creative writing at Indiana State University in Evansville. In 1978, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts allowed him to quit his job and live in Italy where Amy studied singing at the University of Perugia. Returning to California in 1979, he was hired as a visiting writer at the University of California at Irvine. Mark and Amy's oldest daughter was born in Mission Viejo in 1980. That same year, Jarman took a position teaching creative writing at Murray State University in Kentucky. Two years later the couple's second daughter was born in Murray. In 1983, he left Murray State to teach at Vanderbilt University, where he has been since. Amy joined the voice faculty at the Blair School of Music in 1986.

Its main campus sits on on a bluff overlooking Portage Lake. Michigan Tech was founded in 1885 as the first post-secondary institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and was created to train mining engineers to operate the local copper mines. Science, technology, forestry and business have been added to the numerous engineering disciplines, and Michigan Tech now offers more than 130 degree programs through its five colleges and schools.\n\nMichigan Tech's athletic teams are nicknamed the Huskies and compete primarily in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). The men's hockey team competes in Division I as a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), and has won three national championships. The women's basketball team were national runners-up in 2011.\n\nMichigan Tech was founded in 1885 as the Michigan Mining School. After much agitation by Jay Abel Hubbell, the state legislature established the school to train mining engineers. Hubbell donated land for the school's first buildings.\n\nThe school started with four faculty members and twenty-three students. It was housed in the Houghton Fire Hall from 1886 through 1889.\n\nA few years after the school's creation, enrollment grew to such a point that its name no longer reflected its purpose. The name was then changed to the Michigan College of Mines in 1897. This name lasted through World War I until 1925, but by this time the school had begun offering a wider variety of degrees and once again decided to change its name to the Michigan College of Mining and Technology in 1927.\n\nBy 1931 enrollment had reached nearly 600. During the next few years, due to the Great Depression, money was scarce, causing department heads and even the president of the university, William Hotchkiss, to take pay cuts.\n\nGrover C. Dillman was president from 1935 to 1956. During this time, the school underwent many notable changes, including the construction of the Memorial Union Building and purchase of an ice rink and golf course.\n\nAround 1948, enrollment passed 2000 students total.\n\nIn 1956, J. Robert Van Pelt became the new president of the university. He restarted many PhD programs and created a focus on research. This included the school's first analog computation class in 1956–1957.\n\nIn the final years of his presidency, the school changed from a college to a university, changing its name a final time to \"Michigan Technological University\". The change from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology was necessary for two reasons, according to Van Pelt. First, the college had expanded too greatly and the current name was no longer an accurate title. Also, including \"mining\" in the name of the college was misleading. The name \"Michigan Technological University\" was chosen in order to retain the nickname \"Michigan Tech\" that had already been in use since 1927.\n\nAlthough engineering still accounts for some 59 percent of all enrollment as of fall 2010, the university now offers more than 130 degree programs.\n\nAlong with its new name, the school also gained new constitutional status in 1964. This gave responsibility for control of the university to its Board of Control rather than the state legislature.\n\nThe main Michigan Tech campus is located mainly on US 41 in Houghton, Michigan. It is the safest campus in Michigan, and the third safest in the United States, according to \"Reader's Digest\". The main part of campus is relatively small, and can be traversed in about 10 minutes. The offices of the Michigan Tech Fund are located in the Huntington Bank Building in Hancock. The Lakeshore Center in downtown Houghton houses the offices of Human Relations, Vice President for Research and other departments.\n\nFaculty are involved in several distance education programs with clients including General Motors.\n\nThe Portage Lake Golf Course opened for play in April 1902. In 1945 the members could no longer support the needs of the course and sold it to Michigan Tech for one dollar. Since then many improvements have been made such as the addition of another nine holes in 1969. Then in 1984 the new clubhouse was constructed. In 1996 a sprinkler system was installed to modernize the course and keep it playable. The Portage Lake Golf Course is located two miles (3 km) southeast of campus.\n\nMichigan Tech offers more than 130 undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering, natural and physical sciences, computing, business and economics, technology, environmental studies, arts, humanities, and social sciences. The university is divided into five schools and colleges. The average overall ACT scores for incoming students is 27.2 in fall 2017, compared to 21.2 nationally. It currently has the highest tuition of all public universities in Michigan, exceeding both Michigan State and the University of Michigan. The College of Engineering's environmental engineering and mechanical engineering enrollments rank in the top ten nationally and their respective graduate programs are ranked in the top 50 in the US. The electrical engineering department uses an innovative \"DSP First\" curriculum found at only a few leading universities.\n\nMichigan Tech has also developed an alternative program to provide students with engineering and other design experience called the Enterprise program. Enterprises develop engineering skills by allowing students to work in business-like environments on real-world projects while completing their education. Enterprises include Nanotechnology Innovations, Hybrid Transportation, Aerospace, Blue Marble Security, Husky Game Development, Boardsports Technologies, and Wireless Communications Enterprises.\n\nThe student body consists of more than 7,000 graduate and undergraduate students (Fall 2017) and more than 470 academic faculty (Fall 2017). As is historically true of engineering institutions, female enrollment at Michigan Tech is low. The male to female student ratio was 22:1 in 1960; since 1980 it has remained around 3:1. Michigan Tech's admissions office has enlisted female students and faculty to contact every admitted female applicant via telephone or personal letter in an attempt to increase female enrollment. The Fall 2010 freshman class had a ratio of 3.1:1. In the Fall 2012 semester, female enrollment rose for the 6th straight year to reach a then all-time high of 1,837 students (26.1%). Female enrollment for the 2017-2018 academic year is 27.1%.\n\nMichigan Tech students are primarily from Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois. The student body is approximately 75.4% European-American/Non-Hispanic, 14.2% International, 1.6% Hispanic, 1.5% percent African American, 1.0% Asian, 0.6% Native American, 1.0% Multiracial, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and the remaining 4.5% was not supplied. The university has recently focused on achieving a more diverse student body, in terms of ethnicity, gender, and areas of study. A key step in this effort was the recent introduction of several new academic majors, including psychology, biochemistry and molecular biology, cheminformatics, communication and culture studies, pharmaceutical chemistry, exercise science, sound design, audio production, and theater and entertainment technology.\n\nMichigan Tech ranked 172nd of 600 US colleges and universities in research and development expenditures in 2007. Research expenditures exceeded $50 million in 2017.\n\nStudents attending Michigan Technological University have a wide range of activities to participate in, whether or not they are living in the residence halls. In addition to the various small interest groups which form throughout the year, they participate in Greek Life, Student Organizations, and the Enterprise Program; many organize and attend campus traditions, such as K-Day, the Parade of Nations, and the Winter Carnival (which also attracts alumni from across the country); furthermore, there are motivational drives to raise student activity levels and involvement in the school community, typically for those without membership in a student organization.\n\nMichigan Tech currently recognizes more than two hundred student organizations, including:\n\nMichigan Tech is currently host to thirteen fraternities, including three international and three local fraternities. Additionally, there are seven sororities on campus, including three local sororities.\n\nAs the school mascot is the husky (specifically, Blizzard T. Husky), the school's sports teams are known as the \"Huskies\". Michigan Tech competes in the NCAA's Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. The men's hockey team competes in Division I as a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. Michigan Tech owns a downhill ski/snowboard hill, Mont Ripley, just across Portage Lake from campus, and maintains extensive cross-country ski trails (used for mountain biking in summer).\n\nThe men's hockey team competes in Division I as a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), and has won three national championships. The women's basketball team were national runners-up in 2014-2015 season.\n\nMichigan Tech has both an official fight song and an official Alma Mater. At most sporting events, however, both the \"Engineer's Song\" and \"In Heaven There Is No Beer\" are played by the Huskies Pep Band, and many students consider these to be the unofficial school songs. The \"Blue Skirt Waltz\" is played at home ice hockey games and is called the \"Copper Country Anthem.\" During the song, the fans join arms and swing back and forth to the music.\n\n\nThere are over 68,000 Michigan Tech alumni living in all 50 states and over 100 countries. Some notable alumni include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5868124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5868124", "title": "Personalized learning", "text": "Personalized learning\n\nPersonalized learning, individualized instruction, personal learning environment and direct instruction all refer to efforts to tailor education to meet the different needs of students.\n\nThe use of the term \"personalized learning\" dates back to at least the early 1960s, but there is no widespread agreement on the definition and components of a personal learning environment. Even enthusiasts for the concept admit that personal learning is an evolving term and doesn't have any widely accepted definition.\n\nIn 2005, Dan Buckley defined two ends of the personalized learning spectrum: \"personalization for the learner\", in which the teacher tailors the learning, and \"personalization by the learner\", in which the learner develops skills to tailor his own learning. This spectrum was adopted by the (2006) Microsoft's Practical Guide to Envisioning and Transforming Education.\n\nThe United States National Education Technology Plan 2017 defines personalized learning as follows:\nTypically technology is used to try to facilitate personalized learning environments.\n\nAccording to researcher Eduard Pogorskiy:\nProponents of personalized learning say that many elements of curriculum, assessment and instructional design must be present in classrooms for students to succeed and often use software systems to manage and facilitate student-led instruction. Proponents argue that classroom learning activities must build upon students' prior knowledge and teachers need to allocate time for practice. Advocates argue that teachers must continuously assess student learning against clearly defined standards and goals and student input into the assessment process is integral.\n\nAs stated above by the 2017 United States National Education Technology Plan, \"Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized the needs for each learner.\" Conferring is a process in which this can be accomplished. Conferring, as defined by Julie Kallio, is a \"regular, goal-oriented meeting between the teacher and student(s) where they talk about learning progress, process, and/or products.\" Conferring, more simply, is a way to provide more personalized feedback. \n\nLearning, in any context, requires some form of feedback. In schools, this feedback is almost entirely thought of as the teacher providing feedback to the student. The idea of providing feedback to advance student learning is best understood in the framework of the \"zone of proximal development\" or ZPD. Psychologist Lev Vygotski has defined the ZPD as \"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers\". More plainly, a student has a certain level they can achieve by themselves and with support they are able to achieve a higher level of learning. However, there is still some level in which the student is incapable of reaching, no matter what support is provided. For example, a student may be working on double digit addition. Their current knowledge may already provide them with the skills to move on to triple digit addition without any help. If the student is introduced to multiplication, however, they will need help to understand that multiplication is a quicker way to represent the same number being added onto itself a defined number of times. Where this help occurs is the student's ZPD. Even with help though, it is not reasonable to expect the student to learn how to solve a calculus problem. The struggle for teachers is how to provide the right amount of help to each student. If a teacher provides information to the whole class too quickly, some students are left behind trying to figure out the first step. Conversely, if a teacher provides information to the whole class too slowly, some students will finish rapidly and be left with nothing to do. Conferring is a tool that teachers have used to help mitigate that issue.\n\nConferring first gained prominence in the book \"One to one: the art of art of conferring with young writers\" by Lucy Calkins, Amanda Hartman, and Zoe Ryder White. In the work, Calkins and her co-writers describe how effective writing workshops for students included individual writing conferences (conferring), where teachers would sit and talk with their students about their writing. Per the book, \"Conferring can give us the force that makes our mini-lessons and curriculum development and assessment and everything else more powerful. It gives us an endless resource of teaching wisdom, an endless source of accountability, a system of checks and balances. And, it gives us laughter and human connection-the understanding of our children that gives spirit to our teaching.\" Calkins believed that there were three main components to every conferring session: Research, Decide and Teach. Research focused on where the student was in their current writing, decide would help the teacher choose what to teach the student, and teach would use modeling and guiding practice to further advance student learning. In their book \"The Writing Workshop\", Katie Wood Ray and Lester L. Laminack added a fourth component in where after the teaching portion the student and/or the teacher would \"Make a Record\". This modified model can be thought in the terms of: research, decide, teach, record. The benefits of using conferring have been documented in a couple of studies.\n\nUsing a mix method case study approach in observing a group of 4 grade students, Javaye Devette Stubbs posed the question: \"How does the implementation of one-on-one conferring promote higher order thinking skills in students with difficulties in reading?\" The results from her pre and post-test found that \"even those with reading difficulties did show a significant gain in higher order thinking skills\". In a separate study, the educator Antony Smith examined the effectiveness of using teacher-student writing conference for English language learners (ELLs). Observing two students who were ELLs in a second-grade classroom working on a book project, Smith found that the work produced \"looks similar to what is produced by native English speakers\". Smith later suggests that the success of the two students were largely tied to the writing conferences, and goes on to state that writing conferences are the \"heart of the writing process, and with this in mind, the potential of the teacher-student writing conference becomes clear\".\n\nThe information can be summarized into three main takeaways. First, building student knowledge is dependent on the current level of knowledge the student has and what kind of support they are provided. Second, conferring is a model that can provide student support through a structured four-part process. Third, conferring has been shown to increase student learning in both reading and writing.\n\nAndy Hargreaves and Dennis Shirley write that while there are advantages in students being able to access information instantly on-line, one should not mistake such processes for \"something deeper, more challenging, and more connected to compelling issues in their world and their lives\".\n\nAlfie Kohn wrote that while personalized learning may sound like a useful strategy for education, in practice it's mostly just about selling technology products. Personalized learning promises a strategy to specifically adjust education to the unique needs and skills of individual children, he argued, but really it means merely \"adjusting the difficulty level of prefabricated skills-based exercises based on students' test scores... [and] requires the purchase of software from one of those companies that can afford full-page ads in \"Education Week\"\". While \"certain forms of technology can be used to support progressive education\", Kohn wrote, \"...meaningful (and truly personal) learning never \"requires\" technology. Therefore, if an idea like personalization is presented from the start as entailing software or a screen, we ought to be extremely skeptical about who really benefits.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4209079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4209079", "title": "Pit of despair", "text": "Pit of despair\n\nThe Pit of despair was a name used by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow for a device he designed, technically called a vertical chamber apparatus, that he used in experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s. The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. Researcher Stephen Suomi described the device as \"little more than a stainless-steel trough with sides that sloped to a rounded bottom\":\nA  in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop through the drain and out of holes drilled in the stainless-steel. The chamber was equipped with a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top [removed in the accompanying photograph], designed to discourage incarcerated subjects from hanging from the upper part of the chamber.<ref name=\"Suomi1971/33\">Suomi 1971, p. 33.</ref>\nHarlow had already placed newly born monkeys in isolation chambers for up to one year. With the \"Pit of despair\", he placed monkeys between three months and three years old in the chamber alone, after they had bonded with their mothers, for up to ten weeks. Within a few days, they had stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner.\n\nMuch of Harlow's scientific career was spent studying maternal bonding, what he described as the \"nature of love\". These experiments involved rearing newborn \"total isolates\" and monkeys with surrogate mothers, ranging from toweling-covered cones to a machine that modeled abusive mothers by assaulting the baby monkeys with cold air or spikes. The point of the experiments was to pinpoint the basis of the mother-child relationship, namely whether the infant primarily sought food or affection. Harlow concluded it was the latter.\n\nIn 1971, Harlow's wife died of cancer and he began to suffer from depression. He was treated and returned to work but, as Lauren Slater writes, his colleagues noticed a difference in his demeanor. He abandoned his research into maternal attachment and developed an interest in isolation and depression.\n\nHarlow's first experiments involved isolating a monkey in a cage surrounded by steel walls with a small one-way mirror, so the experimenters could look in, but the monkey could not look out. The only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food. Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth; four were left for 30 days, four for six months, and four for a year.\n\nAfter 30 days, the \"total isolates\", as they were called, were found to be \"enormously disturbed\". After being isolated for a year, they barely moved, did not explore or play, and were incapable of having sexual relations. When placed with other monkeys for a daily play session, they were badly bullied. Two of them refused to eat and starved themselves to death.<ref name=\"Blum2002/216\">Blum 2002, p. 216.</ref>\n\nHarlow also wanted to test how isolation would affect parenting skills, but the isolates were unable to mate. Artificial insemination had not then been developed; instead, Harlow devised what he called a \"rape rack\", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. He found that, just as they were incapable of having sexual relations, they were also unable to parent their offspring, either abusing or neglecting them. \"Not even in our most devious dreams could we have designed a surrogate as evil as these real monkey mothers were\", he wrote.<ref name=\"Blum2002/217\">Blum 2002, p. 217.</ref> Having no social experience themselves, they were incapable of appropriate social interaction. One mother held her baby's face to the floor and chewed off his feet and fingers. Another crushed her baby's head. Most of them simply ignored their offspring.\n\nThese experiments showed Harlow what total and partial isolation did to developing monkeys, but he felt he had not captured the essence of depression, which he believed was characterized by feelings of loneliness, helplessness, and a sense of being trapped, or being \"sunk in a well of despair\", he said.\n\nThe technical name for the new depression chamber was \"vertical chamber apparatus\", though Harlow himself insisted on calling it the \"pit of despair\". He had at first wanted to call it the \"dungeon of despair\", and also used terms like \"well of despair\", and \"well of loneliness\". Blum writes that his colleagues tried to persuade him not to use such descriptive terms, that a less visual name would be easier, politically speaking. Gene Sackett of the University of Washington in Seattle, one of Harlow's doctoral students who went on to conduct additional deprivation studies, said, \"He first wanted to call it a dungeon of despair. Can you imagine the reaction to that?\"\n\nMost of the monkeys placed inside it were at least three months old and had already bonded with others. The point of the experiment was to break those bonds in order to create the symptoms of depression. The chamber was a small, metal, inverted pyramid, with slippery sides, slanting down to a point. The monkey was placed in the point. The opening was covered with mesh. The monkeys would spend the first day or two trying to climb up the slippery sides. After a few days, they gave up. Harlow wrote, \"most subjects typically assume a hunched position in a corner of the bottom of the apparatus. One might presume at this point that they find their situation to be hopeless.\"<ref name=\"Blum1994/218\">Blum 1994, p. 218.</ref> Stephen J. Suomi, another of Harlow's doctoral students, placed some monkeys in the chamber in 1970 for his PhD. He wrote that he could find no monkey who had any defense against it. Even the happiest monkeys came out damaged. He concluded that even a happy, normal childhood was no defense against depression.\n\nThe experiments delivered what science writer Deborah Blum has called \"common sense results\", namely, that monkeys, normally very social animals in nature, emerge from isolation badly damaged, and that some recover while others do not.\n\nThe experiments were condemned, both at the time and later, from within the scientific community and elsewhere in academia. In 1974, American literary critic Wayne C. Booth wrote that \"Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties.\" He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.\n\nCharles Snowdon, a junior member of the faculty at the time, who became head of psychology at Wisconsin, said that Harlow had himself been very depressed by his wife's cancer. Snowdon was appalled by the design of the vertical chambers. He asked Suomi why they were using them, and Harlow replied, \"Because that's how it feels when you're depressed.\" Leonard Rosenblum, who studied under Harlow, told Lauren Slater that Harlow enjoyed using shocking terms for his apparatus because \"he always wanted to get a rise out of people\".\n\nAnother of Harlow's students, William Mason, who also conducted deprivation experiments elsewhere, said that Harlow \"kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It's as if he sat down and said, 'I'm only going to be around another ten years. What I'd like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.' If that was his aim, he did a perfect job.\"<ref name=\"Blum1994/96\">Blum 1994, p. 96.</ref>\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25234", "title": "Quadrivium", "text": "Quadrivium\n\nThe quadrivium (plural: quadrivia) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the trivium. The word is Latin, meaning \"four ways\", and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to Boethius or Cassiodorus in the 6th century. Together, the trivium and the quadrivium comprised the seven liberal arts (based on thinking skills), as distinguished from the practical arts (such as medicine and architecture).\n\nThe quadrivium consisted of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. In turn, the quadrivium was considered preparatory work for the study of philosophy (sometimes called the \"liberal art \"par excellence\"\") and theology.\n\nThese four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by Plato in \"The Republic\" and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music). \nThe quadrivium is implicit in early Pythagorean writings and in the \"De nuptiis\" of Martianus Capella, although the term \"quadrivium\" was not used until Boethius, early in the sixth century. As Proclus wrote:\nThe Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold. A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion. Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.\nAt many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of Master of Arts (after the BA). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the B.Phil and B.Litt. degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).\n\nThe study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by Proclus (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand and geometry and cosmology on the other.\n\nThe subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of harmonics, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a monochord. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.\n\nIn modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of number and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in space, music was number in time, and astronomy was number in space and time. Morris Kline classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.\n\nThis schema is sometimes referred to as \"classical education\", but it is more accurately a development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the Classical education movement and at the independent Oundle School, in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

{"id": "24692410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24692410", "title": "Stavanger Museum", "text": "Stavanger Museum\n\nStavanger Museum is a museum of natural and cultural history established in 1877, located in the Norwegian city Stavanger. The museum's collections consist of several departments: the department of zoology, the department for cultural history (which also includes custodianship of the royal residence Ledaal).\n\nDepartments include the Stavanger Museum of Natural History, Stavanger Maritime Museum, Norwegian Children's Museum, Norwegian Printing Museum, Stavanger School Museum, Stavanger Art Museum, and Norwegian Canning Museum.\n\nStavanger Museum was founded in 1877, and was first located in a small wooden house in Gamle Stavanger. The museum got its own building, Muségata 3, in 1893, designed by architect Hartvig Sverdrup Eckhoff. The building was extended in 1930, and again in 1964. A major restoration and technical upgrade was performed in 1995.\n\nLedaal, the summer house of the Kielland family built by Gabriel Schanche Kielland, was bought by Stavanger Museum in 1936, and opened as a royal residence in 1949. The royal residence Ledaal dates from around 1800. Breidablikk villa is a well-preserved mansion which was built in 1881-1882 for the merchant and ship owner Lars Berentsen (1838-1896) . The villa was designed by architect Henrik Nissen. Breidablikk villa is situated on Eiganes in Stavanger.\n\nThe archeological department was split out in 1975, as the new institution \"Arkeologisk museum i Stavanger\". The Maritime Museum was included in 1979. The Graphical museum was established in 1991, and included in Stavanger Museum in 2006. The Children's Museum was established in 2000, and incorporated as a department of Stavanger Museum in 2007. The school museum was established in 1925, and incorporated into Stavanger Museum in 2008. \nThe department also incorporates \"Den Kombinerede Indretning\", a collection of local medical history established in 1989, and a part of Stavanger Museum from 2006.\n\nStavanger Museum of Natural History (\"Stavanger naturhistoriske museum\") was formerly the Department of Zoology at the Stavanger Museum. The department of zoology was central to the establishing of the museum in 1877, assigned the task of collecting local fauna, and also \"exotic\" mammals and birds donated by sailors and travelers. From 1918 the museum specialized in ornithological research. Revtangen Ornithological Station is located in an area known for its rich and varied bird life. Stavanger Museum has a station here where migratory birds are tagged or ringed each year. The ornithological station for bird ringing was established in 1937 and is operated by the museum.\n\nThe Maritime Museum was established in 1926 and included as a department of Stavanger Museum from 1979. Until 1984 the exhibitions were at Stavanger Museum's main building in Muségata 16, and were moved to historical locations at the port of Stavanger (Nedre Strandgate 17 and 19) in 1985. The buildings are from the period 1770 to 1840. The exhibition displays the development of the shipping and fishing industry over the last 200 years. The museum owns and operates two older sailboats, \"Anna af Sand\" from 1848 and \"Wyvern\" from 1896.\nNorwegian Children's Museum (\"Norsk Barnemuseum\") began as a private foundation and opened doors to the public 24 November 2001. The museum is located in the Stavanger Cultural Centre on Arneageren.\n\nNorwegian Printing Museum (\"Norsk Grafisk Museum\") was established in 1991. Stavanger has always been a center of gravity in the Norwegian printing industry. The museum is located on Bjergsted in Stavanger, and is housed in an old canning stock dating from 1913. The premises are renovated and restored to original condition. Norwegian Printing Museum was officially opened on 23 October 1993.\n\nStavanger School Museum (\"Stavanger skolemuseum\") was formerly the Vestlandske Skolemuseum. The museum school is located in a schoolhouse from the 1920s in Hillevåg. The museum which opened in 1925, covers the history of the school in Rogaland. There is a curriculum with role play and dressing up in the school's historic environment.\n\nStavanger Art Museum (\"Stavanger kunstmuseum\") was formerly the Rogaland Museum of Fine Arts. The museum is located on the west side of the lake at Tjensvoll in Stavanger. Stavanger Art Museum opened in 1991. The museum has an extensive collection of more than two thousand works by Norwegian and international art from the 1800s to the present day. Works by Lars Hertervig constitutes a center of gravity, with more than 70 watercolors and oil paintings. Other Norwegian artists from 1800 - and 1900's are represented Kitty Kielland, Edvard Munch, Christian Krogh, Eilif Petersen, Knut Baade, Olaf Lange, Carl Sundt-Hansen and Harriet Backer.\n\nThe Norwegian Canning Museum (\"Norsk Hermetikkmuseum\") was established in 1975, and is located in a preserved cannery in Gamle Stavanger, Øvre Strandgate 88 and 90. The oldest parts of the building are from 1841; canning production here lasted from 1916 to mid-1950s. The exhibitions show machinery, tools, photographs, labels and commercials from the canning industry.\n\n"}
{"id": "6790464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6790464", "title": "Student teaching", "text": "Student teaching\n\nStudent teaching is a college-supervised instructional experience; usually the culminating course in a university or college undergraduate education or graduate school program leading to teacher education and certification. Examples of programs include Early Childhood (Birth-Grade 3), Middle Childhood (Grades 4-9), and Adolescence to Young Adult (Grades 7-12). It is required by those earning either a Bachelor of Education or Master of Education degree, as well as liberal arts Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degrees with a major in education.\n\nStudent teaching is required for students who are not yet certified to teach. It is different from a practicum, which is required when a student \"already\" holds certification to teach, yet wants a certificate extension to teach another area of specialization; they are both college-supervised field-based experiences.\n\nThe student teaching experience lasts about the length of a semester or quarter; long enough to fulfill the college’s assigned tasks. It is an unpaid internship. This experience gives the prospective teaching professional an opportunity to teach under the supervision of a permanently certified master teacher (see schoolmaster).\n\nThe student teacher is usually placed in a neighboring or participating school. The student teacher is monitored by the cooperating teacher from the school, as well as a supervisor through the college. The supervisor acts as a liaison between the cooperating teacher and the head of the college’s student teaching department.\n\nThe student teacher normally shadows the cooperating teacher for about one week, eventually gaining more responsibility in teaching the class as the days and weeks progress. Eventually, the student teacher will assume most of the teaching responsibilities for the class including class management, lesson planning, assessment, and grading. Thus, the student teacher is able to more fully experience the role of the teacher as the classroom teacher takes on the observation role in the class. There is sometimes a \"phasing out\" week when the student teacher returns the teaching role back to the regular teacher.\n\nThe supervisor, as well as cooperating teacher, monitor the progress of the student teacher throughout the experience, ensuring \"satisfactory\" work. A grade of \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in student teaching, as well as satisfactory completion of a school's education program, is an indication as to whether the college recommends the student for certification to teach.\n\nStudent teaching has been used as a challenge to foreign language learners to facilitate the integration of their language skills by placing them at the center of classroom activities.\n\nStudent teaching philosophy has proven to be a decisive between the newer cohort of teachers, and older educators. Trained under differing teaching philosophies, both groups have a difference of opinion on instructional methodology. The two most prevalent teaching philosophies in America are called Modern teaching philosophy and Traditional teaching philosophy respectively. The former relies on inquiry-based instruction, while the later relies heavily on lecture-based teaching. The differing of philosophies is being seen at every rung of the educational ladder, from Pre-K to Collegiate instruction.\n\nIn describing the difference between the two methodologies, one can note characteristics that define them. In traditional teaching methods, there is a high emphasis on attending lectures, reading texts, and solving problems. In modern teaching approaches, there is a high premium put on developing one's unique knowledge through the pursuit of the scientific method, using such didactic methods as observation and hypothesis.\n\nAnother hallmark of the modern teaching approach is the incorporation of technology, a highly useful skill that is required of most who intend on entering the job market in future years.\n\nExamples of technological inclusion within the classroom has become supported in many counties through the United States. Most schools are equipped with smart boards and include roaming laptop carts that allow all students, regardless of financial ability, gain experience with the technology that will make them successful in the next steps of their lives.\n"}

The college was founded in 1846 and incorporated by royal charter as The College of Preceptors in 1849. A supplemental charter was granted in 1998 changing the College's name to The College of Teachers. A further supplemental charter granted in 2017 changed the college's name to The Chartered College of Teaching, updated its objects and gave it the right to award the professional status of Chartered Teacher (CTeach). The college's Patron is HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe college was founded in 1846 by a group of private schoolmasters from Brighton who were concerned about standards within their profession. A provisional committee was set up in early 1846 under the chairmanship of Henry Stein Turrell (1815–1863), principal of the Montpelier House School in Brighton. After meetings in London and Brighton a general meeting was called for 20 June 1846 at the Freemason's Tavern in Great Queen Street. Some 300 schoolmasters attended, some 60 members enrolled and founding resolutions passed, including:\n\nThe college created a system for the formal examination and qualification of secondary school teachers. It was also one of the first bodies to examine and provide certificates for secondary school pupils of both sexes, from all over England and Wales, in a wide variety of subjects. In 1873 it became the first institution to appoint Professors of Education, \n\nDuring the 1870s, the college helped to establish education as a subject worthy of study at university level, resulting in the appointment of Joseph Payne as the first Professor of Education in 1873. The power to appoint Professors of Education is recognised in the college's current royal charter.Frances Buss (1827–1894) and Sir John Adams (1857–1934) were also connected to the College. During the 1950s the college pioneered management training schemes for teachers (at the time these were known as school administration courses).\n\nOn 21 February 1981, the College was granted armorial bearings. Until 2016, the college awarded a range of professional qualifications for teachers aligned to university qualifications up to and including Doctoral Fellowship.\n\nUnder the 1849 Charter, the objects of the college were:\n\n\"'promoting sound learning and of advancing the interests of education more especially among the middle Classes by affording facilities to the Teacher for the acquiring of a sound knowledge of his Profession and by providing for the Periodical Session of a  competent Board of  Examiners to ascertain and give Certificates of the acquirements and fitness for their office of  persons engaged or desiring to be engaged in the Education of Youth particularly in the Private Schools of England and Wales\"'\n\nThe current objects of the college, since 2017, are:\n\n\"'the promotion of sound learning and the improvement and recognition of the art, science and practice of teaching for the public benefit\"'\n\n\nThe Chartered College of Teaching has the following membership designations or post-nominals. These include:\n\n\nFellowship of the college, must be nominated by a peer, and is based on the following criteria:\n\n\nHistoric Affiliates\n\nThis is a closed category of membership, consisting of those members continuing in the grade of membership they previously held in the College of Teachers, whose membership of the College of Teachers dates from before 1st September 2015. \n\n\nThe archives of the college are held in the archives of the Institute of Education, University of London and the full catalogue can be found online here.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "876353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876353", "title": "Theme Hospital", "text": "Theme Hospital\n\nTheme Hospital is a business simulation game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1997 for the PC in which players design and operate a privately owned hospital with the goal of curing patients of fictitious comical ailments. The game is the thematic successor to \"Theme Park\", also produced by Bullfrog, and the second instalment in their \"Theme\" series, and part of their \"Designer Series\". The game is noted for its humour, and contains numerous references to pop culture.\n\nPeter Molyneux and James Leach came up with the idea of creating a \"Theme\" game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on \"Dungeon Keeper\". Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. \"Theme Hospital\" was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as \"CorsixTH\".\n\nThe player is required to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, similar to that of its predecessor, \"Theme Park\". Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).\n\nStarting with an empty hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, handymen and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital at the start of each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available at the start of the game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Training room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including the amount of diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt to cover it up by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.\n\nAlthough the player has no direct control over the patients, they have some influence over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining what to do with them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.\n\nThe player competes against computer rivals named after famous computers, real and fictional: these include Holly from \"Red Dwarf\" and Deep Thought from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". The game is timed with days of the year, and at the end of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and may be given trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.\n\nEach level has set goals in the fields of financial attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.\n\nA patch was released that fixed bugs and added support for Serial Cable, Modem, and IPX/SPX network gaming (with up to four players) in the Windows version, and a difficulty setting. In multiplayer, each player has a colour, which patients will wear to distinguish from those of other players. \"Litter Bombs\" are featured, allowing players to spread litter around other players' hospitals, while staff members can be persuaded to work for other players, and there are \"Mini Missions\", with instructions for players to perform. Players are also able to chat with each other during a game.\n\n\"Theme Hospital\" took over two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and journalist James Leach, who explored the possibility of other \"Theme\" games while discussing \"Theme Park\". Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected \"Theme Hospital\" from a list of possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Frimley Park Hospital for research and inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on \"Theme Hospital\": he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in \"Theme Park\". He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on \"Dungeon Keeper\", which he was eager to do. Initially, \"Theme Hospital\" was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are \"colourful\" compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was hard to tell what each machine does.\n\nIt was during a hospital visit (after witnessing an operation that they were ordered out of because they were distracting the surgeon) that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death \"quite sad\" and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them \"creative freedom\", which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on \"Dungeon Keeper\".\n\nThe graphic design was decided to be modelled from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He said they did not have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.\n\nThe game deviates from the NHS model; Webley and Carr decided that players should think of the hospital as a business, with profit highly important. The team, who worked in offices near the Royal Surrey County Hospital, drew some inspirations from \"Theme Park\" and borrowed a great deal of code. Webley explained that this was an \"obvious starting point\" as he had been a programmer on \"Theme Park\", and that the systems had been rewritten by the time \"Theme Hospital\" was complete. A program which facilitated animation was built upon by Webley, who dubbed it the Complex Engine. There were not many meetings, and Webley took the team to the pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform. Webley explained that the way the team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not get done, effectively giving members ownership of their parts of the game. It was during one such meeting that the team realised the game was complete. The disease called King Complex was to be called Elvis Impersonator, but Elvis's estate owned the rights. Bloaty Head was based on an allergic reaction Molyneux had, when his face became an \"alarming size\".\n\nAccording to Leach, the volume of work was small. A big problem was that the team had too many ideas, and insufficient time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern. The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval zone, and progress to more modern ones. By May 1996, the idea of the other time periods had been deemed \"prohibitive\" due to the amount of graphics required. Carr later stated that the game did not need the other eras, and that the team was small enough to make things up as they went along. Carr was also afraid that if they had produced a design document, Electronic Arts would have considered the omission of the other eras feature cutting. An idea that Molyneux pushed Webley's team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases. Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.\n\n\"Theme Hospital\" was released in March 1997 (although it was previously due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's \"Designer Series\". The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and \"The Daily Telegraph\", who published an article criticising the game as \"sick\" and said that the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game to make light of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. \"Theme Hospital\" was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described \"Theme Hospital\" as \"a great game that I and many people remember\".\n\nOriginal releases' cover art used a green cross on a white background, which Bullfrog did not have the right to use. The artwork was mistakenly approved because it was faxed in black and white, and had to be recalled. Later releases changed the cross to a star. Despite its rejection, the cross version is available in more recent formats.\n\nThe music and sound effects were produced by Russell Shaw and Adrian Moore. Moore used Sound Forge to develop the sound effects. Some (such as the snooker balls) were taken directly from its library, and others (including the treatment machines) were created by mixing sounds together. Some machine sounds were created by mixing the sounds of electric egg mixer with that of a hydraulic lifter. The farting sounds were recorded when Moore was working with bands including T'Pau, Prefab Sprout, and Seal at a recording studio: he did so as a joke, but they were useful for \"Theme Hospital\".\n\nA PlayStation port of \"Theme Hospital\" was developed by Krisalis Software and released by Electronic Arts in 1998. The PlayStation version was released as a download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable from PlayStation Store in Europe on 31 January 2008, in North America on 31 August 2010, and in Japan on 28 October 2009. This version is no longer available for purchase in Europe since September 2014, after becoming free for a short period of time. A Sega Saturn version (titled \"Sim Hospital\" as of October 1995) was in development and due for release in mid-1996, but was cancelled.\n\nIn 2012, \"Theme Hospital\" was re-released on the digital distribution service GOG.com. In January 2015, Origin distributed \"Theme Hospital\" free for a limited time through their \"On the House\" programme. It was distributed a second time through the \"On the House\" programme in September 2015, as a temporary replacement to \"\" due to an excessive number of requests for the latter. It was released a third time in selected countries from 7 March 2017 until 17 May 2017 as a replacement for \"Syberia 2\".\n\nAn open-source remake, \"CorsixTH\", improves the game with features such as higher screen resolutions and a level editor. \"CorsixTH\" is available under the MIT Licence, and in 2012, a version was released on Android, available on the Google Play Store.\n\n\"Theme Hospital\" received positive reviews. Critics noted the strong gameplay, detailed graphics, satisfying comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, the artificial intelligence, and the user interface.\n\nThe British magazine \"PC Gamer\" Steve Owen praised the game's challenge and \"cute\" graphics, but criticised the interface. Frederick Claude of \"Coming Soon Magazine\" also complimented the graphics as \"highly detailed\", and the \"very simple\" user interface, although he criticised the repetitiveness and lack of multiplayer support that would later be introduced with a patch. GameSpot Trent Ward agreed about the graphics too, lauding them as \"fantastic\", and also complimented the \"realistic\" voice acting performance, and the humour, although he criticised the artificial intelligence as \"flawed\". His conclusion was that the game \"just doesn't fly\". Bonnie James of The Electric Playground also liked the graphics, as well as the \"lovely\" opening sequence, but found the music \"horrible\". \"Computer and Video Games\" Alex Huhtala concurred about the graphics, describing them as \"large and colourful\", but commented that the humour wears off after a while, although he felt it is good to begin with.\n\nAnother reviewer who liked the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of \"Computer Gaming World\", who also praised the humour, especially the \"wackiness\" of the illnesses, and described the game as \"delightful and absorbing\". The humour was also approved by a reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com, who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful. \"Next Generation\" reviewer echoed others' views about the humour, describing it as something they had come to except from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support. The humour was again praised by a reviewer of \"PC Power\", who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have \"hilarious\" cures. The \"thoroughly engrossing\" gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a \"cheerful look\". \"Theme Hospital\" was described as a \"fantastic title\". Other comments from critics included \"Edge\" reviewer's compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player's resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre, and \"PC Zone\" reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked that it gets players \"helplessly immersed\", and the game was awarded the \"PC Zone\" Classic accolade. Éric Ernaux of \"\" said the quality is \"remarkable for a game of its genre\".\n\nThe PlayStation version's main problem, as noted by critics, was the controls. It was cited by reviewers from GameSpot, IGN, Eurogamer, and \"Edge\" as a major downside. Its reception was not entirely negative: James Mielke of GameSpot also commended the addictiveness, and described the port as \"almost completely intact\". IGN agreed with others about the humour, by praising it as \"wonderfully sick\". It was further commented that the game's \"brilliance\" made it a \"must-have\". The sentiments about the controls and humour were echoed by Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, who reviewed it on the PlayStation Network. Absolute PlayStation's reviewers had a mixed view about the graphics: they criticised the resolution and colour palette, but complimented the sprites.

Moon's German-style board game of the same name, developed by Next Level Games and published by Playful Entertainment, Inc. The title was released on June 25, 2008. In February 2017 Days of wonder abandoned Linux support.\n\nGameplay is identical to the board game: there are two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo (e.g., black represents coal cars), and destination cards which feature two city destinations (e.g., Chicago to Miami). Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them. They are also dealt six train cards.\n\nPlayers may draw train cards, a new destination card, or claim a colored route on their turn. To claim a route, a player must pay with a combination of same-colored cards including locomotives which serve as wild cards. Once a route is claimed, no other player may claim it; some routes feature double routes which allow up to two players to claim it, but only if four or five players are playing. In two or three-player games, the double routes can only be claimed by one person. The players immediately earn points for each successful route they claim. At the end of the game, players earn the points listed on the destination card. If a player decides to pick a new destination card, he draws three cards and may choose any of the cards; however, the player \"must\" pick at least one destination.\n\nThe game ends when at least one of the players has expended their trains. Players are given bonuses for completed destinations, and penalized for unrealized destinations. The player with the longest contiguous route earns an additional bonus.\n\n\"Ticket to Ride\" supports play with up to five people on Xbox Live or four people on the same console, and supports the Xbox Live Vision cam.\n\nIt also supports Steam.\n\nThe Europe map was released for download on August 1, 2008 for Xbox Live Arcade and on May 24, 2012 on PC and Mac. The Europe map includes two new types of route in addition to a new map: 'Ferry' routes, which require 'Locomotive' cards to be played when claiming them, and 'Tunnel' routes, which add an element of risk and chance to the game.\n\nThe 1910 USA map was released on September 17, 2008 on Xbox Live Arcade and on May 24, 2012 for PC and Mac.

A portfolio of the applicant's achievements and work experience is presented to a committee at the educational institution. The committee will then decide if the documents presented in the portfolio show work that merits partial credit towards a particular degree.\n\nA French law, passed August 23, 1985, authorized people with work experience to ask for a Diploma equivalence. This was mostly for vocational degrees. A significant change came with the \"Loi de Modernisation Sociale\" (Law of Social Modernization) dated January 17, 2002, that specifically authorizes universities and other \"établissements d'Enseignemernt supérieurs\" (higher education institutions) to grant the standard degrees (\"BTS, DEUG, Licence, Maîtrise, DES, DESS, Master, Mastaire, Doctorat, etc.\") based only on the work experience of the candidate. The required minimum of work experience was also lowered from five to three years.\n\nThe VAE is now included in the French Code of Education (code l' Education de la République Française) at Part legislative, Third part, Book VI, Title Ier, Chapter III, Section 2, Art. L613-3 to L613-6.\n\nIt is important to note that (Art L- 613-4) states: \"The validation produces the same effects as the knowledge or aptitude testing process that it replaces.\" The degrees and diplomas obtained through the VAE process are exactly the same and any mention of the VAE is prohibited in order to fight possible unlawful discrimination.\n\nThe VAE decision is done on file after interview (electronic or physical) by a VAE Jury made of professors belonging to the university.\n\nAt first, French professors and universities were reluctant to apply the VAE or were extremely difficult for the equivalences. However the VAE is the law and all universities must apply it if asked. In 2005 21,379 applied for the VAE, 61% of them women. 59% received a full degree. Among those, 10% received a degree equivalent or superior to the bachelor degree.\n\nMore than 1250 bachelor's or higher degrees were granted through the VAE in 2005 in France (+50%).\n\nIn France the VAE is, according to the government website, in full expansion and universally accepted.\nInternationally, the countries that ratified the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region recognize it.\n\nIn the US, credentials evaluators, universities, federal and state governments also recognize the VAE degrees with the notable exception of the state of Oregon.\n\nThe VAE works like the European Erasmus Programme and the Bologna declaration on harmonization of European degrees that allows international students to attend French universities. In 2004 The Sorbonne started VAE in foreign languages ( English, Spanish & Italian) and was followed by several other universities.

{"id": "14474772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14474772", "title": "Worked-example effect", "text": "Worked-example effect\n\nThe worked-example effect is a learning effect predicted by cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988). Specifically, it refers to the learning effect observed when worked-examples are used as part of instruction, compared to other instructional techniques such as problem-solving (Renkl, 2005) and discovery learning (Mayer, 2004). According to Sweller: \"The worked example effect is the best known and most widely studied of the cognitive load effects\" (Sweller, 2006, p. 165).\n\nWorked-examples improve learning by reducing cognitive load during skill acquisition, and \"is one of the earliest and probably the best known cognitive load reducing technique\" (Paas et al., 2003). In particular, worked-examples provide instructions to reduce intrinsic cognitive load for the learner initially when few schemas are available. Extraneous load is reduced by scaffolding of worked-examples at the beginning of skill acquisition. Finally, worked-examples can increase germane load when prompts for self-explanations are used (Paas et al., 2003).\n\nRenkl (2005) suggests that worked-examples are best used in \"sequences of faded examples for certain problem types in order to foster understanding in skill acquisition,\" and that prompts, help system, and/or training be used to facilitate the learners' self-explanations. This view is supported by experimental findings comparing a faded worked-example procedure and a well-supported problem solving approach (Schwonke et al., 2009).\n\n\"However, it is important to note that studying [worked-examples] loses its effectiveness with increasing expertise\" (Renkl, 2005), an effect known as the expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga, 2007). Further limitations of the classical worked-example method include \"focusing on one single correct solution and on algorithmic skill domains\" (Renkl, 2005). Addressing such restrictions in multimedia learning environments remains an area of active research (Renkl, 2005).\n\n\"A worked example is a step-by-step demonstration of how to perform a task or how to solve a problem\" (Clark, Nguyen, Sweller, 2006, p. 190). Worked-examples are designed to support initial acquisition of cognitive skills through introducing a formulated problem, solution steps and the final solution (Renkl, 2005). Studying worked-examples is an effective instructional strategy to teach complex problem-solving skills (van Merriënboer, 1997). This is because example-based instruction provides expert mental models, to explain the steps of a solution for novices.\n\nWorked examples, like the example above, are commonly found in mathematics or geometry textbooks, but they are also used in other fields. Worked-examples had been developed for music, chess, athletics, and computer programming (Atkinson, Derry, Renkl, & Wortham, 2000).\n\n\"In order to facilitate the transition from learning from worked examples in earlier stages of skill acquisition to problem solving in later stages, it is effective to successively fade out worked solution steps\" (Renkl et al., 2004). Fading out steps in worked-example triggers self-explanation activities, which consists of the learners' own explanations to the reasons for the given solution steps (Renkl et al., 2004).\n\nAs learners gain expertise in the subject area of interest, worked-examples lose their effectiveness due to the expertise reversal effect. Using fade worked-examples addresses this effect by structuring the learners' transition from studying worked-example to learning with problem-solving. (Salden et al., 2008)\n\nAccording to Renkl (2005), self-explanations are \"explanations provided by learners and mainly directed to themselves. They contain information that is not directly given in the learning materials and that refer to solution steps and the reasons for them. They can also refer to structural and surface features of problems or problem types.\"\n\n\"Self-explanations are important and necessary\" (Chi et al., 1989) when working with worked-example as \"successful learners studied the examples for longer periods and explained them more actively to themselves\" (Chi et al., 1989). However, as most learners are passive and superficial self-explainers (Renkl, 1997), they \"should be guided to actively self-explain worked-out examples\" (Renkl, 2005).\n\nThe worked-example effect suggests that learning by studying worked examples is more effective than problem solving, and a number of research studies have demonstrated this effect. \n\nSweller and Cooper were not the first to use this form of instruction, but certainly they were the first to describe it from a cognitive load perspective (Sweller & Cooper, 1985; Cooper & Sweller, 1987; Sweller, 1988). While studying problem-solving tactics, Sweller and Cooper used worked examples as a substitute for conventional problem-solving for those learning algebra. They found that learners who studied worked examples, performed significantly better than learners who actively solved problems (Sweller & Cooper, 1985; Cooper & Sweller, 1987). Sweller and Cooper (1985) had developed worked examples as a means of limiting problem solving search. It is important to note, that Sweller & Cooper (1985) used worked-out example-problem pairs as opposed to individual worked examples.\nRenkl (2005) suggests learning from worked-out examples is more effective when a series is used. Pillay (1994) found that worked examples showing 3 intermediate problem stages were more effective than showing only one but suggested that the distance between stages needs to be small enough to allow students to connect them without having to create their own linkages.\n\nSchwonke et al. (2009), in two experiments with Cognitive Tutors investigated the worked example effect. In one experiment, students used Geometry Cognitive Tutor which differed by the presentation of worked examples or not. In the experiment, students that were presented with worked examples needed less learning time to obtain the procedural skill and conceptual understanding of Geometry. In the second experiment, the authors aimed at avoiding the negative effects that occurred due to the lack of understanding of the purpose of worked examples, replicate the positive effects obtained in the first experiment and investigate the underlying learning approaches that explain why worked examples had greater efficiency effects. To achieve these objectives, the students were asked to think aloud, using the think aloud protocol. The results showed that the efficiency effect obtained in the first experiment was also replicated in the second experiment and the students had a deeper conceptual understanding (Schwonke et al., 2009).\n\nGog, Kester and Paas (2011) investigated the effectiveness of three strategies of example-based learning to problem solving on novices' cognitive load and learning; using electrical circuits troubleshooting tasks. The three strategies used are: worked example only, example-problem pairs and problem-example pairs. The results of the study showed that students in the worked example only and example-problems pair's conditions significantly outperformed students in the problem-example pair and problems solving conditions. It was also observed that higher performance was reached with significantly lower investment of mental efforts during the training (Gog, Kester and Paas, 2011).\n\nAlthough a number of research studies have shown that worked-examples have positive effects on learners, Kalyuga et al. (2000, 2001a, b) showed that the worked-example effect is related to the expertise level of a learner, referred to as expertise reversal effect. In three studies, (Kalyuga et al. 2000, 2001a, b) used worked examples in different experiments, on-screen diagrams in mechanical engineering, examples with explanatory based instruction on writing circuits for relay circuits and programming logic. In the different studies, (Kalyuga et al. 2000, 2001a, b) showed that the efficiency effect of worked examples became ineffective and often resulted in negative effects for more knowledgeable learners (Kalyuga, 2007).\nHowever, Nievelstein et al. (2013) argues that both the worked-example effect and the expertise reversal effect that have been previously studied were based on well-structured cognitive tasks such as mechanics (Kalyuga et al. 2000). In a study using less-structured task, using legal cases, Nievelstein et al. (2013) investigates worked example effect and expertise reversal effects on both novice and advanced law students. The results of the study indicate that worked examples had efficiency effect for both the novice students and advanced law students, even though the advanced students had significantly more prior knowledge.\n\nAnother issue regarding worked examples was observed by Quilici & Mayer (1996), who found that providing learners with three examples of each problem type, as opposed to one, did not result in any differences in students' ability to sort subsequent problems into the appropriate types. As Wise & O'Neill, pointed out, this is not to say additional guidance will never lead to learning gains; we just cannot assume it always will.\n\nThere is also some debate as to how complete the worked example needs to be. Paas (1992) found that learners in a \"completion\" condition, who were given a problem only halfway worked out, performed just as well on test problems as those given the problems fully worked.\n\nWard and Sweller (1990) suggested that under some conditions \"worked examples are no more effective, and possibly less effective, than solving problems\" (p. 1). Thus it is important that worked examples be structured effectively, so that extraneous cognitive load does not impact learners. Chandler and Sweller (1992) suggested an important way to structure worked examples. They found that the integration of text and diagrams (within worked examples) reduces extraneous cognitive load. They referred to this single modality, attention learning effect as the split-attention effect (Chandler and Sweller, 1992). Tabbers, Martens, & Van Merriënboer (2000) proposed that one may prevent split-attention by presenting text as audio.\n\nRenkl (2005) suggests that students only gain deep understanding through worked-out examples when the examples: \n(1) are self-explanatory, \n(2) provide principle-based, minimalist, and example-relation instructional explanations as help\n(3) show relations between different representations\n(4) highlight structural features that are relevant for selecting the correct solution procedure\n(5) isolate meaningful building blocks.\n\nNot all worked examples are print-based as those in the Tarmizi and Sweller study. Lewis (2005) for instance, proposed animated demonstrations are a form of worked example. Animated demonstrations are useful because this multimedia presentation combines the worked example, and modality effects within a single instructional strategy.\n\nAs it turns out, worked examples are not appropriate for all learners. Learners with prior knowledge of the subject find this form of instruction redundant, and may suffer the consequences of this redundancy. This has been described as the expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003). It is suggested that worked examples be faded over time to be replaced with problems for practice (Renkl, Atkinson & Maier, 2000). Thus it is important to consider the learner as well as the media while developing worked examples, else learners may not perform as expected.\n\nSince worked-out examples include the steps toward reaching the solution; they can only be used in skill domains where algorithms can be applied (mathematics, physics, programming, etc.)(Renkl, 2005). For creative pursuits such as interpreting poems, or learning contexts when there is an infinite number of potential confounding factors such as conflict resolution, effective leadership, or multicultural communication, solution steps are more difficult to describe and worked-out examples may not be the most effective instructional method.\nWorked-out example approach is considered one of the best multimedia principles of learning mathematics. Worked examples helps to direct the learner's attention to what needs to be studied as well as developing literacy skills. It serves as a guide to preparing novice learners for effective problem solving after gaining an understanding of any concept under consideration. Renkl (2005) argues that learners have a very restricted understanding of the domain when they try to solve problems without any worked examples. Thus, learners gain deep understanding of a skill domain when they receive worked-out examples in the beginning of cognitive skill acquisition. The examples give learners a clue on the right steps to solving the problem.\n\nA recent research (Rourke, 2006) found that novice learners can still have difficulty understanding concepts if the given examples with incomplete or somewhat inaccurate information (known as faded examples) prior to acquiring basic domain knowledge or literacy skills in the subject matter. This is based on how novice and expert learner structure his or her learning schemas - knowing the appropriate procedure/approach to use in retrieving and interpreting the problem. On the other hand, worked out examples may constitute cognitive load and causing redundancy to learners with prior knowledge (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003), in contrast with novice learners in which worked out examples rather serve as a compass that provides direct guides to solving similar problems (Rourke, 2006). This also apply when novice learners evaluate prototypes, which embody the main characteristics of a work, worked examples. This can also assist the novice learner with the semantic processing needed to fully comprehend a work of art or design (Rourke, 2006).\n\nWorked examples model is one of several strong cognitive-instruction techniques with great importance that help teachers foster learning. It is an application principle that significantly enhances novice learners' patterns of knowledge acquisition in the contexts of authentic problem solving. Reed & Bolstad (1991) indicate that one example may be insufficient for helping a student induce a usable idea and that the incorporation of a second example illustrating the idea, especially one that is more complex than the first, garners significant benefits for transfer performance. So, \"at least add a second example\" appears to be a basic rule for worked-examples instructional design. In addition, Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, & Coulson (1991) affirmed that providing a wide range of examples (and having students emulate examples) that illustrate multiple strategies and approaches to similar problems help foster broad knowledge transfer and \"cognitive flexibility\".\n\nThe instructional model of example-based learning by Renkl and Atkinson (2007) suggests that students gain a deeper understanding of domain principles when they receive worked examples at the beginning of cognitive skill acquisition.\n\n\n"}

The words derive from Greek ξένος (\"xenos\"), \"foreigner\" and γλῶσσα (\"glōssa\"), \"tongue\" or \"language\". The term xenoglossy was ostensibly coined by French parapsychologist Charles Richet in 1905. Stories of xenoglossy are found in the Bible, and contemporary claims of xenoglossy have been made by parapsychologists and reincarnation researchers such as Ian Stevenson. There is no scientific evidence that xenoglossy is an actual phenomenon.\n\nStories of the miraculous abilities of certain individuals to read, write, speak, or understand a foreign language that appear in the Bible and other Christian religious literature went on to inspire similar accounts and stories during the Middle Ages. Claims of mediums speaking foreign languages were made by Spiritualists in the 19th century, as well as by Pentecostals in the 20th century, but these did not hold up to scientific scrutiny. More recent claims of xenoglossy have come from reincarnation researchers who have alleged that individuals were able to recall a language spoken in a past life. Some reports of xenoglossy have surfaced in the popular press, such as Czech speedway rider Matěj Kůs who in September 2007 supposedly awoke after a crash and was able to converse in perfect English; however press reports of his fluency in English were based entirely on anecdotal stories told by his Czech teammates.\n\nParapsychologist and psychiatrist at the University of Virginia Ian Stevenson claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of xenoglossy. These included two where a subject under hypnosis could allegedly converse with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. Sarah Thomason, a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that \"the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy\".\n\n\nWilliam J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto has written that Stevenson had chosen to correspond with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner. He noted that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist for a period of six years \"without raising any discussion about the kinds of thing that linguists would need to know.\" He also wrote that most of Stevenson's collaborators were \"fellow believers\" in the paranormal, starting with a preconceived notion.\n\nProf. William Frawley in a review for Stevenson's \"Unlearned Language: New Studies in Xenoglossy\" (1984) wrote that he was too uncritically accepting of a paranormal interpretation of the cases. In one case a female subject could only answer yes or no questions in German which Frawley found unimpressive. In another, the female subject could speak Bengali with a poor pronunciation. Frawley noted that she was raised on the language of Marathi (related to Bengali), had studied Sanskrit from which both Marathi and Bengali derive and was living in a town with thousands of Bengalis. He concluded \"Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics.\"\n\nThe psychologist David Lester also evaluated Stevenson's cases and wrote the subjects made grammatical mistakes, mispronounced words and did not show a wide vocabulary of words in foreign language, thus they cannot be considered evidence for xenoglossy.\n\nIn the early 20th century Alfred Hulme, a self-proclaimed Egyptologist, investigated a young girl named Ivy Carter Beaumont also known as \"Rosemary\" from Blackpool, England who claimed to be under the influence of the personality of a Babylonian princess. Hulme was convinced she spoke in an ancient Egyptian dialect. However, according to linguist Karen Stollznow \"Several scholars examined the data independently and concluded that Hulme's analyses were grossly inaccurate. Hulme had confused Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian [...] they also found evidence that he had falsified many results.\"\n\n\n\n"}

While at Yale, World Fellows participate in a global affairs seminar, leadership workshops, and Yale courses.\n\nThe program's main facilities are located in Betts House, a university-owned mansion in the Prospect Hill Historic District of New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nIn November 2000, University President Rick Levin announced several internationalization initiatives, including the World Fellows program, in conjunction with the university's tercentenary. Journalist and White House aide Brooke Shearer was appointed its founding director, and Dan Esty its first program director. The program moved into Betts House, restored in 2001 to house new international initiatives. The first class of fellows was admitted in 2002. \n\nSince the program's establishment, 257 World Fellows have been selected for the program, representing 83 countries.\n\nThe center of the Yale World Fellows Program is a 15-week global affairs seminar taught by distinguished Yale faculty. Each class of World Fellows is exposed to both classical philosophical texts and current academic research.\n\nSessions are facilitated by Yale School of Management faculty in entrepreneurship and innovation. They also receive individualized coaching in public speaking.\n\nIn an off-the-record conversation series, Fellows have the opportunity to ask questions of global practitioners(?). The program has hosted leaders like United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former heads of state Ernesto Zedillo and Tony Blair, U.S. Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and writers David Brooks and Elizabeth Alexander.\n\nFellows can audit almost any course offered at Yale University with the opportunity to develop individual or collaborative research projects. They also spend time with Yale faculty and students, giving lectures and engaging in informal dialogue. While most program activities take place on campus in New Haven, the program sponsors trips to New York City and Washington, DC.\n\nThe program sponsors a variety of events every year, including global conferences, multimedia exhibitions, and panel discussions on current events. World Fellows often initiate their own collaborative projects while at Yale, such as the Seven Billionth Person Project, an international multimedia effort that invites people to share through writings and art what they would say to the world's seven billionth baby, expected to be born sometime in 2011. In the same year, the Yale World Fellows hosted Yale University's first TEDx event, \"TEDx Yale World Fellows\". The Return to Yale Forum is held every other year, and brings together current and former World Fellows to meet and engage in debates about contemporary issues. The most recent Forum was held in October 2013 and included discussions on social entrepreneurship, corporate thinking, activism, art and culture and peace.\n\nThe World Fellows Program also sponsors an annual Global Leadership Series conference. At these conferences held in cities internationally, World Fellows alumni, leaders in the region, prospective World Fellows nominees, and others debate selected global topics. Past conferences have addressed issues such as the United Nations Global Compact's contribution for addressing corporate social responsibility.\n\nCandidates for the program must be:\n\nApproximately 15–20 World Fellows are selected for the program each year. World Fellows are selected for their work accomplishments and indications of future contributions and leadership. They are required to reside full-time at Yale and participate in university life. In 2013, approximately 2,500 candidates applied for the program.\n\nCandidates can be nominated by anyone, or can apply of their own initiative. Regional panels review semifinalist candidates, and a final selection committee aims to assemble a class of fellows that is diverse, geographically balanced, and representative of a wide range of professions, talents, and perspectives.\n\n"}
