A regular in soaps and comedy, her best-known roles are in the sitcoms \"On the Buses\" and \"The Rag Trade\". She has also appeared in BBC TV's \"EastEnders\" from 1996 on a recurring basis as Aunt Sal.\n\nEarly in her career, Anna Karen worked as a striptease dancer at London's Panama Club. She has appeared in many films and television programmes, including the BBC sitcom \"Wild, Wild Women\", between 1968 and 1969. That same year she played a schoolgirl in the bikini-flying scene in the film \"Carry On Camping\" (even though she was 32 years old). In both these roles she acted with Barbara Windsor (herself a 31-year-old \"schoolgirl\" in the film).\n\nKaren is best remembered for her role in the LWT sitcom \"On the Buses\" (1969–73). In this series, Karen played Olive, the dowdy bespectacled younger sister of Stan (Reg Varney), and wife of Arthur Rudge (Michael Robbins). She also appeared in the film spin-offs, \"On the Buses\" (1971), \"Mutiny on the Buses\" (1972), and \"Holiday on the Buses\" (1973).

{"id": "70084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70084", "title": "August Bournonville", "text": "August Bournonville\n\nAugust Bournonville (21 August 1805 – 30 November 1879) was a Danish ballet master and choreographer. He was the son of Antoine Bournonville, a dancer and choreographer trained under the French choreographer, Jean Georges Noverre, and the nephew of Julie Alix de la Fay, née Bournonville, of the Royal Swedish Ballet.\n\nBournonville was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, where his father had settled. He trained with his father Antoine Bournonville as well he studied under the Italian choreographer Vincenzo Galeotti at the Royal Danish Ballet, Copenhagen, and in Paris, France, under French dancer Auguste Vestris. He initiated a unique style in ballet known as the Bournonville School.\n\nFollowing studies in Paris as a young man, Bournonville became solo dancer at the Royal Ballet in Copenhagen. From 1830 to 1848 he was choreographer for the Royal Danish Ballet, for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced from the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. As a choreographer, he created a number of ballets with varied settings that range from Denmark to Italy, Russia to South America. A limited number of these works have survived.\n\nBournonville's work became known outside Denmark only after World War II. Since 1950, The Royal Ballet has several times made prolonged tours abroad, not the least to the United States, where they have performed his ballets.\n\nBournonville's best-known ballets are \"La Sylphide\" (1836), \"Napoli\" (1842), \"Le Conservatoire\" (1849), \"The Kermesse in Bruges\" (1851) and \"A Folk Tale\" (1854).\n\nBorn in Copenhagen 21 August 1805, Bournonville was the son of the French ballet master Antoine Bournonville, who had settled in Denmark, and Lovisa Sundberg, a Swede. At the age of eight, he entered the Royal Ballet School at the Court Theatre in Christiansborg Palace under the tutelage of his father and Vincenzo Galeotti, ballet master and principal choreographer of the Royal Danish Ballet from 1775 to 1816.\n\nOn 2 October 1813, Bournonville made his first stage appearance in a small part as the son of a Viking king in Galeotti's \"Lagertha\", the first ballet on a Nordic theme. Less than a year later, he received his first personal applause for dancing a Hungarian solo at the Court Theatre. In addition to dance, Bournonville was a voracious reader, learned French at home, played the violin, sang in a boy soprano voice, and studied declamation with the actors Michael Rosing, Lindgreen, and Frydensdahl. His many talents were brought together on the Queen's birthday, 29 October 1817, when as a twelve-year-old he played the role of Adonia to royal acclaim in a music-drama, \"Solomon's Judgment\" and sang a romance, \"The Mother with Her Drooping Wings\".\n\nBournonville had five siblings. He was the only one in out of the children who showed any interest in dancing. He married Helena Fredrika Håkansson on 23 June 1830. They had seven children, including Charlotte who became an opera singer and actress. Both sons died as toddlers.\n\nIn 1820, Antoine Bournonville received a grant from his sovereign to briefly study ballet in Paris. Bournonville accompanied his father to Paris, and, although he studied solely with his father during the Paris sojourn, he was exposed to the latest trends in ballet and watched the illustrious teachers, Gardel and Vestris in action. Upon returning to Denmark, Bournonville became a member of the Royal Theatre, dancing in repertory that was less interesting to him after his exposure to Paris ballet.\n\nIn the spring of 1824, Bournonville returned to Paris for final studies and examination preparations at the Paris Opera. The expected fifteen-month sojourn would stretch to five years, during which time Danish ballet would approach near-disastrous decline. In Paris, Bournonville met his father's old friend, Louis Nivelon, who provided him with friendship, meals, and entree into society. Bournonville hoped the master Gardel would accept him but Gardel's studio was no longer in existence and he was directed to Auguste Vestris for training in his weakest areas — \"balance, pirouettes, and arms.\" Vestris accepted Bournonville. Bournonville wrote his father: \n\nBournonville danced from 1820 to 1828 with the noted dancer Marie Taglioni and the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nBournonville stopped teaching adult classes in the spring of 1877. On returning from church on 30 November 1879, he was stricken and taken to a hospital. Bournonville was interred near Asminderød Church near Fredensborg.\n\nBournonville's work remains an important link with earlier traditions. He resisted many of the excesses of the romantic era ballets in his work. He is noted for his egalitarian choreography, which gave equal emphasis to both male and female roles, at a time when European ballet emphasized the ballerina. Many of his contemporaries explored the extremes of human emotion, while Bournonville, using enthusiastic footwork and fluid phrases in his work, portrayed a more balanced human nature.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5531584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5531584", "title": "Contract cheating", "text": "Contract cheating\n\nContract cheating is a form of academic dishonesty in which students get others to complete their coursework for them by putting it out to tender.\n\nThe term was coined in a 2006 study by Thomas Lancaster and Robert Clarke at the University of Central England in Birmingham (now known as \"Birmingham City University\").\n\nThe first published material detailing the extent of contract cheating is a study by Robert Clarke and Thomas Lancaster. The study presented three main findings:\n\n\nWhereas the quality of solutions to assignments sold by essay mill has been questioned, a study by Jenkins and Helmore showed that work obtained through the use of an auction site was of sufficient quality to gain good marks and remain undetected by the module tutor.\n\nA more recent study examined over 900 examples of contract cheating by students studying computing subjects. The published results categorise the assignment types (e.g. Programming, Database, Web Design) and are analysed by country. One new concern identified by this study was the number of major projects (both final year undergraduate and postgraduate) being posted onto auction sites.\n\nFrom a study of 4,000 suspected cases of \"contract cheating\" some interesting patterns of behaviour have been observed. A summary was presented at the HEA Workshop on Contract Cheating (March 2008).\n\nAt the Aske conference held in June 2009 a paper detailing a \"multi-faceted\" approach to dealing with the problem of \"contract cheating\" was presented.\n\nA paper presented at the STEM conference (April 2012) was a study of over 600 assignments in subject areas ranging from \"Anthropology to Theology\".\n\nThe Commercial Aspects of Contract Cheating are examined in a paper given at ITiCSE '13. This paper analyses the monetary value of contract cheating to the different parties who play a role in the contract cheating process. The main analysis is based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat. The corpus was collected between March 2005 and July 2012.\n\nIn a 2017 meta-analysis of 5 studies, 3.5% of a total of 1378 students reported buying assignments to submit as their own. Of the students who reported engaging in contract cheating, more than 60% admitted doing so more than once.\n\nThe assignments prepared by essay-writing companies and other paid third-parties are supposedly 'original', meaning that they are likely to evade detection by software packages such as Turnitin. Assessment design strategies may limit the possibility that students can use contract cheating services, although a 2014 publication in Educational Studies showed that reducing the time that students have to prepare their assessments is unlikely to deter contract cheating, and that there appeared to be significant spare capacity in the contract cheating market.\n\nIn July 2007 a paper proposed a systematic six-stage process that tutors can use to detect students who are contract cheating. Contract cheating sites often claim this form of cheating is undetectable, a claim that has been tested in two studies. In a 2016 Australian study, when markers were asked to mark a set of contract cheating assignments and contract cheating was not mentioned to them, no marker raised any concerns of contract cheating. However, in a later study when markers were specifically asked to detect it, they correctly identified contract cheating 62% of the time.\n\nIt has recently been proposed that existing assignment and invigilated assessment data can be systematically analyzed in order to detect patterns of students' performance that may be indicative of contract cheating. Additionally, at the Plagiarism across Europe and Beyond conference, it was demonstrated how collecting analytical data at the time of writing can help in identifying cases where a student committed contract cheating. \n\nAlthough non-originality engines (like Turnitin) are unlikely to detect contract cheating, there has been some success in using them to identify the source of assignments detected on auction sites.\n\nIn general, academic institutions consider contract cheating to be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct and it is penalised accordingly. In 2010 the 'AMBeR Project' developed a UK 'Plagiarism Tariff' in an attempt to standardise penalties for all forms of academic misconduct. The final report noted that purchase of an assignment should be penalised with the most serious penalties available, such as expulsion from the institution, and that many institutions considered it to be a separate form of misconduct altogether due to the seemingly obvious intent associated with it. However, a 2015 research study, also in the UK, asked university students what they thought penalties for academic misconduct should be. The responses demonstrated that students consistently recommended lenient penalties for plagiarism, and that this effect was most pronounced for contract cheating.\n\nThe legality of contract cheating services was reviewed by Newton and Lang in a 2016 book chapter of the Springer Handbook for Academic Integrity. The legal status of these services varies internationally. In New Zealand it is illegal to \"advertise or provide third party assistance to cheat\", with similar, older laws on the statutes of 17 states in the US. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency published a report advocating the use of a legal approach as one way to tackle contract cheating, and suggesting that existing fraud laws might be used, since the activities of such services, and their clients, could be reasonably interpreted to fit with definitions of fraud as they involve 'false representation' and 'failure to disclose information'. A subsequent research project compared the UK Fraud laws with the terms and conditions used by contract cheating services and concluded that they would be unlikely to fall foul of Fraud law due to the disclaimers, terms and conditions they use which generally state that any custom written products are to be used only as 'study guides' or 'revision aids', thereby placing responsibility, and 'intent', onto the student client. Despite this, media 'stings' have shown that companies can be complicit in the inappropriate use of these products. A similar analysis in Lithuania concluded that contract cheating services were unlikely to fall foul of existing laws, although an analysis of Australian law concluded that fraud, as well as forgery and conspiracy, might be legal avenues via which contract cheating could be targeted. All three studies called for the introduction of new legal approaches to tackle contract cheating.\n\nA follow-up research study proposed such a new law, based on the principle of strict liability, which lessens the requirement for prosecutors to demonstrate that they 'intended to help student cheat', but instead would make them liable for prosecution simply for offering services that could be reasonably interpreted as being used for contract cheating. \n\nMore broadly, despite the apparent potential of a legal challenge to contract cheating companies, prosecutions are currently rare, largely due to the limitations of existing laws. In addition, the simple act of outlawing a service would not necessarily reduce demand for it; the aforementioned research studies all call for a holistic, multi-pronged approach to tackling contract cheating.\n\n\n"}

He is at present (2014) Senior Professor Emeritus at the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Barcelona and coordinator of a Research Group on States, Nations and Sovereignties, linked to the UPF.\n\nHe is the son of Spanish exiles from the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939. Between 1965 and 1969 he studied at Bard College in New York City (now Bard University), graduated with a BA in 1969 and was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship. Accepted at the Graduate School of the University of Columbia in New York City, he studied with Arno Mayer and Robert O. Paxton (with whom he worked briefly as \"research assistant \"). He completed his Ph.D. in 1979 with a dissertation titled \"Catalan State : Strategies of Separation of Catalan Radical Nationalism and Revolution (1919-1933)\" ( Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States: University Microfilms International), a thesis initially directed by Paxton and then by the scholar on Spanish politics Edward Malefakis. This thesis was largely based on systematic interviewing, and the location of Catalan printed materials, as much of the archival sources were still inaccessible in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1972 he moved to Spain to research his dissertation. He was soon offered an instructorship at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), beginning in 1974. As Spanish legislation required citizenship for tenure status, Ucelay-Da Cal somewhat disingenuously maintained his situation as professor by obtaining a degree in Contemporary (i.e. Modern) History at the University of Barcelona in 1980 and, in 1983, a doctorate in history at the UAB with a new thesis, written in Catalan, re-researched and with a slight change of temporal focus, \"El nacionalisme radical català i la resistència a la Dictadura de Primo de Rivera, 1923-1931\", directed by Josep Fontana. To document this new text, Ucelay-Da Cal worked in numerous archives of France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal and of course, Spain, which, because of standard time access clauses (usually fifty years), were previously closed to investigators working on the 1920s. The documentary research did not produce significant changes in the narrative previously established by oral and press sources. In 1983 he obtained Spanish citizenship, and was granted tenure.\n\nAccordingly, between 1983 and 1995, Ucelay-Da Cal was tenured “Titular Professor” of Contemporary history at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. After the corresponding “opposition” or public contest for promotion characteristic of the Spanish University system, he became Senior Professor (“catedrático”) of contemporary history at the same university from 1995 to 2006. Since 2006, he has been senior professor of contemporary history at the Pompeu Fabra University, also in Barcelona. From 2009 to 2013 he participated in the Advanced Grant Project from the European Research Council (ERC) \"State Building in Latin America\", at the UPF. Although he has not been particularly active in teaching abroad, he was “visiting professor \" at Duke University between February and April 1994, taught also at Venice International University (Italy) in the spring semester of 2002, and received as \" visiting scholar \" at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (École des Hautes Etudes de Sciences Sociales) in Paris in April 2004.\n\nHe directed the dissertations of historians, some whom have since gone on to very distinguished investigatory careers: as examples, one can cite Xavier Casals, who has become unquestionably the major specialist in Neo-Nazism in Spain; David Martinez Fiol, who pioneered research on the impact of the First World War in Catalonia; , a top specialist on the Spanish Falange movement; and Joan Esculies, a rising figure among scholars of Catalan nationalism; among others. He has been open to work with researchers younger than himself. For many years, he collaborated closely with , the main Spanish researcher on Eastern Europe. More recently, he has also prepared books and projects on politically controversial topics in Catalan history together with Arnau Gonzàlez i Vilalta, a younger Catalan historian specializing in the diplomatic contacts of Catalan nationalism.\n\nUcelay-Da Cal has focused on his career production on the contemporary history of Spain and Catalonia, Spanish nationalism and Catalan nationalism, as well as specific issues such as the role of Catalan independence (the Estat Català movement, in particular) before and during the Second Spanish Republic, as well as during the Spanish Civil War. In broader terms, he has called for greater attention to regional dynamics in the explanation of 'national' history. He has insisted on themes such as the analysis of populism in Spain and its connections or analogies with Latin America. As regards the Spanish Civil War, he has called the use of the anthropology of religion as a means to interpret many trends considered usually as exclusively “political”. He has evinced a strong skepticism regarding many of the suppositions that govern the leading interpretations in contemporary Spanish history.\n\nEnric Ucelay-Da Cal has published over two hundred articles in academic journals and other history serial publications, as well as in books in Spanish, Catalan, English, French, and Italian. He also reviewed books. Much of his work is available in pdf format on his personal webpage. His major books are:\n\n\n\n"}

Ebersole (1919–2009) was an American philosopher who developed a unique form of ordinary language philosophy.\n\nFrank B. Ebersole was born in Indiana. He majored in zoology at Heidelberg College. After years as a philosophy graduate student at Yale University, he transferred to the University of Chicago, where he worked with Rudolf Carnap, one of the founders of logical analysis, and with Charles Hartshorne, an advocate of process philosophy and a theorist of physiological psychology. Ebersole received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1947 (He also won the 1945 Fiske Poetry Prize). \nHis dissertation was entitled \"Biology and the theory of knowledge : an analytical method for the theory of knowledge, and its relation to biological laws.\" The thesis contains 7 chapters: \nI. Determination of the subject and Method\nII. Relations of Truth and Knowledge: Logic and Epistemology\nIII. The Order of Knowledge and the Phenomenally Given\nIV. Causal Deliverances in the Given, and the Memory Premiss\nV. Analysis and the A Priori\nVI. Special Problems Concerning Memory; Polemic\nand; VII. Summary of the Main Argument. \nThe thesis starts with general discussion of theory of knowledge (epistemology) and how knowledge must be founded in the \"phenomenally given\" on page 48 it states, \"Here we have if anywhere the foundation of the order of knowledge, in knowledge of the phenomenally given.\" From that point, Ebersole goes on to examine memory in Ch. IV and the relationship of Biology to questions in theory of knowledge. Ending with problems of memory concerning other areas of philosophy and science. Ebersole later directly challenges these ideas concerning memory and the \"phenomenally given\" in his book, \"Things We Know.\" \nEbersole taught philosophy at colleges and universities, including Carleton, Oberlin, San Jose State, Stanford, and Alberta, but most of his academic career was at the University of Oregon, where he was department chairman and director of graduate studies. He published essays in a number of journals, however, many of his essays were not accepted for journal publication and are available only in his three self-published books: \"Things We Know\", \"Meaning and Saying\", and \"Language and Perception\".\n\nBesides his involvement with philosophical issues, he was a photographer, and author of two books of poetry (\"Many Times of Year\" and \"Song of the Crow\").\n\nInitially Ebersole was interested in philosophers who brought a zoological perspective to their philosophy (Henri Bergson, Alfred North Whitehead, and Charles Hartshorne, for example). He also was influenced by ideas of logical analysis (especially as practised by his teacher Rudolf Carnap). In the early 1950s he read Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"Blue Book\" and \"Philosophical Investigations\", and this changed his direction considerably:\nLike many another I was once committed to a certain type of philosophical endeavor—a type that goes under the names of \"linguistic analysis\" or \"conceptual analysis\"... Then I read Wittgenstein. My first reaction was to add footnotes to the things I had been writing. Then I added appendices. Finally I tore the things up; and I have been trying in various ways ever since to overcome a state of paralysis, without success.\nBy the later 1950s Ebersole found a new way in philosophy, partly stimulated by the thinking of Wittgenstein and the writings of other early ordinary language philosophers. In 1957 he read his first paper based on his new thinking; it was about Descartes' dream argument.\n\nEbersole's work from his mature period (available in his three books) \"requires—and often succeeds in producing—a radical reorientation of one's thinking\". Ebersole's essays give form to his personal struggles with philosophical problems. In most of the essays he attempts to remove crustations from traditional philosophical ideas so that he can identify and address the central issues underlying a philosophical problem from his own personal point of view. Often he contrasts the philosophical conception of words that are central to a philosophical problem with examples of how these same words are used in the context of ordinary (non-philosophical) discourse. Using examples, he reveals significant differences between the ways we think when we are in the grip of a philosophical problem and when we are not so gripped. Ebersole concludes that philosophical problems often arise from philosophers' tendency to think in terms of philosophy.\n\nHe has written mainly on topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language. Ebersole is generally taken to be part of the school of ordinary language philosophy and he argues in several essays that two main critics of ordinary language philosophy (Paul Grice and John R. Searle) pose questions raised by the robust form of ordinary language philosophy he practiced. For an appraisal of Ebersole's work, see Don S. Levi's paper \"Ebersole's Philosophical Treasure Hunt.\" His writing is unconventional in style and content, as he acknowledges in this excerpt from one of his poems:\n\n\"People stopped and puzzled when I talked, <br>\nwondered what to make of <br>\nanything I said. <br>\nAnd if I made them ask themselves <br>\nWhat of heads or tails to make <br>\nof a philosopher's talking, <br>\nthat was a good thing I did,<br>\nI would say.<br>\nYes, I would say that.\"\n\n"}

It is taught within the curriculum where teachers integrate multiple dimensions, perspectives, and citizenships into everyday lessons. It began as an undertaking to restructure education and society in the 1960s and 1970s, through the initiatives of educationalists, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. This global approach seeks to break an educational program that is stuck in subject knowledge and national culture, and instead, seeks to discover alternative motivations for education and alternate futures.\n\nIn Australia, it is perceived to enable young people to participate in shaping a better, shared future for the world. It emphasizes the unity and interdependence of human society, developing a sense of self and appreciation of cultural diversity, affirmation of social justice and human rights, as well as building peace and actions for a sustainable future at different times and places. This approach is also believed to promote positive values and prods students to take responsibility for their actions and see themselves as global citizens who can contribute to a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nNetwork of Young Europeans:\n\nTokyo Global Engineering Corporation: \n\nThe National Education Association (NEA) recognizes Global Education to be a goal that educators strive to succeed in the classroom. The American association supports study abroad trips and teaching overseas for teachers to get a first hand experience of different cultures.\n\nUniversities in the United States are also expanding their study abroad programs to enhance greater interconnectedness and global economic interdependence. The Institute of International Education (IIE) is researching effective ways that higher education in the United States can grow and create quality study abroad programs within the curriculum.\n\nMany K-12 schools within the United States have adapted a Global Education Framework that was created for state wide implementation. Within this framework consist of six essential steps for a successful global education curriculum within each school:\n\nUniversities in the United States have recently been expanding on the degree programs relating to global education. Many universities offer Bachelor Degree programs and certifications in Global Education, M.S. degrees in Global and International Education, M.A. degrees in International Education, and doctorate degrees in International Education.\n\nPeople with a degree in International Education design, implement, manage, and evaluate multiple education programs within public and private primary and secondary schools, public and private higher education programs, national corporations, and cultural agencies. People in the job field can work at agencies across the world, within elite universities, and a variety of global education organizations.\n\nIn January 2016, the Institute of International Education (IIE) announced the winners at the annual IIE Andrew Heiskell Awards for Innovation on International Education. The Heiskell awards were created to promote and honor outstanding commitments conducted in international higher education. Categories of the awards include: Internationalizing the Campus, Study Abroad, International Partnerships, and Internationalizing the HBCU. These awards hope to bring public awareness to the benefits of international education.\n\nThe International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) awards professionals in the global education field for their outstanding contributions to international education in Australia by providing excellence and best practice. The International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) also supports the international education communities’ research, projects, journalism, publications, and more areas that contribute to the global perspectives in education.\n\nEvidence based practices have shown that literature can help children learn about global issues. By exploring diversity in text, connecting the literature to service learning and activism, promote critical thinking about themselves in the global community, and develop their global awareness with literacy elements. Literature introduced in the classroom can teach multiple skills that prepare for further learning within the global community.\n\nTechnology is a key provider in learning about globalization and participating in the global community. Technology can be used in the classroom to communicate around the world, establish global relationships, learn more about global current events, and developing global research. The advancements of technology will have a positive impact of global education in primary schools and higher education schools.\n\nService learning or local volunteer service work are included in conceptualized global citizenship programs. This approach is criticized because global relations are dramatically split into rich and poor, or oppressor and oppressed, respectively. Experiences of oppression are more complex than experiences of oppressing. Global citizenship education includes connecting nearby and worldwide issues and points of view and may incorporate such themes as human rights, social equity, and citizenship instruction, economic improvement, and globalization. Service learning can carry the possibility to recreate social disparities and advance, instead of dissipate, stereotypes.\n\n\n"}

It has since had numerous imitators, spawning an entire genre of how-to books on child-rearing for Chinese parents.\n\nLiu was raised in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Liu's parents, believers in the value of early childhood education, subjected her to a rigorous education since she was just 15 days old. For example, to ensure that someone was always talking to Liu, they invited relatives over to the house. They also had her participate in \"character-building\" physical exercises such as swimming, jumping rope, and holding ice in her hands for extended periods of time. Liu also acted in a soap opera when she was five years old.\n\nWhile in high school, Liu met then Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher partner Larry L. Simms, a Dartmouth and BU Law alumnus and former U.S. Navy Lieutenant who clerked for Supreme Court justice Byron White and worked as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel from 1975 to 1985. With Simms' assistance, Liu participated in a student exchange program sponsored by Washington-Beijing Scholastic Exchange, Inc., of which Simms was the founder and President, and visited America in 1998. This experience changed her views about life in America, because like many Chinese citizens, most of her impressions about America came from Hollywood, and when she came to the country she was \"surprised that [she] didn't see any street fights or police-car chases\". The program also piqued her interest in American universities, where she realized she would be able to study a variety of subjects.\n\nAlthough they had been training her to attend a preeminent university, Liu's parents had not expected that she would attend an American one; her mother has said that until Liu came back from America, she had not been aware that Chinese students could apply to American universities. At the time, it was unusual for Chinese students to attend American schools as undergraduates, as most only applied to schools abroad for postgraduate education. However, rather than taking the \"gaokao,\" China's national college entrance examination, and attending one of the National Key Universities, Liu applied to American colleges with recommendation from Simms. She was accepted to several schools, including Harvard, Columbia, Wellesley, and Mount Holyoke, from which she ultimately chose to attend Harvard. Not long afterwards, a local newspaper announced her acceptance and the family was \"besieged with thousands of phone calls\".\n\nAt Harvard, Liu majored in applied mathematics and economics and earned high grades; she also chaired the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations, a student organization. She was described as \"unassuming\" and a \"typical student\", to the point that it took her roommate four years to realize Liu was a celebrity in China. In 2003, Liu graduated and took a job at the Boston Consulting Group in New York City.\n\nLiu Weihua (Liu's mother) and Zhang Xinwu (Liu's stepfather) published \"Harvard Girl\" in 2000, after Liu had matriculated at Harvard. According to Liu, her parents had plans early on to write about their parenting methods, but they waited until 2000 to publish the book, relying on Liu's perceived success to establish themselves as \"experts\". The book primarily consists of research-like notes and diary entries, which Liu and her parents began recording and saving before Liu was in first grade. Liu herself helped edit the book, and wrote several of the later chapters.\n\nOne major element of the child-rearing strategy described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and \"encourag[ing] her to develop a mature style of thinking\". Liu's parents never used baby talk when Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult. According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a \"break with the past\" in China, where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning.\n\nIn addition, the book details the rigorous \"character-building exercises\" Liu's parents had her perform. In addition to having her do physical exercises, Liu's parents controlled her diet. They also frequently took her traveling, both on short trips to nearby rural areas and on longer trips to historical sites such as Xi'an. Throughout the book, high value is placed on \"full development\", and the writers encourage parents to cultivate more than just academic ability in their children.\n\nThe book also includes supplementary chapters on topics such as how to select which schools to apply to, and advice for students on filling out applications and taking TOEFL and SAT exams.\n\nThe book was at the top of China's bestseller list for 16 months, during which time it sold at least 1.5 million copies and the writers were estimated to have earned at least the equivalent of $100,000 in royalties. It became a must-have book for middle-class parents in China. The popularity of \"Harvard Girl\" made Liu a \"national superstar\" and an \"idol\" for Chinese parents, and she frequently received fan mail and drew large crowds at book signings in mainland China. The success of this and similar books (another bestseller in 2001 and 2002 was Robert Kiyosaki's \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\") in mainland China has been said to reflect a \"national obsession\" among Chinese parents to get their children into top-ranking American schools.\n\n\"Harvard Girl\" was followed by numerous imitations by parents of other successful students, and is said to have spawned an entire genre of education \"manuals\" for Chinese parents, including similar books on how to get one's children into schools such as Oxford University, Cambridge University, or Cornell University. This genre includes titles such as \"Ivy League is Not a Dream\", \"From Andover to Harvard\", \"How We Got Our Child Into Yale\", \"Harvard Family Instruction\", \"The Door of the Elite\", \"Harvard Boy Zhang Zhaomu\", \"Harvard Talents: Children Cultivated by the Karl Weter Educational Law\", \"Tokyo University Boy\", \"Cornell Girl\", and \"Our Dumb Little Boy Goes to Cambridge\".\n\nComparable books have also been published in South Korea, although American undergraduate universities are not \"revered\" in the same way there as they are in mainland China. In addition to imitators, Liu's parents have written their own follow-up: \"Harvard Girl 2: Liu Yiting's Studying Methods and Upbringing Details\" (＜哈佛女孩刘亦婷＞之二： 刘亦婷的学习方法和培养细节), which describes Liu's four years in college, was published in 2004 by Writers Publishing House.\n\nThe book also affected applications to Harvard. It made Harvard a household name in China, and books of this genre caused a significant increase in the number of Chinese applicants to top-tier American universities. In 1999, Liu and 43 other Chinese students applied to Harvard, and by 2008, 484 Chinese students had.\n\nThe book has been criticized for increasing the pressure many Chinese students already had to succeed in school, and for taking advantage of the widespread belief that admission into leading universities is necessary for success in life. Some critics have called the book \"boastful.\" A 2001 study by a group of educators claimed that the strategies described in the book would not work for everyone even though they had worked for Liu, and that many families following the book's advice would be disappointed.\n\nA 2004 book by Xiao Hui (萧愚), entitled \"Raising Children Requires Great Wisdom: The Truth About \"Harvard Girl Liu Yiting\"\" (教育孩子需要大智慧：“哈佛女孩刘亦婷”真相), harshly criticizes \"Harvard Girl\", calling the methods described in the book \"false character building\" (\"伪素质教育\") and claiming that Liu gained entrance into Harvard not because of her comprehensive or well-rounded education, but by exploiting loopholes and defects in Harvard's admissions policy for Chinese students or by taking advantage of \"guanxi\", personal relationships and networks.\n\nMany successful Chinese students after Liu have tried to distance themselves from the so-called \"Harvard Girl Phenomenon;\" Harvard students Yin Zhongrui and Tang Meijie have both stated they do not want to be compared to \"Harvard Girl.\" Yin's mother published a book, \"From Andover to Harvard\", about how her son was accepted by Harvard, but Yin only allowed his full name to appear in the book's preface. Tang received at least six offers from publishers to have a book written about her, but declined them all. Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to \"Harvard Girl,\" and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (程琬芯) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.\n\n\n"}

Today IML-UQ enrolls 3000 plus students annually in all of its language programs.\n\nIML-UQ provides courses in over 30 languages. Designed to enrich the knowledge of a language and its culture, these courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression. Apart from Latin, their content is based on themes and topics of the modern world in which we live.\n\nIML-UQ is an Australian translator and interpreter service for 75 different languages, specialising in English language translations. Languages available at the IML-UQ include Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Cantonese, Chinese Mandarin, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, French, Greek, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese amongst many others.\n\nEstablished in 1934, IML-UQ continues to serve the community by facilitating language learning and cross-cultural communication. Over the years it has sought to develop strategies to reach out to students in order to enrich their experience of learning another language. IML-UQ still meets the language service needs of the corporate sector, small businesses, government departments and community organisations. \nIML-UQ seeks to fulfill the original aspiration of the University of Queensland Senate to give more adults the chance to deepen their lives by bringing them into the university community via language courses open to the public. \nIML-UQ also provides a vehicle for UQ students to remain connected with its alumni in a meaningful way over the decades in which they are no longer engaged in more formal study.\n\nWhen the seventh Senate of the University of Queensland met in March 1932, it stated its intentions \"…to serve increasingly, despite straitened resources, not only education but whatever public needs science and learning could serve.\"\n\nOne of the ways these intentions were made manifest in 1934 was \"to bring those classes under an Institute of Modern Languages (IML-UQ) associated with the Faculties of Arts and Commerce and to offer through it instruction in any modern language for which there should be a sufficient demand.\"\n\nThe successful launching of the IML-UQ was largely the result of the personal commitment to non-traditional university studies of a number of prominent University of Queensland academics. These academics recognised the demand for language teaching from the community at large.\n\nWhen IML-UQ was established at the University of Queensland on 11 May 1934, it was the first adult education extension unit in modern languages to be attached to an Australian tertiary education institution. According to a university statute, IML-UQ was intended to \"promote and extend the teaching of Modern Languages.\"\n\nThe Telegraph reported the University’s decision to establish IML-UQ as follows (12 May 1934): \"At the meeting of the University Senate yesterday afternoon a recommendation for the establishment of IML-UQ was approved. This is clearly an important educational development, since it provides machinery for the study of foreign languages that have a cultural and commercial value for the State, and for which no provision is made in secondary schools for Junior, Senior, and Matriculation purposes.\"\n\nIML-UQ commenced operations with one class each in French and Italian and two in German. In an article entitled ‘A Wider National Perspective’ (Courier-Mail, 14 May 1934, see page 5), the author articulates a vision of language education serving the national interest. The view was that IML-UQ courses would provide training in practical skills which would benefit business and international travel. Language programs were also endorsed as suitable educational ventures towards better international understanding and tolerance.\n\nAustralia’s changing perceptions of the non-English speaking world were reflected through the changing patterns of IML-UQ enrolments. New prospects in international commerce and tourism and the evolution of a cosmopolitan Australian society through post-war immigration were reflected in the diversification of language courses. These new courses were offered in response to public demand.\n\nIn another article, entitled ‘Foreign Languages’, which appeared in the Courier-Mail on the same day, the new IML-UQ courses were defined as follows: \"The courses were…for commercial purposes, and would not enter so deeply into the literature of the languages as in an ordinary degree course, but rather would aim at the impartation of good working business knowledge of each tongue dealt with.\" \n\nThe history of language teaching at IML-UQ has been characterised by an ongoing search for more effective ways of teaching languages. \nThe Grammar Translation Method was the main language teaching method in the initial decades. After this the Direct Method, which emphasises listening and speaking skills, was introduced.\n\nToday, languages are primarily taught using the Communicative and Intercultural Language Teaching and Learning approaches with less emphasis on whole class activities and more on pair and group work.\n\nOn 23 April 1934, resolutions to create a constitution and rules were passed by IML-UQ Joint Sub-Committee of the Faculties of Arts and Commerce. By 1937, special courses were added for those involved in scientific work. In 1952, students of Russian reflected a sentiment that, \"Russian will probably be useful in the future\".\n\nBy 1954, IML-UQ had grown to the point that a review of its purposes, services and administrative structures was required. The main priority was to establish IML-UQ as a provider of ‘adult education’, where courses would not enter ‘deeply into literature’ but focus on a ‘good working knowledge’ for practical application; followed by the expectation to satisfy requirements set for honours students in the Faculty of Commerce; and lastly to provide access to languages for which there was no provision in schools for Junior, Senior and Matriculation purposes.\n\nAll IML-UQ classes were held in the Old Government House on George Street. By the late 1960s, all IML-UQ classes were transferred to the St Lucia campus, where they remain today. The first full-time IML-UQ director was appointed in 1965.\n\nDonald Munro was the first full-time Director of IML-UQ from 1965 - 1970.\n\nMr Munro advocated the idea that learning languages would assist in community engagement. He believed that the study of a language would help students to understand the perspective of those who spoke that language. In his own words, his assumption was that \"language and culture cannot be separated.\" He advocated that the study of language could itself form a cultural bridge, and thus is important for Australia’s migrant population.\n\nHe began a move to audio-lingual teaching methods by acquiring new teaching and learning equipment which could simultaneously play and record, so that students could compare their pronunciation with a master track.\n\nDr Max Brändle the second full-time IML-UQ director from 1970 - 1998, taught 5 languages at IML-UQ.\nDuring Dr Brändle’s time as IML-UQ director, IML-UQ established the first commercial ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) centre in Australia that taught English solely to individual, full-fee paying students. In 1988 the University set up a separate TESOL unit, now known as the Institute of Continuing & TESOL Education.\n\nGeorgiana Poulter became the new IML-UQ Director in 1999, commencing a series of functional changes to the structure of Institute. \nIn response to the increasing trend of global business, IML-UQ now includes a translation and interpreting service appropriate to the international market inclusive of local cultural needs. External clients range from the mining and engineering industry, to law firms, government departments, migration agents, and the IT, travel and advertising industries.\n\nTo enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning which is the primary focus of IML-UQ, in-house training, or Professional Development (PD), workshops are now implemented for tutors and staff, and involvement with professional associations is encouraged. \nTranslation, interpreting, language courses and customised tuition are the foundational components to support the purpose of IML-UQ in its ongoing role facilitating community engagement and links between UQ and the Brisbane community.\n\nIML-UQ is designed to enhance employment opportunities, improve communication abilities, support lifelong learning and international travel, and maintain language skills in a practical adult (16+) learning environment. Year courses commence March of each year, and second semester courses commence in July. Short courses are offered in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.\n\nLanguages currently taught at IML-UQ are:\nArabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Cantonese), Chinese (Mandarin), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek (Modern), Hebrew (Modern), Hindi, Indonesian, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.\n\nIML-UQ offers one-on-one and small group private tuition in most languages customised for business, government departments, companies, travel preparation, research, personal development and cross-cultural communication. Customised courses are designed to offer flexibility in course content, structure and teaching style at venues and times that suit the needs of students. Qualified and experienced tutors are selected specifically for each organisation or individual.\n\nThese language enrichment courses are designed for students in the Senior phase of learning who wish to enrich their knowledge of the language and culture they are currently studying and practise their language skills over the long Summer holidays. The courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression, with content based on themes and topics specified in the QSA Senior Syllabus.\n"}

{"id": "549355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=549355", "title": "Lie-to-children", "text": "Lie-to-children\n\nA lie-to-children (plural lies-to-children) is a simplified explanation of technical or complex subjects as a teaching method for children and laypeople. The technique has been incorporated by academics within the fields of biology, evolution, bioinformatics and the social sciences. It is closely related to the philosophical concept known as Wittgenstein's ladder.\n\nThe \"lie-to-children\" concept was first discussed by scientist Jack Cohen and mathematician Ian Stewart in the 1994 book \"The Collapse of Chaos: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World\". They further elaborated upon their views in their coauthored 1997 book \"Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind\". The concept gained greater exposure when they collaborated with popular author Terry Pratchett, discussing \"lies-to-children\" in the book \"The Science of Discworld\" (1999).\n\nCohen and Stewart discussed \"lies-to-children\" and the desire inherent in society for a view of simplicity with regards to complex concepts in their 1994 book \"The Collapse of Chaos\".\n\nStewart and Cohen wrote in \"Figments of Reality\" (1997) that the lie-to-children concept reflected the difficulty inherent in reducing complex concepts during the education process. Stewart and Cohen noted reality itself was viewed within the prism of human perspective: \"Any description suitable for human minds to grasp must be \"some\" type of lie-to-children — real reality is always much too complicated for our limited minds.\"\n\nLibrarian and editor Andrew Sawyer discussed the \"lie-to-children\" concept introduced by scientists Cohen and Stewart in their early two non-fiction books. Sawyer wrote: \"In \"The Collapse of Chaos\" and \"Figments of Reality\", we also come across the concept of 'lies-to-children' — the necessarily simplified stories we tell children and students as a foundation for understanding so that eventually they can discover that they are not, in fact, \"true\".\"\n\nThe definition given in \"The Science of Discworld\" (1999) is as follows: \"A lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation, one that the child will only be able to appreciate if it has been primed with the lie\". The authors acknowledge that some people might dispute the applicability of the term \"lie\", while defending it on the grounds that \"it is for the best possible reasons, but it is still a lie\". This viewpoint is derived from earlier perspectives within the field of philosophy of science.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Pratchett commented upon the phrase: \"I \"like\" the lies-to-children motif, because it underlies the way we run our society and resonates nicely with Discworld.\" He was critical of problems inherent in early education: \"You arrive with your sparkling A-levels all agleam, and the first job of the tutors is to reveal that what you thought was true is only true for a given value of 'truth'.\" Pratchett cautioned: \"Most of us need just 'enough' knowledge of the sciences, and it's delivered to us in metaphors and analogies that bite us in the bum if we think they're the same as the truth.\"\n\nCohen and Stewart further elaborated upon the lie-to-children trope in a 2002 book they coauthored on exobiology, \"Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life\". Within the work, the authors were critical of use of lie-to-children as an educational methodology which had an unfortunate side-effect of reducing complex science concepts to overly simplified explanations. Stewart was asked in a 2015 interview about his views on Pratchett beyond the influence of lie-to-children, and the author's take on the understanding of science. Stewart commented upon the interaction between himself and Cohen with Pratchett during the writing process: \"Terry wasn't trained as a scientist, but he had the right kind of critical attitude. He was extraordinarily widely read, and would ask all sorts of unexpected questions that really got me and Jack thinking.\"\n\nAuthors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry recommended the original works discussing the concept for further analysis of the phenomenon: \"These are well worth a read if you fancy a laugh while pretending to work.\"\n\nThe term \"lie to children\" should not be taken to imply that it is exclusively used in childhood education. Educators in secondary and post-secondary schools employ increasingly-accurate yet still \"untrue\" models as a means of explicating complex topics.\n\nA typical example of this is found in physics, where the Bohr model of atomic electron shells is still often used to introduce atomic structure before moving on to more complex models based on matrix mechanics; and in chemistry, where the Arrhenius definitions of acids and bases are often introduced, followed (in a manner similar to the historical development of the model) by the Brønsted–Lowry definitions and then the Lewis definitions.\n\nHigh school teachers and university instructors often explain at the outset that the model they are about to present is incomplete. An example of this is given by Gerald Sussman during the 1986 video recording of the Abelson-Sussman Lectures (lecture 1-b):If we're going to understand processes and how we control them, then we have to have a mapping from the mechanisms of this procedure into the way in which these processes behave. What we're going to have is a formal, or semi-formal, mechanical model whereby you understand how a machine could, in fact, in principle, do this. Whether or not the actual machine really does what I'm about to tell you is completely irrelevant at this moment.\n\nIn fact, this is an engineering model, in the same way that, [for an] electrical resistor, we write down a model V = IR — it's approximately true, but it's not really true; if I put enough current through the resistor, it goes boom, so the voltage is not always proportional to the current, but for some purposes the model is appropriate.\n\nIn particular, the model we're going to describe right now, which I call the substitution model, is the simplest model that we have for understanding how procedures work and how processes work — how procedures yield processes.\n\nAnd that substitution model will be accurate for most of the things we'll be dealing with in the next few days. But eventually, it will become impossible to sustain the illusion that that's the way the machine works, and we'll go to other, more specific and particular models that will show more detail.\n\nThe concept of lie-to-children was discussed at-length in 2000 by Andrew Sawyer, where the subject itself was included in the article title: \"Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'\". Sawyer wrote that: \"The 'lies-to-children' we tell ourselves about science are a different form of science fiction: one, perhaps where 'fiction' qualifies the word 'science.' They are 'fictions about science' rather than 'science fictions.'\" Sawyer concluded: \"The strength of \"The Science of Discworld\" — and why in many ways it is something new in science writing — derives from Pratchett's story being more than a parable constructed for the specific purpose of explaining what the scientists have to say. It is, as has been said, a commentary/parody of the scientific method\".\n\nIn a contribution about evolution for the 2001 book \"Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences\", reproductive biologist Jack Cohen discussed the lie-to-children teaching technique and its use educating students on the concept of evolution and its complex facets including the notion that DNA is an architectural guide for life. The author concluded: \"Only the search for universal features, while treasuring all the exceptional specifics, offers some hope of sketching out the general shape of the evolutionary process so that we can explain it honestly as a Lie-to-Children.\"\n\nD.J. Jeffrey and Robert M. Corless of the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra at the University of Western Ontario wrote in their 2001 computer science paper on linear algebra instruction on the teaching concept. Jeffrey and Corless identified a \"useful\" lie-to-children, as one in which: \"The pedagogical point is to avoid unnecessary burdens on the student’s first encounter with the concept.\" The authors gave an example from early childhood mathematics instruction: \"We happily teach children that 'you cannot take 3 from 2' because we are confident that\nsomeone will later introduce them to negative numbers.\" Corless further expounded on this view in a subsequent paper published in 2004, writing: \"A 'lie to children' is a useful oversimplification that starts one on the path to better knowledge. It is a truth unacknowledged that mathematics before computers was a lie to children.\"\n\nIn their 2004 book \"Bioinformatics, Biocomputing and Perl\", authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry explained how the lie-to-children model may be utilized as a teaching technique for the concepts of protein, RNA, and DNA. Moorhouse and Barry wrote that the lie-to-children methodology can reduce complex academic notions to a simpler format for basic understanding. The authors conclude that the lie-to-children teaching technique: \"allows the basic features to be understood without confusing things by considering exceptions and enhancements.\" \n\nHaroom Kharem and Genevieve Collura were critical of the teaching practice, in a contribution to the 2010 book \"Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children\". The authors wrote that using this teaching method was a form of disrespect for the truth. Kharem and Collura lament that rather than imparting truth to children, \"a pedagogy of stupidification is promoted in which teachers imbue students with untruths and then wonder why education has problems. Sooner or later the fabrications we teach students will come to light and the respect educators expect from students will become disingenuous.\"\n\nNorth Eastern Hill University economics professor Sudhanshu K. Mishra in 2010 defined the phrase as: \"A lie-to-children is a lie, often a platitude, which may use euphemism(s), which is told to make an adult subject acceptable to children.\" Mishra gave as an example parents who engage in mythology by lying to their children and telling them they were brought by a stork to the house, instead of explaining childbirth. In a 2011 contribution to the academic journal \"Digital Difference\", Hamish Macleod and Jen Ross discussed the lie-to-children concept and wrote that this teaching methodology can have the negative impact of introducing studying difficulties to students as they progress further in their education. They cautioned this could lead to a negative influence on students' future behaviors. Macleod and Ross wrote: \"Playing devil's advocate is in itself a challenging notion for many learners, who may, especially in their early years of higher education, be conditioned by what Stewart and Cohen call 'lies to children' to expect simple and unambiguous questions and equally simple answers.\"\nWriting in 2011 for the Carleton College website, geophysicist Kim Kastens in a column with her daughter at first found the notion of lie-to-children as surprising. Kastens delved further into the issue, and identified specific instances where a lie-to-children teaching technique would do more harm than good for students. The worst examples included a lie-to-children which would later have to be unlearned following teaching from subsequent professors, an instance where the student is successfully able to identify the factual inaccuracy and knows more about it than the teacher, and using the technique without having a \"master plan\" involving progressive learning. In her 2011 book \"The Children's Bill of Emotional Rights\", Eileen Johnson discussed the lies told by parents to their children during the formation of childhood fictional mythology and pointed out the inherent problems this could raise in the future during the parenting process. Johnson cautioned: \"Why do we tell these lies to children? At some point we have to admit we were lying. Parents are not sure how much of this deceit is right, how far to go with it, and how and when to explain it was all a lie.\"\n\nKirsten Walsh and Adrian Currie contributed a 2015 article to the journal \"Metaphilosophy\" in which they quoted the verbatim definition of lie-to-children from \"The Science of Discworld\" and discussed the impact of such behavior on students. Walsh and Currie concluded that mythmaking within education in order to teach a more complex concept is a form of unwarranted behavior with detrimental impact upon instruction methodology. In a 2015 article, \"The Conversation\" compared the concept to Wittgenstein's ladder, and defined it: \"that in order to get across a complicated idea, sometimes you need to use an explanation that is actually wrong but which helps a child – or anyone learning about anything complex – build an understanding of that issue.\"\n\nWriting for \"Forbes\" in 2015, physics professor and science journalist Chad Orzel explained the concept: \"Lies-to-children are not strictly true, but they’re simplified in a way that makes them easier to grasp for children, and provide a framework that allows for future elaboration.\" Orzel praised the University of California Museum of Paleontology initiative \"Understanding Science\" for its strategy of going beyond a simple explanation of the scientific method in a lie-to-children format, and instead going into more depth and specifics to directly inform others on how science impacts their daily quality of living.\n\nBritish writer Tim Worstall expounded upon the lie-to-children phenomenon in education, in a 2015 article for \"Forbes\". He wrote: \"that’s what Terry Pratchett pointed out education was: lies to children to help them make some sense of the world. When they become older, more capable of nuance, then we point this out to them: those previous stories were gross simplifications and now you need to know the caveats.\" Worstall stressed that this form of educational methodology was ubiquitous across multiple academic disciplines: \"This is true of any form of education by the way. We don’t start music classes with atonality, we start with simple scales. We don’t do syncopation until we’ve mastered 2/4 and 4/4. Einstein’s corrections at the margin to Newton come quite late in a physics education.\"\n\n\n"}

She trained at the Ballet School of the Sociedad Pro-Arte Musical de La Habana and at the Alicia Alonso Ballet Academy.\n\nAraújo joined the BNC in 1955 (1959 is also mentioned) and was promoted to principal ballerina in 1965. In 1973, she associated with Ballet National de Marseille where she again held the position of prima ballerina, becoming a muse for Roland Petit. Araújo was a guest performer with the Béjart Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, Bulgarian National Opera and Ballet, Maly Theatre, and Royal Danish Ballet.\n\nWhen she was 21 years old, Araújo began teaching at the BNC, transitioning in later years to ballet mistress. Other teaching opportunities occurred at the Béjart Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Opéra National de Bordeaux, Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, Teatro alla Scala, and Teatro di San Carlo. In September 2012, Araújo joined the English National Ballet, where she is the Associate Artistic Director.\n\nAmong Araújo's many Cuban honors are the Distinción Por la Cultura Nacional, Medalla Alejo Carpentier, Orden Félix Varela, Premio Anual del Gran Teatro de La Habana, Medalla Fernando Ortiz, Premio Nacional de Danza, Doctora \"Honoris Causa\" en Arte, and Member emeritus National Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba. Her international awards include the Gold Medal (Varna, 1965), Silver Medal (Moscow, 1969), and Gold star at the Champs Elysées Ballet Festival (Paris, 1970). She was honored with the Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur by France in 2011.\n"}

It offers part-time non-degree courses on a wide range of topics within philosophy. It was founded in 2010 by lecturers from Birkbeck College. It is based within Conway Hall, in Bloomsbury.\n\nIn 2009, the long-established School of Continuing Education at Birkbeck, University of London, which specialised in extra-mural studies, was abolished and its activities integrated into the main college. The following year, as part of this re-organisation, the number of part-time philosophy courses for adults was sharply reduced. Seven of Birkbeck's philosophy lecturers responded to the cancellation of their courses by meeting to establish a new college, the London School of Philosophy (LSP). \n\nThe LSP's seven founders organised themselves on a cooperative basis and agreed a constitution in 2010. The first lectures took place in January 2011. A launch event was held on 6 September 2011.\n\nIn 2011 the London School of Philosophy announced a collaborative agreement with Conway Hall to base all its teaching activities there. \n\nConway Hall is a large art-deco building on Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury, built in 1929. It is the venue for a wide range of concerts, lectures and other cultural events. The building also houses the Humanist Library, which includes a sizeable philosophy section.\n\nCourses at the college cover topics such as ‘Philosophy and Theatre’, ‘Philosophy of Love’; ‘Existentialism’; and ‘Philosophy and Biology’ alongside others on ethics, aesthetics and the history of philosophy.\n\nIn 2013 the London School of Philosophy for the first time entered a collaborative arrangement with Birkbeck's Department of Philosophy and with Conway Hall, to offer a Summer School on philosophy, which was held over several days at the beginning of July.\n\nThe LSP's second annual Summer School, in 2014, was a collaboration with Heythrop College and Conway Hall. The speakers included Professor John Cottingham, Professor Keith Ward, Dr Anna Abram, Dr Piers Benn, Dr Stephen Law and Dr Adam Stewart-Wallace (all from Heythrop), Dr Shahrar Ali, Dr Keith Barrett and Dr Anja Steinbauer (from London School of Philosophy) and special guest speakers Dr Roger Scruton, Emeritus Professor Richard Norman (Kent) and Professor Ken Gemes (Birkbeck). \n\nAs the London School of Philosophy offers only part-time courses, student life is not centralised. The college does not offer halls of residence. At lunchtimes, LSP students often gather at the open-air Park Café in Red Lion Square Gardens.\n\n"}

{"id": "194034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194034", "title": "Miss America", "text": "Miss America\n\nMiss America is an annual competition that is open to women from the United States between the ages of 17 and 25.\nOriginating in 1921 as a \"bathing beauty revue\", the contest is now judged on competitors' talent performances and interviews. As of 2018, there is no longer a swimsuit portion to the contest, or consideration of physical appearance. Miss America travels about 20,000 miles a month, changing her location every 24 to 48 hours, touring the nation and promoting her particular platform of interest. The winner is crowned by the previous year's titleholder.\n\nThe current titleholder, Miss America 2019, is Miss New York 2018, Nia Franklin, who was crowned on September 9, 2018, by her predecessor Cara Mund (Miss America 2018).\n\nOn February 1, 1919, there was a beauty pageant held in the Chu Chin Chow Ball at the Hotel des Artistes in New York City. The winner, Edith Hyde Robbins Macartney, was called \"Miss America.\" Neither the title nor this pageant were related to the current \"Miss American Pageant\" which would develop a year later in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Rather, the origins of the \"Miss America Pageant\" lie in an event entitled \"The Fall Frolic\" which was held on September 25, 1920, in Atlantic City. This event was designed to bring business to the Boardwalk: \"three hundred and fifty gaily decorated rolling wicker chairs were pushed along the parade route. Three hundred and fifty men pushed the chairs. However, the main attractions were the young 'maidens' who sat in the rolling chairs, headed by a Miss Ernestine Cremona, who was dressed in a flowing white robe and represented 'Peace.'\"\n\nThe event was so successful that \"The Businessmen's League\" planned to repeat it the following year as a beauty pageant or a \"bather's revue\" (to capitalize on the popularity of newspaper-based beauty contests that used photo submissions). The event was scheduled to take place the week-end following Labor Day, to encourage summer visitors to stay in Atlantic City. Thus, \"newspapers as far west as Pittsburgh and as far south as Washington, D.C., were asked to sponsor local beauty contests. The winners would participate in the Atlantic City contest. If the local newspaper would pay for the winner's wardrobe, the Atlantic City Businessmen's League would pay for the contestant's travel to compete in the Inter-City Beauty Contest.\" Herb Test, a \"newspaperman\", coined the term for the winner: \"Miss America.\" On September 8, 1921, 100,000 people gathered at the Boardwalk to watch the contestants from Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Ocean City, Camden, Newark, New York, and Philadelphia. The 16-year-old winner from Washington, D.C., Margaret Gorman, was crowned the \"Golden Mermaid\" and won $100.\n\nThe pageant continued consistently over the next eight decades except for the years 1928–1932, when it was temporarily shut down due to financial problems associated with the Great Depression and suggestions that it promoted \"loose morals.\" With its revival in 1933, 15-year-old Marian Bergeron won, prompting future contestants to be between the ages of 18 and 26. In 1935, Lenora Slaughter was hired to \"re-invent\" the pageant and served for 32 years as its Director. By 1938, a talent section was added to the competition, and contestants were required to have a chaperone. In 1940, the title officially became \"The Miss America Pageant\" and the pageant was held in Atlantic City's Convention Hall. In 1944, compensation for \"Miss America\" switched from \"furs and movie contracts\" to college scholarships, an idea generally credited to Jean Bartel, Miss America 1943.\n\nDuring the early years of the pageant, under the directorship of Lenora Slaughter, it became segregated via rule number seven that stated: \"contestants must be of good health and of the white race.\" Rule number seven was abolished in 1950. Miss New York 1945, Bess Myerson, the only Jewish American winner to date, became Miss America 1945 and faced antisemitism during her time as Miss America, leading to a cutback in her official duties. Although there were Native American, Latina, and Asian-American contestants, there were no African-American contestants for fifty years (African-Americans appeared in musical numbers as far back as 1923, however, when they were cast as slaves).\n\nIn 1970, however, Cheryl Browne, Miss Iowa 1970, competed as the first African-American contestant in the Miss America 1971 pageant. She also participated in one of the last USO-Miss America tours in Vietnam. A decade later in 1983, Miss New York (and Miss Syracuse) 1983, Vanessa Williams (the first African-American woman to win the competition as Miss America 1984), faced discrimination in response to her win and later resigned under pressure due to a scandal involving nude photographs. Three decades after these events, Miss New York (and Miss Syracuse) 2013, Nina Davuluri, the first Indian-American woman to win the crown as Miss America 2014, faced xenophobic and racist comments in social media when she won. Two years later at the Miss America 2016 pageant, former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell apologized to Vanessa Williams (who was serving as head judge) for what was said to her during the events of 1984.\n\nIn 2018, the pageant ended the swimsuit portion of the competition. Gretchen Carlson, the organization’s chairwoman, who was Miss America in 1989, explained on ABC's \"Good Morning America\": “We are not going to judge you on your outward appearance... We are moving it forward and evolving it in this cultural revolution.”\n\nMargaret Gorman, Miss District of Columbia, was declared \"The Most Beautiful Bathing Girl in America\" in 1921 at the age of 16 and was recognized as the first \"Miss America\" when she returned to compete the next year. The contest that year was won by Mary Katherine Campbell (Miss Ohio), who won again in 1923. She returned to compete a third time in 1924 but placed as first runner-up that year, and pageant rules were then amended to prevent anyone from winning more than once. Beginning in 1940, Bob Russell served as the first official host of the pageant. In 1941, Mifauny Shunatona, Miss Oklahoma, became the first Native American contestant.\n\nIn 1945, Bess Myerson became the first Jewish-American and the first Miss New York (competing as Miss New York City, a competition organized by a local radio station) to win the Miss America pageant as Miss America 1945. As the only Jewish contestant, Myerson was encouraged by the pageant directors to change her name to \"Bess Meredith\" or \"Beth Merrick\", but she refused. After winning the title (and as a Jewish Miss America), Myerson received few endorsements and later recalled that \"I couldn't even stay in certain hotels […] there would be signs that read no coloreds, no Jews, no dogs. I felt so rejected. Here I was chosen to represent American womanhood and then America treated me like this.\" She thus cut short her Miss America tour and instead traveled with the Anti-Defamation League. In this capacity, she spoke against discrimination in a talk entitled, \"You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate.\"\n\nIn 1948, Irma Nydia Vasquez, the first Miss Puerto Rico, became the first Latina contestant. In addition, in 1948, Yun Tau Chee, the first Miss Hawaii, was also the first Asian-American contestant. Miss America 1949, Jacque Mercer, was married and divorced during her reign; after this, a rule was enacted requiring Miss America contestants to sign a certification that they have never been married or pregnant. Starting in 1950, although the pageant continued to be in September, the Miss America title changed to \"post-dated\", thus that year's pageant winner became Miss America 1951, and there was no Miss America 1950. The pageant was first televised nationally in 1954, hosted by Bob Russell. Future television star Lee Meriwether was crowned Miss America 1955. It would also be the last time Russell served as host. He recommended, and was replaced by, Bert Parks, who served as the host for the second televised pageant in 1955 and stayed as host until 1979. Television viewership peaked during the early 1960s, when it was the highest-rated program on American television.\n\nWith the rise of second-wave feminism and the civil rights movement during the 1960s, the Miss America pageant became the subject of a series of protests that attacked it as sexist, racist, and part of U.S. militarism. The first demonstration took place during the Miss America 1969 pageant held on September 7, 1968 (won by Miss Illinois 1968, Judith Ford), when about 200 members of the group New York Radical Women demonstrated as part of the Miss America protest. In addition, a pamphlet distributed at the protest by Robin Morgan, \"No More Miss America!\", became a source for feminist scholarship. The protest was co-sponsored by Florynce Kennedy's Media Workshop, an activist group she founded in 1966 to protest the media's representation of African Americans, along with the feminist Jeanette Rankin Brigade and the ACLU. Morgan later stated that the Miss America pageant \"was chosen as a target for a number of reasons: it has always been a lily-white, racist contest; the winner tours Vietnam, entertaining the troops as a 'Murder Mascot'; the whole gimmick is one commercial shillgame to sell the sponsor's products. Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values—racism, militarism, sexism—all packaged in one ‘ideal symbol,’ a woman.\" The protesters compared the pageant to a county fair where livestock are judged. They thus crowned a sheep as Miss America and symbolically destroyed a number of feminine products, including false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, girdles, corsets, and bras. Burning the contents of a trash can was suggested, but a permit was unobtainable; news media seized on the similarity between draft resisters burning draft cards and women burning their bras. In fact, there was no bra burning, nor did anyone remove her bra. The Women's Liberation Front later demonstrated at the Miss America 1971 pageant.\n\nMiss Iowa 1970, Cheryl Browne, became the first African American contestant in the competition's history during the Miss America 1971 pageant (September 12, 1970). She drew attention from reporters and from security personnel in Atlantic City who maintained a visible presence during pageant rehearsals. Browne was not a finalist, however, losing to future media personality, Miss Texas 1970, Phyllis George. In August 1971, Browne traveled to Vietnam with George, Miss Nevada 1970, Vicky Jo Todd, Miss New Jersey 1970, Hela Yungst, Miss Arizona 1970, Karen Shields, Miss Arkansas 1970, Donna Connelly, and Miss Texas 1970 (George's replacement), Belinda Myrick. They participated in a 22-day United Service Organizations tour for American troops that began in Saigon. Browne later commented that she thought \"it was one of the last Miss America groups to go to Vietnam.\" Miss Arkansas 1980, Lencola Sullivan, finished the Miss America 1981 pageant (September 6, 1980) as fourth runner-up, making her the first African American contestant to place in the top five.\n\nA few years later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won the title of Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown. Williams later commented that she was one of five minority contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham \"had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [1983].\" She also pointed out that \"Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial. But when the press started, when I would go out on the – on the tour and do my appearances, and people would come up and say they never thought they'd see the day that it would happen; when people would want to shake my hand, and you'd see tears in their eyes, and they'd say, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime – that's when, you know, it was definitely a very special honor.\" Williams' reign as Miss America was not without its challenges and controversies, however. For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and hate mail. Williams was forced to resign seven weeks prior to the end of her time as Miss America, however, after the unauthorized publication of nude photos in \"Penthouse.\" First runner-up, Miss New Jersey 1983, Suzette Charles replaced her for the final weeks of Williams' reign. Thirty-two years after she resigned however, Vanessa Williams returned to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although \"none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.\" Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) said in an interview with \"Inside Edition\" that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings.\n\nIn 1985, Miss Utah 1984, Sharlene Wells Hawkes, became the first foreign-born, bilingual Miss America, as she was born in Asunción, Paraguay. Miss Alabama 1994, Heather Whitestone, won the 1995 pageant becoming the first deaf Miss America (she lost most of her hearing at the age of 18 months). At the Miss America 1999 pageant held on September 19, 1998, Nicole Johnson (Miss Virginia 1998) became the first Miss America with diabetes and the first contestant to publicize an insulin pump. Around the same time, Miss America officials announced they had lifted the ban on contestants who were divorced or had had an abortion. This rule change, however, was rescinded and Miss America CEO Robert L. Beck, who had suggested it, was fired. Angela Perez Baraquio, Miss Hawaii 2000, was crowned Miss America 2001, thereby becoming the first Asian-American, the first Filipino-American, as well as the first teacher ever to win the pageant.\n\nA few years later, the Miss America 2005 pageant held on September 18, 2004, would be the last one televised live on ABC (which dropped the pageant after this broadcast, as it \"drew a record-low 9.8 million viewers\") and the last one held in Atlantic City for ten years. Miss Alabama 2004, Deidre Downs, reigned as Miss America four months longer than usual as the Miss America 2006 pageant was moved to a January broadcast at the Las Vegas Strip's Theatre for the Performing Arts (Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino). It was also broadcast live on MTV Networks' Country Music Television. After two years, the pageant moved to TLC (the former Learning Channel). The Miss America 2011 pageant held on January 15, 2011, showcased Miss New York 2010, Claire Buffie, (the first Miss America contestant to advocate a gay-rights platform) and Miss Delaware 2010, Kayla Martell, (the first bald contestant). ABC also resumed broadcasting the pageant with the 2011 competition. The Miss America 2013 pageant, held on January 12, 2013, was the last one to take place in Las Vegas. Miss New York 2012, Mallory Hagan, won the competition but only served for eight months as the pageant moved back to its former broadcast slot in September 2013 Miss Montana 2012, Alexis Wineman, (\"America's Choice\" winner) was the pageant's first autistic contestant.\n\nWith the Miss America 2014 pageant, held on September 15, 2013, the competition returned to Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey. Miss New York (Nina Davuluri) won the title of Miss America. Davuluri was also the first Indian-American and second Asian-American to win the crown. Shortly after her win, however, Davuluri became the target of xenophobic and racist comments in social media relating the proximity of the event date to the 9/11 anniversary and to anti-Indian sentiment. News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab, associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda, and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas 2013, Theresa Vail, (a soldier who won the \"America's Choice\" award and was the first contestant to display tattoos during the swimsuit competition). Davuluri said that she was prepared for this backlash because \"as Miss New York, I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks\", and Vail denounced the social media backlash, offering her support to Davuluri. In addition, a torn ACL and MCL forced Miss Florida 2013, Myrrhanda Jones, to perform her baton routine with a decorated leg brace, while Nicole Kelly (Miss Iowa 2013) was the first contestant without a forearm to compete in the pageant.\n\nAmanda Longacre, who was crowned Miss Delaware 2014 and was preparing to compete in Miss America 2015, was stripped of the title and the crown because she was deemed to be too old. Longacre filed a $3 million lawsuit, and Miss America officials later blamed the error on state pageant officials whom, they said, \"missed the age discrepancy in Longacre's submitted paperwork.\" Miss New York 2014 (Kira Kazantsev) eventually won the title of Miss America 2015, making New York the first state to produce a winner for three consecutive years.\n\nIn September 2014, comedian John Oliver ran a segment on his show, \"Last Week Tonight\", that investigated the Miss America Organization's claim that it is \"the world's largest provider of scholarships for women.\" Oliver's team, which included four researchers with journalism backgrounds, collected and analyzed the organization's state and federal tax forms to find that the organization's scholarship program only distributes a small fraction of its claimed \"$45 million made available annually\". Oliver said that at the national level, the Miss America Organization and Miss America Foundation together spent only $482,000 in cash scholarships in 2012. Oliver found that at the state level, the Miss Alabama pageant claimed that it had provided $2,592,000 in scholarships to Troy University despite not actually distributing any such scholarships. The pageant appeared to multiply the value of a single available scholarship by the number of contestants theoretically eligible for it, while using the term \"provided\" in a way that did not mean \"distributed.\" The Miss America Organization responded by stating that Oliver affirmed that it provides the most scholarships to women and that the $45 million figure was based on all scholarships made available whether or not they are accepted. In February 2015, Sharon Pearce announced that she was stepping down from her role as President of the Miss America Organization. At that time, former CEO Sam Haskell was named Executive Chairman of the Miss America Organization, retained the title of CEO, and assumed all of Pearce's responsibilities. In addition, Miss America 2014, Nina Davuluri, was appointed one of the new trustees to the Miss America Foundation. In September 2015, Miss America officials announced that the organization grants $5.5 million in scholarships, a number which still includes adding together offers of in-kind tuition waivers from multiple schools when a contestant could accept one at most.\n\nOn March 24, 2016, the Miss America Organization announced a contract renewal with ABC to continue carrying the pageant for the next three years to the 2019 edition.\n\nIn June 2016, Erin O'Flaherty was crowned Miss Missouri, becoming the first openly lesbian Miss America contestant.\n\nIn late December 2017, HuffPost published an article exposing derogatory emails sent and received by CEO Sam Haskell, board members Tammy Haddad and Lynn Weidner, and lead writer Lewis Friedman. The emails, sent between 2014 and 2017, featured instances of expletive name-calling and unprofessional comments. The comments were often sexual or violent in nature and targeted former Miss America winners, notably Mallory Hagan and Katherine Shindle, both of whom joined 47 other former Miss Americas (including all Miss Americas from 1988 to 2017) in signing a joint open letter calling for the firing or resignation of all involved. On December 22, the Miss America Organization released statements to \"USA Today\", saying that it was made aware of concerns several months prior. They stated that the organization does not \"condone the use of inappropriate language\" and reported that its investigation had determined that Haskell was under \"unreasonable distress resulting from intense attacks on his family from disgruntled stakeholders\". The organization also reported that its relationship with Friedman had been terminated. Haskell explained that attacks on his character impaired his judgment when responding to the emails. Miss America's board of directors also suspended Haskell, who released a statement labeling the HuffPost article \"unkind and untrue\". Hagan and Shindle criticized the decision to suspend Haskell, rather than fire him, as inadequate. The following day, the President of Miss America, Josh Randle; executive chairwoman Lynn Weidner; and Haskell all resigned. The scandal prompted the pageant's producer, Dick Clark Productions, to cut ties, and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) announced that it was reconsidering its contract with Miss America, with its executive director Chris Howard describing the scandal as \"troubling\", and both Frank Gilliam, incoming mayor of Atlantic City, and State Senator Colin Bell called for CRDA to end its relationship with Miss America. On December 24, Haddad also resigned.\n\nIn January 2018, Gretchen Carlson, who won the Miss America in 1989, was elected as the new chairwoman of the organization, becoming the first former Miss America to serve as its leader. Katherine Shindle, Miss America 1998, was also appointed to the board alongside fellow Miss America winners, Heather French Henry (2000) and Laura Kaeppeler (2012). This move led to a number of changes. In June 2018, there was an announcement that Miss America contestants would no longer be judged based on their physical appearance. Thus, the national Miss America event would be considered a competition, rather than a beauty pageant, and the titleholders would now be candidates, rather than contestants. The swimsuit competition was replaced with state titleholders participating in a live interactive session with the judges. For the evening gown competition, the contestants chose clothing, \"that makes them feel confident, expresses their personal style, and shows how they hope to advance the role of Miss America.\" In interviews, Gretchen Carlson emphasized the organization's desire to be more welcoming, \"open, transparent, [and] inclusive to women,\" and to prioritize displaying the talent and scholarship in the contestants. The talent portion was worth 50% of the contestants' preliminary score. Additionally, the new board of directors increased the maximum age of titleholders to 25 years old, from 24. Therefore, contestants cannot be older than 25 years old on December 31 in the calendar year of her state competition.\n\nIn August 2018, Miss America 2018 Cara Mund gave an interview to The Press of Atlantic City in which she stated that it has \"been a tough year.” She then wrote an open letter to former Miss Americas a few weeks later, in order to explain her comments. In the letter she states that the current leadership had “silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America.” She also stated that her \"voice is not heard nor wanted by our current leadership …nor do they have any interest in knowing who I am and how my experiences relate to positioning the organization for the future.” Chairwoman Gretchen Carlson has denied Mund's claims. However, at the time the Miss America 2019 competition began, 46 of 51 state organizations (as well as 23 former Miss America winners) had signed a petition calling for the resignation of Carlson and CEO, Regina Hopper, from the Miss America Organization.<ref name=\"USATD 9/18\"></ref> The states who had not signed were Arkansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, and Vermont.\n\nOn September 5, 2018, Fox Rothschild LLP, a law firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a breach-of-contract suit against the Miss America Organization for failing to pay nearly $100,000 for legal services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They recently competed with their vehicle named \"Tigergen III\" in the 2013 Shell Eco-Marathon. At the competition they achieved 8.8 mi/kWh which placed them 3rd in the UrbanConcept Hydrogen category. The team also won an off-track award for \"Best Team Spirit\"\n\nThe team, located on the campus of the University of Missouri and run entirely by students, seeks to promote awareness of alternative fuels, develop technology, and allow members to gain practical experience through constructing a hydrogen vehicle. Advised by Professor Richard Whelove of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, as well as Richard Wallace of the Electrical Engineering Department, the team was formerly known as the Mizzou Solar Car Team. The team switched over to hydrogen after 6 generations of solar cars. The team remains advised by Richard Whelove, alongside Michael Devaney of the Electrical Engineering Department. The team's first venture into hydrogen powered vehicles was with Tigergen I which ran on two 1.2 kW Ballard fuel cells and exhibitioned in the North American Solar Challenge as a demonstration vehicle. The team's second vehicle, Tigergen II, operated on a single 1.2 kW Ballard fuel cell and competed in the Urban Concept category of the Shell Eco Marathon, winning first place in the hydrogen category and fourth place overall in 2011. The team's current vehicle, Tigergen III, operates on two 1 kW Horizon fuel cells and competed Shell Eco Marathon Americas competition, placing third in the hydrogen UrbanConcept category.\n\nThe body and chassis of Tigergen III is integrated as a partial-load bearing system in a partial-monocoque design. This construction technique saves weight without compromising the structural integrity of the vehicle. To further reduce weight, Tigergen III's partial monocoque structure is composed entirely of composite materials. Carbon fiber and nomex material is used extensively throughout the car. Tigergen III uses Horizon hydrogen fuels cell to convert energy from hydrogen gas into electricity which is then used to power the vehicle's electric motor. Safety is a priority in Tigergen III. The driver is secured with a five-point racing safety harness along with the driver being separated from all components of the fuel system by a fire-resistant bulkhead and easy access to a fire extinguisher. Tigergen III competed in the 2012 and 2013 Shell Eco-Marathons.\n\nThe purpose of the Shell Eco Marathon race is to drive as far as possible on the least amount of fuel. The competition is based on efficiency rather than speed and awards are given to teams that use the least amount of fuel while driving on a 6-mile circuit. The Urban Concept category subjects vehicles to constraints that resemble those of a consumer vehicle such as brake lights, luggage space, and four wheels along with stop-and-go driving. The next competition takes place March 2012 at Discovery Green in Houston, TX.\n\nThe team competed for the first time with their vehicle named \"Tigergen II\" in the Shell Eco-Marathon although it did not finish the race due to technical difficulties. The team was awarded a trophy and monetary prize for the \"Perseverance in the Face of Adversity\" as a result of the hard work they did to get the car working at the race.\n\nIn 2011 the team competed for the second time with Tigergen II with much greater success than before. Tigergen II completed all six\nruns to receive six qualifying results. Run 2 experienced a technical problem but the fuel cell was rebooted and the run was completed. Of the six runs the highest efficiency obtained was on run \"5\" with 13.79 mi/kWh or 476 MPG. The team was awarded with First Prize for the Hydrogen Category in the Urban Concept Division. The team was also awarded a trophy and monetary prize for \"Best Team Spirit\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1667068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1667068", "title": "Ragging", "text": "Ragging\n\nRagging is the term used for the so-called \"initiation ritual\" practiced in higher education institutions in South Asian countries, including India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The practice is similar to hazing in North America, bizutage in France, praxe in Portugal and other similar practices in educational institutions across the world. Ragging involves abuse, humiliation or harassment of new entrants or junior students by their seniors. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to psychological or physical torture.\nIn 2009 the University Grants Commission of India imposed regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging, and launched a toll-free 'anti-ragging helpline'.\n\nInception of ragging can be pleasant at first, hence the name 'Mal Samaya'. During this week or so, all newcomers are ordered to memorize the name and hometown of their peers. The objective of this exercise is said to be increasing the friendship among batch mates (locally termed as \"batch fit\").\n\nThe freshmen are asked to dress in a specific dress code for a particular period of time. The dress code prescribed is generally unusual, e.g. dressing completely in white or black with the hair oiled and combed in a particular style, dressing shirts that do not contain stripes, dressing long skirts for girls. Dress code ragging may make freshmen feel uncomfortable, as it often brings them unnecessary attention from everybody else.\n\nVerbal torture involves indulging in loose talks. The freshmen may be asked to sing the lyrics of any vulgar song or use abusive language in the presence of a large number of peers. During this time, seniors assign an abusive and demeaning nickname, known as \"card\" to the juniors and they have to be called by that name throughout their entire university life. In some universities, this nickname is changed to a less vulgar name after the ragging period. These aliases are used primarily as a means of preventing the university authorities identifying the students who are involved in ragging and other unlawful activities. The form of verbal ragging differs from one institution to another. In some universities, students have to memorize poems made up of filth and recite them in front of others.\n\nThe freshers are asked to do various tasks, such as sit-ups or push-ups, sitting in the murga pose, being forced to call seniors as sir, or removing their shirts. On an attempt to resist carrying out the activities, they may beat the fresher with baseball bats or slap them. \n\nThough, in India, if a complaint is lodged against that senior, they (and others who were present that time) will be given a strict punishment such as expulsion from university, imprisonment for a year etc.\n\nThe seniors may attempt to harass or threaten the junior to complete their assignments, bunk classes, not to take part in any activities or be a part of clubs etc. \n\nAlthough, it comes under extreme cases of ragging and on complaint will lead to strict punishment to the seniors\n\nHighly reputed Indian colleges have a history of ragging especially medical colleges. It has become increasingly unpopular due to several complaints of serious injury to the victims and stringent laws pertaining to ragging. Ragging is now defined as an act that violates or is perceived to violate an individual student's dignity.\n\nFollowing Supreme Court orders, a National Anti-Ragging Helpline was launched by the Indian government.\n\nA high-level committee in 2009, which probed the death of Aman Kachroo, revealed that alcohol was the main reason leading to serious form of ragging and violence in the campus.\n\nA report from 2007 highlights 42 instances of physical injury, and reports on ten deaths purportedly the result of ragging: Ragging has reportedly caused at least 30–31 deaths in the last seven years. In the 2007 session, approximately seven ragging deaths have been reported. In addition, a number of freshmen were severely traumatised to the extent that they were admitted to mental institutions.\nRagging in India commonly involves serious abuses and clear violations of human rights. Often media reports and others unearth that it goes on, in many institutions, in the infamous Abu Ghraib style: and on innocent victims.\n\nHowever, the Anti-Ragging NGO, Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE) has supported that ragging is also widely and dangerously prevalent in engineering and other institutions, mainly in the hostels.\n\nFollowing a Supreme Court Order, a National Anti-Ragging Helpline was created which helps the victims and take action in cases of ragging, by informing the head of the institution and the local police authorities of the ragging complaint from the college. The main feature of the helpline is that the complaints can be registered even without disclosing the name by the victim, through email at helpline@antiragging.in, or through phone at 1800-180-5522.\n\nIndia's National Anti-Ragging Helpline started working in June 2009 to help students in distress due to ragging. It consists of an email id and a 24-hour toll-free number. Provision for anonymous complaints was considered of utmost important at the time of establishment of the helpline, since the victim after making the complaint remains with or close to the culprits, away from a fully secure environment. Since many ragging deaths, like Aman Kachroo's, occurred due to seniors taking a revenge of the complaint made, anonymous complaints were equally allowed at the helpline.\n\nAs per UGC regulations, it is mandatory for a college to register an F.I.R. with police against the culprits if any violence, physical abuse, sexual harassment, confinement etc. takes place with any fresher. After receiving any such complaint from the helpline, it becomes the duty of the head of the institution to register the F.I.R. with police within 24 hours. In 2013, a police case was registered against the director, dean and registrar of a reputed college in Delhi for, among other charges, not informing the police and registering F.I.R. within 24 hours of receiving the ragging complaint. (failing to inform a public authority, IPC 176).\n\nThe database of the Anti-Ragging Helpline indicates that it has been to an extent successful in ensuring a safer environment in colleges from where it registered the complaints. In many a cases though, it forwarded the complaint to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for an action against those colleges which refused to take any action against the culprits.\n\nA major concern that was highlighted against the helpline was that it registered a minuscule percentage (0.1%) of the total phone calls it received, and that meant it registered complaint in one out of one thousand calls it received. Specifically, the toll-free helpline (1800-180-5522) received calls in the three months of November 2012 to January 2013, hence 77 calls an hour and at least a call a minute. But, only 190 complaints were registered in this period. In its defence, the helpline said that most of the calls it received were of inquiry in nature, of the eager students to know whether the helpline number worked or not. Many a times students changed their minds also midway not to register the complaint. It also said that many of the calls were hoaxes as it was a toll-free number.\n\nIn 1997, the state of Tamil Nadu first passed laws related to ragging. Subsequently, a\nmajor boost to anti-ragging efforts was given by a landmark judgement of the Supreme Court of India in May 2001, in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by the Vishwa Jagriti Mission.\n\nThe Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), following a directive by the Supreme court, appointed a seven-member panel headed by ex-CBI director Dr. R. K. Raghavan to recommend anti-ragging measures.\nThe Raghavan Committee report,\nsubmitted to the court in May 2007, includes a proposal to include ragging as a special section under the Indian Penal Code. The Supreme Court of India interim order (based on the recommendations) dated 16 May 2007 makes it obligatory for academic institutions to file official First Information Reports with the police in any instance of a complaint of ragging. This would ensure that all cases would be formally investigated under\ncriminal justice system, and not by the academic institutions own ad-hoc bodies.\n\nThe Indian Supreme Court has taken a strong stand to prevent ragging. In 2006, the court directed the H.R.D. Ministry of the Govt. of India to form a panel which will suggest guidelines to control ragging.\n\nThe panel, headed by the former director of CBI Dr. R.K.Raghavan, met victims, guardians and others across the country. The Raghavan committee has placed its recommendation to the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which has given its order on the issue.\n\nWelcoming the Supreme Court's recent judgment on ragging Dr. Raghavan, the former CBI director, who is the chairman, Monitoring Committee for the Prevention of Ragging, said, \"there are finally signs that the recommendations to prevent ragging in colleges will be taken seriously.\"\n\nSupreme Court in 2007 directed that all the higher educational institutions should include information about all the ragging incidents in their brochures/prospectus of admission.\n\nIn 2009, in the wake of Aman Kachroo's death, University Grants Commission (UGC) passed UGC regulation on curbing the menace of ragging in higher educational institutions, 2009. These regulation mandate every college responsibilities to curb the menace of ragging, including strict pre-emptive measures, like lodging freshers in a separate hostel, surprise raids especially at nights by the anti-ragging squad and submission of affidavits by all senior students and their parents taking oath not to indulge in ragging.\n\nSubsequently, UGC has made few amendments to the Regulation. As per these,\n\n\nWith the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is emerging a spontaneous anti-ragging movement in India. Several voluntary organisations have emerged, who conduct drives for public awareness and arrange for support to victims.\n\nOnline groups like Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education (CURE), Stopragging, No Ragging Foundation became the major anti-ragging groups on the Internet. Among them, the No Ragging Foundation has transformed into a complete NGO and got registered as Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE) which is India's first registered anti-ragging nonprofit organisation (NGO).\n\nThe Indian media has been playing a crucial role by exposing ragging incidents and the indifference of many concerned institutions towards curbing the act. The Supreme Court of India has directed, in its interim judgement, that action may be taken even against negligent institutions.\n\nRagging is widely prevalent in Sri Lanka.\n\nThere is no record to suggest that ragging is an indigenous phenomenon or was present in the ancient Sri Lankan educational institutions such as Mahavihara or Abhayagiri Vihara. It is widely considered to have been introduced during the post World War II era as a result of British colonialism in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan soldiers returning from war re-entered the college educational system and brought with them the tradition and techniques of military style ragging. These techniques were used in the military as a mechanism of breaking down an individual so that success was achieved through team effort rather than personal goals or motivation. As fewer military persons entered the universities, ragging devolved into a violent and hazardous exercise that has been largely utilized for political purposes and thuggery.\n\nRagging continues in most government universities and several private institutions with some efforts being made to contain the problem although there is hesitation from administrations to get involved. These efforts have been largely hindered by students themselves who consider ragging as a rite of passage. The creation of 'safe spaces' and travelling in larger groups are just some techniques employed by a growing movement of students trying to combat ragging. \nTraditionally, ragging would entail seniors mocking or jeering at freshers within a dedicated period of time – usually the first few months of an undergraduates university life. This period is known as the 'ragging period'. In Sri Lanka, several variations of ragging can be observed.\n\nRagging has been frequently associated with a broad spectrum of physical, behavioral, emotional and social problems among victims and is attributed to the increased risk of suicide and drop-outs among students attending Sri Lankan universities. Ragging at private universities and higher education institutes are at a minimum as compared to government universities which has prompted many students with financial means to enroll in private establishments. \nRagging is not merely a sociolegal problem and has a certain psychological basis too. Many senior students state they do not wish to rag juniors but succumb to peer pressure.\n\n\nThe human rights of citizens of Sri Lanka are protected in terms of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka which is the supreme law in the country. According to this Constitution, any citizen can produce a petition to the Supreme Court in terms of the article 126 of the Constitution in case of a human right violation or a case closer to the infringement. The Constitution further highlights ruthless, brutal or contemptuous treatment to any party by another as a violation of human rights. University students are also considered as citizens and are subjugated to the Common Law that prevails in the country. Accordingly, the constitutional constrains specified above are equally applicable to university students. Any form of civil or criminal offence executed by them are liable to be punished and in an instance of violation of such rights committed by university students, they shall be produced before the relevant court and subject to suitable punishment that followed by the trial. After the series of ragging-related incidents happened in 1997, \"Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998\" was passed in the Sri Lankan parliament. As specified in the detailed note of the Act, it is identified as an Act to eliminate ragging and other forms of violent and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment from educational institutions. The Act specifies the relevant Higher Educational Institutions coming under the Act and that includes all the Higher Educational Institutions established under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.\n\nUnlike in India, there is no official anti-ragging movement in Sri Lanka. But with the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is a spontaneously emerging anti-ragging movement in each and every faculty of the universities that ragging exists. In the case of University of Peradeniya, the largest university in Sri Lanka, anti-ragging movement emerged in the year 1996. Prior to that, there was no movement against ragging, but certain individuals managed escape from the ragging. In the mean time, anti-ragging movements started to appear in all other universities. Several faculties in several universities have become rag-free due to these movements, strengthened laws as well as practical difficulties in conducting ragging such as not providing accommodation facilities to the first-year students. Internal clashes have erupted several times due to the friction between ragging and anti-ragging movements, best example being Samantha Vithanage, a third-year management student at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, who pioneered an anti-ragging campaign that was killed at a meeting while in a discussion about ragging. The higher education minister at the time, S. B. Dissanayake, stressed that firm action will be taken against those who are found guilty of such activities in future and would be expelled from the university. In December 2011, he claimed that the levels of ragging has gone down drastically in the recent times and \"only Peradeniya and Ruhuna are still affected by this 'malaise'\".\n\n\n"}

It is a project being run in Mawere District located in the Nyanza Province of Kenya. Its purpose is to build a self-sustaining solar energy and water management school in the area by 2016.\n\nSince 1992 ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya have been running their development programs in Kenya through offices based in Majiwe District at the ARO Development Centre. In an effort to make the centre more environmentally sustainable a partnership agreement was struck with Elkem Solar. Elkem installed solar panels in ARO Development Centre which is very close to the equator and thus in a prime position for Elkem to simultaneously carry out research and development on the solar panels. The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand.\n\nARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with Kvadraturen School(also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in Kisumu Polytechnic a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.\n\nNORAD is funding the project as part of their development activities. Vest-Agder County Municipality has also pledged their support, donating funds and seeking other ways of involvement.\n\nIn 2010 the project officially began with the granting of funds by NORAD for a pilot project and the carrying out of feasibility research. The land on which the school will be built was acquired in 2011. The plot of land is located in Mawere District which is 100 kilometres from Kisumu. Construction has begun on the school using materials that have been developed in Kisumu Polytechnic. A delegation from Kisumu Polytechnic will be visiting Kristiansand in the month of May in order to discuss the way forward with Kvadraturen School and ARC-Aid.\n"}

It involves invoking a scram, or emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor. Written in Atari BASIC, \"Scram\" uses differential equations to simulate reactor behavior. The player controls the valves and switches of a nuclear reactor directly with the joystick.\n\nThis game's title, SCRAM, is taken from the nuclear reactor safe-word conceived at the University of Chicago in 1942. It stands for \"Start Cutting Right Away, Man\", and it refers to cutting a reactor's control rods so they fall into the nuclear material and stop the reaction process. The game also recreates the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear reactor, and allowed players to recreate the events that took place there in 1979.\n\nThe game display shows a schematic-like representation of a light water reactor, typical of nuclear reactors in use in the United States at that time. The reactor core is on the left of the screen, with the primary coolant loop to its immediate right. Further right is the secondary cooling loop, and finally the tertiary cooling loop and its associated cooling tower.\n\nThe user interacts with the game by moving the joystick, which makes a cursor jump from one \"hot spot\" to another on the screen, each one controlling one part of the reactor systems. There are hot spots for the control rods, cooling pumps and valves. The user can experiment with the reactor systems by moving the joystick up and down, operating the equipment. It is possible to simulate a meltdown by shutting off the primary cooling pumps and withdrawing the control rods all the way.\n\nThe game has several skill levels, which control the frequency of earthquakes and the obviousness of the damage. In the event of an earthquake the screen shakes, and a breaking sound is heard if there is damage. The user then has to watch the on-screen displays to try to isolate where the problem is.\n\n\"Softline\" in 1981 criticized the documentation, calling it \"needlessly wordy and confusing\".\n\nIn 2013 Crawford released the source code of several of his games, including \"Scram\", to the public.\n\n"}
{"id": "8444007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8444007", "title": "Secret Court of 1920", "text": "Secret Court of 1920\n\nThe Secret Court of 1920 was an ad hoc disciplinary tribunal of five administrators at Harvard University formed to investigate charges of homosexual activity among the student population. During two weeks in May and June 1920, the Court – headed by Acting Dean Chester Noyes Greenough – conducted more than thirty interviews behind closed doors and took action against eight students, a recent graduate, and an assistant professor. They were expelled or had their association with the university severed. Two of the students were later readmitted. The affair went unreported until 2002.\n\nOn May 13, 1920, Cyril Wilcox, a Harvard undergraduate, completed suicide by inhaling gas in his parents' house in Fall River, Massachusetts. Newspaper reports called the death accidental. At the time Wilcox had been warned about his poor academic performance and had withdrawn from school for reasons of health. The night before his death, Wilcox had confessed to his older brother, George Lester Wilcox, himself a graduate of Harvard, that he had been having an affair with Harry Dreyfus, an older Boston man.\n\nGeorge, shortly after his brother's death, intercepted two letters to Cyril, one from Ernest Roberts, a Harvard student, and another from Harold Saxton, a recent graduate. Their candid and detailed gossip convinced him that Harvard was harboring a network of homosexual students. On May 22, George Wilcox located Dreyfus, extracted from him the names of three other men involved, and beat him. Later that day, he met with Harvard's Acting Dean Greenough and shared what he knew: his brother's admission, the contents of the letters, and what Dreyfus had told him.\n\nGreenough promptly consulted with Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell and the decision was made to obviate the normal and relatively slow-moving student disciplinary process before the Administrative Board made up of faculty members and the Dean. Instead, on May 23, 1920, just a day after listening to Wilcox, Greenough formed a special five-man tribunal which has come to be called the \"Secret Court,\" because its files were stored under that name in the University Archives. The participants themselves called it \"The Court\" to distinguish it from the usual Administrative Board. The unspecific name also disguised the subject of its investigations.\n\nActing Dean Greenough was to head the Court. Another senior member was Professor of Hygiene Robert I. Lee, the doctor responsible for the students' annual physical examinations, who had experience posing intimate questions about sexual activity. A third was Regent Matthew Luce, whose responsibilities included student discipline and conduct, especially housing and dormitory proctors. They were all roughly forty years old or more. Two young Assistant Deans, Edward R. Gay and Kenneth Murdock, both just a little older than the undergraduates, filled out the Court's membership. The Court reported to President Lowell, and his rulings were final.\n\nAt this point Greenough could identify Roberts, the author of one of the letters to Cyril Wilcox, as the principal target of his inquiry. The same day the Dean formed the Court, he spoke to a graduate student in business, Windsor Hosmer. He expected Hosmer, as proctor of Perkins Hall, to be a source for information about Roberts, but he proved unhelpful, either because he was an inattentive proctor or because he preferred not to be candid. He told the Dean he knew that Roberts hosted parties, but caused no disturbance and broke no rules. He was given three days to monitor visits to Roberts' room and report both current and past visitors. On May 26, Hosmer gave Greenough a list beginning with Roberts himself, followed by the names of Kenneth Day and Keith Smerage, noted as frequent visitors, then Eugene Cummings and Nathaniel Wolff, and then two more of whom he was \"inclined to think that neither is part of the group that has centered around Perkins.\" A few days later, Hosmer returned to report that the last two boys had objected to his inclusion of their names.\n\nAn unsigned, typed letter dated May 26 now confirmed and enlarged upon what Greenough had learned from George Wilcox. It probably reached the Dean just as the Court began interviewing students. The author, identifying himself as a Harvard College junior, described how Cyril Wilcox in his first year fell in with a set of his classmates who \"committed upon him and induced him to commit upon them 'Unnatural Acts'\" and when he determined he lacked the \"strength of character\" to stop participating in such activity he completed suicide. Roberts was \"the leader of this group and directly responsible\" for the suicide, he continued:\n\nThen he named as regular participants three students—Kenneth Day, Edward Say and Eugene Cummings—as well as the tutor Saxton, who was already known to Greenough. He pressed home his point by describing the parties where \"the most disgusting and disgraceful and revolting acts of degeneracy and depravity took place openly in plain view of all present.\" Finally he urged the Dean on with a rhetorical question: \"Isn't it about time an end was put to this sort of thing in college?\"\n\nThe Court began its interrogations on May 27, 1920. Dean Greenough summoned each witness with a brief note, for example: \"I expect you, whatever your engagement may be, to appear at my office tomorrow, Friday, May 28th, at 2:45 P.M.\" Another even said: \"If necessary you are directed to cut a final examination in order to keep this appointment.\" Only the Court's notes survive, not transcripts, so it is difficult to ascertain the tenor of the exchanges, whether these were conversations, interviews, or interrogations, or perhaps changed in the course of each session. Clearly the Court pressed witnesses and challenged them with conflicting facts, since the Court's notes record admissions followed by attempts to recant, as well as denials followed by admissions. For example, the Court's note for Harold Saxton says \"when pushed he practically confessed to one act, but later retracted.\" And Kenneth Day \"confessed to H.S. [homosexual] relations with Roberts, after denial at first.\"\n\nMany of those interrogated were never charged and have not been identified. That suggests that the Court, despite its secrecy, was prepared to reveal its mission to innocent students as it attempted to identify those more closely involved. As the Court proceeded, it had increasing amounts of information to use to question witnesses and challenge their statements. Some were called back for follow-up questioning. Nor did the Court restrict itself to people with a Harvard affiliation. At least two witnesses lacking a Harvard connection responded to its summons, though it is unclear whether they participated voluntarily or under some threat. One was Ned Courtney, a Boston boy whose name was mentioned in testimony as the \"main annoyance\" for his frequent telephone calls to Perkins. Another was Harry Dreyfus, who was connected through his relationship with Cyril Wilcox and his employment at the Café Dreyfus, a known homosexual gathering place.\n\nNo subject was too personal for the Court's inquiry. It posed questions about masturbation practices and engaging in sexual acts with women or men, cross-dressing and entertaining overnight guests. Less intrusive questions addressed friends and associates, parties attended and what was seen and who was present, reading habits and familiarity with homosexuality, theories about it as well as slang used to describe its practitioners and their activities (\"faggoty parties,\" \"tricks\"). Soon the Court had a list of business establishments to inquire about as well, starting with the Café Dreyfus and adding The Lighted Lamp, The Golden Rooster, and Green Shutters.\n\nMany witnesses found it difficult to lie effectively when the Court already had enough circumstantial evidence to use in probing their answers. Others may have decided that the best course was to answer honestly or with relatively honest answers that minimized their involvement. The Court's notes say that Kenneth Day \"admits he is probably a little tainted. Mind poisoned.\" Ernest Roberts claimed he was \"led astray\" by Cyril Wilcox and that Kenneth Day, too, had been \"led into it by Wilcox–but not of his own free will.\" Joseph Lumbard described parties where men danced together and others dressed in women's clothes. The Court noted: \"some kissing witnessed.\" Asked why he did not leave such a party, he allowed that he \"stayed because he was interested.\" He had not masturbated for 6 years. Nathaniel Wolff detailed mutual masturbation with Keith Smerage, but claimed to have ended such behavior. \"He was fighting hard and felt that he had overcome the habit. Says he is 90% OK.\" Keith Smerage in turn said he had not masturbated in 9 months and in college \"had not slept with men in the unnatural sense.\" Later the Court recorded that he said he had \"'fooled' around with the homosexual business\" once or twice at Harvard. Stanley Gilkey defended reading Havelock Ellis: \"I think a man should know everything.\" Assistant Professor of Philosophy Donald Clark \"denied any connection with homosexualism, and he denied talking about it except to help some students to cure themselves.\" He later admitted to have propositioned a student, as the Court already knew from an earlier interview with the object of Clark's attentions.\n\nThe Court punished ten it found guilty of some offense and the punishments varied with their status and their degree of culpability. It expelled seven College students (Day, Gilkey, Lumbard, Roberts, Say, Smerage, Wolff) and one student in dentistry (Cummings). Four (Day, Gilkey, Lumbard, Wolff) were invited to reapply to Harvard in a year or two. The Court also told those expelled to leave Cambridge promptly and complained to the families of those who did not move quickly. All were told that Harvard would reply frankly to requests for recommendations or for explanations for their separation from the school. Refusing to provide a positive reference was all the Court could do to Saxon, the tutor, and Clark, the young professor. It identified four others unconnected to Harvard as \"guilty\" but could not directly punish them. It would try to see that one would lose his job as a waiter at the Café Dreyfus.\n\nDean Greenough also ordered a letter placed in the files of those it punished to prevent the college's Alumni Placement Service from \"making any statement that would indicate confidence in these men.\" The Placement Service proved efficient in following those instructions. Lumbard found himself blocked by negative responses from Harvard when he applied to Amherst, the University of Virginia, and Brown. Dean Otis Randall of Brown even replied sympathetically to praise Harvard's actions: \"I feel your action in the matter was wise and just and that you deserve the support of the colleges to which young Lumbard may make application. How frequently we uncover messes of this sort, and how disagreeable it is to deal with such matters.\" Wolff was treated similarly when applying to McGill. The Placement Office's standard reply said \"Harvard cannot show any confidence in this individual.\" To a request for Saxon's credentials it spoke of \"moral turpitude.\"\n\nThe Court warned the students not to delay contacting their families because the Court was going to write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: \"The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything.\" To Kenneth Day he wrote: \"It would be better for them to hear it from you than from me.\" The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided the Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: \"The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted.\" He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him \"no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless.\" When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son \"has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense has nothing to do with low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story.\"\n\nThe students' parents were troubled, supportive, and forgiving. Responses to Greenough, while always respectful, varied from pleading to polite challenges to the Court's judgment. Lumbard's father protested his son's \"extremely unjust treatment.\" Gilkey's father hoped his son would be readmitted to erase the impact of a \"penalty out of proportion to his delinquency,\" Roberts' father noted \"how this dreadful news has upset me\" and sought assurances from Greenough that his son had terminated his \"evil practices\" some months before. Others engaged in protracted correspondence and had employers send testimonials. In Day's case, since he was an orphan, his cousin undertook a long correspondence detailing his cousin's work habits and social contacts. Say's father, a Connecticut grocer, asked to see the evidence against his son, and Greenough replied that he could not send \"the great mass of evidence\" through the mail, though the actual evidence against Say consisted of a few sentences of testimony that mentioned him. Say's mother wrote as well and indicated she felt that others of greater means like Lumbard were not being treated as harshly as her son: \"My son's father is not a doctor, but he is a good, honest working father.\"\n\nSmerage's mother learned of her son's expulsion when she opened Greenough's letter and the next day initiated a yearlong series of letters on his behalf. She spoke of her \"stricken home\" and her son's history of illness. Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: \"I feel now that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts.\" Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: \"I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to do what you can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise.\"\n\nThe Court told four students to consider applying for admission in a year or more. Initially Lowell opposed all such applications. Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day. Informing Day that he could not return to Harvard, Greenough could only offer personal reflections and assurances: \"Two points, however, I beg you to bear in mind. First, the chief thing in this world is to do right and be of service, whether at Harvard or outside. I know that you will keep on trying wherever you are. Secondly, please remember that if there is ever anything I can personally do to help you, I shall be glad to know it and to do it.\"\n\nGiven the number of interviews, and the consequent expulsions, the undergraduate population must have become aware of the Court's work in a matter of days. Yet the Court's work escaped public attention. At least twice the Court was told that Ernest Weeks was threatening to make public his opposition to the Court and its methods, but nothing came of that. The Court itself in its communications with the students' parents and guardians gave assurances that \"Every effort has been made to prevent any knowledge of this affair from becoming public.\"\n\nYet a few students must have spoken with a reporter. On June 19, the \"Boston American\" ran a news story that connected the few public facts: two Harvard students, friends, both from Fall River, Massachusetts, had died within a month of one another: Cyril Wilcox \"accidentally killed by gas\" at home on May 13 and dentistry student Eugene Cummings a suicide in the infirmary on June 11. Cummings, the story went on, had told friends about \"an alleged inquisition, which he claimed was held in the college following Wilcox' death.\" He had been taken to a room \"shrouded in gloom\" and \"questioned exhaustively.\" College authorities denied his story and said it was the product of his \"disordered mind.\" Finally, Court member Dr Roger I. Lee put an end to further inquiries. Cummings, he told the \"Boston American\", \"had been acting in a queer manner,\" using an adjective that indicated Cummings' underlying condition was not fit for public discussion. Contemporary press coverage ended with that one article.\n\nA second anonymous letter reached the Court as it concluded its work. The author upbraided the Court for failing to identify \"most, if not all\" of those students guilty of homosexual activity. The Court, according to the author, mishandled its investigation by concentrating on the Roberts group, which encompassed only half of the 50 students the Court should have identified. The others disliked the Roberts set and had \"little cliques of their own.\" They now \"continued their practices within the student body and continued spreading it.\" The letter also said that the Court's methods, such as the grilling Cummings described and using expulsion as its consistent punishment, were not well considered. It argued that offering more lenient treatment like \"probation, etc.\" in return for additional names of associates would have accomplished more. The identity of the letter's author remains unknown.\n\nThe Court took no action in response to this critique. On commencement day, June 22, less than 4 weeks after the Court began interviewing students, the senior class exercises in Sanders Theatre were followed by another ceremony at the stadium. \"The usual spreads and dances at clubs and fraternity houses were arranged...Rain fell at frequent intervals during the evening, putting a damper on the outdoor program.\"\n\nIn July, in a somewhat different context, Dean Greenough claimed the Court did all it could with the evidence it extracted from its witnesses. Grace Smerage, the mother of expelled student Keith Smerage, had complained to Greenough that Harvard had just graduated others her son said were as guilty as he or more so. Greenough replied on behalf of the Court: \"We certainly cannot be held responsible for not acting on evidence we did not possess, especially when we have asked all the boys we have summoned if they had anything further to tell us. If boys choose to shield those who are guilty they must accept the incomplete results of a Board acting upon information which is inadequate because the boys themselves have chosen to let it be inadequate.\"\n\nEdward R. Gay served as Assistant Dean of Harvard College from 1919 to 1923. He was born in London to American parents and served in World War I as a second lieutenant of artillery. Though a college administrator at the time of the Court, he only received his Harvard diploma magna cum laude in 1922. Following his years at Harvard, he worked as a newspaper copy editor and then embarked on a distinguished business career in the paper industry, ending as Vice Chairman of the Board of St. Regis Paper Company. He died at his home in New York City on July 18, 1966.\n\nChester Noyes Greenough was a Professor of English serving a two-year term as Acting Dean of Harvard College in 1920. Born in Wakefield, Massachusetts in 1874, he graduated from Harvard in 1898 and became a Professor of English in 1915. In the 1920s he held the post of Dean in his own right and became the first Master of Dunster House, serving from 1930 to 1934. One of his publications became a popular textbook. He died on February 27, 1938. Greenough Hall, a Harvard dormitory, is named for him.\n\nRoger I. Lee was head of the Department of Hygiene. As doctor to the students, he conducted their annual physical examinations. He was born in 1881 and at Harvard he earned his bachelor's degree in 1902 and medical degree in 1905. He served as a lieutenant-colonel in the Medical Corps in World War I. Upon his return from service he authored \"Health and Disease: Their Determining Factors\". As a reaction to the discovery that so many World War I recruits were unfit for service, he initiated at Harvard one of the first collegiate fitness programs in 1919. He was Professor of Hygiene from 1914 to 1924 and later served as a member of the Harvard Corporation from 1931 to 1954. He played a prominent role in several medical organizations, notably as President of the American Medical Association in 1945-46. He retired from the practice of medicine at 80 and died October 29, 1965 at the age of 84.\n\nAbbott Lawrence Lowell was in his tenth year as President of the University. He was born in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1856, the scion of a famous family. He graduated from Harvard College \"cum laude\" in 1877 and from Harvard Law School in 1880. After practicing law, he taught at Harvard and in 1909 began his 24-year tenure as President of Harvard University. An educational reformer, he implemented a new set of academic requirements for Harvard undergraduates that required them to concentrate in a particular discipline beginning in 1914. He established a distinctive profile as a defender of academic freedom in the years during and after World War I. His tenure was marked by controversies about his proposed establishment of a quota to limit the admission of Jewish students and his attempt to exclude African American students from residing in the Freshman Halls. He implemented Harvard College's residential house system in 1930 and retired in 1933. He died in 1943.\n\nMatthew Luce was Harvard's Regent in 1920, the administrative officer charged with responsibility for the welfare and conduct of the student population. He supervised residence hall proctors and student organizations. He was a Harvard graduate from the class of 1891. During World War I he served as assistant secretary of the Massachusetts Food Administration. When appointed Regent in 1919, he worked at a firm of wool dealers, Luce and Manning, and was a trustee of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. He served as Regent until his resignation in 1935. Upon his resignation, the \"Harvard Crimson\" described him as \"obscure by preference and by the nature of his functions, and an officer of the University unknown to students who followed the relatively straight and narrow path...Since he acted as an intermediary without disciplinary authority, his office was largely what he himself wanted to make it, and he considered it a roving commission to pour oil on troubled waters.\"\n\nKenneth Murdock was an Assistant Dean of Harvard College. A Boston native, he was just 25 years old at the time of the Court. He graduated from Harvard \"summa cum laude\" in 1916 and then served in World War I as an ensign in the Navy. He then returned to the college as Assistant Dean, while his father, a successful banker, was serving on a committee that was reorganizing the University's finances. He later earned his doctorate in English from Harvard and enjoyed a distinguished academic career as Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English Literature, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1931–36), and the first Master of Leverett House (1930–41). Among his many publications were \"Literature & Theology in Colonial New England\" and \"The Notebooks of Henry James\", which he edited with F.O. Matthiessen. He died in 1975.\n\nDonald Clark was a 24-year-old graduate of Wesleyan University, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Harvard, and a Ph.D. candidate there. Fluent in Italian, German and French, he served during World War I as a special agent in the U.S. Department of Justice. He received a master's degree in Philosophy from Harvard in 1918 and was in the third year of his Ph.D. program when the Court summoned him for an interview after a student claimed to have been propositioned by Clark. As a mark of the Court's profound concern about Clark's status as an instructor, Harvard President Lowell attended his interrogation. Clark confessed to having homosexual sex on a number of occasions. The Court told him he would have to withdraw from the Ph.D. program and would not be reappointed to his teaching position. He was expected to finish grading examinations. Later President Lowell crossed Clark's name off all school records. Clark taught for a while at Mills College and at the David Mannes School of Music, published a book of poetry and translations from Italian and German. He worked as a librarian at the National Jewish Hospital in Denver until his death from tuberculosis at age forty-seven in 1943.\n\nNed Courtney had no relationship with Harvard. He worked as a waiter at the Café Dreyfus and probably had sex with several Harvard students. Nevertheless he responded to the Court's summons and submitted to its questioning. The Court's notes indicate that Harvard would do what it could to terminate his employment.\n\nEugene R. Cummings was a 23-year-old student just three weeks from completing a program in dentistry. He was an active homosexual and thoroughly embedded in the group of students the Court was targeting. Soon after he faced the Court's questioning, he became ill and checked himself into Harvard's Stillman Infirmary. A few days later, on June 11, before being notified that he was expelled, he used his medical knowledge to commit suicide using drugs available there. His death provoked the only press coverage of the Court's work.\n\nKenneth Day was a popular student athlete and the roommate of Cyril Wilcox, whose suicide triggered the creation of the Court. He admitted to sexual relations with men and was expelled. Though told he might be considered for readmission, his repeated requests were denied. He married in April 1926 and moved to New York, where he worked as a head bank teller. He had two daughters, was widowed late in life, and married twice more.\n\nHarry Dreyfus was born Henry Arthur Dreyfus on January 24, 1891. He was 8 years older than Cyril Wilcox, the Harvard student with whom he had an affair. He worked at the Café Dreyfus, which was known in certain circles as a gathering place for homosexuals, in the hotel his father owned in Boston. Though in no way connected to Harvard, he submitted to the Court's interrogation. The Court terminated its interview notes with the words \"No action possible.\" He moved to Providence in the late 1920s, where he lived as a bachelor. He died in September 1978 in Miami.\n\nStanley Gilkey, a sophomore from New Hampshire and the son of a Congregational minister, was probably an active homosexual, but he successfully lied to the Court about his associates and judgments. The Court expelled him for associating too closely with Roberts, for demonstrating an interest in the subject of homosexuality, and for claiming the ability to recognize homosexuals. He admitted reading works by Havelock Ellis, but explained that his interest in homosexuality was just part of his more general interest in criminology. Though expelled, the Court had no evidence he had participated in homosexual activity. His request to be readmitted was granted in 1921 and he graduated in 1923. He lived in Paris for two years, then returned to the U.S., where he produced ten Broadway shows over 20 years. He died in Pacifica, California in 1979.\n\nWindsor Hosmer was born in upstate New York in 1894. After two years at Harvard, he interrupted his studies to serve in the Ambulance Corps with the French army in World War I and then returned to graduate in 1919. During the Court's investigations he was a graduate student in business and the proctor of Perkins Hall. He earned his Harvard MBA in 1921. He then taught briefly at Harvard Business School before moving to Hobart College. He returned to Harvard in 1931 and became a full professor in 1937. He published several accounting texts and served as an adviser on accounting to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950s. He set up and helped manage two small businesses and tried to establish a formal program in small business management at Harvard Business School. With two colleagues he published \"Small Business Management\" in 1966. He retired from teaching in 1963.\n\nJoseph Lumbard was a 19-year-old student who, in the Court's judgment, was \"too closely connected\" with others who had committed homosexual acts, including his roommate, Edward Say, who was \"deeply involved.\" Lumbard had come to terms with Say's odd behavior and showed him a measure of sympathy. For not segregating himself from his roommate's friends and for showing too much curiosity he was expelled. Not having committed a homosexual act, Lumbard gained readmission in 1921 and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1925. Harvard twice provided explanations for Lumbard's expulsion, once in 1931 when he was being considered for employment by the U.S. Attorney's office and again in 1953 when President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower was considering him for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals. In the second case, at least, Harvard's Registrar reported that he gave the FBI \"the facts in the case clearing L[umbard] of any question,\" saying that Lumbard had been expelled \"solely because of association with [the homosexual] group spacially.\" Lumbard married in 1929. Better known as J. Edward Lumbard, he had a long and distinguished legal career in private practice and in government and died in 1999.\n\nErnest Weeks Roberts made his rooms the center of the homosexual social scene. His letter to Cyril Wilcox, arriving after the latter's suicide, made his sexual position clear. He was the son of retired U.S. Representative Ernest William Roberts and had served during World War I in the Harvard unit of the Students' Army Training Corps (SATC). Despite his poor academic performance, he hoped to enter Harvard Medical School. The Court expelled him. He married less than a year later, saw the birth of Ernest Jr. at the end of 1921, and enjoyed a successful career as an interior decorator.\n\nHarold Winfield Saxton was a 25-year-old Harvard graduate working as a tutor to Harvard students. The Court had the incriminating letter he wrote to Cyril Wilcox and he contradicted himself when giving testimony. The Court banished him from the university and thereafter he had difficulty finding employment when Harvard refused to recommend him. After teaching at a variety of schools around the country, as well as in England, Saxton eventually returned home to Chelsea, Massachusetts, where he remained at his parents' home until at least 1942. Nothing further is known of his life.\n\nEdward Say was 20 years old and had a rather delicate constitution after spending years recovering from a spinal deformity. He insisted he had never engaged in any homosexual activity, though other witnesses before the Court claimed that he had. After the Court expelled him, he returned to Connecticut and worked as a securities salesman. He was active in his church and remained unmarried when he was killed in the crash of a car in which he was a passenger on July 13, 1930.\n\nKeith Smerage was a junior and a member of the Dramatic Club. To the Court he confessed to a variety of homosexual contacts before realizing that the Court would not respond to honesty with leniency. In a confrontational conclusion, he told the Court he could add 50 additional names to the few he had already furnished, but would not. He later claimed the Court had tricked him into confessing by lying about the evidence against him. After being expelled, Smerage became assistant manager of his mother's inn in Topsfield, Massachusetts. He had some jobs in regional theater productions, using \"Richard Keith\" as his stage name, once playing the lead in \"Tangerine\". He was out of work when he completed suicide by inhaling household gas in his Greenwich Village apartment on September 8, 1930.\n\nNathaniel Wollf was a 25-year-old from Buffalo, New York, just days away from graduating, when he volunteered to Dean Greenough that he had information about the suicide of Cyril Wilcox and was quickly swept up in the Court's investigation. When interviewed he described several homosexual experiences but asserted he had made a clean break. The Court expelled him and refused his requests for re-admittance though it had initially offered hope that he might return. Wollf's application for admittance to McGill University was also denied because of Harvard's report of the reason for his expulsion. Wollf earned a medical degree at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City. After studying psychiatry for three more years, he spent ten years pursuing painting and academic interests. He traveled widely and briefly converted to Islam. He opened a nightclub in Barcelona in 1935. During World War II, he returned to the United States and he served as a psychiatrist for returning soldiers. He then practiced medicine in Mexico. He never married and died in London in 1959.\n\nIn 2002, a researcher from \"The Crimson\", the school's undergraduate daily newspaper, came across a box of files labeled \"Secret Court\" in the University Archives. After a protracted campaign on the part of the paper's staff, the university released five hundred documents relating to the Court's work. An article by Amit R. Paley in \"The Crimson\"s weekly magazine \"Fifteen Minutes\" reported the 1920 events on November 21, 2002. Though the University insisted on redacting the names of those under investigation, six researchers at the paper were able to identify most through research in other records.\n\nHarvard University's President Lawrence H. Summers responded to that story with these words:\n\nAn editorial in \"The Crimson\" two weeks later called on the university to grant \"posthumous honorary degrees\" to those expelled and not allowed to return. It also charged that by failing to reveal the names of the students involved \"the University implies that they were accused of some legitimate transgression.\"\n\nIn a letter to the editor the next week, Gladden J. Pappin, a Harvard junior and editor of a conservative campus magazine, the \"Harvard Salient\", objected to the editorial's proposed degrees and called the Court's work \"a very appropriate disciplinary move.\" He also called for the administration to \"reestablish standards of morality\" and punish violators, noting that \"Such punishments would apply to heterosexuals, of course, but even more so to homosexuals, whose activities are not merely immoral but perverted and unnatural.\" In a similar vein, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan wrote: \"Harvard appears to have quietly expelled a few deviates while avoiding a public scandal that would have ruined their reputations and damaged Harvard’s good name. What did Harvard do wrong?...Harvard has not only turned its back on its Christian past, it has just renounced its Christian roots as poisoned and perverted.\" Two editors of the \"Salient\" resigned over the letter.\n\nA book-length study of the Court's work \"Harvard's Secret Court\" (St. Martin's Press, 2005) was written by William Wright. More of a popular dramatization than a history, the book recounts the Court's work in considerable detail, but also includes imagined conversations and considerable speculation. Where only the notes of an interrogation survive, the author reconstructs the questions and even characterizes the tone of voice of the questioners.\n\nIn 2008, Michael Van Devere wrote, produced, and directed a different kind of dramatization: a film based on the Court's work called \"Perkins 28: Testimony From the Secret Court Files of 1920\". The film consists of re-enactments of 9 of the Court's interrogation sessions and uses a cast of Harvard undergraduates. The screenplay uses the Court's documents as its starting point.\n\nIn 2010, a movement called \"Their Day in the Yard,\" aiming to petition Harvard University to grant posthumous honorary degrees to the expelled students, launched a Facebook page and a website. On February 28, 2012, the University said in a statement that it \"does not award posthumous degrees except in the rare case of a student who completes all academic requirements for the degree but dies before the degree has been conferred.\" \"The Harvard Crimson\" reported that at least 28 posthumous degrees were granted to former students who did not complete their academic requirements before dying in World War I.\n\nTwo stage works dramatizing the Court and the affected students have been presented in New York. In 2010, \"VERITAS\", by Stan Richardson, was presented at the New York International Fringe Festival, and in 2011 Classic Stage Company presented \"Unnatural Acts: Harvard's Secret Court of 1920\", conceived by Tony Speciale and created by members of the Plastic Theatre.\n\nPaley's article was published in the \"Harvard Crimson\"'s weekly supplement \"Fifteen Minutes\", where the article was not divided into parts and the section called \"How We Discovered An 82-Year Secret\" was a sidebar.\n\n"}

{"id": "20595788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20595788", "title": "Student debt", "text": "Student debt\n\nStudent debt is a form of debt that is owed by an attending, formerly withdrawn, or graduated student to a lending institution, or to a financial institution. \n\nThe lent amount, often referred to as a \"student loan\" or the debts may be owed to the school (or the bank) if the student has dropped classes and withdrawn from the school. Withdrawing from a school, especially if a low (or no-income student) has withdrawn with a failing grade, could deprive the student of the ability of further attendance by disqualifying the student of necessary financial aid. Student loans also differ in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and bankruptcy. Due payments may be a retroactive penalty for services rendered by the school to the individual, including room and board.\n\nAs with most other types of debt, student debt may be considered defaulted after a given period of non-response to requests by the school or the lender for information, payment or negotiation. At that point, the debt is turned over to a Student Loan Guarantor or a collection agency.\n\nIn the United States, the “Congress created a rule called the ‘Cohort Default rate’. Annually the Department of Education evaluates the proportions of students who have received student loans and have withdrawn from a college, and have a defaulted on their federal government backed loans.” If that nonpayment (default) rate is too high, the college will be refused the privilege of having government financial aid available to their students. Also you can not get federal financial aid if you dont have a passing grade or if you are not showing them you are committed. According to Adam Looney, and Constantine Yannelis with the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, in 2011, “borrowers at for-profit and 2-year institutions represented almost half of student-loan borrowers leaving school and starting to repay loans, and accounted for 70 percent of student loan defaults.\" This rule was an instantaneous achievement, ‘there were more than fifteen hundred for profit colleges were pushed out of the system’. Colleges have to change their funding habits to get in line with the government guidelines. Many colleges are continuously forced to lower their nonpayment rates, down.” The number of defaulters has not changed, it is just the way the government tracks them.\n\nMany factors are accountable for student debt. The growing problem of student debt has become more prominent, inspiring numerous documentaries that examine the causes and effects. One factor is amount of interest on the loans. Another factor is the new guidelines developed by the federal government. There are now new rules deciding who can borrow, as well as how much debt they can take on. Colleges and universities have been increasing the costs for students to attend their schools subsequently increasing the amount of debt these students take on as student loans. Reports have shown that borrowers who finished college in the early 1990s were able to manage their student loans without an enormous burden. The average debt increased 58% since in the seven years from 2005 to 2012. The debt for students in the United States rose from $17,233 in 2005 to $27,253 in 2012. Some blame the economy for the debt increases, but in the same 7-year period credit card debt and auto debt have decreased. According to the American Center for Progress' report on the Student Debt Crisis, within the past three decades the cost of attaining a college degree has drastically increased by more than 1,000 percent. If student debt had stayed constant with inflation since 1992, graduates would not be facing this level of student debt. Newer data, as of 2018, reflects an even larger crisis and cumulative level of student debt. As of 2018, a total of 44.2 Million borrowers now owe a total of over $1.5 Trillion in student debt. In addition to more borrowers, and the total amount owed having more than doubled (up 250%) from $600 Billion to $1.5 Trillion in 10 years, according to Forbes Magazine , the rate of delinquency greater than 90 days, or default, has doubled to over 11% nationwide, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere are two types of loans students borrow in the US: Federal loans and Private loans. Federal loans have a fixed interest rate, usually lower than private loans' interest, set annually by the congress. The direct subsidized loan with the maximum amount of $5,500 has an interest rate of 4.45%, while the direct plus loan with the maximum amount of $20,500 has an interest rate of 7%. As for private loans, there are more options like fixed interest rate, variable interest rate, and income based monthly plans whose interest rates vary depending on the lender, credit history and cosigners. The average interest rate for a private loan in 2017 was 9.66%. \"The Economist\" reported in June 2014 that U.S. student loan debt exceeded $1.2 trillion with over 7 million debtors in default. In 2014, there was approximately $1.3 trillion of outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. that affected 44 million borrowers who had an average outstanding loan balance of $37,172. As of 2018, outstanding student loan debt totals 1.5 trillion.\n\nThe interest rates are a major factor in the alarming debt numbers, however, the booming of prices of college is another major factor for US tremendous student debt. The Public universities increased their fees by a total of 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, with out-of-state students paying more than $19,000. For two decades ending in 2012, college costs rose 1.6% more than inflation each year. Government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012. Student enrollments rose from 15.2 million in 1999 to 20.4 million in 2011, but fell 2% in 2012. \"Bloomberg\" reported in July 2014 that: \"The biggest growth in the program came in the past decade, as student debt rose an average of 14 percent a year, to $966 billion in 2012 from $364 billion in 2004, according to New York Fed data.\"\n\nThere were around 37 million student loan borrowers with outstanding student loans in 2013. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan debt in the United States lies between $902 Billion and $1 Trillion with around $864 Billion in Federal student loan debt. As of Quarter 1 in 2012, the average student loan balance for all age groups is $24,301. About one-quarter of borrowers owe more than $28,000; 10% of borrowers owe more than $54,000; 3% owe more than $100,000; and less than 1%, or 167,000 people, owe more than $200,000. Of the 37 million borrowers who have outstanding student loan balances, 14%, or about 5.4 million borrowers, have at least one past due student loan account. For every student loan borrower who defaults, at least two more borrowers become delinquent without default. In 2010 for the first time ever, student loan debt exceeded credit card debt and in 2011 student debt surpassed auto loans (both of which were decreasing). According to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, student loan debt is growing by $3,000 per second. According to a report by The Institute for College Access and Success the average debt from those who graduated in 2013 topped $30,000 in six states and was only below $20,000 in one state. Data released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that in the fourth quarter of 2014 delinquency rates for students dipped to the point where approximately one in nine student loans is past due. As of 2015 over half of outstanding student loans are in deferral, delinquency or default. Rising student loan debt is exacerbating wealth inequality.\n\nStudent loan borrowers that attended a for profit, and two year community colleges, in comparison, earn low annual salaries; an average of $22,000 for people withdrawing from schools as of 2010. This means that these people have troubles paying back their loans. The new evidence is reliable with the previous data. For example, the statistics presenting that default rates are essentially lower within the demographic of borrowers with large loans than within borrowers with small loans. However, the new evidence which goes back twenty years, shows how much the scenery of borrowing has changed. Currently, most borrowers are older and attended a for profit or two year community college. About ten years ago, the standard borrower was an established student at a four-year university.\n\nIn recent years, tuition has been rising due to the cuts of government funding in education. As an example, more specifically, the University of Pittsburgh has had an increase in tuition of 3.9 percent for the academic school year of 2014-15. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Education ranked Pitt as the most expensive public university for tuition and fees at $16,240, just ahead of Penn State University.\n\nIn 2005, the difference in median annual income between those with a bachelor's degree vs. those with a high school diploma was $16,638, though this varies considerably by field of study.\n\nCanada ranks second in the world behind Korea for the percentage of people in the age group of 25-34 with a bachelor's degree. But Canadians are not prone to the rapid accumulation of student loans. As of September 2012, the average debt for a Canadian leaving University was 28,000 Canadian dollars, and that accumulated debt takes an average of 14 years to fully repay based on an average starting salary of $39,523. To temporarily help their low income struggling citizens with student debt, Canada has a program called \"interest relief\". It grants 6 months free of mandatory payments, for a maximum of 30 months. The Canadian government pays for the interest on those loans during the grace period, so the loan amount is the same at the end of the grace period. Also, students are relieved of their debt after 15 years. As a nation, Canadians have accumulated more than $15 billion of student loan debt as they continue to fight tuition rates from further skyrocketing.\n\nThere is concern about the level of student debt in the United Kingdom. There is also concern about possible changes in government policy forcing graduates to pay back more. Andrew Adonis claims most student loans will never be repaid, Adonis also states that university leaders have failed to improve teaching standards but rewarded themselves handsomely with high salaries. The Institute for Fiscal Studies claims that 75% of graduates will never repay all their debts. Andrew McGettigan, loans system expert said, “Until the government removes their right to retrospectively change terms, then you as a borrower appear to be on the hook to future policy changes\". Sebastian Burnside NatWest economist, said “These latest figures show student debt is becoming of greater priority with every passing year. Student debt is the fastest growing type of borrowing and is rapidly becoming economically significant.”\n\nWith student debt being one of the most prominent issues in the world, it seems Germany has found a solution to avoid tremendous student debt that many first world countries face. Germany has both private and public universities with the majority being public universities. For undergraduate studies, public universities are free but have an enrollment fee of no more than €250 per year which is roughly 305 USD. Their private universities cost an average of €10,000 a semester which is about 12,000 USD. Private universities account for 7.1% enrollment with the rest attending the public universities. The private universities have a smaller teacher to student ratio and tend to offer more specialized programs which is why Germany is experiencing a boom in private universities enrollment in recent years for majors like law and medicine. However, most students still prefer public universities due to the drastic difference in tuition cost. The only expense students take out loans for in public universities is the living cost which ranges from €3600 to €8,200 a year depending on the university location. However, the repayment of this loan is interest free and no borrower pays more than €10,000 regardless of the borrowed amount. The average debt at graduation is €5,600 which is 6,680 USD. The chance to gain a bachelor's through well respected universities at a reasonable price without interest packed loans attracts many foreign students as seen through increased enrollment of students from all around the world.\n\nFrance offers a reasonable price for college. The average tuition for a bachelor’s degree is around 190 euros a year, around 620 euros a year for engineering degrees, around 260 euros a year for a master's degree and around 400 euros a year for a PhD. These prices are similar to its neighboring country, Germany. The cost of living in France is an average of 500 to 1250 euros a month depending on the city which is not included in the tuition price. Students are able to take out loans in order to pay for these expenses. Only less than 2% students take out loans as there is financial assistance to pay for the full tuition or half of the tuition for low income families depending on their needs.\n\nStudent loans are an unknown concept in Pakistan, like most third world countries. Students attend college through the help of their parents who spend majority of their income on their children’s education and some students work to help out with the tuition. The top universities in Pakistan are mostly located in the provinces of Sindh and Punjab. There are 177 universities in the country. To better understand this number, let’s consider the US which is twelve times the size of Pakistan and has 5900 colleges. That means the US has about 477 universities in an area as big as Pakistan.\n\nPakistan has universities ranking in the top 250 and top 700 in the world. The average tuition cost for these universities is around 402,000 Pakistani Rupees ($3500). But this is not the only expense citizens have to pay for; most people pay for books, food, bus or van to get to their university and a tuition center for help with the tough curriculum which adds up to about 130,000 Rupees ($1147). Even though this seems like a small total to someone from the first world, this is very expensive for Pakistanis as the average salary is about $7,800 a year. The majority of parents cannot afford college education for their children which is why only 12% of all 18-24 years olds are attending college.\n\nExcluding students from outside Switzerland, the EU, or EEA, there is no tuition fee for students studying at Finnish Universities. There are, however, many exemptions for non-Finnish citizens studying at a Finnish University to not pay tuition as well. In addition to going to college for free, students also receive student grants from the government. These grants are generally used for housing and compensates for up to 80% of rent for students who live independently and/or not qualified to receive child benefits. Through Kela, 40% of students take out student loans in addition to student grants. Student loans average to about 650 EUR a month for higher education within Finland and an average amount of 800 EUR a month for Finnish students studying abroad. These loans are not through Kela itself but is a guaranteed loan through the student’s bank of choice. Besides just student loans and grants, Finland also compensates its citizens, and others that qualify, a meal subsidy, school transport subsidy, and a student loan compensation for students who finish schooling in a target time.   \n\nIn August 2017, Finland saw student loan drawdowns double to 143 million EUR from August 2016 as a result of being able to borrow 650 EUR a month from the previous 400 EUR a month. The reform for financial aid resulted in students that qualify for government-guaranteed loans to increase to over 60%. \n\nThe growing problem of student debt has caused many reactions from young people throughout the United States. As a result, the Occupy Colleges and Occupy Student Debt movements merged in 2012 in an effort to gain support from students around the country. There have been significant efforts made via social media for the Occupy Student Debt campaign. In particular, students all over the United States have posted their personal student debt testimonies. While some success stories of students eliminating debt have been reported on, they are met with heavy skepticism. Since last October, Occupy Student Debt has provided a platform for over 800 students to share their horror stories. Because of this, other organizations such as, Rebuild the Dream, Education Trust, and the Young Invincibles, have joined in the effort and started similar platforms. The Occupy College movement itself has staged over 10 direct actions. They have also gathered over 31,000 signatures on the White House’s petition site, “We the People”. As a result, President Obama announced the Pay as you Earn initiative. Another petition, titled 'Support the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012' on MoveOn.org, which seeks similar relief for student borrowers, has gotten over one million signatures. HR 4170: “The Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012” would give relief to borrowers with both federal and private student loans. HR 4170 also includes the “10-10” programs, which allows borrowers to pay 10% of their discretionary income for ten years with the remaining balance forgiven afterwards.\n\nIn April 2012, student loan debt reached US$1 trillion. Severity of the student debt burden represents such a threat to the middle class that some have demanded a general bailout. Anthropologist David Graeber, author of \",\" argues that student debt is \"destroying the imagination of youth\":\n\nIn 2014, a Chilean activist, artist Francisco Tapia, known as \"Papas Fritas\" (French Fries) \"burned $500 million worth of debt papers\" from Viña del Mar University, and displayed the ashes in a van as an art project. \"The University was being shut down due to financial irregularities. 'It is a concrete fact that the papers were burned. They are gone, burned completely, and there’s no debt,' said Papas Fritas in his first U.S. broadcast interview. 'Since these papers don’t exist anymore, there’s no way to charge the students.'\n\nOn November 12, 2015, students organized rallies at more than 100 college campuses across the United States to protest crippling student loan debt and to advocate for tuition-free higher education at public colleges and universities. The demonstrations took place just days after fast food workers went on strike for a minimum wage of $15 an hour and union rights.\n\nIn 2015, Central Saint Martins student Brooke Purvis announced that he would burn his student loan as a form of protest art, raising awareness about student debt. It is argued the art work addresses the subject matter of the materialism of money and brings to light the political issues of the U.K student loan system.\n\nLeon Botstein, president of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., contends that the next president elected in 2016 should push for all outstanding student loan debt to be forgiven.\n\nA February 2018 research paper from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College argues that government cancellation student debt in the United States would result in rising consumer demand, along with economic growth and increased employment. Over the following decade, the GDP would increase by between $86 billion and $108 billion annually, which would result in an increase of between 1.2 and 1.5 million jobs and a decreased unemployment rate of 0.22 to 0.36 percent. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "217289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217289", "title": "Undergraduate education", "text": "Undergraduate education\n\nUndergraduate education is the post-secondary education previous to the postgraduate education. It includes all the academic programs up to the level of a bachelor's degree. For example, in the United States, an entry level university student is known as an undergraduate, while students of higher degrees are known as graduates. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is post-secondary education up to the level of a master's degree; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.\n\nIn Nigeria, undergraduate degrees (excluding Medicine, Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Engineering, Law and Architecture) are four-year-based courses. Medicine (MBBS) and Architecture normally take six years to complete studies while Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Law and Engineering courses take five years to complete studies, usually, all six years are taken to improve their chances.\n\nThe South African system usually has a three-year undergraduate bachelor's degree, with two or three majors. (There are exceptions, such as the medical qualification (MBChB), which is six years.) A fourth year, known as an Honours year, is considered a post-graduate degree. It is usually course-driven, although may include a project or thesis.\n\nBrazil follows the major traits of the continental European system; free public schools are available from kindergarten up to postgraduation, both as a right established in Article 6, \"caput\" of the Brazilian Constitution and as a duty of the State in Article 208, Items I, IV and V, of the Brazilian Constitution. Students choose their specific course of studies before joining the university. Admission to university is obtained by means of a competitive entrance exam known as Vestibular (a concept somewhat similar to the \"Baccalauréat\" in France). There's a new system, adopted by most federal universities, that uses the high school national examination (ENEM) result as part or a replacement of the Vestibular grade. Depending on the chosen course, upon graduating the student shall be granted: a technologist diploma, 3 years to complete, a bachelor's degree's diploma, which usually takes 4 or, in the case of Law, Veterinary, Geology and Engineering, 5 years to complete; or a professional diploma, which normally require 5 or, in the case of medicine, 6 years to complete.\n\nIn the United States of America \"undergraduate\" refers to those who are studying for a bachelor's degree. The most common method consists of four years of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), a Bachelor of Science (B.S.), or sometimes another bachelor's degree such as Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), Bachelor of Music (B. Mus.), Bachelor of Social Work (B.S.W.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.), Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A), Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.), or Bachelor of Philosophy (B.Phil.) Five-Year Professional Architecture programs offer the Bachelor of Architecture Degree (B.Arch.) or sometimes Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch.).\n\nUnlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as professional study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medical schools have set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment.\n\nSome students choose to attend a community college for two years prior to further study at another college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges award associate degrees of different types, some intended to prepare students to transfer to four-year schools (e.g. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)), and others intended to provide vocational skills and training for students wishing to enter into or advance in a profession. Those seeking to continue their education may transfer to a four-year college or university after applying through a similar admissions process as those applying directly to the four-year institution called articulation. Some community colleges have automatic enrollment agreements with a local four-year college, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. The community colleges award associate degrees, while universities and colleges award the bachelor's. However, some community colleges, such as Brazosport College in Lake Jackson, Texas offer bachelor's degrees along with associate degrees. Conversely, some universities such as the University of Delaware also award associate degrees.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the English system is followed. Students sit for the Certificate of Education examinations at around sixteen years of age, and the Advanced-level, or A-level examinations at around eighteen, then follow by three years of undergraduate education, except for a few specific fields, such as medicine, nursing and law. This is due to be changed, with five-year secondary education and two-year matriculation examination combined and shortened to six years matriculation, and undergraduate education lengthened to four years. Students may be able to receive general education in their first years in universities, more akin to the North American system. The first batch of students under the new system will enter universities in 2012.\n\nIn India the Graduation system is classified into two parts: Undergraduation (UG) and Postgraduation (PG). It takes three or four years to complete an \"undergraduate\" degree. The three-year undergraduate programs are mostly in the fields of arts, commerce, science etc., and the four-year programs are mostly in the fields of technology, engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, agriculture etc. However, for medicine, law and architecture, the period has been five years. The possessor of the first UG is referred to as graduate and that of the PG degree as post-graduate. Other than UG and PG there are various 1 to 2 year diploma courses available.\n\nIn Pakistan, it generally requires four years to complete a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Sciences, Dentistry, Engineering or Business Administration such as BA, BS, BDS, BE/BS/BSc Engineering or BBA and five years for bachelor's degrees in Medicine (MBBS), Physiotherapy (DPT), Pharmacy (Pharm.D) and Architecture (B.Arch) after successfully completing 12 years of schooling. 4 years bachelor's degree is offered in various universities of Pakistan such as COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (UET Lahore), University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila (UET Taxila), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NU).\n\nThe modern educational system comprises the following five stages: The Primary school lasting five years for children 5–10 years old in grades one to five; a Middle school of three years for children 10 to 13 years old, covering grades six through eight; a two-year secondary, or Matriculation consists of grades nine and ten, for children 13 to 15 years old; a two-year higher secondary, or Intermediate college, leading to an F.A. in arts or F.Sc. in science; and a fifth stage covering college and university programs leading to baccalaureate, professional, master's and doctorate degrees. The pre-primary or preparatory classes, called kachi (literally, unripe) or Nursery school, were formally integrated into the education system in 1988.\n\nStudents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may usually enter university from the age of eighteen, often having studied A-levels and thus having had thirteen to fifteen years of schooling. Occasionally students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic giftedness) may enter below this age but large universities are now setting minimum age limits of 16 or 17 after a number of well publicised \"child prodigies\" were found to be emotionally and mentally unprepared for university life.\n\nApplications for undergraduate courses in UK higher education are made through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).\n\nFor their first degree, most students read for the degree of bachelor, which usually takes three years, however in the sciences and engineering integrated courses covering both undergraduate level and advanced degree level leading to the degree of master, usually taking four years and including a research project or dissertation are popular. Given the integrated nature of these programs someone who gains a master's degree via an integrated program is not usually admitted to the degree of bachelor.\n\nMaster's degrees conferred after extended programs are not to be conflated with the degree of Master of Arts conferred at Oxbridge and Dublin, which is not a substantive qualification, but reflects the ancient practice of those three universities of promoting Bachelors of Arts to Masters of Arts (and thus full membership of the University) six or seven years after matriculation.\n\nHonours degrees and integrated master's degrees are awarded with 1st, upper 2nd, lower 2nd or 3rd class honours. If a student passes the course but fails to do so sufficiently well for third class honours to be awarded he will be awarded with an ordinary degree. It is possible to use the abbreviation \"Hons\" after the degree postnominals to indicate that the degree has been passed with honours and is not an ordinary degree.\n\nMany universities offer sandwich courses or an extramural year, which offer work placements for a short period of time in a relevant industry before students complete their studies. Taking a sandwich course may make the course last a year longer than it would otherwise.\n\nWith very few exceptions, nearly all universities with the power to award degrees are heavily state financed. However, they also rely on tuition fees set by the government at a maximum index-linked level, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. UK students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance with repayment contingent on income. Unlike in other European countries, the British government does not own the universities' assets and university staff are not civil servants. United Kingdom universities are therefore better described as autonomous, intellectually-independent institutions with public funding, rather than public universities per se. The crown does not control syllabi, with the exception of teacher training. The crown restricts the power to award degrees to those with a royal charter, in the case of traditional universities, or authorization from the Secretary of State for Universities, in the case of modern universities. Universities accredited in foreign countries, such as Richmond University are, however, free to operate.\n\nIn many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor's and master's degree is being introduced by the Bologna process. Under the new Bologna reform, universities in Europe are introducing the Bachelor level (BA or BS) degree, often by dividing a 5-year Master-level program into two parts (3-year Bachelor's + 2-year Master's), where students are not obligated to continue with the second Master's-degree part. These new bachelor's degrees are similar in structure to British bachelor's degrees.\n\nIf there is a separate undergraduate degree, higher degrees (License, Master, Doctorat) can be gained after completing the undergraduate degree. In the traditional German system, there were no undergraduate degrees in some fields, such as engineering: students continued to Master's level education without any administrative breakpoints, and employers would not consider half-finished master's degrees.\n\nThe Bachelor's phase in The Netherlands can be fulfilled either at university or at the University of Applied Sciences. Except for some specific exceptions, only at universities students are able to graduate for their masters or be promoted. These two institutions differ from each other in the level students learn abstract concepts. Whereas theories are created at the university, at the University of Applied Sciences theories are taught to be applied correctly.\n\nStudents in Scotland usually enter university in the year they turn eighteen (with many still being seventeen upon starting), hence courses take an extra year compared to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nAt the older universities the degree of Master of Arts is conferred in the arts subjects after four years while the newer universities instead confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts conferred by the Ancient Scottish Universities is equivalent to the degree of Bachelor of Arts at other universities and does not require the level of study necessitated for the other degrees of master awarded by these universities. The degree instead reflects the ancient traditions of these universities.\n\nIn the sciences, students usually read for the degree of bachelor, which usually takes four years. However, as with the rest of the UK, integrated master's degrees are popular in science and engineering, although in Scotland they last for five years. Degree classification is same as that of the rest of UK\n\nIn many other, particularly continental European systems, an \"undergraduate\" degree in the American sense does not exist. Because students are expected to have received a sound general education at the secondary level, in a school such as a gymnasium or lycee, students in Europe enroll in a specific course of studies they wish to pursue upon entry into a University. In the US, students only specialize in a \"major\" during the last years of college. Specializing in a field of study upon entry into a university means most students graduate after four to five years of study. The fields available include those only taught as graduate degrees in the US, such as law or medicine.\n\nIn the traditional German system, there is a vocational degree (Diploma FH) that is similar in length, and is also considered an academic degree. Though it is designed as a specialist degree, in contrast to the Diplom degree at \"University\", which claims to be more generalist. Germany itself, however, is currently abolishing the legal distinction between Fachhochschule and University. They are both translated as university and they both provide bologna-compliant and equivalent postgraduate degrees.\n\nNot obligatory and sometimes applied at Universities in the Netherlands are the propaedeutic exams. The entire curriculum of the first two semesters of the bachelor's programme is part of the propaedeutic exams. In most bachelor's studies, students are required to obtain their propaedeutic certificate within three semesters after starting the course. A propaedeutic certificate also counts as a requirement for participating in a university level bachelor's study. The propaedeutic exams have the purpose of assessing whether a student has the appropriate capacities in order to complete the course.\n\nAt some Swedish universities (such as the Royal Institute of Technology), PhD courses are sometimes referred to as \"graduate courses\", whereas courses for other students (up to master level) sometimes are referred to as \"undergraduate courses\". The system at many Finnish universities is similar.\n\nIn the French system, the first degree of tertiary education was reached two years after the baccalauréat. Amongst these degrees the university-delivered DEUG has disappeared, whereas Diplôme universitaire de technologie, Brevet de Technicien Supérieur or classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles still exist.

{"id": "718719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718719", "title": "Whipping boy", "text": "Whipping boy\n\nA whipping boy or girl are children who are in slavery and suffer corporal punishment on behalf of their young master when the latter did something wrong. As both grew up and spend quite a lot of time together, a friendship or affectionate tie often developed between the young slave child and the young master. The slave boy or girl had to undergo the physical punishment and the young master had to watch, thus undergoing an emotional punishment instead of a physical which was / is often seen as too cruel to inflict on one's own children or children of one's own caste.\n\nThe winner of the Prix des droits de l'homme des Nations unies 2013 Biram Dah Abeid - who was raised himself as a child slave in Mauritania - testifies of this practise of child enfant souffre-douleur in Mauritania. In the slavery caste it is customary that when boys reach the age of circumcision, they can choose a slave boy who will grow up with his young master. Because they spend a lot of time together, it happens that a certain bond of friendship or appreciation settles between the young master and his slave. To punish the young master, there is a custom of subjecting punishments e.g. floggings to the young slave instead of this master who is obliged to watch his friend undergoing the flogging, thus inflicting the master this way emotional suffering, but not the physical suffering which is too cruel according to local custom to be born by their own children.\nA whipping boy or girl was, supposedly, a child educated alongside a prince/princes (or boy monarch) in early modern Europe, who received corporal punishment for the prince's transgressions in his presence. The prince was not punished himself because his royal status exceeded that of his tutor; seeing a friend punished would provide an equivalent motivation not to repeat the offence. An archaic proverb which captures a similar idea is \"to beat a dog before a lion\". Whipping was a common punishment of tutors at that time. There is little contemporary evidence for the existence of whipping boys, and evidence that some princes were indeed whipped by their tutors, although Nicholas Orme suggests that nobles might have been beaten less often than other pupils. Some historians regard whipping boys as entirely mythical; others suggest they applied only in the case of a boy king, protected by divine right, and not to mere princes. \n\nIn Renaissance humanism, Erasmus' treatises \"The Education of a Christian Prince\" (1516) and \"Declamatio de pueris statim ac liberaliter instituendis\" (1530) mention the inappropriateness of physical chastisement of princes, but do not mention proxy punishment. Hartley Coleridge wrote in 1852, \"to be flogged by proxy was the exclusive privilege of royal blood. ... It was much coveted for the children of the poorer gentry, as the first step in the ladder of preferment.\" John Gough Nichols wrote in 1857, \"the whole matter is somewhat legendary, and though certain vicarious or rather minatory punishments may have been occasionally adopted, it does not seem likely that any one individual among the King's schoolfellows should have been uniformly selected, whether he were in fault or not, as the victim or scape-goat of the royal misdemeanours\". In current English, a \"whipping boy\" is a metaphor which may have a similar meaning to scapegoat, fall guy, or sacrificial lamb; alternatively it may mean a perennial loser or a victim of group bullying.\n\nYoung royals alleged to have had whipping boys include:\n\nAn adult example often included in discussions of whipping boys is provided by the French Catholic prelates Arnaud d'Ossat (1537–1604) and Jacques Davy Duperron (1556–1618), who were symbolically whipped by Pope Clement VIII in 1593 in proxy expiation on behalf of Henry IV of France (1553–1610), who had renounced Protestantism.\n\nSamuel Rowley's 1604 play \"When You See Me You Know Me\" depicts the childhood of the future Edward VI. When he skips class to play tennis, Edward \"Ned\" Browne is sent to the chapel to be whipped by the master of children. Cranmer says, \"Since he was whipped thus for the prince's faults. / His grace hath got more knowledge in a month. / Than he attained in a year before, / For still the fearful boy, to save his breech, / Doth hourly haunt him, wheresoe'er he goes.\" The prince persuades king Henry VIII to knight Ned: \"the poor gentleman was pitifully wounded in the back parts, as may appear by the scar, if his knightship would but untruss there\". Ned hopes the tutors will refrain from whipping a knight, to which the fool retorts, \"If they do, he shall make thee a lord, and then they dare not.\" This work may have helped the idea of a whipping boy to take root. \n\nJohn Donne alluded to proxy whipping in a sermon he preached in 1628: \"Sometimes, when the children of great persons offend at school, another person is whipped for them, and that affects them, and works upon a good nature; but if that person should take physic for them in a sickness, it would do them no good: God's corrections upon others may work by way of example upon thee; but because thou art sick for physic, take it thyself.\" The earliest attestation of the word \"whipping boy\" in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is from a 1647 Bible commentary by John Trapp on : \"Those Presbyters that sin publikely ... and those who were convicted by two or three witnesses ... : Rebuke before all, yet not as if they were whipping boyes\".\n\nIn Book V of \"Gil Blas\" (1715) by Alain-René Lesage, when the Marquis of Leganez forbids his son's tutors from beating him, Don Raphael is flogged in his stead: \"a most ingenious device, by which to keep this troublesome young lordling in awe, without trenching on his foolish father's injunctions\". \"The Fortunes of Nigel\" (1822) by Walter Scott describes Malagrowther, the fictional whipping boy of the young James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England): \"Under the stern rule, indeed, of George Buchanan, who did not approve of the vicarious mode of punishment, James bore the penance of his own faults, and Mungo Malagrowther enjoyed a sinecure; but James's other pedagogue, Master Patrick Young, went more ceremoniously to work, and appalled the very soul of the youthful King by the floggings which he bestowed on the whipping-boy, when the royal task was not suitably performed.\" In Mark Twain's 1881 novel, \"The Prince and the Pauper\", the pauper's masquerade as Edward VI is aided by information from the prince's whipping boy, son and namesake of the late Sir Humphrey Marlow, a \"Head Lieutenant\" in Henry VIII's Household. Twain wrote, \"James I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little fellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their lessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my own purposes.\"\n\n\"The Whipping Boy\" by Sid Fleischman, which won the 1987 Newbery Medal for children's books, tells of the brattish Prince Horace who learns humility on an adventure with his whipping boy, a rat-catcher named Jemmy. In George R. R. Martin's fantasy series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", published from 1991, the characters Tommen Baratheon and Joffrey Baratheon have a whipping boy named Pate. In David Belbin's 2002 children's novel \"Boy King\", Barnaby FitzPatrick is whipped by John Cheke for teaching Edward VI swear-words; when Edward protests that nobody has whipping boys any more, Cheke says \"the Duke of Richmond had one\". Cheke relents from giving FitzPatrick the whipping owed to Edward. Sarah Ruhl's 2016 play \"Scenes from Court Life, or The Whipping Boy and His Prince\" includes whipping boys in its depictions of Charles I and Charles II of England.\n\n\n"}

It is the ninth or tenth year of compulsory education.\n\nIn Australia, Year 9 is usually the tenth year of compulsory education. Although there are slight variations between the states, most children in Year 9 are aged between fourteen and fifteen.\n\nIn New Zealand, Year 9 is the ninth year of compulsory education, and the first year of secondary education. Children entering Year Nine are generally aged between 12.5 and 14. Year Nine pupils are educated in secondary schools or area schools.\n\nIn England and Wales, Year Nine is the ninth year after Reception. It is the ninth full year of compulsory education, with children being admitted who are aged 13 before 1 September in any given academic year. It is also the year in which pupils are formally assessed against National Curriculum levels. With effect from 2009, National Curriculum Tests are no longer compulsory in this year group.\nYear Nine is usually the third year of Secondary school and was previously known as the 'third year' or 'third form'. Some schools in the UK (especially grammar schools and private schools) still refer to 'year 9' as 'third year'. In most schools in England and Wales, it is also the final year of Key Stage 3.\nYear 9 pupils are usually aged between 13 and 14 years old. Pupils usually either choose or start their options for their GCSE qualifications in Year 9.\n\nIn Scotland, Year Nine is the equivalent to Second year (S2) where pupils start at the age of 12 or 13 and end the at the age of 13 or 14. In Second year pupils pick subjects for Third year.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Year Nine is the second year of Secondary education. Children in Year 9 are aged between 12 and 13. It is the second year of Key Stage 3.\n"}
