Her work examined traditional pedagogy and challenged Enlightenment writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. She is often called the German counterpart to Mary Wollstonecraft. There is still little known about Amalia Holst’s life. She rose to prominence in the late 1700s through her works as a teacher, although she became more widely recognized in the 1970s after her work was rediscovered and published.\n\nAmalia Holst was born in 1758 in Mecklenburg. She is the daughter of Johanna Maria Magdalena Marchand and Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi and the oldest of six children from her father’s second marriage. Her father was a well-known political economist and the Prussian chief inspector of mines. He was also a feminist, who published pieces advocating for improved women’s education. When Holst was 10 years old, he was accused of embezzling funds and imprisoned in Küstrin where he died several years later.\n\nAfter her father’s death, the family was split up. Their possessions had to be dissolved. Holst’s mother went to live with her brother, who was a pastor in Brunswick. Her younger sisters were lodged into a monastery in Potsdam and her brother was admitted into a Danish cadet school. It is unknown what happened to Holst during this time.\n\nIn large part due to Justi’s progressive beliefs, Holst was one of only very few women to receive a college education during this time. She is also said to have received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Kiel.\n\nHer name appeared again 20 years later in 1791 when at the age of 33, she married Ludolf Holst, a lawyer as well as the director of the Pedagogical Institute in Hamburg-St Georg. They had three children together, one son and two daughters.\n\nThat same year she published her first work, \"Observations on the Errors of our Modern Education by a Practical Teacher (\"German\": Bemerkungen über die Fehler unserer Modernen Erziehung von einer Praktischen Erzieherin)\" after having supported herself through teaching from a young age.\n\nFrom about 1792-1802, Holst was the headmistress of the preschool that her husband oversaw. During this time, she also opened several small schools in Hamburg, Wittenberg and Boizenburg. These schools were short-lived however, and the reason for their closings is not known.\n\nHolst published \"Letters on Elisa, or Women as they Ought to be\" (German: “Breife über Elisa, oder das Weib wie es seyn sollte\"), the second of her three known works, in 1799. It was written in response to the novel, which according to Holst dangerously extolled the marital oppression of the title character. In it she also strongly advocated for marital equality and female autonomy. She argued that women should be defined as human beings first and wives second. This was the beginning of her involvement in a larger debate about feminism occurring during this time.\n\nIn 1802, Holst published her final work: \"On the Purpose of Women’s Advanced Intellectual Development\" (German: \"Über die Bestimmung des Weibes zur höhern Geistesbildung\")\".\"\n\nHolst passed away in Groß-Timkenberg on January 6, 1829. She is memorialized in Judy Chicago’s installation art piece The Dinner Party which features a triangular table with 39 place settings, each commemorating important women in history. While she is not given a place setting, her name, along with the names of 998 other feminist icons, is inscribed in gold on the white tile floor below the table.\n\nPublished in 1791, it criticizes widely accepted conservative pedagogical theories, specifically those of Campe and Basedow. Holst analyzes their ideas from the perspective of an educator, and points out the flaws and contradictions within them. She also calls attention to the impractical nature of their ideas.\n\nIn 1799 Holst responded to the success of the novel \"Elisa\", which appeared in its fifth edition. She wrote four letters to the title character criticizing the self-sacrificing and submissive role of women. This seems to be her first public push for gender equality. According to Holst, a woman's attachment to her spouse did not detract from her autonomy. However, she also emphasized a woman's responsibility to her domestic duty and referred to her own marriage as \"a domestic bliss.\"\n\nIn this work, Holst makes the case for higher, ungendered education for males and females alike. This notion was very radical: unlike many of the prominent female-education advocates before her such as La Roche, Herder and Goethe, Holst rejected the idea of separate curriculums for each gender, believing that women could and should learn the same things men do. This was not an accepted idea at the time. Her ideas diverged from most her contemporary equal education advocates as well, including the likes of Hippel, Wollstonecraft and Condorcet: while they were in favor of an advanced public coeducation system, Holst insisted on a professional maternal educator who would instruct her children in all academic disciplines from early childhood through adolescence. Only women who were thoroughly educated themselves were fit to educate the next generation, and thus Holst reasoned that every woman was to be educated. She advocated for an in depth knowledge of history, the sciences, philosophy, geography and the arts. Holst stressed that the most important quality of an effective maternal educator was the ability to draw meaningful connections among all disciplines. She also placed an emphasis on individual perfection, urging women to continually engage in intellectual pursuits throughout the course of their lives.\n\nShe made several demands for female education:\n"}

BrainPop is used in more than 20% of U.S. schools and also offers subscriptions for families and homeschoolers. It is also used in schools in Mexico, France, Spain, Israel and several other countries, where it offers videos in local languages that are designed for students in those countries. BrainPop is available by subscription but has some free content, including a movie of the day, several free movies from each topic area, educators materials, including lesson plans, and an extensive library of educational games called GameUp. Its free smartphone and tablet application accesses BrainPop's free and subscription content.\n\nThe videos and other materials are designed to engage students and assist teachers and home schoolers; they are aligned to state education standards. Most of the videos feature the characters Tim and Moby. In addition to BrainPop.com for older children, the company offers BrainPop Jr. for younger children (grades K-3), BrainPop Español, BrainPop Français, BrainPop ELL for non-native speakers learning English, BrainPop Educators, a free site for teachers and parents to post materials and interact with BrainPop and each other, GameUp and My BrainPop, a tool for students and teachers to record learning accomplishments. The sites are owned by FWD Media, Inc. and its affiliates, based in New York.\n\nFounded in 1999, the BrainPop websites display animated, curriculum-based content that supports educators and are intended to be fun and motivational for students to watch. The sites' movies cover the subjects of science, social studies, English, mathematics, engineering & technology, health, and arts and music. Since 2007, the movies have been closed captioned. The sites also access a wide variety of educational games. BrainPop is used in more than 25% of U.S. schools and in many schools outside the U.S., as well as by parents, homeschoolers and others. The company was founded by Avraham Kadar, M.D., an immunologist and pediatrician, to explain medical concepts to his young patients using animation. As of 2011, BrainPop hosted more than 11 million unique visits each month, from thousands of schools and individuals worldwide. BrainPop uses an in-house team of educators, animators and writers to produce and continually update the sites, incorporating teacher and parent input.\n\nThe site's resources include BrainPop.com, for grades 3 and up (over age 9) and BrainPop Jr., for grades K-3 (ages 5 to 9). The sites also offer movies in several languages for regional markets aligned to local educational standards. The site's free, interactive resource for teachers and homeschoolers, BrainPop Educators, features free tips, tools and best practices by and for educators. My BrainPop is a tool for students and teachers to record learning accomplishments, and teachers can track students' progress. In 2009, BrainPop introduced BrainPop ELL (originally called BrainPop ESL), targeted at students learning English as a second language. Schools and parents can use the site to help shape the student's curriculum. BrainPop's free GameUp website contains free online games from third-party game publishers that coordinate with the BrainPop, BrainPop Jr. and BrainPop ELL curricula.\n\nBrainPop movies may be used to introduce a new lesson or topic, for illustrating complex subject matter or to review before a test. Content is aligned to USA state education standards and is searchable by topic or state standard. In addition to movies, the site displays quizzes, educational games, experiments and other related content that students can use interactively to reinforce the lessons in the movies. BrainPop products are compatible with PCs, Macs, projectors and interactive whiteboards, as well as applications for tablets and smart phones. No downloading, installation or special hardware is required. The movies feature recurring characters such as the robot Moby, Tim (a teenager, at BrainPop) and Annie (a younger girl, at BrainPop Jr.). Most of the movies begin with the characters responding to correspondence and end humorously, often with Tim getting annoyed at Moby or vice versa.\n\n\"BrainPOP has built a reputation for quality, thoughtfulness, and robust support for teachers\". BrainPop and its products have earned numerous awards and recognition from \"Common Sense Media\", Association of Educational Publishers, \"District Administration\" magazine, \"Forbes\" magazine, Association for Library Service to Children, Association of Educational Publishers, Digital Innovation in Learning Awards, \"Tech & Learning Magazine\", the KAPi Awards, the Codie awards, Apps for Homeschooling, International Serious Play Awards, \"Learning Magazine\", EdNet's Best, Teacher's Choice Awards, \"eSchool News\", Homeschool.com, Apple Education, the Interactive Media Awards, Teachers With Apps and Distinguished Achievement Awards, Media & Methods. A 2009 multi-grade study by SEG research, entitled \"A Study of the Effectiveness of BrainPop\", involved over 1,000 students in schools in Palm Beach County, Florida and New York City. The BrainPop-financed study concluded, \"Students in classes using BrainPop made significant improvements compared to students in classes not using BrainPop.\"\n\nReviews for the websites and movies have been favorable. A review in \"Common Sense Media\" commented: \"BrainPOP is a standard-bearer for quality, self-directed online educational content. … A year's subscription is worth it because there's at least a year's worth of content for a kid to explore on BrainPOP.\" A home schooler wrote in \"Curriculum Choice\": \"The videos are very funny, plus they explain information in a way that is easy for kids to understand and remember. … [The quizzes are] a quick and easy way for me to see whether [the students] really grasped the material.\" A review in \"The Reading Matrix\" stated:\n\nSchools recommend the product. A teacher wrote to \"eSchool News\", \"This product has made my students excited to take the quiz after the video. How many teachers can say that about their students?\" Praising a BrainPop video about Ada Lovelace, \"Wired\" magazine wrote, \"After reading more about her life and her work, I still feel it is best summarized by BrainPop’s Ada Lovelace video, which is designed for kids.\" Another reviewer felt that a good feature of BrainPop's movies is their brevity: \"just enough to capture and engage children.\" After budgetary cuts caused the cancellation of a Michigan school's subscription to BrainPop in 2014, teachers raised money from students to bring it back in 2015.\n\nThe educational site connexions.org wrote: \"I recommend this site to teachers who want to inform and entertain their students. The videos are a unique educational tool with loveable characters. … BrainPop will not only enliven the classroom, but the site is dependable with lessons following state and grade-level standards.\" \"Teach Magazine\" noted, \"Tim and Moby … illustrate often difficult concepts in a fun format uniquely suited for the 21st-century learner.\" In 2011, Canada's \"TEACH Magazine\" wrote that the movies are presented \"in a fun format uniquely suited for the 21st-century learner. … BrainPop movies are ideal for both group and one-on-one settings and can be used to introduce new lessons or topics or to illustrate complex themes as review before a test. In 2015, \"Yahoo! Tech\" selected BrainPop for its list of \"Eleven Great Digital Homework Helpers for Your Kids\", and SheKnows Media listed it among its top educational sites for kids.\n\nIn 2010, \"The New York Times\" wrote of the company's free smartphone and tablet application: \"BrainPop is a worthy app, featuring a new brief educational cartoon every day. The cartoon is followed by a quick quiz that will at times challenge even a grown-up.\" \"The Epoch Times\" featured the application as its \"iPhone App of the Week\" and called the movies \"usually funny, if somewhat corny, and always engaging\". The Explore Knowledge Academy, the first public charter i-school in Nevada, has recommended BrainPop's phone and tablet application, as has ChanelproSMB, \"Family Circle\", \"Common Sense Media\" \"Cool Mom Tech\" and \"The Educator's Room\". \"ADDitude Magazine\" selected the app as one of three apps to \"sharpen reading skills\".\n\nTim and Moby are the main characters in most BrainPop movies.\n\nTim is a teenager who does most of the talking in the movies and understands what Moby says. The design on his shirt usually matches the topic being covered. At the beginning of each video, Tim reads a letter from a student asking about the topic. Often at the end of the movies, Moby will humorously annoy Tim, or vice versa.\n\nMoby the Robot is an orange robot who communicates in beeping noises. The three lights on his chest light up when he beeps, and Tim usually translates what he's saying. Moby is Tim's friend but loves to drive him crazy. Moby helps out by fetching things for Tim and asking questions about the topic they are discussing. As a robot, he can do things that people are unable to do, such as changing his hand into a freeze-ray, sending himself back in time, throwing garbage into a black hole in space, removing his head, and using lasers. Some of the movies, such as the Earth, Radar and Milky Way videos, imply that Moby is of an extraterrestrial origin. However, the Leonardo da Vinci movie implies that he was invented by da Vinci.\n\nCassie and Rita are two teenage girls, who are best friends and are mainly featured in comics that accompany many of the movies in the \"FYI\" section. They also occasionally appear in the main movies and even narrate a few of them. Rita tends to be more composed and intelligent, while Cassie tends to be more absent-minded. Like Moby, Cassie enjoys annoying Tim, while some of the movies imply that Rita has a romantic interest in Tim and that he returns her feelings.\n\nBob is a rat with a broken tail and a patched chest. He is featured in, and often conducts, experiments called \"Experiments with Bob the Ex-Lab Rat\", which relate to mostly science movies.\n\nGary and gary are a father and son featured in comics called \"How To With Gary and gary\", which show how to do something safely. The capitalized \"Gary\" is the father, and the lowercase \"gary\" is the son.\n\nBrainPop Jr. was launched in 2006. It is similar to BrainPop in subject areas, but the movies are geared towards grades K-3 (age 5-9). The hosts are Moby and a little girl named Annie. Like the regular BrainPop, the site offers a free \"Movie of the Week\", as well as several free movies in the different curricular areas. \"Common Sense Media\" wrote called \"BrainPop Jr. \"a high-quality educational site that kids can navigate easily on their own. This interactive site includes videos, audio prompts, and graphics familiar to kids in an ideal format for young learners. Kids can take their enjoyment of videos to the next, more effective, level and do something with what they've just watched online … [and explore] sub-categories, like the science and math sections. If your K-3 child likes to learn things online, this site is worth the subscription fee.\" \"Common Sense Media\" also praised the free movies' video quality and topic variety, and writing, \"The videos cover a lot of ground but are easy to follow and fun to watch; they'll explain things slowly and deliberately and at a level that's appropriate for young elementary school kids [but] it will be largely up to parents to get kids engaged in further exploration of the material.\"\n\nAnnie is a young girl who narrates the movies. She wears red framed glasses and also works with Moby. She has a teenage sister named Mia. There are many hints in BrainPop Jr. that Annie is Mexican. For instance, her dog's name is Señor Maurice, and she sometimes refers to her father as \"Papi\".\n\nIn BrainPop Jr., Moby shows his emotions more often, like crying or getting excited. Moby is more kind-hearted in BrainPop Jr. than in BrainPop. He can also do things that he can't do in the BrainPop videos, like sneeze, sweat, and drink water. He can also be sick and smell flowers.\n\nFrank and Joey are two fish that star in the comic strip \"Belly Up.\"\n\nBrainPop Educators was introduced in 2008. It is an online community of 125,000 teachers, and parents who use BrainPop. This free site offers answer keys to activity pages, graphic organizers, professional development materials, posters, clipart and other resources for educators. It also allows educators to collaborate and share resources, such as lesson plans, organizers and activities for students. The site also offers video tutorials and webinars. My BrainPop, added in 2013, is a tool for students and teachers to record learning accomplishments from game play, activities, quizzes and other content.\n\nBrainPop ELL (English as a second language) is a website launched in 2009 that displays animated videos providing grammar and vocabulary instruction and interactive exercises for non-native English speakers of all ages. Each video contains an animated story, an introduction to new vocabulary, and an illustration of relevant grammar topics. The narrator is a boy named Ben, who is accompanied by Moby the robot. The videos provide a series of increasingly challenging contextualized language and content exercises for English learners, starting with beginner levels and progressing to advanced levels. Students may select review activities, such as “Words, Words, Words”, a vocabulary exercise that uses flashcards and includes a pronunciation guide; \"Hear it, Say it\", to reinforce vocabulary and speaking; \"Read it\", for reading comprehension; and \"Write it\", for writing practice. There are also games and quizzes to review ideas from the videos. Internet-based websites have been shown to be useful tools to supplement in-class instruction for English language learners. \"Education Week\" recommends BrainPop ELL, writing that it \"helps build background knowledge and concrete visual examples.\"\n\nIn 2011, BrainPop launched its educational games site, GameUp, which contains a collection of free online games from third-party game publishers and BrainPop's designers that help teach a variety of subjects and coordinate with the BrainPop, BrainPop Junior and BrainPop ELL curricula. BrainPop partners with developer organizations and community developers to continually expand and improve the site's content and align the games with academic standards. More than 100 games were featured on the site by 2014 based on the Common Core State Standards Initiative. GameUp aims to help teachers use educational games in the classroom to engage and motivate students. It is supported by BrainPop Educators.\n\nNew Media Consortium wrote: \"GameUp features top online educational gaming titles as well as support and supplementary materials to educators. GameUp titles come from an impressive collection of organizations such as Nobelprize.org®, iCivics, JASON Project, Mangahigh, and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, to name a few.\" \"Edutopia\", \"Education Week\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" are among other sources that recommend GameUp. BrainPop \"curates their games very carefully and considers a wide range of factors, from a game's curricular value to the length of experience appropriate for classroom use, and thoughtfully pairs games with supplemental lessons and materials that allow teachers to quickly and easily integrate the games into their classrooms.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35605338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35605338", "title": "Carla DeSola", "text": "Carla DeSola\n\nCarla DeSola (born 1937) is a choreographer, teacher, and performer who has built her reputation as a pioneer and advocate of liturgical dance over more than 40 years. In 1974 she founded the Omega Liturgical Dance Company which was soon based at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. In the 1990s she founded the Omega West Dance Company in the San Francisco Bay area. A Carla DeSola collection is being developed in the archives of the Graduate Theological Union library in Berkeley, Ca.\n\nBorn on 24 April 1937, Carla Desola grew up in New York City. As a child, she danced informally and also spent a year at the Hanya Holm dance school. She studied dance for four years at the Juilliard School of Music where she was inspired by the work of her teacher José Limón, especially by his ballet \"Missa Brevis\" and other dance work with religious and spiritual elements. After graduating from Juilliard in 1960 she began to develop a modern dance company, but then changed direction, experimented with liturgical dance and founded the Omega Liturgical Dance Company (Omega). This was named after the Omega Point, a spiritual concept of Teilhard de Chardin's. The dance company was offered space in the crypt of the Episcopal cathedral, St. John the Divine, where DeSola built a studio with her future husband, Arthur Eaton.\n\nAround 1970 DeSola, who had grown up in a non-religious Jewish home, became interested in Catholicism and eventually converted. She also became interested in social issues, and was particularly concerned about poverty. These interests overlapped with themes she explored in dances choreographed for Omega and performed at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Philadelphia and also at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in the 1970s. DeSola presented ideas derived from her teaching in her 1974 book \"Learning Through Dance\". Three years later she explained more of her dance philosophy in \"The Spirit Moves: A Handbook of Dance and Prayer\".\n\nIn 1978 a critic in the \"New York Times\" wrote: “As a contemporary form, it [liturgical dance] was virtually nonexistent in this country before Miss DeSola's pioneering efforts a decade ago…” She gradually integrated her formal training with her aim of expressing worship and prayer through dance. DeSola places an emphasis on the \"overlap between body and spirit\", and believes people can experience dancing as a kind of \"movement meditation\". She makes a distinction between carefully choreographed dance with confident, experienced performers for services, and teaching that encourages untrained dancers to \"move spiritually\". Unlike religious dance in some traditions, where all dance is spontaneous, DeSola's liturgical dance is well-rehearsed.\n\nThis unfamiliar art form was controversial and some Catholics disapproved. A 1980 book, \"Pope Paul's New Mass\" by Michael Davies, criticised DeSola in a chapter asserting “there is no place for dancing, liturgical or otherwise, within the Catholic liturgy”. DeSola’s work continued to grow and in 1981 she told the \"New York Times\" \"acceptance is seeping into all denominations.\" Though at that time Omega was most often invited to perform by “liberal groups in the Catholic Church”, by 1981 they had also “performed at churches and synagogues in a half-dozen states”.\n\nIt was in the 1980s that Desola first taught a class for the Sacred Dance Guild, an organisation sympathetic to her work. This was when she made first contact with Dr Doug Adams, professor at the Pacific School of Religion who initiated the Center for Arts, Religion and Education at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. He later became influential in her professional life. This period also saw the first year of the Earth Mass celebration at St John's Cathedral in 1985, when dancing choreographed by DeSola was added to Paul Winter's music, Missa Gaia. The Mass is attended by thousands of people and is celebrated annually for the Feast of St. Francis.\n\nIn 1990 DeSola moved to California, when she was invited to join the Pacific School of Religion faculty. She also studied there and received a Master of Arts degree in Theology and the Arts in 1993. Since the early 1990s she has been involved with the Center for Arts, Religion and Education at the Graduate Theological Union, teaching and serving on its Board of Directors. She also started the Omega West dance company in San Francisco.\n\nOver the years she has created many liturgical dances for a variety of audiences and congregations. She is known for devising works on the theme of peace, and has published \"PeaceRites: Dance and the Art of Making Peace\". She has taught in numerous different settings, in the US and abroad, and has been described as a “a liturgical dance pioneer”, a “leader in the sacred dance movement” and “one of the most prominent figures in liturgical dance” \n\nShe has been recognised with a Bene Award from Modern Liturgy Magazine (1993), a cover photo and story in Dance Magazine (December 2001), naming as a “Living Legacy” at the Sacred Dance Guild Golden Anniversary Festival in 2008, a Distinguished Alumni Award from the Pacific School of Religion (2010 ), the title Honorary Member of the Sacred Dance Guild in 2011, and becoming a mentor for Dance USA in 2016.\n\nHer papers and videos etc. have been acquired by the Graduate Theological Union library to form the nucleus of a Carla DeSola collection.\n\nHer last name is sometimes written as two words: De Sola.\n\n"}

The framework primarily serves educational and research purposes, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions. The classification includes all accredited, degree-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n\nThe Carnegie Classification was created by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970. The classification was first published in 1973 with updates in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2015 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. The 2005 report substantially reworked the classification system, based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.\n\nOn October 8, 2014, the Carnegie Foundation transferred responsibility for the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to the Center for Postsecondary Research of the Indiana University School of Education in Bloomington, Indiana. The classification retained the Carnegie name after the Center for Postsecondary Research took over on January 1, 2015.\n\nInformation used in these classifications comes primarily from IPEDS and the College Board.\n\nThe number of institutions in each category is indicated in parentheses.\n\n\"Doctorate-granting Universities\" are institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarly doctorates in 2013–14. Professional doctorates (M.D., J.D., etc.) are not included in this count. The framework further classifies these universities by their level of research activity, as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors. A detailed list of schools can be found in the List of research universities in the United States.\n\n\n\"Master's Colleges and Universities\" are institutions that \"awarded at least 50 master's degrees in 2013–14, but fewer than 20 doctorates.\"\n\n\n\"Baccalaureate Colleges\" are institutions where \"bachelor's degrees accounted for at least 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees and they awarded fewer than 50 master's degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals).\"\n\n\n\"Associates Colleges\" are institutions whose highest degree is the associate degree, or bachelor's degrees account for fewer than 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals).\n\n\n\"Special Focus Institutions\" were classified \"based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the College Board's Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution's only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories\".\n\n\n\"Tribal Colleges\" are institutions that belong to the \"American Indian Higher Education Consortium.\"\n\n\nThe Basic Classification omits 26 institutions.\n\nThe \"Undergraduate Instructional Program\" classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).\n\nThe framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate majors in arts and sciences or professional fields, based on their two-digit CIP.\n\n\nThe framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate and graduate programs (defined by their 4-digit CIP) that coexist.\n\n\nThe \"Graduate Instructional Program\" classification indicates (a) if the institution awards just master's degrees or master's degrees and doctoral degrees, and (b) in what general categories they predominantly award graduate degrees. Institutions that do not award graduate degrees are not classified by this scheme.\n\nInstitutions that offer graduate and professional programs (such as law schools) but do not award the doctorate are classified as having \"Postbaccalaureate\" graduate programs. These programs are classified by the fields in which the degrees are awarded.\n\n\nInstitutions that offer doctoral degrees, including medical and veterinary degrees, are classified by the field in which they award degrees.\n\n\nThe Enrollment Profile of institutions are classified according to (a) the level of the highest degree awarded and (b) the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students.\n\n\nThe framework classifies institutions' \"Undergraduate Profile\" according to (a) the proportion of part-time undergraduate students to full-time students, (b) the institutions selectivity in admitting undergraduate students, and (c) the percentage of students who transfer into the university.\n\nThe framework classifies \"Enrollment Status\" according to the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in four-year institutions).\n\n\"Selectivity\" is classified according to the SAT and ACT scores of first-time first-year students. This classification only applies to four-year or higher institutions. As of the 2010 edition the criteria were as follows (http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/methodology/ugrad_profile.php)\n\n\"Transfer origin\" characterizes the percentage of students who transfer to the institution, and only applies to four-year or higher institutions.\n\n\"Size and Setting\" classifies institutions according to (a) size of their student body and (b) percentage of student who reside on campus. This does not apply to exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions.\n\nThe \"size\" of institutions is based on their \"full-time equivalent (FTE)\" enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students. Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions.\n\n\n\"Setting\" is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing. Two-year institutions are not classified by setting.\n\nIn contrast to previous classifications, the 2005 classification scheme provides a \"...set of multiple, parallel classifications.\" According to Alexander C. McCormick, Senior Scholar at The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and director of the classifications project, \"The five new classifications are organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?\" In addition to the new classification categories, the previously used classification scheme (\"Basic classification\") has been revised.\n\nThe Carnegie Foundation is also developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that rely on data submitted by institutions. The first focuses on outreach and community engagement, and the second on \"...how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education.\"\n\nThe Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications. Their website has several tools that let researchers and administrators view classifications.\n\nThe \"basic classification\" is an update of the original classification scheme. In addition to changing names of some categories, the 2005 revision differs from previous editions in that it:\n\n\nPrior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of federal funding they received. The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions. Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor \"Research I\" is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.\n\n\n"}

The university is a federally funded public institution of higher education. It offers technical and full bachelor's degrees as well as having scientific and technological research programs. Many of these programs are related to agriculture, forestry and fishing.\n\nThe school began as the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura (National School of Agriculture) which was founded in 1854 at the Monastery of San Jacinto in Mexico City. The school was moved in 1923 to the President Álvaro Obregón ex Hacienda of Chapingo. Postgraduate studies were added in 1959. The school received autonomous status in 1978. It offers courses of study in Forestry, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Industries, Irrigation, Rural Sociology and more.\n\nThe main attraction for visitors at this school is its murals. In the old hacienda chapel, which is now the University Ceremonies Room is a mural by Diego Rivera called “Tierra Fecundada” (Fertile Land). This work was begun in 1924 and completed in 1927. Covering an area of over 700m, the work divides into three parts. The left panel depicts man’s struggle to have land, the right panel shows the evolution of Mother Nature and the center shows the communion between man and earth. It is considered to be one of Rivera’s best works. More recently, the school acquired an unnamed mural by Luis Nishizawa. This work was produced during his last year at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas (ENAP) of UNAM and depicts the agriculture of Mexico in both the past and the present. The work is six meters high, nine meters wide and in the form of a triangle. It is placed in a building that is commonly called “El Partenon.” \nThe school is also home to the National Museum of Agriculture. The 2,000 m facility presents the development of agriculture in Mexico from the pre-Hispanic past to the present day. The collection has about 4,000 objects relating to technology, agronomy including farming implements and photographs by Hanz Gutmann.\n\nThe Chapingo Autonomous University is the best of its class in latin america, is the mexican leader in areas such as agricultural economics, rural development, agribusiness, forestry, soil sciences, crop sciences, irrigation and water management, agricultural machines, entomology, food processing, horticulture, natural resources, ecology and animal sciences. It also offers high school education, which is considered the best high school in Mexico, the Agricultural High School takes three years to finish and for students that already have a high school education, a one year Propedeutic course is mandatory. The purpose is to prepare the students for the high level math, engineering and agricultural focused bachelors the university offers.\n\nThe university offers wide variety of agricultural focused undergraduate degrees that should be completed in four years such as Statistics, Economics, Agri-foods Networks, Horticulture, Business and Administration, and International Trade. This offer also includes a list of engineering programs such as Forestry, Agricultural Irrigation, Agricultural Industry, Agricultural Ecology, Agricultural Mechanics, Forestry Industry, Forestry Restoration, Renewable Natural Resources, Plant Science, Soil Agronomics, Animal Science, Tropical Zones, Rural Sociology, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Parasitology, Agri-food Industry and Agroforestry Development.\n\n"}

He was called \"a voice for the Hawaiian wilderness,\" a \"Guardian of the Koke'e Forest,\" and as an educator, \"the window through which thousands of Hawai'i students learned about Hawaiian birds, plants, marine creatures, climate and much more.\" Boynton photographed a bird now believed extinct, the Ōōāā (\"Moho braccatus\"). He recorded the mating call of the single male, whose mate presumably did not survive Hurricane Iwa at the end of 1982. The bird, probably the last of its species, was tending an empty nest. \nBoynton used this poignant recording and story to inspire Hawaiian school children in the traditional Hawaiian values of kuleana, malama, kokua, laulima, ho‘ihi, lokahi, and pono, which translate roughly as rights and responsibilities to the land, the appropriateness of serving nature, helping others, cooperation, respect, peace and unity, and duty to do what is right.\n\nDavid Spalding Boynton, born and raised in Oahu, graduated from the Punahou School in Honolulu in 1963, where his alumni profile says he \"would rather have been in the ocean than in the classroom.\" Boynton graduated from the University of California-Santa Barbara in 1967 and returned to live in Hawaii.\n\nHe was appointed the environmental resource teacher for Kaua`i School District after 18 years as a teacher at Waimea High School. In 1992, David was honored by the Koke‘e Natural History Museum with the “One Person Can Make a Difference” award. Boynton was instrumental in the creation, by the state Department of Education, of the Koke‘e Discovery Center in 1994, a \"groundbreaking\" overnight outdoor education facility and student-teacher resource center for fourth and fifth graders in Koke'e State Park, where he served as Director. Boynton claimed that Koke'e and surrounding wilderness areas contained many endangered species, over 400 different native plants, and the greatest concentration of ‘single-island endemics’ anywhere, making it the ideal place to teach about biodiversity, sustainability and environmental stewardship.\nThe David S. Boynton Educational Grant was established in his memory. Grants, for projects supporting the values Boynton taught, up to a maximum of $1,500 each are awarded to educators or students. The first grant was awarded in 2009.\n\nBoynton was a much-published author or co-author of photographic essays of Hawaii. Among his books are:\n\nIn addition, his photographs have been reproduced in countless magazines, newspapers, and posters. Boynton assisted in the production of the Emmy award-winning 1991 National Geographic Special documentary film, “Hawaii: Strangers in Paradise.”\n\nBoynton's body was found in February, 2007 at the foot of a 300-foot cliff on the north face of the remote Miloli'i Valley of the Na Pali coast, by all evidence the victim of an accident on the difficult trail. It was reported that Boynton had been alone en route to photograph sea turtles on Miloli'i Beach. He was familiar with this rugged trail and terrain. He told a journalist in 2006, \"There is a fern that grows in thick mats along these ridges, and I know from personal experience that you can try to push your way through this green layer and wind up stepping off into air.\"\n\n"}

She was also a prolific author regarding the training of the voice and Professor Emerita of Theatre at Purdue University.\n\nAfter spending her early life in Ohio, Mennen received her Bachelor of Science degree in Speech from Kent State University in 1938, and received the Honorary Cardinal Key from the National Activities Society for Women for her participation in extracurricular activities. She then taught high school English in Twinsburg, Ohio for 5 years.\n\nAfter receiving a MA in Theatre from Purdue University in 1964, Mennen taught at Purdue in the Theatre program as the voice teacher for both candidates in the Professional Acting program (graduate) and undergraduate theatre majors from 1964-2001. She developed the original voice curriculum for their MFA training for actors \"from the ground up,\" where she was also the vocal director for their musicals, serving for over 70 productions. In the 1960s she put together several programs, including the voice and speech program for the American Theater Program.\n\nShe was the first female president of the American Association of University Professors at Purdue, helped form the Women's Caucus to study and implement gender equity, and was the first female president of the Purdue Senate. As Professor Emerita, she was involved in the classroom climate interactive theatre workshop program. Mennen served Purdue for over 60 years. She also did consulting and taught privately.\n\nMennen was the author of \"The Speaking-Singing Voice, A Vocal Synthesisis\". She is also listed as a contributor to \"The Complete Voice and Speech Workout\", published in 2002, part of the editorial board for Marian E. Hampton's \"The Vocal Vision: Views on Voice,\" and associate editor of Singing for \"Standard Speech and other Contemporary Issues in Voice\". She also served as an editor for the \"Voice and Speech Review\".\n\nMennen was the founding president of the Voice and Speech Trainers Association (VASTA) in 1986, which became an international organization because of her efforts. Mennen continued as a vital member of the VASTA board for twenty years after her retirement. She also served on the board of the Indiana chapter of the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) and was a member of the Voice Foundation.\n\nIn 1985, she was given a national award for Leadership and Performance by the University/Resident Theatre Association(U/RTA).\n\nAfter her retirement in 2001, Purdue Theatre professor Richard Stockton Rand said, \"Dorothy has navigated through many generations of Purdue University Theater; assisting as needed, selflessly, in a myriad of capacities without any expectation of recognition at any point in her long and distinguished career.\" The Dorothy Runk Mennen Scholarship Fund was created at the end of the 2001-2002 Purdue University Theatre season, in order to commemorate and honor the efforts of one of the department's \"biggest fans.\"\n\nA letter to the faculty reads, \"Perhaps because my family lived here...I knew this was where I would be. I always saw the faculty and staff as a gestalt. it was our personal responsibility to make each one not only look good, but be good as artists and teachers. It was important to make the Theatre live up to its potential with the university and the students. To me, this meant being a part of the university as a whole and to serve it.\"\n\nThe scholarship criteria reads: The Dorothy Runk Mennen Scholarship was created to honor the spirit of Dorothy Runk Mennen, who has given much of her professional life to the theatre at Purdue University. Her academic work emphasized the importance of speech and voice in the theatre curriculum at Purdue and throughout higher education. Recognizing her impact beyond academics, this scholarship celebrates her unwavering enthusiasm and steadfast encouragement of students to pursue their dreams. It is a merit-based scholarship given to upperclassmen who have made outstanding artistic or craft contributions during their years of studying theatre at Purdue and who have provided notable support and encouragement of their fellow students.\n\nIn 2003, she was honored as a distinguished alumna of Purdue University for her professional achievements, dedication to community, and involvement with Purdue.\n\nAlso in 2003, she received the Sagamore of the Wabash Award from Governor Frank O'Bannon. Until 2006, the award was the highest honor which the Governor of Indiana bestows, a personal tribute usually given to those who rendered distinguished service to the state or to the governor.\n\nIn 2009, VASTA created the Dorothy Mennen Research/Development Grant, which awards of up to $1000 to fund VASTA members for research or professional development. The VASTA Voice newsletter of September 2009 stated that this award was \"named for Mennen, 'the mother of us all.' Dorothy's spirit of encouragement, vision of inclusivity, professionalism, determination and generosity are at the heart of VASTA's mission.\"\n\nMennen is featured as a Lifetime Distinguished Member of VASTA, honoring \"individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the field of Voice & Speech.

{"id": "52579317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52579317", "title": "EarSketch", "text": "EarSketch\n\nEarSketch is a free educational programming environment. Its core purpose is to teach coding in two widely used languages, Python and JavaScript, through music composing and remixing. This learning environment was developed first at Georgia Institute of Technology (from 2011) under Prof. Jason Freeman (School of Music) and Prof. Brian Magerko (School of Literature, Media, and Communication).\n\nEarSketch is web-based, which means users can access it with their web-browsers, and with no installation. No account is required to create projects or view existing projects.\n\nEarSketch comprises different elements: a curriculum, a digital audio workstation (or DAW), a code editor and console, and a sound browser. EarSketch's sound library was created by Young Guru, Jay Z's sound engineer, and famous sound designer Richard Devine.\n\nEarSketch has two main goals: to make computer science more engaging for students, and to diversify the population of students interested in computer science.\n\nThe US has a shortage of computer science students, not only because not all schools are offering CS classes, but also because students do not enroll in such classes. A study published in 2009 states: \"The percentage of U.S. high school students taking STEM courses has increased over the last 20 years across all STEM disciplines except computer science where it dropped from 25% to 19%\". Considering this, and the fact that all fields of the economy incorporate computing in their operations, EarSketch proposes to motivate students to enroll in CS classes and to pursue CS studies in higher education.\nEarSketch attempts to reach this goal by adding a musical side to coding. This strategy is a STEAMs approach to education that integrates arts into STEM teaching. A study conducted at Georgia Tech showed statistically significant results in this domain: students who study with EarSketch have been shown to make progress both in content knowledge and attitude towards CS (self-confidence, motivation, intent to persist, etc.).\n\nToday female and minority students in CS classes are, like in other engineering fields, underrepresented (with 22% of female students, 13% of African American students in US classes in 2015). EarSketch has demonstrated success in tackling this issue, partly because of the focus on popular genres of music such as dubstep, and because EarSketch provides a creative, expressive, and authentic environment (since students compose their own music).\n\nThe name EarSketch originated in a different project from co-creators Freeman and Magerko focused on collaborative composition and music analysis via drawing. That project never came to fruition, but the idea of collaborative music-making (and the name) remained in a new project focused more on coding and computer science education. Though sketching is no longer a focus of EarSketch, the environment does offer drawing and animation features through P5.\n\nThe initial version of EarSketch, released in 2012, was built inside of REAPER, a commercial digital audio workstation with extensive support for coding via the ReaScript API for Python and the JavaScript plugin authoring architecture. As the project grew, the Reaper-based version of EarSketch was eventually retired due to its dependence on commercial software, the inability of the team to create an integrated user interface to author code, view musical results in the DAW, find sounds, and challenges installing the software in school computer labs.\n\nThe project then evolved to become a website in 2014. This allowed students to start coding without having to download software. The website uses the web audio API and runs on a private server. New versions are release approximately once per month.\nEarSketch is not just a software: the EarSketch team works hand in hand with teachers to build the curriculum, and trains teachers every year in summer professional development workshops.\n\nEarSketch received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) (CNS #1138469, DRL #1417835, DUE #1504293, and DRL #1612644), the Scott Hudgens Family Foundation, the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, and the Google Inc. Fund of Tides Foundation.\n\nEarSketch is a web application, and when opening a session, users see different sections: the curriculum, the code editor, the console, the Digital Audio Workstation, and the browser. \nThe curriculum is aligned with AP Computer Science Principles but can be used in any introductory programming course.\n\nEach chapter has several sections, a summary, a quiz, screencasts, and associated slides. The curriculum is positioned in the right side of the window. It is a textbook for EarSketch that includes chapters about major computing principles, Python and JavaScript, as well as an introduction to computer science. The curriculum is divided in the following sections:\n\nThe units are divided into chapters. Each chapter has several sections, a summary, a quizz, and associated slides. The curriculum contains Python and JavaScript example code that can be pasted into the code editor.\n\nEarSketch's code editor is located in the window at the center of the page. When the code is executed, it will create the music in the Digital Audio Workstation. If there is an error in the code, a message explaining the error will appear in the console, located under the code editor.\n\nA digital audio workstation (DAW) is a tool used by a majority of music producers which helps manipulate audio samples (or audio files), add effects, and accomplish other tasks in the composition process. EarSketch's DAW is located in the top center section, above the code editor. It contains tracks: each line is a track, and corresponds to an instrument. With code commands, the user will add sound samples in these tracks, as well as effects, such as volume changes, reverberation, delay, etc. \nWhen the code is executed, the DAW will be filled with the sound samples, and the user can play the music they just coded.\n\nIn order to compose music, EarSketch coders can use samples. Audio samples are located in the sound browser, in the left window, which allows for sound file search, and personal sound file upload. \nIn the left section, users can also show the script browser. A script is a code file, and different scripts will create different music in the DAW.\n\nAlthough the code written in the code editor will be either in Python or JavaScript, there are EarSketch-specific functions that allow for the user to accomplish music related tasks. Here are some examples:\n"}

Though they continued to share many common services and operations, HRSDC was to focus on workforce-related aspects of the former HRDC portfolio, while SDC was to focus on social support programs for children, families and seniors. The split was given formal legal effect when the \"Department of Humans Resources and Skills Development Act\" and the \"Department of Social Development Act\" were enacted in July 2005.\n\nUpon taking office in February 2006, the Conservative Party government of Stephen Harper announced it would recombine the two departments, and through a series of Orders in Council Social Development Canada was folded into HRSDC. Though a Department of Social Development remains in effect in legal terms, it no longer exists in any real sense.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, Social Development's preceding role was reflected by styling the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development as the \"Minister of Human Resources and Social Development\", and by changing the department's applied title to \"Human Resources and Social Development Canada\". This practice ended in late 2008 when the title was changed to \"Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development.\" The post was later referred to as \"Minister of Employment and Social Development\" when the department was renamed.\n\nOn November 4, 2015 the department underwent Machinery of Government Changes which saw the employment responsibilities transfer to the Labour Minister resulting in the newly re-titled Minister of Employment, Workforce and Labour. The Social Development aspects were then shaped into the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development. The Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities is now tasked with handling the file on persons with disabilities.\n\nSub-agencies of ESDC include:\n\nESDC delivers $87 billion in programs and services and has approximately 24,000 employees. Approximately 19,000 of those employees work under the Service Canada banner.\n\n\n\n\nOn January 11, 2013, Minister Diane Finley announced that a hard drive containing information of 583,000 student loan borrowers had been lost from a Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP)/HRSDC office in Gatineau, Quebec. Borrowers who registered a loan between 2000–2006 were potentially affected. The information on the hard drive contained full names, Social Insurance Numbers, contact information, and loan balances. The hard drive also contained information on 250 HRSDC employees. Concerns of privacy breaches and identity theft led to the filing of three class-action suits against the federal government on behalf of the affected students.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated that a formal investigation had been launched.

Originally, a private initiative of employees of the ECSC, the concept attracted the attention of EU founding father, Jean Monnet as capturing the spirit of the post-war effort to reconcile and integrate Europe.\n\nAs of 2017, there are thirteen European Schools located in six EU member states in close proximity to European institutions. Nonetheless, the Schools are neither EU bodies, nor under the full jurisdiction of the individual member states of the European Union. They are instead administered and financed through the international organisation \"The European Schools\", established by means of an intergovernmental treaty, the 1957 Statute of the European School, since repealed and replaced by the 1994 Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools. All EU member states, as well as the EU itself, and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) are party to this agreement. The Schools are legally recognised in all participating jurisdictions as public bodies.\n\nSince 2005, upon a recommendation of the European Parliament, the title of an \"Accredited European School\" has been available for schools under national jurisdiction, which have been approved, by the Board of Governors of the European Schools, to offer the European Schools' curriculum and the European Baccalaureate. As of 2017, there are thirteen Accredited European Schools located in eleven EU countries.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the institutions of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in Luxembourg, in 1952, it became apparent that it was necessary to provide an education to the children of the officials of those institutions in their mother tongues. The lack of such provisions posed challenges in building an administration that reflected the diverse makeup of the ECSC's six founding member states, discouraging potential employees who heralded from outside the jurisdiction in which the institutions were based from relocating with their families. In 1953, employees of the ECSC established an association, financed by the High Authority of the ECSC, for the purpose of founding a school in Luxembourg providing nursery and primary education to the children of the institutions' officials. The school begun to operate on 4 October 1953, with teachers recruited and paid by the association.\n\nHowever, by the spring of 1954, it was apparent that the solution was inadequate, with the school unable to provide a secondary education to its enrolees. The President of the High Authority of the ECSC, Jean Monnet, invited representatives of the education ministers of the six founding member states of the ECSC to Luxembourg for discussions on a school with intergovernmental status. The member state representatives transformed themselves into a Board of Governors, who would oversee the establishment of a such a school. It was agreed that teaching staff would be seconded from the member states, who would continue to pay their salary, and that salaries would be harmonised by means of an additional supplement. On 12 October 1954, the first two years of the secondary school began to operate.\n\nOn 12 April 1957, the governments of the six ECSC member states signed, and later subsequently ratified, the Statute of the European School, which took the form of an international treaty. Under Article 6 of the Statute, the European School was to have the status of a public institution in the law of each of the contracting parties and was to have legal personality to the extent requisite for the attainment of its objectives. The organs of the school were to be a Board of Governors, which would have executive authority over the School, a Boards of Inspectors, an Administrative Board and a Head teacher. Article 8 provided that the Board of Governors of the European School was to consist of the \"Minister or Ministers of each contracting party whose responsibilities include national education and/or external cultural relations\", with the Board able to confer a position to a representative of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, as per Article 27.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) in 1957 and the establishment of the institutions of those Communities in various places, other European Schools were set up in Brussels and Mol, Belgium in 1958, in Varese, Italy in 1960, Karlsruhe, Germany in 1962, in Bergen, the Netherlands in 1963, and a second school in Brussels in 1976. In order to facilitate the setting-up of those new schools and to provide them with a legal basis, the governments of the member states signed on 13 April 1962 in Luxembourg a Protocol on the setting-up of European Schools with reference to the 1957 Statute of the European School.\n\nIn 1967, the institutions of the EEC, ECSC and Euratom were merged to form the European Communities. Consequently, the three organisations were represented on the Board of Governors by the European Commission of the European Communities, the successor institution to the High Authority of the ECSC. Taking advantage of the powers conferred to it by the 1957 Statute, the Board of Governors signed an agreement with the European Patent Organisation - a separate intergovernmental organisation - in December 1975 allowing for the creation, in 1977, of a European School in Munich, Germany for the education and instruction together of children of its staff. In 1973, the first enlargement of the European Communities saw the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland accede to the 1957 Statute. In 1978, a European School was established at Culham, UK in order to serve the children of the staff posted to the Joint European Torus Joint Undertaking (JET), supervised by Euratom, for the development of a common nuclear fusion programme. By 1986, following the enlargement of the European Communities to include Greece, Spain and Portugal, the Schools were obliged to provide an education to the students of officials originating from the 12 EC member states.\n\nPursuant to the incorporation of the European Communities into the European Union in 1993, and envisioning the enlargement in membership of the EU following the end of the Cold War, it was decided that the legal and organisational framework of the Schools needed an overhaul. On 1 October 2002, the Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools, originally signed in 1994, came into effect repealing and replacing the 1957 Statute of the European School and its accompanying 1962 Protocol. Following the accession of Croatia to the EU in 2013, the 1994 Convention includes amongst its contracting parties all 28 EU member states, as well as the EU itself, and Euratom.\n\nThe historical significance of the first European School, founded a mere 12 years after the end of World War II, was not lost on its architects. Children, whose parents had fought on opposite sides of the conflict, would not only be taught together, but, as per the curriculum of the School, learn history and geography in a foreign language and from a foreign point of view. \"May the Europe of the European schools definitively take the place of the Europe of the war cemeteries,\" René Mayer, head of the ECSC proclaimed upon the opening of a new custom building for the School on Boulevard de la Foire in Luxembourg, on 11 December 1957. This sentiment is echoed in the words inscribed in Latin on parchment and sealed in each of the European Schools' foundation stones. Translated into English, it reads:\n\nThe curriculum is common to all thirteen schools and is centrally controlled by the Board of Inspectors and the Board of Governors.\n\nCompulsory subjects for Years 1–7 of the secondary school:\nCompulsory for Years 1–3 of the secondary school:\nCompulsory subjects for Years 1–5 of the secondary school:\nCompulsory subjects for Years 6–7 of the secondary school:\nOptional subjects:\n\nAll modern foreign languages offered are taught using the direct method where the lessons are taught in the language being learned, and the use of the student's native tongue is discouraged. These foreign languages lessons are shared with pupils from other language streams. The idea is to encourage the pupils to use the language they are learning as a means of crossing the communication barrier between themselves and pupils from other language streams. From Year 3 onwards of the secondary school, History and Geography as well as other secondary subjects such as Music are taught in each student's second language. Many of the pupils find themselves in a foreign country, so are surrounded by a foreign language. Some pick it up through language immersion, hence some lessons are taught in the national language of the host country.\n\nThe European Baccalaureate is the leaving certification of the European Schools, and should be distinguished from the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the baccalaureates of various national systems. It is a two-year course assessing the performance of students in the subjects taught in Years 6–7, and culminating in a final series exams taken at the end of Year 7. As per the multilingual ethos of the Schools, certain subjects are instructed and assessed in each student's respectvie second language. Details of the examinations are set out in the Annex of the Statute of the European School and in the regulations for the European Baccalaureate.\n\nThose students undertaking the European Baccalaureate are required to study at least 8 and up to a maximum of 11 academic subjects, in addition to physical education and moral/religion, with different weightings according to the course choices made when commencing the Baccaluareate. The final mark is calculated as a percentage, where 60% is the minimum for a pass.\n\nThe European Baccalaureate is administered and directly supervised by an external examining board appointed annually by the Board of Governors. The examining board consists of up to three representatives of each member state, who must satisfy the conditions governing the appointment of equivalent examining boards in their respective countries. It is presided over by a senior university educator appointed by each member state in turn, assisted by a member of the Board of Inspectors of the Schools.\n\nArticle 5 (2) of the Statute provides that holders of the Baccalaureate shall:\n\n\nThe first awards of the European Baccalaureate were made in 1959.\n\nSports teams of the European Schools compete in the biennial Eurosport event, with the Schools alternating as hosts. In addition, students of the Schools have the opportunity to take part in the annual European Schools Science Composium, the winners of which represent the European Schools in the European Union Contest for Young Scientists.\n\nThe European Schools also cooperate to take advantage of their unique relationship to EU institutions, to provide students on an annual basis with the opportunity to take part in political simulations of EU meetings, held on the premises of the institutions themselves. Students get the opportunity to role-play as delegates of EU member state governments in a Model European Council, MEPs in a Model European Parliament, or international journalists covering the meetings.\n\nThe federation of student representatives of the Schools, CoSup, organises a \"Europarty\", held in a different European city each academic year, and open to any student of the European Schools over 16 years of age to attend.\n\nThe Board of Governors is the common executive body of the European Schools, determining educational, administrative and financial matters. When it is not in session, its powers are exercised by its officially appointed Secretary-General.\n\nThe governing board is composed of the ministers of education of each of the EU member states, normally represented by senior civil servants from the ministries of education or foreign affairs, together with the representative of the European Commission, representing the EU and Euratom, and the representative of the European Patent Office. A representative designated by the Staff Committee and a representative of the parents designated by the Parents’ Associations are also members of the Board of Governors.\n\nMatters to be discussed by the Board of Governors first make their way through a range of preparatory committees, the most important of which are the Joint Teaching Committee and the Budgetary Committee. The Joint Teaching Committee gathers Inspectors and directors, together with representatives of teachers, parents and pupils and a representative of the European Commission and the European Patent Office. It examines proposals concerning the organisation and curricula of the schools. The Budgetary Committee, likewise, gathers finance officials from the EU member states, together with representatives of the European Commission and European Patent Office to examine the financial implications of educational proposals and the budgets of individual schools and of the General Secretariat in Brussels.\n\nSupervision of the education provided by the European Schools is conducted by two Boards of Inspectors, one for the primary and nursery sections and one for the secondary section. One Inspector from each of the 28 EU member states sits on each Board.\n\nEach European School has an Administrative Board responsible for the day-to-day administration and functioning of the each respective School. Chaired by the Secretary-General of the European Schools. Its other members are the director of the School, a representative of the European Commission, two elected representatives of the teachers, two representatives of the Parents’ Association, a representative of the administrative and socially staff and, at the European School of Munich, a representative of the European Patent Office. Bodies which have signed an agreement with a school and have at least 20 pupils on roll also have the right to be represented on the Administrative Board.\n\nEach head teacher is appointed by the Board of Governors for nine years. There are generally two deputy-head teachers, one for the secondary section and one for the primary and nursery sections. They are also appointed for nine years. Head and deputy-head teachers are appointed directly by the Board of Governors. All full time teachers are seconded by their national governments for a period up to nine years.\n\nEach European School elects, annually, two representatives of the teaching staff (one primary, one secondary) to form a European School Staff Committee which is represented on the Board of Governors, in the Preparatory Committees and on the Administrative Board of each School. In 2016, these roles were enlarged to include Locally Recruited Teachers (LRT) and two further representatives are elected annually. These representatives do not have voting rights, however they are able to attend meetings and represent the interests of LRTs vis-a-vis the School.\n\nIn the European Schools system, the Complaints Board, an independent administrative court, represents the judiciary, owing to the Schools' unique intergovernmental legal basis.\n\nCommon to each European School, the respective Parents' Associations are responsible for overseeing the provision of school transportation, the running of canteen services and extra-curricula activities. Each Parents' Association is open to any parent or legal guardian who has a child enrolled in the Schools, and possesses a place on the Administrative Board of their respective European School. Via a body which federates all the Parents' Associations of the European Schools, INTERPARENTS, they participate in meetings of the Board of Governors of the European Schools, enabling them a voice in intergovernmental meetings which set the future direction of the organisation as a whole. Each Parents' Association is also a member of the \"Groupe Unitaire pour la Défense des Ecoles Européennes\" (GUDEE), which groups Parents’Associations, Trades-Unions and other organisations possessing an interest in the future of the European Schools together.\n\nRegulations agreed by the Board of Governors of the European Schools recognise the right of the students of each School to organise and represent themselves in the administration and functioning of the Schools via a Pupils' Committee. Each European Schools' Pupils' Committee is democratically elected at the start of each academic year, headed by a president.\n\nThe Pupils' Committees of the European Schools are federated via CoSup, an acronym formed from its French title, \"Conseil Supérieur des Elèves\". Each Pupils' Committee elects two representatives to send to meetings of CoSup. Accredited European Schools may also send representatives. As of 2006, CoSup is recognised by the Board of Governors of the European Schools as an official body. It is able to represent common student interests on the European Schools' Joint Teaching Committee. CoSup possesses a common fund, able to financially support represented Pupils' Committees, when necessary. Amongst other duties, CoSup is responsible for organising the annual Europarty, held in a different European city each year, and open to any student of the European Schools over the age of 16 to attend. CoSup meets four times per academic year and utilises a Qualified Majority Voting system, endowing each European School represented a number of votes proportional to its share of the total number of students enrolled across all European Schools. Each School receives an equal vote weighting for matters concerning the functioning of CoSup, such as its presidential elections, which occur at the last meeting of each academic year.\n\nThere are thirteen European Schools, found in eight municipalities, across six EU countries, in close proximity to EU institutions, or in the case of the European School, Munich, the European Patent Organisation. There are already five European Schools in Belgium (four in Brussels and one in Mol) and discussions are currently being held about building a fifth school in Brussels at an undetermined future date. The European School, Culham closed on 31 August 2017.\n\n"}

It consists of a coordinating European Unit and a series of national units; its aim is to provide policy makers in the member states of the European Union with up-to-date and reliable information on which to base policy decisions in the Education field.\n\nSpecific studies and reports are available free of charge on the Eurydice website, along with Eurypedia, a comprehensive online Encyclopedia on national education systems in Europe.\n\nThe Eurydice Network is the Education Information Network in Europe. It was established by the European Commission in 1980, following a request by the then European Community Ministers of Education in their resolutions of 1976.\n\nIn those early days of Education policy within the European Community there was considerable suspicion among some Ministers of Education of what the European Commission might do; their original action programme thus limited actions at European level to those that could not impinge on national sovereignty: this included the exchange of information and documentation. The Commission established the European Eurydice Unit directly; and following some years' negotiations, the network held its first meeting in 1980.\n\nThe network consisted originally of a European Unit and one or more units set up by Education Ministries in each of the then 9 member states of the European Union. These national units were normally located within Ministries responsible for Education, although in some cases (e.g., England) they were outsourced to research or documentation bodies. In federal countries (such as Germany or Belgium) the more than one unit was needed to respond to the structure of education in the country: thus, in Germany one national Eurydice Unit was established inside the documentation service of the Federal Ministry for Education; and another in the \"Conference of State Ministers of Education\", which brings together the Education Ministers of the federal states.\n\nThis structure has continued: the addition of more EU Member States with successive enlargements of the European Union has in each case been preceded by participation of the new country within the Eurydice network. At the end of 2006 there were 35 'national' units in 31 countries. Since 2014, the network consists of 40 national units based in all 36 countries participating in the EU's Erasmus+ programme (EU Member States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey, Liechtenstein and Norway). Eurydice is now co-ordinated and managed by the EU Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency in Brussels, which drafts its studies and provides a range of online resources.\n\nEurydice prepares and publishes a range of studies and material on all levels of education, from preprimary to tertiary and adult education, including: \n\nEurydice cooperates closely with several European and international organisations:\n\nThe European Unit of Eurydice also supports the European Commission in the work it undertakes with international organisations such as the Council of Europe, OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)\n\n"}

{"id": "42447086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42447086", "title": "Income Share Agreement", "text": "Income Share Agreement\n\nAn Income Share Agreement (or ISA) is a United States financial structure in which an individual or organization provides something of value (often a fixed amount of money) to a recipient who, in exchange, agrees to pay back a percentage of his/her income for a fixed number of years. ISAs have gained prominence as a proposed alternative to the traditional student loan system in American higher education, and a number of private companies now offer ISAs for a variety of purposes, including as a funding source for college tuition. ISAs are often considered to be less financially risky to a borrower than a traditional private student loan. In the UK this type of agreement is called a \"Human Capital Contract\" and is currently being assessed by the FCA (UK financial regulator) as a more affordable alternative to debt for post-graduation student funding.\nIncome Share Agreements are characterized by a percentage share of future income. They function like non-voting shares in a company where the individual student is treated like a company. In the American system, this usually involves the investor transferring funds to an individual in exchange for a fixed percentage of his/her future income Other features of Income Share Agreements could include a) a fixed length of time for the income sharing b) an income exemption where the borrower does not owe anything below a certain income, and c) a buyout option, where the borrower pays a fee to exit the contract. Some ISA investors offer different terms to different students based on their predicted likelihood of success, while others offer the same terms to all students. Potential groups of investors could include for-profit companies, altruistic non-profits, alumni groups, educational institutions, and local, state, or federal governments.\n\nMilton Friedman originally proposed the concept in 1955, in his essay The Role of Government in Education, in which he argued that students should be funded through an \"equity investment\" such that:\n\nIn the 1970s Yale University attempted a modified form of Friedman’s proposal with several cohorts of undergraduate students. At Yale, instead of making individual contracts for a fixed number of years, all members of the cohort agreed to pay back a percentage of earnings until the entire cohort’s balance had been paid off. However, the system left students frustrated that they were paying more than their fair share, by being forced to make payments on behalf of peers unwilling or unable to pay back their loans.\n\nIn 2013, Oregon legislators passed a bill that would investigate Pay It Forward as a college financing scheme. The model would allow students to attend college tuition-free, and then pay a proportion of their incomes post-graduation to finance the cost of their studies. However, unlike the Income Share Agreement model, Pay It Forward would be publicly funded, and it would offer fixed percentage repayments across all institutions.\n\nPublic debate over the Oregon plan led to renewed interest in equity-based funding models, including a prominent summit on Income Share Agreements at the New America Foundation and a policy paper from the American Enterprise Institute. On April 9, 2014, Senator Marco Rubio announced the introduction of legislation that would 'broaden the use' of Income Share Agreements.\n\nProponents of ISAs argue that they provide significant benefits over existing models of college financing:\n\nEfficient allocation of resources\n\nSince investors have an incentive to allow students to pay lower shares of their income when they enroll in high quality, low-cost educational programs, ISAs lead to a more efficient allocation of financial resources between colleges. \n\nThis allows students to go to universities and educational institutions with higher placement and completion rates. A significant problem right now is that students frequently \"underplace,\" i.e. prefer to go to a less expensive school, even if career outcomes from such schools are worse. ISAs allow a way to reward going to schools that provide more value and better career outcomes.\n\nInsurance and downside protection \n\nISAs reduce risk for students, and therefore act as an insurance policy for graduates with low earnings:\n\nThis is a non-trivial benefit, since we know, based on current studies that student loans can impact both short term career outcomes and long term wealth. For instance, recent articles indicate that student loans make it difficult for individuals to participate in the stock market to build long term wealth: “My money is spent servicing student loans,” said Marcus Wallace, a 25-year-old waiter in Washington, D.C. Until that debt is reduced, he explained, the great stock market bull run will have to go on without him.Lower job search costs \n\nResearch indicates that income based repayments make students' career outcomes more efficient by making the job search process less costly. If you are not worried about how to make your next repayment immediately, you are free to search for a job that is a better fit for your skills and can help you grow your career. \n\nCareer development augmentation\n\nIncome share agreements align the incentives of investors to that of the student—i.e., both would like the student to do well in the job market. This creates an opening to combine ISA financing with career enhancement tools like career mentoring and networking support. Such a model can also help overcome many of the common concerns with ISAs (listed below). \n\nStudents that need education finance the most (including low income, minority, and first generation students) also typically have limited social capital like family-based networks and career mentors that are frequently critical to success in the job market. ISAs augmented with career development provide a nice way to overcome such limitations. \n\nOne of the most frequently cited concerns with Income Share Agreements is that they are a form of indentured servitude. Critics argue that because students owe a percentage of their income, the investor therefore own a piece of the student. For instance, Kevin Roose wrote in \"New York\" magazine that ISA companies give \"young people in the post-crash economy the chance to indenture themselves to patrons in the investor class.\"\n\nHowever, advocates of ISAs contend that since students have no legal obligation to work in a particular industry, and since it is illegal for investors to pressure them into a certain career, students are no more “indentured” than those with a student loan. In fact, someone with a traditional student loan has less choice than someone with an ISA, because the student with a loan needs to be in a career where they make at least enough income to cover their monthly payment, whereas someone with an ISA can choose to never make any money, and would never owe the investor a dime.\n\nSince Income Share Agreements are priced based on likely economic success, critics argue that programs that are not economically viable but still valuable to society may not receive ISAs. For instance, a Masters of Social Work is an expensive degree, but social workers often are not paid very much. Therefore, investors may not offer Income Share Agreements for social workers given current tuition rates. However, the same argument could be made for those with certain majors in the liberal arts. This risk is mitigated so long as other financing options are available, such as subsidized loans and grants from the federal government.\n\nAs of now, there are no documented cases of discrimination based on race or gender with ISA agreements, but some worry that should ISAs become a more popular model, the potential for discrimination could increase. While there are already anti-discrimination laws in most financial markets that would likely apply to ISA investors, the question, as of now, has not been completely resolved. Some advocates argue that ISAs are less discriminatory as compared to loans:\n\nSome worry that ISAs would have the effect of \"creaming\" the best students and only fund elite institutions. However, ISAs should theoretically fund all economically viable programs (that is the future income of their graduates proportionately aligns with the cost of the degree), so the only way that could be true is if the vast majority of institutions are not economically viable.\n\n"}

It is also one of the most prestigious Iranian medical schools. Admission to the university is limited to students with top scores on the national entrance examination, administered yearly by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran).\n\nIsfahan University of Medical Sciences was founded by Great Avicenna(Ibn_sina), under the patronage of the Kakouid ruler Alla-al-Dowleh in 1024/1025. It soon became one of the leading educational centers of the historic Muslim world. Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), was established in 1946, as the Isfahan Higher School of Health Education. In 1950, the Isfahan Faculty of Medicine was inaugurated and students were admitted for the M.D. degrees after a 6-year medical training course.. Today, the university campus is located on Hezarjarib Street in southern Isfahan.\n\nIsfahan University of Medical Sciences provides undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate programs in 10 faculties and 75 main departments. The student body consists of about 10,000 students from all 31 provinces of Iran and some foreign countries. Funding for Isfahan University of Medical Sciences is provided by the government (via the ministry of health and medical education) and through some private investments.\n\nTo the north of the Isfahan city centre lies an area called Dardasht, formerly known as Bab-ol Dasht, through which the Khiaban-e-Ibn Sina (Avicenna st.) runs. This ancient 11th century dome traditionally marks the spot where the great Sheikh-al-Rais Ibn-e-Sina, or Avicenna, as he is known in the West, established his school of medicine under the patronage of the Kakouid ruler Alla-al-Dowleh Mohammad, who had conquered the town from the Deylamid rulers at the start of the 11th Century.\n\nTeaching at the school began as early as 1024 under the name of \"Alaii School\" (مدرس علایی )/Avicenna School(مدرس ابن سینا), making Isfahan University of Medical Sciences the oldest medical university in the world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.\n\nAvicenna settled in Isfahan and authored a five-volume medical encyclopedia: the Canon of Medicine (Al-Qanun fi't-Tibb). It was used as the standard medical textbook in Isfahan, the Islamic world, India, and Europe until the 18th Century.\n\nAccording to Abu Ubayd al-Juzjāni, a pupil and a close companion of Avicenna, the students used to gather at the residence of Sheikh al-Raiss (Avicenna′s school) every night and would study his book of Canon and Shifā one by one under his instruction. The Canon still plays an important role in Iranian (Unani) medicine.\n\nAvicenna (Ibn Sina) has been described as the \"father of early modern medicine.\" He is credited with various medical observations and discoveries, such as recognizing the potential of airborne transmission of disease, providing insight into many psychiatric conditions, recommending the use of forceps in deliveries complicated by fetal distress, distinguishing central from peripheral facial paralysis, and describing guinea worm infection and trigeminal neuralgia. His works cover subjects including angelology, heart medicine, and treatment of kidney diseases.\n\nAvicenna (Ibn Sina) was also a pioneer of experimental medicine, evidence-based medicine, pharmaceutical sciences, clinical pharmacology, aromatherapy, pulsology, and sphygmology. \n\nThe school of medicine in Isfahan by Avicenna became the representative of Islamic (Irani) medicine mainly through the influence of Ibn Sina's famous work al-Canon fi Tibb. The book was originally used as a textbook for instructors and students of medical sciences in the medical school of Avicenna.\n\nAbu ubaid al juzjani was a famous pupil of Avicenna. He spent many years with his master in Isfahan, becoming his lifetime companion. After Avicenna's death, he completed Avicenna's autobiography with a concluding section. He and the other students of Avicenna continued teaching in Avicenna's school in Isfahan.\n\nAlso, Ibn Miskawayh (Persian: مُسکویه, 932–1030) was a Persian chancery official of the era, and a philosopher and physician that taught in the Isfahan school of medicine. As a Neoplatonist, his influence on Islamic philosophy is primarily in the area of ethics. Ibn Miskawayh was one of the first to clearly describe a version of the idea of evolution.\n\nThe idea to establish the modern university came from doctors at the Amin Hospital in 1939. Finally, the hospital's board of directors approved a plan to establish the Isfahan Higher Institute of Health in 1946. Isfahan University of Medical Sciences was established as a modern institution in 1946 under the name \"The Higher Institute of Health\" and later was elevated to the \"School of Medicine\". \n\nIn September of the same year, an ad signed by lecturer Dr. Jelveh, then caretaker of Isfahan Province Health and Medical Treatment Department, was published in local newspapers calling on prospective students to enroll in the new institute.\n\nThe first classes were held at the old Sa'di High School (now the Soureh Institute). Many more students enrolled in subsequent years. Therefore, the institute had to find a larger campus to accommodate the growing number of new students. As a result, the Isfahan University was founded to accommodate these students and establish new faculties.\n\nOn October 29, 1950, the first series of classes were held at the new campus, named the University of Isfahan. The newly established school of Medicine at Sa'di School and Literature College on Shahzadeh Ebrahim Street joined the University of Isfahan and relocated themselves to the main campus.\n\nThe university later offered programs in human sciences, engineering and medical sciences. Related programs of medical sciences, although they were the parent programs of Isfahan University, were then separated from the University of Isfahan and became an independent university named Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS) in 1985.\n\nWith 12 hospitals and 75 departments, the university is currently a regional health care provider and the main medical center in Isfahan Province and central Iran.\n\n\nIUMS has one of the largest network of research in medical sciences. Besides the research done in different departments of its faculties, it is now handling several research centers in central Iran.\n\nIsfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) currently publishes 14 peer reviewed journals in different fields of basic and clinical, medical and paramedical sciences. Many of these journals are indexed by international indexers.\n\nOnline management services for editorial workflow of university journals were established in 2004 and became fully operational by 2005.\n\nIUMS governs 17 training hospitals which provide health services for the people of Isfahan province and also neighboring provinces. Stagers, interns and residents are trained in these universities by attending faculty of IUMS training hospitals.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53255", "title": "Jacques Derrida", "text": "Jacques Derrida\n\nJacques Derrida (; ; born Jackie Élie Derrida; July 15, 1930 – October 9, 2004) was an Algerian-born French philosopher best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction, which he discussed in numerous texts, and developed in the context of phenomenology. He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy.\n\nDuring his career Derrida published more than 40 books, together with hundreds of essays and public presentations. He had a significant influence upon the humanities and social sciences, including philosophy, literature, law, anthropology, historiography, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, political theory, religious studies, feminism, and gay and lesbian studies.\n\nHis work retains major academic influence throughout continental Europe, South America and all other countries where \"continental philosophy\" has been predominant, particularly in debates around ontology, epistemology (especially concerning social sciences), ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of language. He also influenced architecture (in the form of deconstructivism), music, art, and art criticism.\n\nParticularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider \"Speech and Phenomena\" (1967) to be his most important work. Others cite \"Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference\", and \"Margins of Philosophy\". These writings influenced various activists and political movements. He became a well-known and influential public figure, while his approach to philosophy and the notorious abstruseness of his work made him controversial.\n\nDerrida was born on July 15, 1930, in a summer home in El Biar (Algiers), Algeria, into a Sephardic Jewish family (originally from Toledo) that became French in 1870 when the Crémieux Decree granted full French citizenship to the indigenous Arabic-speaking Jews of Algeria. His parents, Haïm Aaron Prosper Charles (Aimé) Derrida (1896–1970) and Georgette Sultana Esther Safar (1901–1991), named him \"Jackie\", \"which they considered to be an American name\", though he would later adopt a more \"correct\" version of his first name when he moved to Paris; some reports indicate that he was named Jackie after the American child actor Jackie Coogan, who had become well-known around the world via his role in the 1921 Charlie Chaplin film \"The Kid\". He was also given the middle name Élie after his paternal uncle Eugène Eliahou, at his circumcision; this name was not recorded on his birth certificate unlike those of his siblings, and he would later call it his \"hidden name\".\n\nDerrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Moïse died at less than three months old, the year before Derrida was born, leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother.\"\" Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.\n\nOn the first day of the school year in 1942, French administrators in Algeria—implementing antisemitism quotas set by the Vichy government—expelled Derrida from his lycée. He secretly skipped school for a year rather than attend the Jewish lycée formed by displaced teachers and students, and also took part in numerous football competitions (he dreamed of becoming a professional player). In this adolescent period, Derrida found in the works of philosophers and writers (such as Rousseau, Nietzsche, and Gide) an instrument of revolt against family and society. His reading also included Camus and Sartre.\n\nIn the late 1940s, he attended the , in Algiers; in 1949 he moved to Paris, attending the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where his professor of philosophy was Étienne Borne. At that time he prepared for his entrance exam to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure (ENS); after failing the exam on his first try, he passed it on the second, and was admitted in 1952. On his first day at ENS, Derrida met Louis Althusser, with whom he became friends. After visiting the Husserl Archive in Leuven, Belgium (1953–1954), he completed his master's degree in philosophy (\"\") on Edmund Husserl (see below). He then passed the highly competitive \"agrégation\" exam in 1956. Derrida received a grant for studies at Harvard University, and he spent the 1956–57 academic year reading James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" at the Widener Library. In June 1957, he married the psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier in Boston. During the Algerian War of Independence of 1954–1962, Derrida asked to teach soldiers' children in lieu of military service, teaching French and English from 1957 to 1959.\n\nFollowing the war, from 1960 to 1964, Derrida taught philosophy at the Sorbonne, where he was an assistant of Suzanne Bachelard (daughter of Gaston), Georges Canguilhem, Paul Ricœur (who in these years coined the term \"school of suspicion\") and Jean Wahl. His wife, Marguerite, gave birth to their first child, Pierre, in 1963. In 1964, on the recommendation of Louis Althusser and Jean Hyppolite, Derrida got a permanent teaching position at the ENS, which he kept until 1984. In 1965 Derrida began an association with the \"Tel Quel\" group of literary and philosophical theorists, which lasted for seven years. Derrida's subsequent distance from the \"Tel Quel\" group, after 1971, has been attributed to his reservations about their embrace of Maoism and of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.\n\nWith \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\", his contribution to a 1966 colloquium on structuralism at Johns Hopkins University, his work began to gain international prominence. At the same colloquium Derrida would meet Jacques Lacan and Paul de Man, the latter an important interlocutor in the years to come. A second son, Jean, was born in 1967. In the same year, Derrida published his first three books—\"Writing and Difference\", \"Speech and Phenomena\", and \"Of Grammatology\".\n\nIn 1980, he received his first honorary doctorate (from Columbia University) and was awarded his State doctorate (\"doctorat d'État\") by submitting to the University of Paris ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title \"L'inscription de la philosophie : Recherches sur l'interprétation de l'écriture\" (\"Inscription in Philosophy: Research on the Interpretation of Writing\"). The text of Derrida's defense was based on an abandoned draft thesis he had prepared in 1957 under the direction of Jean Hyppolite at the ENS titled \"The Ideality of the Literary Object\" (\"L'idéalité de l’objet littéraire\"); his 1980 dissertation was subsequently published in English translation as \"The Time of a Thesis: Punctuations\". In 1983 Derrida collaborated with Ken McMullen on the film \"Ghost Dance\". Derrida appears in the film as himself and also contributed to the script.\n\nDerrida traveled widely and held a series of visiting and permanent positions. Derrida became full professor (\"directeur d'études\") at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris from 1984 (he had been elected at the end of 1983). With François Châtelet and others he in 1983 co-founded the Collège international de philosophie (CIPH), an institution intended to provide a location for philosophical research which could not be carried out elsewhere in the academia. He was elected as its first president. In 1985 Sylviane Agacinski gave birth to Derrida's third child, Daniel.\n\nIn 1986 Derrida became Professor of the Humanities at the University of California, Irvine, where he taught until shortly before his death in 2004. His papers were filed in the university archives. After Derrida's death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI's archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida's widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine's collection, although it dropped the suit in 2007.\n\nDerrida was a regular visiting professor at several other major American and European universities, including Johns Hopkins University, Yale University, New York University, Stony Brook University, and The New School for Social Research.\n\nHe was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Cambridge (1992), Columbia University, The New School for Social Research, the University of Essex, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the University of Silesia, the University of Coimbra, the University of Athens, and many others around the world.\n\nDerrida's honorary degree at Cambridge was protested by leading philosophers in the analytic tradition. Philosophers including Quine, Marcus, and Armstrong wrote a letter to the university objecting that \"Derrida's work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour,\" and \"Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university\".\n\nDerrida was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Although his membership in Class IV, Section 1 (Philosophy and Religious Studies) was rejected, he was subsequently elected to Class IV, Section 3 (Literary Criticism, including Philology). He received the 2001 from the University of Frankfurt.\n\nLate in his life, Derrida participated in making two biographical documentaries, \"D'ailleurs, Derrida\" (\"Derrida's Elsewhere\") by Safaa Fathy (1999), and \"Derrida\" by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman (2002).\n\nDerrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, which reduced his speaking and travelling engagements. He died during surgery in a hospital in Paris in the early hours of October 9, 2004.\nAt the time of his death, Derrida had agreed to go for the summer to Heidelberg as holder of the Gadamer professorship, whose invitation was expressed by the hermeneutic philosopher himself before his death. Peter Hommelhoff, Rector at Heidelberg by that time, would summarize Derrida's place as: \"Beyond the boundaries of philosophy as an academic discipline he was a leading intellectual figure not only for the humanities but for the cultural perception of a whole age.\"\n\nDerrida referred to himself as a historian. He questioned assumptions of the Western philosophical tradition and also more broadly Western culture. By questioning the dominant discourses, and trying to modify them, he attempted to democratize the university scene and to politicize it. Derrida called his challenge to the assumptions of Western culture \"deconstruction\". On some occasions, Derrida referred to deconstruction as a radicalization of a certain spirit of Marxism.\n\nWith his detailed readings of works from Plato to Rousseau to Heidegger, Derrida frequently argues that Western philosophy has uncritically allowed metaphorical depth models to govern its conception of language and consciousness. He sees these often unacknowledged assumptions as part of a \"metaphysics of presence\" to which philosophy has bound itself. This \"logocentrism,\" Derrida argues, creates \"marked\" or hierarchized binary oppositions that have an effect on everything from our conception of speech's relation to writing to our understanding of racial difference. Deconstruction is an attempt to expose and undermine such \"metaphysics.\"\n\nDerrida approaches texts as constructed around binary oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This approach to text is, in a broad sense, influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure, considered to be one of the fathers of structuralism, posited that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language.\n\nPerhaps Derrida's most quoted and famous assertion, which appears in an essay on Rousseau in his book \"Of Grammatology\" (1967), is the statement that \"there is no out-of-context\" (\"il n'y a pas de hors-texte\"). Critics of Derrida have been often accused of having mistranslated the phrase in French to suggest he had written \"Il n'y a rien en dehors du texte\" (\"There is nothing outside the text\") and of having widely disseminated this translation to make it appear that Derrida is suggesting that nothing exists but words. Derrida once explained that this assertion \"which for some has become a sort of slogan, in general so badly understood, of deconstruction (...) means nothing else: there is nothing outside context. In this form, which says exactly the same thing, the formula would doubtless have been less shocking.\"\n\nDerrida began his career examining the limits of phenomenology. His first lengthy academic manuscript, written as a dissertation for his \"diplôme d'études supérieures\" and submitted in 1954, concerned the work of Edmund Husserl. In 1962 he published \"Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction\", which contained his own translation of Husserl's essay. Many elements of Derrida's thought were already present in this work. In the interviews collected in \"Positions\" (1972), Derrida said: \"In this essay the problematic of writing was already in place as such, bound to the irreducible structure of 'deferral' in its relationships to consciousness, presence, science, history and the history of science, the disappearance or delay of the origin, etc. [...] this essay can be read as the other side (recto or verso, as you wish) of \"Speech and Phenomena\".\"\n\nDerrida first received major attention outside France with his lecture, \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences,\" delivered at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 (and subsequently included in \"Writing and Difference\"). The conference at which this paper was delivered was concerned with structuralism, then at the peak of its influence in France, but only beginning to gain attention in the United States. Derrida differed from other participants by his lack of explicit commitment to structuralism, having already been critical of the movement. He praised the accomplishments of structuralism but also maintained reservations about its internal limitations; this has led US academics to label his thought as a form of post-structuralism.\n\nThe effect of Derrida's paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970, the title of the collection had become \"The Structuralist Controversy\". The conference was also where he met Paul de Man, who would be a close friend and source of great controversy, as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, with whose work Derrida enjoyed a mixed relationship.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Derrida began speaking and writing publicly, addressing the most topical debates at the time. One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of structuralism, which was being widely favoured as the successor to the phenomenology approach, the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier. Derrida's countercurrent takes on the issue, at a prominent international conference, was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a \"phenomenology vs structuralism debate.\"\n\nPhenomenology, as envisioned by Husserl, is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's \"lived experience;\" for those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event. For the structuralists, this was a false problem, and the \"depth\" of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential.\n\nIn that context, in 1959, Derrida asked the question: Must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be \"already\" structured, in order to be the genesis \"of\" something? In other words, every structural or \"synchronic\" phenomenon has a history, and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis. At the same time, in order that there be movement or potential, the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity, but must already be articulated—complex—such that from it a \"diachronic\" process can emerge. This original complexity must not be understood as an original \"positing\", but more like a default of origin, which Derrida refers to as iterability, inscription, or textuality. It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derrida's work in motion, and from which all of its terms are derived, including \"deconstruction\".\n\nDerrida's method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity, and their multiple consequences in many fields. He achieved this by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.\n\nDerrida's interests crossed disciplinary boundaries, and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: \"Speech and Phenomena\", \"Of Grammatology\" (initially submitted as a \"Doctorat de spécialité\" thesis under Maurice de Gandillac), and \"Writing and Difference\".\n\nOn several occasions, Derrida has acknowledged his debt to Husserl and Heidegger, and stated that without them he would not have said a single word. Among the questions asked in these essays are \"What is 'meaning', what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric 'voice' as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?\" In another essay in \"Writing and Difference\" entitled \"Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas\", the roots of another major theme in Derrida's thought emerges: the Other as opposed to the Same \"Deconstructive analysis deprives the present of its prestige and exposes it to something \"tout autre\", \"wholly other,\" beyond what is foreseeable from the present, beyond the horizon of the \"same\".\" Other than Rousseau, Husserl, Heidegger and Levinas, these three books discussed, and/or relied upon, the works of many philosophers and authors, including linguist Saussure, Hegel, Foucault, Bataille, Descartes, anthropologist Lévi-Strauss, paleontologist Leroi-Gourhan, psychoanalyst Freud, and writers such as Jabès and Artaud.\n\nThis collection of three books published in 1967 elaborated Derrida's theoretical framework. Derrida attempts to approach the very heart of the Western intellectual tradition, characterizing this tradition as \"a search for a transcendental being that serves as the origin or guarantor of meaning\". The attempt to \"ground the meaning relations constitutive of the world in an instance that itself lies outside all relationality\" was referred to by Heidegger as logocentrism, and Derrida argues that the philosophical enterprise is \"essentially\" logocentric, and that this is a paradigm inherited from Judaism and Hellenism. He in turn describes logocentrism as phallocratic, patriarchal and masculinist. Derrida contributed to \"the understanding of certain deeply hidden philosophical presuppositions and prejudices in Western culture\", arguing that the whole philosophical tradition rests on arbitrary dichotomous categories (such as sacred/profane, signifier/signified, mind/body), and that any text contains implicit hierarchies, \"by which an order is imposed on reality and by which a subtle repression is exercised, as these hierarchies exclude, subordinate, and hide the various potential meanings.\" Derrida refers to his procedure for uncovering and unsettling these dichotomies as deconstruction of Western culture.\n\nIn 1968, he published his influential essay \"Plato's Pharmacy\" in the French journal \"Tel Quel\" . This essay was later collected in \"Dissemination\", one of three books published by Derrida in 1972, along with the essay collection \"Margins of Philosophy\" and the collection of interviews entitled \"Positions\".\n\nStarting in 1972, Derrida produced on average more than one book per year. Derrida continued to produce important works, such as \"Glas\" (1974) and \"\" (1980).\n\nDerrida received increasing attention in the United States after 1972, where he was a regular visiting professor and lecturer at several major American universities. In the 1980s, during the American culture wars, conservatives started a dispute over Derrida's influence and legacy upon American intellectuals, and claimed that he influenced American literary critics and theorists more than academic philosophers.\n\nOn March 14, 1987, Derrida presented at the CIPH conference titled \"Heidegger: Open Questions\" a lecture which was published in October 1987 as \"Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question\". It follows the shifting role of \"Geist\" (spirit) through Heidegger's work, noting that, in 1927, \"spirit\" was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling. With his Nazi political engagement in 1933, however, Heidegger came out as a champion of the \"German Spirit,\" and only withdrew from an exalting interpretation of the term in 1953. Derrida asks, \"What of this meantime?\" His book connects in a number of respects with his long engagement of Heidegger (such as \"The Ends of Man\" in \"Margins of Philosophy\", his Paris seminar on philosophical nationality and nationalism in the mid-1980s, and the essays published in English as \"Geschlecht\" and \"Geschlecht II\"). He considers \"four guiding threads\" of Heideggerian philosophy that form \"the knot of this \"Geflecht\" [braid]\": \"the question of the question,\" \"the essence of technology,\" \"the discourse of animality,\" and \"epochality\" or \"the hidden teleology or the narrative order.\"\n\n\"Of Spirit\" is an important contribution to the long debate on Heidegger's Nazism and appeared at the same time as the French publication of a book by a previously unknown Chilean writer, Victor Farías, who charged that Heidegger's philosophy amounted to a wholehearted endorsement of the Nazi \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) faction. Derrida responded to Farías in an interview, \"Heidegger, the Philosopher's Hell\" and a subsequent article, \"Comment donner raison? How to Concede, with Reasons?\" He called Farías a weak reader of Heidegger's thought, adding that much of the evidence Farías and his supporters touted as new had long been known within the philosophical community.\n\nSome have argued that Derrida's work took a \"political turn\" in the 1990s. Texts cited as evidence of such a turn include \"Force of Law\" (1990), as well as \"Specters of Marx\" (1994) and \"Politics of Friendship\" (1994). Others, however, including Derrida himself, have argued that much of the philosophical work done in his \"political turn\" can be dated to earlier essays. Derrida develops an ethicist view respecting to hospitality, exploring the idea that two types of hospitalities exist, conditional and unconditional. Though this contributed to the works of many scholars, Derrida was seriously criticized for this.\n\nThose who argue Derrida engaged in an \"ethical turn\" refer to works such as \"The Gift of Death\" as evidence that he began more directly applying deconstruction to the relationship between ethics and religion. In this work, Derrida interprets passages from the Bible, particularly on Abraham and the Sacrifice of Isaac, and from Søren Kierkegaard's \"Fear and Trembling\". Derrida's contemporary readings of Emmanuel Levinas, Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt, Jan Patočka, on themes such as law, justice, responsibility, and friendship, had a significant impact on fields beyond philosophy. Derrida and Deconstruction influenced aesthetics, literary criticism, architecture, film theory, anthropology, sociology, historiography, law, psychoanalysis, theology, feminism, gay and lesbian studies and political theory. Jean-Luc Nancy, Richard Rorty, Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom, Rosalind Krauss, Hélène Cixous, Julia Kristeva, Duncan Kennedy, Gary Peller, Drucilla Cornell, Alan Hunt, Hayden White, Mario Kopić, and Alun Munslow are some of the authors who have been influenced by deconstruction.\n\nDerrida delivered a eulogy at Levinas' funeral, later published as \"Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas\", an appreciation and exploration of Levinas's moral philosophy. Derrida used Bracha L. Ettinger's interpretation of Lévinas' notion of femininity and transformed his own earlier reading of this subject respectively.\n\nDerrida continued to produce readings of literature, writing extensively on Maurice Blanchot, Paul Celan, and others.\n\nIn 1991 he published \"The Other Heading\", in which he discussed the concept of identity (as in cultural identity, European identity, and national identity), in the name of which in Europe have been unleashed \"the worst violences,\" \"the crimes of xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, religious or nationalist fanaticism.\"\n\nAt the 1997 Cerisy Conference, Derrida delivered a ten-hour address on the subject of \"the autobiographical animal\" entitled The Animal That Therefore I Am (More To Follow). Engaging with questions surrounding the ontology of nonhuman animals, the ethics of animal slaughter and the difference between humans and other animals, the address has been seen as initiating a late \"animal turn\" in Derrida's philosophy, although Derrida himself has said that his interest in animals is, in fact, present in his earliest writings.\n\nBeginning with \"The Deaths of Roland Barthes\" in 1981, Derrida produced a series of texts on mourning and memory occasioned by the loss of his friends and colleagues, many of them new engagements with their work. \"Memoires for Paul de Man\", a book-length lecture series presented first at Yale and then at Irvine as Derrida's Wellek Lecture, followed in 1986, with a revision in 1989 that included \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War\". Ultimately, fourteen essays were collected into \"The Work of Mourning\" (2001), which was expanded in the 2003 French edition, \"Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde\" (literally, \"The end of the world, unique each time\"), to include essays dedicated to Gérard Granel and Maurice Blanchot.\n\nIn October 2002, at the theatrical opening of the film \"Derrida\", he said that, in many ways, he felt more and more close to Guy Debord's work, and that this closeness appears in Derrida's texts. Derrida mentioned, in particular, \"everything I say about the media, technology, the spectacle, and the 'criticism of the show', so to speak, and the markets – the becoming-a-spectacle of everything, and the exploitation of the spectacle.\" Among the places in which Derrida mentions the \"Spectacle\", is a 1997 interview about the notion of the intellectual.\n\nDerrida engaged with many political issues, movements, and debates:\n\nBeyond these explicit political interventions, however, Derrida was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself, within and beyond philosophy. Derrida insisted that a distinct political undertone had pervaded his texts from the very beginning of his career. Nevertheless, the attempt to understand the political implications of notions of responsibility, reason of state, the other, decision, sovereignty, Europe, friendship, difference, faith, and so on, became much more marked from the early 1990s on. By 2000, theorizing \"democracy to come,\" and thinking the limitations of existing democracies, had become important concerns.\n\nCrucial readings in his adolescence were Rousseau's \"Reveries of a Solitary Walker\" and \"Confessions\", André Gide's journal, \"La porte étroite\", \"Les nourritures terrestres\" and \"The Immoralist\"; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. The phrase \"Families, I hate you!\" in particular, which inspired Derrida as an adolescent, is a famous verse from Gide's \"Les nourritures terrestres\", book IV. In a 1991 interview Derrida commented on a similar verse, also from book IV of the same Gide work: \"I hated the homes, the families, all the places where man thinks to find rest\" (\"Je haïssais les foyers, les familles, tous lieux où l'homme pense trouver un repos\").\n\nOther influences upon Derrida are Martin Heidegger, Plato, Søren Kierkegaard, Alexandre Kojève, Maurice Blanchot, Antonin Artaud, Roland Barthes, Georges Bataille, Edmund Husserl, Emmanuel Lévinas, Ferdinand de Saussure, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Claude Lévi-Strauss, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, J. L. Austin and Stéphane Mallarmé.\n\nHis book, \"Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas\", reveals his mentorship by this philosopher and Talmudic scholar who practiced the phenomenological encounter with the Other in the form of the Face, which commanded human response.\n\nDerrida's philosophical friends, allies, students and the heirs of Derrida's thought include Paul de Man, Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Blanchot, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Sarah Kofman, Hélène Cixous, Bernard Stiegler, Alexander García Düttmann, Joseph Cohen, Geoffrey Bennington, Jean-Luc Marion, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Raphael Zagury-Orly, Jacques Ehrmann, Avital Ronell, Judith Butler, Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec, Ernesto Laclau, Samuel Weber and Catherine Malabou.\n\nJean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe were among Derrida's first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right. Despite their considerable differences of subject, and often also of a method, they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida, from the early 1970s.\n\nDerrida wrote on both of them, including a long book on Nancy: \"Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy\" (\"On Touching—Jean-Luc Nancy\", 2005).\n\nDerrida's most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man, which began with their meeting at Johns Hopkins University and continued until de Man's death in 1983. De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction, and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers.\n\nShortly after de Man's death, Derrida authored a book \"Memoires: pour Paul de Man\" and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal \"Critical Inquiry\" called \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War\". The memoir became cause for controversy, because shortly before Derrida published his piece, it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US, de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the German occupation of Belgium, including several that were explicitly antisemitic.\n\nDerrida complicated the notion that it is possible to simply read de Man's later scholarship through the prism of these earlier political essays. Rather, any claims about de Man's work should be understood in relation to the entire body of his scholarship. Critics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Man's writing. Some critics have found Derrida's treatment of this issue surprising, given that, for example, Derrida also spoke out against antisemitism and, in the 1960s, broke with the Heidegger disciple Jean Beaufret over Beaufret's instances of antisemitism, about which Derrida (and, after him, Maurice Blanchot) expressed shock.\n\nDerrida's criticism of Foucault appears in the essay \"Cogito and the History of Madness\" (from \"Writing and Difference\"). It was first given as a lecture on March 4, 1963, at a conference at Wahl's \"Collège philosophique\", which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two men that was never fully mended.\n\nIn an appendix added to the 1972 edition of his \"History of Madness\", Foucault disputed Derrida's interpretation of his work, and accused Derrida of practicing \"a historically well-determined little pedagogy [...] which teaches the student that there is nothing outside the text [...]. A pedagogy which inversely gives to the voice of the masters that infinite sovereignty that allows it indefinitely to re-say the text.\" According to historian Carlo Ginzburg, Foucault may have written \"The Order of Things\" (1966) and \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\" partly under the stimulus of Derrida's criticism. Carlo Ginzburg briefly labeled Derrida's criticism in \"Cogito and the History of Madness\", as \"facile, nihilistic objections,\" without giving further argumentation.\n\nGeoffrey Bennington, Avital Ronell and Samuel Weber belong to a group of Derrida translators. Many of Derrida's translators are esteemed thinkers in their own right. Derrida often worked in a collaborative arrangement, allowing his prolific output to be translated into English in a timely fashion.\n\nHaving started as a student of de Man, Gayatri Spivak took on the translation of \"Of Grammatology\" early in her career and has since revised it into a second edition. Barbara Johnson's translation of Derrida's \"Dissemination\" was published by The Athlone Press in 1981. Alan Bass was responsible for several early translations; Bennington and Peggy Kamuf have continued to produce translations of his work for nearly twenty years. In recent years, a number of translations have appeared by Michael Naas (also a Derrida scholar) and Pascale-Anne Brault.\n\nBennington, Brault, Kamuf, Naas, Elizabeth Rottenberg, and David Wills are currently engaged in translating Derrida's previously unpublished seminars, which span from 1959 to 2003. Volumes I and II of \"The Beast and the Sovereign\" (presenting Derrida's seminars from December 12, 2001 to March 27, 2002 and from December 11, 2002 to March 26, 2003), as well as \"The Death Penalty, Volume I\" (covering December 8, 1999 to March 22, 2000), have appeared in English translation. Further volumes currently projected for the series include \"Heidegger: The Question of Being and History\" (1964-1965), \"Death Penalty, Volume II\" (2000–2001), \"Perjury and Pardon, Volume I\" (1997–1998), and \"Perjury and Pardon, Volume II\" (1998–1999).\n\nWith Bennington, Derrida undertook the challenge published as \"Jacques Derrida\", an arrangement in which Bennington attempted to provide a systematic explication of Derrida's work (called the \"Derridabase\") using the top two-thirds of every page, while Derrida was given the finished copy of every Bennington chapter and the bottom third of every page in which to show how deconstruction exceeded Bennington's account (this was called the \"Circumfession\"). Derrida seems to have viewed Bennington in particular as a kind of rabbinical explicator, noting at the end of the \"Applied Derrida\" conference, held at the University of Luton in 1995 that: \"everything has been said and, as usual, Geoff Bennington has said everything before I have even opened my mouth. I have the challenge of trying to be unpredictable after him, which is impossible... so I'll try to pretend to be unpredictable after Geoff. Once again.\"\n\nDerrida was familiar with the work of Marshall McLuhan, and since his early 1967 writings (\"Of Grammatology\", \"Speech and Phenomena\"), he speaks of language as a \"medium,\" of phonetic writing as \"the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, technical, and economic adventure of the West.\"\n\nHe expressed his disagreement with McLuhan in regard to what Derrida called McLuhan's ideology about the end of writing. In a 1982 interview, he said:\n\nAnd in his 1972 essay \"Signature Event Context\" he said:\n\nIn a paper entitled \"Ghostwriting\", Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak—the translator of Derrida's \"De la grammatologie\" (\"Of Grammatology\") into English—criticised Derrida's understanding of Marx. Commenting on Derrida's \"Specters of Marx\", Terry Eagleton wrote \"The portentousness is ingrained in the very letter of this book, as one theatrically inflected rhetorical question tumbles hard on the heels of another in a tiresomely mannered syntax which lays itself wide open to parody.\"\n\nThough Derrida addressed the American Philosophical Association on at least one occasion in 1988, and was highly regarded by some contemporary philosophers like Richard Rorty, Alexander Nehamas, and Stanley Cavell, his work has been regarded by other analytic philosophers, such as John Searle and Willard Van Orman Quine, as pseudophilosophy or sophistry.\n\nSome analytic philosophers have in fact claimed, since at least the 1980s, that Derrida's work is \"not philosophy.\" One of the main arguments they gave was alleging that Derrida's influence had not been on US philosophy departments but on literature and other humanities disciplines.\n\nIn his 1989 \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\", Richard Rorty argues that Derrida (especially in his book, \"\", one section of which is an experiment in fiction) purposefully uses words that cannot be defined (e.g., \"différance\"), and uses previously definable words in contexts diverse enough to make understanding impossible, so that the reader will never be able to contextualize Derrida's literary self. Rorty, however, argues that this intentional obfuscation is philosophically grounded. In garbling his message Derrida is attempting to escape the naïve, positive metaphysical projects of his predecessors.\n\nPhilosopher Sir Roger Scruton wrote in 2004, \"He's difficult to summarise because it's nonsense. He argues that the meaning of a sign is never revealed in the sign but deferred indefinitely and that a sign only means something by virtue of its difference from something else. For Derrida, there is no such thing as meaning – it always eludes us and therefore anything goes.\"\n\nOn Derrida's scholarship and writing style, Noam Chomsky wrote \"I found the scholarship appalling, based on pathetic misreading; and the argument, such as it was, failed to come close to the kinds of standards I've been familiar with since virtually childhood\".\n\nPaul R. Gross and Norman Levitt also criticized his work for misusing scientific terms and concepts in \"\" (1994).\n\nThree quarrels (or disputes) in particular went out of academic circles and received international mass media coverage: the 1972–88 quarrel with John Searle, the analytic philosophers' pressures on Cambridge University not to award Derrida an honorary degree, and a dispute with Richard Wolin and the NYRB.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection \"Limited Inc\". Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by dedicating any attention to it. Consequently, some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that \"It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions\", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was \"the only sentence of the \"reply\" to which I can subscribe\". Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between analytical and continental philosophy.\n\nThe debate began in 1972, when, in his paper \"Signature Event Context\", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes \"force\", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a \"structure of absence\" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by \"iterability\" (the constraints on what can be said, given by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or \"parasitic\" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, \"Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida\", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with phenomenological perspectives on intentionality. Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austin's type–token distinction and his failure to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.\n\nThe substance of Searle's criticism of Derrida in relation to topics in the philosophy of language—referenced in Derrida's \"Signature Event Context\"—was that Derrida had no apparent familiarity with contemporary philosophy of language nor of contemporary linguistics in Anglo-Saxon countries. Searle explains, \"When Derrida writes about the philosophy of language he refers typically to Rousseau and Condillac, not to mention Plato. And his idea of a \"modern linguist\" is Benveniste or even Saussure.\" Searle describes Derrida's philosophical knowledge as pre-Wittgensteinian—that is to say, disconnected from analytic tradition—and consequently, in his perspective, naive and misguided, concerned with issues long-since resolved or otherwise found to be \"non\"-issues.\n\nSearle also wrote in \"The New York Review of Books\" that he was surprised by \"the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial.\"\n\nDerrida, in his response to Searle ( in \"Limited Inc\"), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, he suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a \"société à responsabilité limitée\" (a \"limited liability company\") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition to be problematic from which they were only paradigmatic examples.\n\nHe continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between \"nonfiction or standard discourse\" and \"fiction,\" defined as its \"parasite\", \"for part of the most original essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place-and in so doing to 'de-essentialize' itself as it were\". \nHe would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:\nIn the debate, Derrida praises Austin's work but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls \"infelicities\" from the \"normal\" operation of language. One \"infelicity,\" for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is \"sincere\" or \"merely citational\" (and therefore possibly ironic, etc.). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily \"citational,\" due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible \"intention\". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.\n\nIn 1994, Searle argued that the ideas upon which \"deconstruction\" is founded are essentially a consequence of a series of conceptual confusions made by Derrida as a result of his outdated knowledge or are merely banalities. He insisted that Derrida's conception of \"iterability\" and its alleged \"corrupting\" effect on meaning stems from Derrida's ignorance of the type–token distinction that exists in current linguistics and philosophy of language. As Searle explains, \"Most importantly, from the fact that different tokens of a sentence type can be uttered on different occasions with different intentions, that is, different speaker meanings, nothing of any significance follows about the original speaker meaning of the original utterance token.\"\n\nIn 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in \"The Construction of Social Reality\". He called Derrida's conclusion \"preposterous\" and stated that \"Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts...\" Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase \"il n'y a pas dehors du texte\" (\"there is no outside-text\"), which appears in Derrida's \"Of Grammatology\".\n\nAccording to Searle, the consistent pattern of Derrida's rhetoric is: \n<br>(a) announce a preposterous thesis, e.g. \"there is no outside-text\" (\"il n'y a pas de hors-texte\"); \n<br>(b) when challenged on \"(a)\" respond that you have been misunderstood and revise the claim in \"(a)\" such that it becomes a truism, e.g. \"\"'il n'y a pas de hors-texte\" means nothing else: there is nothing outside contexts\"; \n<br>(c) when the reformulation from \"(b)\" is acknowledged then proceed as if the \"original\" formulation from \"(a)\" was accepted. The revised idea—for example—that \"everything exists in some context\" is a banality but a charade ensues as if the original claim—\"nothing exists outside of text\" [\"sic\"]—had been established.\n\nIn 1992 some academics at Cambridge University, mostly not from the philosophy faculty, proposed that Derrida be awarded an honorary doctorate. This was opposed by, among others, the university's Professor of Philosophy, David Mellor. Eighteen other philosophers from US, Austrian, Australian, French, Polish, Italian, German, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, and UK institutions, including Barry Smith, Willard Van Orman Quine, David Armstrong, Ruth Barcan Marcus, and René Thom, then sent a letter to Cambridge claiming that Derrida's work \"does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour\" and describing Derrida's philosophy as being composed of \"tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the Dadaists.\" The letter concluded that:\n\nIn the end the protesters were outnumbered—336 votes to 204—when Cambridge put the motion to a vote; though almost all of those who proposed Derrida and who voted in favour were not from the philosophy faculty. Derrida suggested in an interview that part of the reason for the attacks on his work, was that it questioned and modified \"the rules of the dominant discourse, it tries to politicize and democratize education and the university scene.\" To answer the question about the \"exceptional violence,\" the compulsive \"ferocity,\" and the \"exaggeration\" of the \"attacks,\" he would say that these critics organize and practice in his case \"a sort of obsessive personality cult which philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate\".\n\nRichard Wolin has argued since 1991 that Derrida's work, as well as that of Derrida's major inspirations (e.g., Bataille, Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Nietzsche), leads to a corrosive nihilism. For example, Wolin argues that the \"deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism\".\n\nIn 1991, when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of \"The Heidegger Controversy\", Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation, which was \"demonstrably execrable\" and \"weak, simplistic, and compulsively aggressive\". As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given, Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints. Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions. Later editions of \"The Heidegger Controversy\" by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview. The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolin's book by the Heideggerian scholar Thomas Sheehan that appeared in \"The New York Review of Books\", in which Sheehan characterised Derrida's protests as an imposition of censorship. It was followed by an exchange of letters. Derrida in turn responded to Sheehan and Wolin, in \"The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)\", which was published in the book \"Points...\".\n\nTwenty-four academics, belonging to different schools and groups – often in disagreement with each other and with deconstruction – signed a letter addressed to \"The New York Review of Books\", in which they expressed their indignation for the magazine's behaviour as well as that of Sheenan and Wolin.\n\nCritical obituaries of Derrida were published in \"The New York Times\", \"The Economist\", and \"The Independent\". The magazine \"The Nation\" responded to the \"New York Times\" obituary saying that \"even though American papers had scorned and trivialized Derrida before, the tone seemed particularly caustic for an obituary of an internationally acclaimed philosopher who had profoundly influenced two generations of American humanities scholars.\"\n\nSelected translations of works by Derrida\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6070524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6070524", "title": "Jules Ferry laws", "text": "Jules Ferry laws\n\nThe Jules Ferry Laws are a set of French laws which established free education in 1881, then mandatory and laic (secular) education in 1882. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (\"l'école républicaine\"). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.\n\nFrench education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems, the first being a secondary school system and the second a primary school system. However, in each of these systems, the Catholic Church provided an alternative to secular schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France.\n\nAlthough the Republican party is often credited for inventing the concept of free primary school, it was, in fact, a series of progressive improvements since mid-century. For example, in 1698, it was decreed that children ages 7–14 were to attend local Catholic schools with certified instructors, which were also added to areas that previously had none. However, funds for these schools were to be provided by local residents, and it proved very difficult for these schools to afford to remain in practice. Overall, between 1837 (44 years before the Jules Ferry Laws were passed) and 1906, the number of schools had increased by more than 100%. In some areas, like Bretagne Ouest, it reached nearly 200% (197.2%).\n\nThe idea of national government support for popular education and teacher training first became apparent as an important social and political issue during the French Revolution of 1789. Prominent politicians, such as Talleyrand and Condorcet, each proposed a national system of education that would provide every citizen with basic primary education. With the intention of strengthening France's politics and armed forces, a growing concentration on higher education was later seen after the Revolution, notably from Napoleon I in his establishment of the Imperial University in 1804-8. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church still remained highly involved within primary education. The Guizot Laws passed in 1833 obliged all communes to open boys’ schools. The Falloux Laws of March 15, 1850 abolished teacher training programs for men which had been put in place by the Guizot Law. These laws created a mixed system in which some primary education establishments were public and controlled by the state and others were under the supervision of Catholic congregations. Although the concept of universal public schooling was important to these revolutionaries, it became clear that financial issues and political debate thwarted the implementation.\n\nDespite the differences on economic, social, and other issues among the Republican radicals with whom Jules Ferry identified, they were united by the desire to obtain a secular republic due to the growing popularity of anti-clericalism since the Revolution and notably during the Third Republic. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution and its new practices of employment and work days, the radicals also \"hoped that schooling would make workers as reasonable and self-satisfied as it was credited with making the bourgeoisie.\"\n\nThe 1698 attempt would not have held sway with the Republican radicals of Ferry’s generation, who would have seen it as Catholic propaganda and as a defense against the growing popularity of Protestantism. Likewise, Napoleon’s Imperial University remained connected to the Church and paid little heed to primary education that would ensure basic literacy needs among the larger population. In Ferry’s view, schools would educate on political doctrine and the virtues of nationalism, emphasizing independent thought.\n\nMembers of Catholic orders were not allowed to teach in public schools after a five-year transitional period.\n\nOn June 16, 1881, the first set of Jules Ferry Laws were passed, making primary education free for both boys and girls. To finance of the project, the communes and departments had the responsibility to subsidize it. Additionally, the laws protected the wages of teachers by mandating that \"salaries... may never under any circumstances become inferior to the salaries they have enjoyed during the three years preceding the application of the present law...\" (Art. 6).\n\n\"This article outlines what is to be included in a free, mandatory, and laic education system. The Act of March 15, 1850, referred to at the end of the article, is the Falloux Act.\"\n\nPrimary education includes:\n\nThe moral and civic education;\n\nReading and writing;\n\nThe language and elements of French literature;\n\nGeography, particularly that of France;\n\nHistory, particularly that of France to the present;\n\nBasic lessons on law and political economy;\n\nThe elements of the natural sciences and mathematics, and their applications to agriculture, hygiene, industrial arts, handicrafts and use the tools of the principal occupations;\n\nThe elements of drawing, modeling and music;\n\nGymnastics;\n\nFor boys, military exercises;\n\nFor girls, needlework.\n\nArticle 23 of the Act of March 15, 1850 is repealed.\n\n\"This article regulates the option of a religious education, which differs between public and private institutions.\"\n\nThe public primary schools will hold one day free, apart from Sunday, allowing parents to give, if they wish, their children a religious education outside from school buildings. Religious education is optional in private schools.\n\n\"This article discusses further annulment of portions of the Falloux Laws regarding religious authority.\"\n\nThe measures of sections 18 and 44 of the Act of March 15, 1850 are repealed, in that they gave ministers of religion a right of inspection, supervision and management in public and private elementary schools and in the kindergartens (\"salle d’asile\"), as well as paragraph 2 of Article 31 of the Act, which gives consistories the right to present teacher candidates belonging to non-Catholic faiths.\n\n\"This article makes compulsory primary education and lays down the requirements of age and manner of instruction (whether they will be schooled in the home or at a public or private institution).\"\n\nPrimary education is compulsory for children of both sexes between the ages of six to thirteen years and may be given either in institutions of primary or secondary schools, in public or free schools, or in the home, by the father himself or anyone he chooses.\n\nA regulation will determine the means of ensuring primary education for deaf, mute, and blind.\n\n\"This article explains the formation of school boards, national representation in Paris and Lyon, and the terms of office of the members. A stratification of responsibility begins to take shape: first, parents were to have the primary responsibility over the education of their children. Mayors, then, as presidents of the local school boards, were to oversee that parents followed through with this responsibility. To oversee the school board, therefore, was the central government (see Article 7 below). This now removes church officials from these positions.\"\n\nA municipal school board is established in each commune to monitor and encourage school attendance. It consists of the mayor, president; a cantonal delegate and, in common with several townships, as many delegates as there are townships, designated by the school inspector; with members appointed by the department council in equal numbers, at most, to one third of the members of this council.\nIn Paris and Lyon, there is a school board for each municipal district. It is chaired, in Paris, by the mayor, in Lyon, by assistants; it is composed of one delegate appointed by the cantonal inspector of schools, with members appointed by the council, numbering three to seven by each district.\nThe term of office of members of the school board, appointed by the council under the second paragraph, lasts until the election of a new municipal council.\nTheir terms will always renewable.\nThe primary inspector is ex officio member of all school boards established within his jurisdiction.\n\n\"This article discusses the graduation of students after they have completed the appropriate amount of primary education, determined by a public examination.\"\n\nThere shall be established a certificate of primary studies; it is awarded after a public examination which may be presented to children beginning from the age of eleven. Those who, from that age, have obtained the certificate of primary studies, will be exempt from remaining compulsory school time.\n\n\"This article discusses the compulsory requirements of the parents or guardians of each child in procuring an education, whether private or public.\"\n\nThe father, guardian, person having custody of the child, the boss with whom the child is placed, shall, at least fifteen days before the time classes begin, advise the mayor of the town if the child is to be given education in the family or in a public or private school; in the latter two cases, he will indicate the chosen school.\n\nThe families living near to two or more public schools have the option to enroll their children in either of these schools, whether within or outside the territory of their commune, unless they already have the maximum number of students permitted by the regulations.\n\nIn case of dispute, and by request of either the mayor or the parents, the department council rules as the last resort.\n\n\"This article discusses further requirements of the parents or guardians in maintaining their child’s attendance, regulated by the student records kept by the municipal school boards.\"\n\nEach year the mayor shall prepare, in consultation with the municipal school board, the list of all children aged between six and thirteen years and is to notify those persons who are responsible for these children at the time classes begin.\n\nFailure to register, fifteen days before the beginning of school, on the part of parents and other responsible persons, allows him to automatically register the child in a public school and notify the person responsible.\n\nEight days before classes begin, he gives to the directors of public and private schools the list of children who will attend their schools.\n\nA duplicate of these lists is sent by him to the primary inspector.\n\n\"This article discusses the procedures for changing schools and/or the manner in which education is received.\"\n\nWhen a child leaves school, parents or persons responsible must immediately give notice to the mayor and indicate how the child will receive instruction in the future.\n\nThe school inspector invites those responsible for the child to comply with the law and makes them aware of the provisions of Article 12 below.\n\n\"This article outlines policy regarding school absences.\"\n\nWhen a child misses school temporarily, parents or persons responsible should inform the director or the directress the reasons for this absence.\n\nThe directors and directresses must keep a register of attendance that notes, for each class, the absences of the students. At the end of each month, they will address to the mayor and the primary inspector a copy of the register, indicating the number of absences and reasons.\n\nThe reasons for absence will be submitted to the school board. The only known legitimate reasons are: child's illness, death of a family member, incapacity resulting from accidental difficulty of communications. The exceptional circumstances invoked will be taken into consideration by the school board.\n\n\"This article discusses penalties against a school director in the failure to abide by the preceding article.\"\n\nAny private school director who will have not complied with the requirements of the preceding article shall, on the report of the school board and primary inspector, remand to the county council.\n\nThe county council may impose the following penalties: 1) warning; 2) censorship; 3) suspension for not more than one month and in case of recurrence in the school year, for not more than three months.\n\n\"This article discusses the parent or guardian’s duty in the situation of excessive absences of their child.\"\n\nWhen a child is absent from school four times a month for at least half a day without justification accepted by the school board, the father, guardian or responsible person will be invited at least three days in advance to appear in the municipal hall, before the National Commission, which will remind him the text of the law and explain his duty.\n\nIn case of failure to appear without accepted justification, the school board will apply the penalty set out in the following article.\n\n\"This article discusses repeated occurrences of the preceding offenses.\"\n\nIn cases of recurrence within twelve months after the first offense, the municipal school board shall order the posting for fifteen days or a month, at the door of city hall, the surnames, first names, and qualifications of the person responsible, stating the offense made out against the person.\n\nThe same shall apply to persons who have not complied with the requirements of Article 9.\n\n\"This article discusses, in further offense of excessive absence, legal proceedings to be administered.\"\n\nIn case of further offense, the school board, or, in its stead, the inspector, should address a complaint to the justice of the peace.\n\nThe offense will be considered as a contravention resulting in penalties by the police in accordance with Articles 479, 480 and the following of the Penal Code.\n\nSection 463 of the same code is applicable.\n\n\"This article discusses the procedures for excusing a child’s absence, including the case of a child’s industrial or agricultural labor.\"\n\nThe school board may grant to children living with their parents or guardians, when they make a reasoned request, exemptions from school attendance that may not exceed three months per year except holidays.\n\nThese exemptions should, if they exceed fifteen days, be subject to the approval of the primary inspector.\n\nThese provisions do not apply to children who accompany their parents or guardians when they absent themselves temporarily from the town.\n\nIn this case, a notice given verbally or in writing to the mayor or the teacher will suffice.\n\nThe school board may also, with the approval of the department council, exempt children employed in industry, once arrived at the age of apprenticeship, of one of the two classes of the day; the same opportunity will be given to all children employed, outside their families, in agriculture.\n\n\"This article discusses the assessment of students instructed by their families through public examinations.\"\n\nChildren who receive instruction in the family, must, each year, by the end of the second year of compulsory education, take an examination which will focus on matters of education for their age in public schools according to the following forms and programs that will be determined by ministerial orders made in the High Council.\n\nThe Examination Board shall consist of: the primary inspector or his delegate, president; a cantonal delegate; a person holding a university degree or a certificate of competency; the judges will be selected by the school inspector.\n\nIn examining the girls, the certificated person shall be a woman.\n\nIf examination of the child is considered inadequate and no excuse is accepted by the jury, parents are required to send their child to a public or private school within a week of notification or to inform the mayor what school they have chosen.\n\nIn failure of reporting, registration will take place automatically, as stated in Article 8.\n\n\"This article addresses school funding provided by the laws passed on April 10, 1867 by Victor Duruy.\"\n\nThe school fund, established by Article 15 of the Act of April 10, 1867, will be established in all communes.\n\nIn communes where the subsidy does not exceed 30 francs, the fund will be entitled, on the appropriation for this purpose at the Ministry of Education, a grant at least equal to the amount of municipal subsidies.\n\nThe distribution of relief will be under the responsibility of the school board.\n\n\"This article addresses the results of the failure of a school or schools within a commune to comply with Article 4; mandating compulsory primary education.\"\n\nMinisterial orders, made at the request of the school inspectors and department councils, will determine each year the commune where, as a result of inadequate school facilities, the requirements of Articles 4 and following the obligation could not be enforced.\n\nAn annual report, sent to the Congress by the Minister of Education, will give the list of communes to which this section has been applied.\n\n"}

He is well known for his work with Pacifica Radio station KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California, and for the many nationally broadcast hearings he anchored for the Pacifica network.\n\nA native of New York City, Bensky graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1954 and, with departmental honors, from Yale University, where he was managing editor of the \"Yale Daily News\". He is married and has one daughter.\n\nPrior to his broadcasting career (and continuing throughout), Bensky worked as a print journalist and editor. He worked at the \"Minneapolis Star-Tribune\" after college, while attending graduate school at the University of Minnesota. He then worked as an editor at Random House, before moving to France, where he was Paris editor of \"The Paris Review\" from 1964 to 1966. He then returned to New York, as an editor of \"The New York Times\" Sunday Book Review, and also wrote daily book reviews. But his views on the war in Vietnam were not well received by editors of the \"Times,\" and several of his reviews and features were rejected. In 1968, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to take over as managing editor of the radical, anti-war publication, \"Ramparts\" magazine, working closely with editor-in-chief Robert Scheer.\n\nAfter leaving \"Ramparts,\" Bensky worked for a time at San Francisco radio station KSAN-FM, before joining the staff of KPFA-FM in Berkeley. In 1972, he anchored and produced Pacifica Radio's coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions, both held in Miami, along with the attendant massive anti-war protests, dubbed \"The Siege of Miami\".\n\nBensky served as station manager for KPFA from 1974-77. After returning to KSAN as a news anchor, reporter, and talk show host, he narrowly missed accompanying Congressman Leo Ryan to investigate conditions at the Jonestown colony in Guyana in 1978. (Ryan and four journalists were shot to death on an airstrip, precipitating the mass murder-suicide of over 900 people.) In the early 1980s, Bensky turned his attention to the revolutions and American interventions in Nicaragua and El Salvador. He produced the PBS documentary, \"Nicaragua: These Same Hands\" in 1980.\n\nPerhaps best known as national affairs correspondent for Pacifica Radio from 1987-1998, Bensky covered numerous national and international events for Pacifica, including the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987, the confirmation hearings for four Supreme Court justices, the 1990 elections in Nicaragua, and numerous demonstrations and protests in Washington and elsewhere. Most recently, he anchored Pacifica's live coverage of the September 11 Commission hearings, and co-anchored Pacifica's coverage of the 2004 Democratic and Republican conventions, as well as the Presidential debates. He was anchor for Pacifica's extensive coverage of the post 2004 election controversy in Ohio, as well as several Congressional hearings about the misuse of executive power in the Bush administration.\n\nHe recently retired as host of a weekly two-hour radio talk show, Sunday Salon, originating at KPFA in Berkeley. The broadcasts are archived at SundaySalon.org. Among his guests were numerous literary and political luminaries, including the late Senator Paul Wellstone, Paul Krugman, Manning Marable, Bernie Sanders, Jane Smiley, Calvin Trillin, and Gary Shteyngart.\n\nBensky has written for \"The Nation,\" magazine, and was a regular contributor to the \"Los Angeles Times\" Sunday Book Review. A longtime resident of Berkeley, he was a political writer and columnist for the \"East Bay Express\" for fifteen years.\n\nHe has also appeared as a guest journalist on C-SPAN, CNN, \"The Today Show,\" and \"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour\", as well as on San Francisco KQED-FM's \"Forum\" and KQED-TV's \"This Week in Northern California.\" In addition, he was founding managing editor (1999-2000) of the web site Mediachannel.org.\n\nBensky won the prestigious George Polk award for his coverage of Iran-Contra, and has won five Gold Reel awards from the National Federation of Community Broadcasters. He has won a career achievement award from the Society of Professional Journalists, and the Golden Gadfly award from Media Alliance.\n\nIn addition to his work as a journalist, Bensky has had a continuing role in the classroom. For twelve years he taught broadcast journalism classes at Stanford and courses in mass communication, journalism, broadcasting, and political science at California State University (CSU), East Bay in Hayward, California. He currently teaches media criticism and analysis at Berkeley City College and political science at CSU, East Bay.\n\nBensky has been a political activist since the 1960s, working with nuclear disarmament and anti-war groups in New York City, Paris, and San Francisco during the Vietnam War. In 1968, he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. He co-designed and wrote numerous successful direct mail appeals for Modern progressive organizations, including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and the United Farm Workers. He is a devout pacifist and an outspoken opponent of capital punishment.\n\nSince retiring from regular broadcasting in 2007, Bensky has returned to a lifetime avocation, French language and literature. He is producer and host\nof \"Radio Proust,\" a web site which he's developing as a fellow of the Bard College Center. He has also developed and is teaching classes about Proust for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\n"}

He was also a mathematician and an irrigation and consulting engineer.\n\nLouis George Carpenter was born on March 28, 1861, the son of Charles Ketchum Carpenter and Jeanette Coryelle Carpenter. His siblings included two notable brothers, Professor Rolla C. Carpenter of Cornell University and jurist William L. Carpenter.\n\nHe married Mrs. Mary Jane Cliff Merrell (a librarian at Michigan State Agricultural College—now Michigan State University—and the second woman graduate from the college) in 1887 in Michigan. They had a son and daughter before she died in 1921. He remarried in 1922 to Katherine M. Warren.\n\nCarpenter died in Denver, Colorado on September 12, 1935. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Lake Orion, Oakland County, Michigan.\n\nCarpenter graduated in 1879 from the Michigan State Agricultural College with a Bachelor of Science degree. He studied at Johns Hopkins University from 1879 to 1881 then from 1881 to 1883 he was tutored at the University of Michigan literary department.\n\nFrom 1881 to 1888 he served as an assistant to his brother, Professor Rolla C. Carpenter, in teaching courses at the Michigan State Agricultural College.\n\nIn 1883 he was awarded his Masters of Science degree from Michigan State Agricultural College.\n\nCarpenter began teaching mathematics at Michigan State Agricultural College and did so from 1883 to 1888.\n\nCarpenter was recruited by President Charles Ingersoll and accepted the chair of the Engineering & Physics Department of the then Colorado Agricultural College. It was there where he began the first organized and systematic college program for irrigation engineering. Those completing such instruction were awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Irrigation Engineering. In addition, Carpenter was a strong advocate to expand education opportunities to minorities and women. He helped promote and organize newly accredited degree programs despite opposition from those unwilling to change.\n\nCarpenter declined the Presidency of that college (later university) in 1891 and several times during his tenure. Despite difficultly to enact change, he was significant in being able to help transform the farm focused college into a university of higher learning.\n\nIn 1889 he became the director of the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station.\n\nCarpenter was one of the foremost leading experts on irrigation systems. During his life he investigated irrigation systems not only in North America but also in Canada and Europe. This led to his engineering consulting and water law. He became Colorado's State Engineer which he held for several years while still teaching.\n\nIn 1911, Carpenter left academics and established an engineering consulting firm in Denver, Colorado. This covered not only included Irrigation Engineering but consulting on hydraulic construction projects and the problems associated with such projects. He did this traveling around Canada, the United States and Western Europe with his brother running the office until his retirement in 1922. He left many papers to the University and was given an honorary doctorate before his death in 1935.\n\nIn 1907, Carpenter concluded a report for the British Columbia Irrigation commission to assist them in implementing in engineering the irrigation of southern BC. This led to the eventual development of the BC Ministry of Agriculture eight present watershed and demand areas.\n\nReportedly, he reviewed and edited geological reports from several countries.\n\nOne example of a book written by Carpenter has the title, \"On the measurement and division of water\" published by the Colorado Agricultural College - Agricultural Experiment Station in Fort Collins, Colorado. This book and other like it show his primary focus on water and irrigation.\n\n\nCarpenter left his academic papers related to water resources, education, irrigation and outside field work to Colorado State University after he retired in 1922. These papers detail the early work in organizing and stressing the importance of water education in modern societies.\n\nHis papers also include lantern slides of the Zola Dam in France. And correspondence of queries, students, letters of recommendation and other papers of academic nature.\n\nA joint effort of the University Libraries and the Colorado Water Institute created a \"Guide to the Papers of Louis G. Carpenter\" and covers the years from 1888 to 1919. It resides at the Morgan Library at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nAdditional papers, legal papers, articles about and newspaper clippings are at the Denver Public Library. This biographical type collection reflect his work as a \"Colorado irrigation engineer who specialized in irrigation and water-use practices in the Rocky Mountain region.\"\n\nFor his promotion of education science and engineering which had an impact not only in America, but also Canada, England and France, Carpenter was given several honors.\n\nIn 1895 he was decorated by the French government with the Chevalier du Merite Agricole. In 1900 he was awarded a Gold Medal for his scientific education at the Paris Exposition.\n\nBy 1900 Carpenter was elected a member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nIn 1927, Carpenter was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Colorado State University.\n\n"}

It is a part of the \"Inter Academy Medical Panel\" (IAMP), a global network of medical academies. The Academy is headquartered at NAMS House, at Ansari Nagar, neighbouring the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Indian Council of Medical Research House, along Mahatama Gandhi Marg, in the Indian capital of New Delhi.\n\nThe National Academy of Medical Sciences originated as the Indian Academy of Medical Sciences, a registered society, on 21 April 1961, for the promotion of medical education and research in India. The academy, housed in NAMS House, New Delhi, started functioning when Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India inaugurated the institution on 19 December 1961. In 1963, the inaugural convocation was held at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi when Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan addressed the gathering. The Academy re-branded itself as the National Academy of Medical Sciences (India) on 16 November 1976.\n\nThe governance of the Academy is by a council composed of 22 members, selected from the Indian medical community, and is headed by a President and a Vice President, with a Treasurer assisting them in financial matters. Mukund S. Joshi is the incumbent president and Sanjay Wadhwa and Manorama Berry serves as the vice president and treasurer, respectively. The council members include many notable medical personalities such as P. K. Dave, Saroj Chooramani Gopal and Mohan Kameswaran, among others.\n\nOne of the principal activities of NAMS is promoting medical education through continuing medical education (CME) programmes for the junior scientists and medical professionals. The Academy provides opportunities, on a regular basis, for the aspirants to undergo training at various centres of excellence. It conducts symposia and workshops on various medical topics where medical professionals and researchers are exposed to modern medical methodologies and practices and encourages them to join the stream as members of the Academy. On successful performance at the entry examination conducted by the National Board of Examinations, the examinees are awarded the Diplomate of National Board title (formerly MNAMS). Besides the academic promotion activities, the Academy recognizes excellence through Fellowships and Awards; the fellowship further categorized into Honorary Fellows and elected Fellows. Honorary Fellowship is awarded to eminent personalities while elected fellowship is limited to medical professionals. An annual conference is conducted by the Academy, NAMSCON, which is a major event in the Indian medical calendar. Further, it acts as an advisory body to the Government of India in matters related to National Health Policy and Planning.\n\nThe academy honors academics with notable service profile and achievements with the title of \"Emeritus Professor\". The following is a list of \"Emeritus Professor\" title holders:\nThe Academy publishes a quarterly journal, the \"Annals of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (India)\", which provides a platform for researchers, educationists and education administrators to publish their works. Sanjeev Misra is the editor while V.

Training products include national training packages and accredited courses which outline the qualifications, competencies and assessment criteria for specific areas of training. These two dimensions form the National Skills Framework. The National Quality Council is responsible for overseeing the effective operation of the Framework. Training received and certified under the framework is 'portable' across state boundaries and industries.\n\nAll students doing nationally recognised training need to have a Unique Student Identifier (USI).\n\nAustralia has a system of Technical and Further Education colleges, which offers courses in most larger towns and cities at technical schools and community colleges.\n\nAdditionally, individuals and companies can be accredited as a Registered Training Organisation and offer courses and modules of training.\n\nThe courses available are listed by the . The hierarchy of courses available for VET under the Australian Qualifications Framework is:\n\nThe training packages at the Cert II-IV levels offer options as well as the mandatory courses. A person founding out their training would be able to group these extra training courses and be assessed for additional or higher certificates.\n\nHence: \n\nA person's experience can also be assessed without formal training under a system of \"recognition of prior learning\" (RPL). In such cases, the assessor (who would be qualified as a Certificate IV in Training and Assessment - TAE40110 from Training Package TAE10) can take evidence of the person's abilities, experience, and training the particular skill area, plus similar and other fields, and issue a certificate; or, require the person to undertake certain courses to round out the person's competencies before the issue of a certificate.\n\nThe RPL for history in Australia dates back to 1993 when it was first introduced by the Australian Government as part of a National Qualifications Framework.\n\nRPL has been the mainstay of all assessments conducted under national vocational education and training systems since the late 1980s and continues to evolve as different VET systems evolve. It was first introduced into the UK by Susan Simosko, a consultant with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, who adapted it as the central element of all competency-based assessments. A similar process was adopted by all countries during the development of their own vocational education and training systems, some aligned solely with the need to assess competence in line with the needs of private and public sector organizations, and others as a critical element of the assessment of skills and knowledge in order to grant vocational qualifications.\n\nAs of 2015, it is part of the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF) charter and the standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) delivering accredited training. There are numerous companies that offer training online that help Australians get qualified and improve their careers.

In other countries, primarily the UK, United States, Canada, and several ex-Yugoslav and Asian countries, the equivalent period covered by the diploma is middle school.\n\nOver the course of the ninth grade, at the end of each unit of a course, all pupils take a test graded out of twenty points. At the end of each trimester the average mark from each subject is calculated as well as a general average (the average of all the subjects' averages).\n\nUp until 2007 the averages from the two school years (six trimesters) from the start of the \"quatrième\" (eighth grade) to the end of the ninth grade were counted towards the final result. From 2007 onwards, only the marks from the ninth grade are used. A pupil may know he has a good enough average to pass the Brevet before sitting for the exams. However students may not skip the exams, as that would mean automatic disqualification.\n\nAt the end of the ninth grade, three tests are taken, such that each will have a score of:<br>\nFrench: 100<br>\nHistory, geography and citizenship: 50<br>\nMathematics: 100<br>\nBiology, Physics, Chemistry and Technology: 50\n\nAnd as of 2011, an oral exam in cultural history is mandatory for all students in the ninth grade. It is taken before the three other tests. It consists of writing an essay (around 2000 words) about any art form and analyzing 6 to 8 paintings, then presenting them to two teachers for 10–15 minutes then answering questions that they ask. This also has a score out of 40.\n\nThe results are calculated using a weighted total. The subjects of the final exams are weighted as follows:\n\n\nThe subjects studied in the ninth grade are given a total weighting of 9 to 11, depending on the série taken.

He is credited with helping to bring modern dance to Western Canada.\n\nAlthough Vesak worked internationally as a choreographer, he was frequently referred to as \"Canada's finest male dancer.\" Early in his career, he often choreographed works and then danced in them as well, receiving critical acclaim for both roles. He was described as a \"Renaissance Man\", well known as a lecturer, dancer, set and costume designer, and teacher, as well as for his choreography and work in the theater. Vesak was born in Port Moody, British Columbia in 1936 to Frank and Nora Vesak, of Czech and Belgian descent. As a child, he was an opera fan who described listening to Metropolitan Opera broadcasts. He studied dance in Edmonton, Alberta with Laine Metz and followed that with study under Josephine Slater, whom he described as having the greatest influence on his career at that time, because in addition to teaching and mentoring him, she introduced him to Ted Shawn who was one of the pioneers of modern dance in the United States. Vesak was given a scholarship to train with Shawn at Jacob's Pillow in Lee, Massachusetts, where he trained and eventually joined the teaching staff. Vesak also studied under Margaret Craske, Merce Cunningham, Geoffrey Holder, Pauline Koner, Madam La Meri, Robert Abramson, Ruth St. Denis, and Vera Volkova, among others. He was classically trained, and was a member of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Ballet in Britain and also studied ethnic dance extensively. Although he wanted to be an actor, at the age of 17, he decided on dance and was awarded a scholarship in 1960 to Jacob's Pillow Dance in Massachusetts, where he studied under the direction of Ted Shawn and other well-known teachers. When Vesak returned to Vancouver, he co-founded the Pacific Dance Theatre in 1964 and later founded the eponymous Norbert Vesak Dancers, which became the Western Dance Theatre in 1970.\n\nIn 1964, Norbert Vesak was named resident choreographer for the Vancouver Playhouse Theater. He went to England to perform with Western Theatre Ballet, and then returned to Canada. During the 1960s, he served as the resident choreographer for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Theatre Calgary and the Banff Festival Ballet, and several other companies, doing choreography, teaching, and directorial work.\n\nBy the time he founded the Western Dance Theatre, he had already created 60 major works and had been a guest choreographer at several companies. His work with the Western Dance Theater was, by his description, designed to present stories about human relations, with influences from the monumental geography of British Columbia: \"We would hope the rugged beauty of the environment of B.C. was evident in Western Dance Theatre's work, and that it is truly a product of a unique area of Canadian topography.\" Vesak often undertook large, complex projects that attracted critical admiration for their scope, as for example, in June, 1969, when he choreographed Pierrot Lunaire by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg, danced to the central part of Schoenberg's 21-part orchestration of poems by Belgian poet Albert Giraud. One of Vesak's major objectives was educating the public about contemporary dance, and his companies often presented free educational programs on contemporary dance in public schools and other public venues. His dance school in Vancouver at one time had an enrollment of more than 700 students.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1962, he published what has been called the \"shortest-lived dance magazine in Canadian history\". Called \"The Canadian Dance World Magazine\", Vesak and Slater published a total of six issues of the free 16-page magazine and distributed it to 300 individuals who were interested in dance. Each issue had its own theme including: men in dance, ethnic dance, religion in dance, symbolism, and leaders of the modern dance movement. He described the magazine as being \"dedicated to the furtherance of dance\" in Canada and he published it without attribution. Known for choreographing both classical and contemporary work, in 1963, Vesak debuted his choreographic work entitled Parenthesis, at the first Canadian Modern Dance Festival in Toronto. He also created works, such as \"From Ecstasy to Despair\" in 1969, that were described as futuristic and emotionally jarring, that provided an important social message. He was director of the San Francisco Opera ballet from 1970 to 1975. He was named official choreographer for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1975. Also in 1975, he was named director of the Metropolitan Opera ballet. He became one of the most internationally renowned choreographers of his time, having the rare distinction of being awarded two international gold medals for choreography in a single year, withhis broad range of work performed throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America.\n\nTwo notable ballets Vesak created in the 1970s, The Ecstasy of Rita Joe and \"What To Do 'Till the Messiah Comes\", were major successes for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and highlighted important cultural and sociological issues. \"The Ecstasy of Rita Joe\", was commissioned by the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood and debuted as a ballet in 1971. The ballet was based on a controversial play written by George Ryga about a young Aboriginal girl who leaves the reservation to move to the big city, and about the cultural conflicts, poverty, and violence that she experiences. Vesak's ballet was said to surpass the play itself in terms of delivering the intended message to the audience: \"Most of the reviews were vehement in their support of the ballet's antiracist message. William Littler in the Toronto Daily Star called it 'perhaps the ballet of 1971, in terms of its social importance to Canadians'. He noted that the ballet is 'less angry, less polemical in tone than Ryga's play, which hammers away at the idea that white justice cannot comprehend the Indian fact.' In 'the abstracting medium of dance,' wrote Littler, the message 'loses some of its soap-box shrillness and gains symbolic power.'\" The commissioning of this work by the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood was said to have been a calculated effort by the Brotherhood to bring the message about the effects of racism against indigenous peoples to a larger population through use of a medium, ballet, that was not usually used for inspiring societal understanding. \"As a platform for Aboriginal rights, The Ecstasy of Rita Joe was undeniably potent, with people sobbing at the end of the ballet.\"\n\nThe ballet met with equal success when it was performed internationally: “Themes explored in Norbert Vesak’s the \"Ecstasy of Rita Joe\" met with resounding acceptance throughout Australia on the spring tour of 1972. Anna Maria de Gorriz, in the title role, brought down the house with curtain calls in Sidney and Melbourne.”\n\nIn 1973, \"What to do Till the Messiah Comes\" became another of Vesak's most acclaimed works, described as a visionary ballet set to rock music, and in 1980, he won gold medals for his choreography of \"Belong Pas de Deux\" from that work at the International Ballet Concours in both Varna, Bulgaria and Osaka, Japan. In addition, Canadian ballerina Evelyn Hart won a gold medal in Varna, Bulgaria for her performance of \"Belong\" with David Peregrine in 1980. Hart rose to international stardom, and Vesak's \"Belong\" became a signature piece for her. \"Belong Pas de Deux\" remains one of Vesak's most enduring works, and is in the repertoires of ballet companies worldwide. Performances of it were televised in several countries including Canada, the United States, Scotland, England, Germany, and Israel, and it became the title subject of an IMAX film entitled \"Heart Land\", which was released in 1987 and distributed internationally. In 1989, Norbert Vesak collaborated with director Franco Zeffirelli, choreographing La Traviata for the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nIn addition to his choreography work, Norbert Vesak was highly sought after for his skill as a Master Teacher, particularly regarded for the individual attention he gave to dancers. He often co-taught master classes with Joffrey Ballet founder Robert Joffrey. Vesak's commitment to mentoring and providing dance opportunities to young dancers, as well as raising interest in dance, was clear throughout his life.\n\nVesak was regularly chosen to create new works for international companies, receiving commissions from such institutions as the Metropolitan Opera, the Berlin Ballet, the North Carolina Dance Theatre, the Los Angeles Ballet, the Miami Ballet, the Scottish Ballet, the Joffrey II Dancers, Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, the National Ballet of Canada, the Winnipeg Contemporary Dancers, The Alberta Ballet, Ballet Florida in Palm Beach, National Association for Regional Ballet, the Marin Ballet in San Rafael, California, and the Deutsche Opera Ballet in Berlin, in addition to many others.\n\nNorbert Vesak's long-time partner and creative collaborator was Robert de La Rose, a costume and set designer who worked on Vesak's productions and was involved in the concept development of many of Vesak's works.\n\nLady of the Camellias was conceived by Norbert Vesak and Robert de La Rose to be a full-length ballet based on the novel of the same name by Alexander Dumas. Although Vesak worked on the concept, the libretto, selected the music, and even had the costumes designed by de La Rose, \"Lady of the Camellias\" was ultimately choreographed by another international choreographer, Val Caniparoli. Vesak died suddenly of a brain aneurysm while on his way to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of North Carolina Dance Theater, where a work that he had designed for that company in 1975, \"The Gray Goose of Silence\", was being performed to commemorate the occasion. After his death, \"Lady of the Camellias\" remained in limbo for three years until de La Rose approached Caniparoli about taking it on. Caniparoli had known Vesak well, since Vesak had given Caniparoli his first professional job and was also one of Caniparoli's teachers. Caniparoli agreed to do the project, adapting Vesak's concept and music to his own choreography, with de La Rose providing the costume and partial set design. It was Caniparoli's first full-length work, and debuted by Ballet Florida in 1994. It has since been performed by many companies including: Ballet West, Ballet Florida, Boston Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Tulsa Ballet, Alberta Ballet, Diablo Ballet, and Royal Winnipeg Ballet.\n\n\"A trained artist can extemporize, but training comes first. You have to be a master of your physical inadequacies, and the only way to do so is to study. No one is born with a dancer's body.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Encyclopedia website: http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/norbert-vesak\n\nMetropolitan Opera website: http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/index.aspx?\n"}

In an undergraduate institution this would usually be other undergraduates, as distinct from the graduate students who may be teaching the writing classes; in an K-12 school this is usually a student from the same grade or higher. There are some basic rules to establishing your peer tutoring program, the key to success is a clear objective. Thorough planning and evidence gathering activities will contribute to substantiation of the decisions you will make.\n\nThere are many benefits for both the peer tutor and tutee in this relationship, one aspect of this is that the tutor can establish a rapport with the tutee in a way that a teacher cannot. A peer tutor may have taken the same class recently, or have taken similar classes. \n\nBecause the peer tutor is seen by the tutee as being more at their own level, advice given by the tutor may be accepted more readily than advice from a teacher. Another key reason for this is that a peer tutor does not give any grade on the paper, whereas a teacher serving in a tutor role may still be perceived as someone who grades papers.\n\nPeer tutors can be trained through on-the-job training, as well as through formal workshops. New tutors can be paired with more experienced tutors for their first few tutorials, and after the tutors are satisfied that the new tutors can operate alone they can give one-on-one tutoring. A key aspect of tutor training is the reflection on tutorials with other tutors. This reflection looks at what could have gone better as well as the tutor's progress in giving tutorials.\n\nIn higher education tutorial settings, the benefits of peer tutoring programs also extend to class tutors. Using grounded theory techniques, it was found that the following five themes underlie their experiences: role exploration, sharing responsibility, regulation of the peer tutored groups, harnessing the peer tutors’ role, and community (see article for further detail).\n\nESL training can be separated from regular tutor training as a subject that contains special difficulties that must be dealt with on their own. Tutoring in an Online Writing Lab can also be separated from normal training.\n\nStated by Goodlad and Sinclair, \"Peer tutoring is the system of instruction in which learners help each other and learn by teaching. Tutoring schemes have been used in a variety of context, with students teaching students, students teaching school pupils, non-professional adults teaching adults and children, and pupils teaching pupils.\" \n\n\n"}

Initially introduced in the early 1970s as a means to make services available to the hard of hearing, Closed captioning as it became known was standardized for Latin alphabets in the 1976 World System Teletext agreement. Non-Latin character set services have subsequently been introduced, and are used in India, and in China to also aid literacy.\n\nIn the mid 1980s Pioneer introduced a range of Laserdisc Karaoke machines, with subtitled Music video playback combined with a Karaoke PA system, the technology was transferred to the PlayStation 2, and later games consoles, and has in parallel been adapted to classroom use of synchronized captioning of musical lyrics (or any text with an Audio and/or Video source) as a Repeated Reading activity.\n\nThe 1996 DVD-Video standard was published with support for up to 32 separate synchronised subtitling streams to be packaged with a video file.\n\nThis idea was struck upon by Brij Kothari, who believed that SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment, at a low per-person cost to shore up literacy rates in India.\n\nBrij Kothari was watching a Spanish film on video with English subtitles during a break from dissertation writing in 1996 when the thought hit him that if all Hindi film songs were subtitled in Hindi, on television in India, it would bring about a revolution in literacy. Upon completion of his academic pursuits Kothari returned to India. In late 1996 he joined the faculty of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. While continuing to teach communication to MBA students, he started work on SLS and it became a project of IIM. The idea of SLS was first innovated, researched, pioneered and nationalized by the Centre for Educational Innovation, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad under Brij Kothari. The program took off on a national scale by August 2002.\n\nBefore Kothari's study, most available research on captioning had demonstrated limited results. As a direct result of Kothari's success with subtitled music video there are several new related studies using technology and music video that are also showing remarkable results.\n\nDuring the last 10 years in India, SLS has been implemented on Doordarshan's film song programmes in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, and Punjabi. For each language the subtitles are in the same language as the audio.\n\nA 2002–2007 Nielsen-ORG study demonstrated that the ability to read a paragraph among schoolchildren jumped from 25% to 56% when exposed to 30 minutes a week of the Rangoli program with subtitles. Over 90% said they prefer having subtitles on songs owing to their interest in the lyrics.\n\nThe basic SLS reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected on-screen, while completing a response worksheet. Ideally, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, text should change colors in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the source media should be dynamic and engaging.\n\nChinese-language programmes are often subtitled, because speakers of other varieties of Chinese can read Standard Written Chinese, even if they cannot understand the spoken dialect.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26964642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26964642", "title": "Smart Way Reading and Spelling", "text": "Smart Way Reading and Spelling\n\nSmart Way Reading and Spelling is a commercial brand of reading instruction methodology and materials that was developed in 2001 by Bright Sky Learning.\n\nOver two years in development, Smart Way Reading and Spelling is designed to be simple to use yet it is extremely efficient in teaching students. The reading methodology ranges from teaching introductory sounds and how to learn American English through advanced reading strategies. The program has been used effectively in remedial reading programs in states across the country with positive and consistent results and is based on the most complete scientific research on teaching reading which stresses systematic and explicit phonics coupled with reading comprehension and fluency.\n\nThe Smart Way Reading and Spelling program is presented in a series of twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text on one side of the flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.\n\nThe delivery of the Smart Way Reading and Spelling program is based on the concept of self-efficacy and its application in instructional practices. The gradual, systematic approach allows students to develop their skills and increase their confidence. Explicit, systematic instruction is recognized as having a direct impact on student success, especially in low-achieving students and supports its use in phonics instruction. As well, research shows phonics instruction is useful to students of all ages and other research validates intense instruction in decoding skills as a method of boosting the reading level for struggling readers in high school.\n\nThis compact disc and flash card product helps people recognize and repeat the sounds unique to American English. It was created and designed specifically for early readers, ELL (English Language Learners) and EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students. The Sounds of English introduces forty-six phonemes (speech sounds) in isolation and in text.\n\n"}
{"id": "53686204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53686204", "title": "TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)", "text": "TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)\n\nTVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment. TVET uses formal, non-formal and informal learning. TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for social equity, inclusion and sustainable development.\n\nThe term 'Technical and Vocational Education and Training' or TVET was officiated at the World Congress on TVET in 1999 in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The congress recognised the term TVET to be broad enough to incorporate other terms that had been used to describe similar educational and training activities including Workforce Education (WE), and Technical-Vocational Education (TVE). The term TVET parallels other types of education and training e.g Vocational Education but is also used as an umbrella term to encompass education and training activities.\n\nThe decision in 1999 to officiate the term TVET led to the development of the UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in Bonn, Germany.\n\nBecause of TVET′s isolation with other education streams it was not widely adopted, in particularly in secondary education. Steps were taken to reduce segmentation of education and training and to address institutional barriers that restricted TVET learners′ options including choices to move vertically to higher levels of learning, or horizontally to other streams.\n\nPolicy-makers have introduced forms of hybridization with other education systems, additionally some of the distinctions between TVET and ′academic′ education streams have been blurred. This hybridisation has been termed the ′vocationalization of secondary education′, a similar process has happened to a lesser extent in tertiary education.\n\nThe baccalauréat professionnel in France, and the middelbaar beroepsonderwijs (MBO) ount of work experience in the area they are specializing in.\n\nApprenticeships enhanced content within occupational training courses and considerable emphasis has been placed on personal skills.\n\nWork education has been included in the primary standards (grades 1–8) to make the students aware of work. At the lower secondary level (grades 9–10) pre-vocational education has been included with the aim to increase students’ familiarity with the world of work.\n\nAround 40% of secondary students are currently enrolled in TVET education, in some schools, academic and vocational students share almost 75% of the curriculum.\n\nA new approach to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced within the framework of general educational reform. This has been guided by the Ministry of Education’s strategy of modernization. Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for profile selection. Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum. In preparation for the upper-secondary specialization, a ′pre-profiling′ programme in grade 9 has been introduced to help students make their choices in grade 10.\n\nTech-prep programmes in the United States of America are examples of how the ′blending′ approach was used to help students make the connections between school and work. In year nine, programmes in broad occupational fields such as the health professions, automotive technology, computer systems networking are offered within general technology studies. The programmes continue for at least two years after the end of secondary school, through a tertiary education or an apprenticeship programme, with students achieving an associate degree or certificate by the end of the programme.\n\nPrivate TVET providers include for-profit and non-profit institutions. Several factors triggered actions to support the expansion of private TVET including the limited capacities of public TVET providers and their low responsiveness to enterprises and trainees. Private TVET providers were expected to be more responsive because they were subject to fewer bureaucratic restrictions than public institutions (particularly in centralized systems). Their presence was expected to help raise quality system-wide, in many developing countries, government budgets constituted a vulnerable and unreliable source of financing for TVET, an important objective was to finance TVET systems by increasing the contribution of beneficiaries, including employers and trainees.\n\nPrivate TVET provision over since 2005 has become a significant and growing part of TVET in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. In some countries, e.g Lebanon, enrolments in private TVET institutions have exceeded enrolments in public institutions. In Jordan, private provision at the community college level has been promoted by the government. However not all experiences has been positive with private proprietary institutions or NGOs, their courses have often been concentrated in professional areas that typically do not require large capital investment, permitting easy entry and exit by private providers from the sector. Quality issues have also emerged, where market information about quality has been unavailable.\n\nTVET has an important role to play in technology diffusion through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as information technology and the green economy has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning.\n\nTVET courses have been created to respond to the diverse ICT needs of learners, whether these are related to work, education or citizenship. New courses have been introduced to address occupational changes in the ICT job market, while many TVET providers have shifted provision towards a blended approach, with significantly more self-directed and/or distance learning. In developed countries, new ICT approaches have been introduced to modernize TVET organizations and to manage administration and finance, including learner records.\n\nThe Education for All (EFA) movement has had its own implications for TVET at both international and national levels. The third EFA goal lacked precision and measurable targets for TVET, however it called for ensuring ′that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes′. This goal had a symbolic value, helping to raise the visibility of TVET and skills development and create a more prominent place for them on the global education policy agenda. The current bulge of young people requiring TVET learning opportunities is partly fuelled by the success of the EFA movement in opening access to basic education, particularly at the primary level. In 2009, 702 million children were enrolled worldwide in primary education, compared with 646 million in 1999.\n\nContinuing TVET involves ongoing training to upgrade existing skills and to develop new ones and has a much higher profile in ageing societies and knowledge-based economies. Increased recognition of the importance of human capital for economic growth and social development made it necessary to increase learning opportunities for adults in workplaces within the wider context of policies and strategies for lifelong learning.\n\nIn many countries policy-makers have considered ways to expand workplace learning opportunities for workers and to assess and give credit for knowledge and skills acquired in workplaces. Efforts were geared towards training for workers in companies, encouraged by legislation, financial incentives and contractual agreements.\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis in 2008, labour markets across the world experienced structural changes that influenced the demand for skills and TVET. Unemployment worsened and the quality of jobs decreased, especially for youth. Gender differentials in labour force participation placed men ahead of women, and skill mismatches deepened. The crisis impacted labour markets adversely and led to deepening uncertainty, vulnerability of employment, and inequality. Furthermore, measures to improve efficiency and profitability in the economic recovery have often led to jobless growth, as happened in Algeria, India and post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nIn seeking to address the level of vulnerable employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify skills needs early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems have focused more on developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt.\n\nIncreasing migration are significant challenges to the national character of TVET systems and qualifications. TVET qualifications are progressively expected not only to serve as proxies for an individual's competencies but to also act as a form of a currency that signals national and international value. TVET systems have been developing mechanisms to enable credible and fair cross-border recognition of skills. In 2007, the ILO identified three types of recognition that TVET system may use: unilateral (independent assessment by the receiving country), mutual (agreements between sending and receiving countries), and multilateral (mostly between a regional grouping of countries). The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.\n\nTVET systems are responding to migration by providing qualifications that can stand the rigour of these recognition systems and by creating frameworks for mutual recognition of qualifications. Regional Qualifications Frameworks such as those in Southern Africa, Europe, Asia and the Caribbean aim to significantly support the recognition of qualifications across borders. These efforts are further supported through the introduction of outcome-based learning methodologies within the broader context of multilateral recognition agreements.\n\nSkills for economic development include a mix of technical and soft skills. Empirical evidence and TVET policy reviews conducted by UNESCO suggest that TVET systems may not as yet sufficiently support the development of the so-called soft competencies. Many countries have, however, adopted competency-based approaches as measures for reforming TVET curricula.\n\nThe HEART Trust National Training Agency of Jamaica adopted this approach, with a particular emphasis on competency standards and balanced job-specific and generic skills. Competency standards aimed to ensure that the training was linked to industry and was up to date, and that competences were integrated into training programmes, along with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes. The balancing of skill types was to ensure adequate attention was given to job-specific skills as well as the conceptual and experiential knowledge necessary to enable individuals to grow and develop in the workplace, and more generally in society.\n\nGlobalization of the economy and the consequent reorganization of the workplace require a more adaptable labour force, requiring countries to rethink the nature and role of TVET. Globalization intensifies pressure on the TVET sector to supply the necessary skills to workers involved in globalized activity and to adapt existing skills to rapidly changing needs. As a consequence, there is an increasing requirement for more demand-driven TVET systems with a greater focus on modular and competency-based programmes, as well as on cognitive and transferable skills, which are expected to help people adapt to unpredictable conditions.\n\nPreparing marginalized groups of youths and adults with the right skills and helping them make the transition from school to work is part of the problem faced by TVET in promoting social equity. Ensuring that the workplace is inclusive poses numerous policy challenges, depending on the contextual dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the capabilities of individuals. For example, the experiences of exclusion by people with disabilities and disadvantaged women may be similar in some ways and different in others. Many individuals experience multiple forms of disadvantage in the workplace, to different degrees of severity, depending on social attitudes and traditions in a specific context or organization. Approaches to inclusiveness in the workplace will therefore vary according to population needs, social diversity and context. To give one example, the Netherlands set about the task of making workplaces more inclusive for low-skilled adults by offering programmes that combine language instruction with work, and in certain cases on-the-job training.\n\nA review of employer surveys in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, reported that employers valued people with disabilities for their high levels of motivation and their diverse perspectives, and found their attendance records to be the same or better than those of other employees. Many employers mentioned that being seen as pro-inclusion was positive for the company or organization's image, an advantage that goes well beyond providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups. In many cases, however, social and cultural perceptions are an obstacle to making workplaces more inclusive, and this will require sensitive and concerted attention. Some low- and middle-income countries have sought to address this through legislation. In Tanzania the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act of 1982 established a quota system that stipulates that 2 per cent of the workforce in companies with over fifty employees must be persons with disabilities.\n\nThe 2012 Education for All Global Monitoring Report concluded that 'all countries, regardless of income level, need to pay greater attention to the needs of young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'. The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the skills needs of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not sufficient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor. Coherent policies that link social protection, micro-finance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups.\n\nRecent years have seen rising numbers of young women enrolling in TVET programmes, especially in service sector subjects. At times the challenge is to bring more males into female-dominated streams. However, beyond number games, the real gender parity test that TVET systems are yet to pass is balancing the gender participation in programmes that lead to employability, as well as to decent and high-paying jobs. Gender disparities in learning opportunities, and earnings, are a cause for concern. The persistent gender-typing of TVET requires concerted attention if TVET is to really serve a key facilitative role in shared growth, social equity and inclusive development.\n\nThe absence of work, poor quality of work, lack of voice at work, continued gender discrimination and unacceptably high youth unemployment are all major drivers of TVET system reforms from the perspective of social equity. This is an area where TVET systems continue to be challenged to contribute proactively to the shaping of more equitable societies.\n\nGender equality has received significant international attention in recent years, and this has been reflected in a reduction in gender participation gaps in both primary and secondary schooling. Efforts to analyse and address gender equality in TVET are relevant to other aspects of equity and dimensions of inclusion/exclusion. In almost all parts of the world, the proportion of girls to total enrolment in secondary education defined as TVET is less than for 'general' secondary education.\n\nIntegrating women or men into areas of specialization in which they were previously under-represented is important to diversifying opportunities for TVET. The National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET in Bangladesh set clear priorities and targets for breaking gender stereotypes. The Strategy developed by a Gender Working Group comprising fifteen representatives from government ministries and departments, employers, workers and civil society organizations. It provided an overview of the current status and nature of gender inequalities in TVET, highlighted the priority areas for action, explored a number of steps to promote equal participation of women in TVET, and outlined the way forward.\n\nIn Cambodia, TVET programmes set out to empower young women in traditional trades by upgrading their skills and technology in silk weaving. This led to the revitalization and reappraisal of a traditional craft by learners and society.\n\nThe Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET made the following recommendations on expanding access and improving quality and equity, including to: \n\n\"Improve gender equality by promoting equal access of females and males to TVET programmes, particularly in fields where there is strong labour market demand, and by ensuring that TVET curricula and materials avoid stereotyping by gender.\"\n"}
