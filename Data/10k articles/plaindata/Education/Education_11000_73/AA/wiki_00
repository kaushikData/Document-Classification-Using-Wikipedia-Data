In the States Berlin, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the reduction took place from seven to six years because, there, primary education goes until grade 6. The principal argument for the reduction are the comparatively long times for vocational education in Germany.\n\nIn Saxony and Thuringia it is, however, already a long established norm to take the after twelve years.\n\nSome German federal states already reverse the reform even though sound academic insights on reform effects are scarce.\n\nIn part, parents’, teachers’ and students’ organizations express criticism, exclusively from the Western States of Germany. In spite of the removal of one school year, all contents of the, now thirteen, school years are arranged. This means that the school timetable is enlarged and that the students have to be at school between 32 and 40 periods a week. Altogether with the homework given and exam preparations a school week is calculated to include an estimate of 45 up to 55 periods.\n\nHowever, there is little empirical evidence on the effect of this compression of instructional hours into fewer years of schooling on student outcomes.\n\n"}

He is currently member of the Executive Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the chairman of the Council of the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He was Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) from 1996 to 2002 and Secretary for Education and Manpower from 2002 to 2007. Li’s dictatorial and ruthless leadership style led some to refer to him as \"King Arthur\" and even \"the Tsar\". He is the grandson of the co-founder of the Bank of East Asia, Li Koon-chun, and brother of its current chairman, David Li.\n\nLi was born into the prominent Li family. His grandfather, Li Koon-chun, was the founder of the Bank of East Asia. His father, Li Fook-shu, was the unofficial member of the Executive Council and Legislative Council. His brother, David Li Kwok-po, succeeded his father to become the chairman of the Bank of East Asia and member of the Legislative Council.\n\nAn alumnus of St. Paul's Co-educational College and a classmate of Professor Lawrence J. Lau, Li received his medical training at the University of Cambridge. He was subsequently trained at Middlesex Hospital Medical School and Harvard Medical School, before returning to Hong Kong to become the founding chairman of the Department of Surgery and Dean of Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \n\nLi's tenure as Secretary for Education and Manpower was marked by an era of education reforms that included the School-Based Management Policy. Since 2000, the Education and Manpower Bureau has implemented a number of mandates, including having teachers spend more time with students outside the classroom, adding exams for subjects such as English and history, and ordering that teachers take benchmark assessments to prove their language abilities. Li ostensibly retired from public service in 2007.\n\nIn the role, he caused controversy by proposing mergers first between Chinese University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and later between Chinese University and the Hong Kong Institute of Education.\n\nLi's appointment by CY Leung to the governing board of the University of Hong Kong in 2015 has been met with strong criticism, particularly from academic staff (mostly pro-democrats): a poll has shown most to have little to no confidence that Li will uphold academic freedom. Further, Li's general attitude towards staff has been said to be 'hostile' and 'critical'.\n\nSix months later, when it became known that Li was likely to take over the chairmanship of the Council upon the expiry of the term of Edward Leong on 6 November, there was further strong opposition, with 87 percent of members of HKU Academic Staff Association and almost three-quarters of members of the Professional Teachers Union opposed, due to his stance during the University of Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellor selection controversy.\n\nHis leadership style has seen him being referred to as \"King Arthur\" or even \"the Tsar\".\n\nHe was married to Diana Chester, a registered nurse and graduate of New Hall College, Cambridge University who died in 2013. He has two sons.\n\nBefore his appointment, Li was Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), as well as:\n\n\n"}

Because the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was consecrated on September 13, 335, the Encaenia started on September 13, while the cross itself was brought outside the church on September 14 so that the clergy and faithful could pray before the True Cross (Feast of the Cross).\n\nAt certain universities, Encaenia is an annual ceremony typically involving the presentation of honorary degrees to distinguished alumni and to distinguished personages from the worlds of arts and sciences. In most British universities, it corresponds to part of Graduation.\n\nThe most famous Encaenia is the ceremony at the University of Oxford, which usually takes place on the Wednesday of the ninth week of Trinity Term (i.e. a Wednesday in the latter part of June). Preceding the ceremony is a procession of some of the participants to the Sheldonian Theatre, inside which the main event takes place.

She was the second of three daughters to Roy and Sylvia. She began dancing from the age of three. However, she contracted polio at the age of 8, which left her hospital in an iron frame for 18 months. Remarkably, she was back dancing again by the time she was 12, attending the school of Paul Hammond, formerly a leading soloist with the Borovansky Ballet.\n\nTwo years later, however, she had another setback when she suffered serious injury - a fractured skull and jaw - following a collision between a cement lorry and her father's car; she was left in a coma for three days. She had been due to take her Royal Academy of Dance exam. Incredibly, she recovered and passed her exam with \"commendation\".\n\nIn 1962, at the age of 16, Stock was awarded a Royal Academy of Dance scholarship to London's Royal Ballet School, but at the same time, Dame Peggy van Praagh had just founded The Australian Ballet and she decided to offer Gailene a job and so she deferred her London jaunt to the following year. After a year in London, she was offered a position with The Royal Ballet. She decided, however, to return to The Australian Ballet, where she spent 7 years, rising to principal dancer under director Robert Helpmann.\n\nWhen The Australian Ballet embarked on its first European tour in 1965, Stock was part of the company, and toured on subsequent tours, including one to the United States, during which many dancers sustained injuries. On that tour, Stock recalled, she did 69 performances in 69 days.\n\nShe later went on to dance for three years in Canada as principal ballerina with the National Ballet of Canada and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. She was pursued to North America by an Australian colleague, Gary Norman, whom she married. The pair returned to Australian Ballet and resumed their dancing careers. After having their daughter in 1978 she moved into teaching and management. Stock then was named director of the National Ballet School, Victoria, and took on other administrative positions before being made director of the Australian Ballet School from 1990-98. In 1999 she was head-hunted to take over from Dame Merle Park as Director of the Royal Ballet School. She accepted the post with the proviso that her husband taught the boys at the school.\n\nGailene Stock moved to The Royal Ballet School in 1999, with her family. She immediately set to work changing the curriculum in order to make the student dancers more employment-ready upon graduation. When she joined, employment rates were around 48% and steadily rose to over 98% during her tenure.\n\nShe opened the doors to students from all over the world, which angered many of the establishment within the English ballet. Over her 15 years, she oversaw the splendid refurbishments of the school's junior and senior sections, achieving a much-praised move of the Royal Ballet School's senior section from dowdy Chiswick premises to an award-winning conversion next to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, and upgrading the younger section's accommodation in White Lodge, Richmond Park.\n\nShe served twice as the President of the Jury at the Prix de Lausanne (2003 and 2011) and also as a Jury Member for the Young America Grand Prix.\n\nGailene married fellow Australian and principal dancer Gary Norman while they were touring North America in 1977. Their daughter Lisa was born in 1978.\n\nIn 1997, she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for services to ballet. In the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 5 June 2013 Stock was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). The insignia was brought to her hospital bed, where she was being treated for cancer.\n\nIn 1998, Stock became the first Australian representative on the Executive and Artistic Committees of the Royal Academy of Dance, London. In 2013, she received the Governors of The Royal Ballet Gold Medal.\n\nIn 2013 Stock was diagnosed with a brain tumour and took leave from The Royal Ballet to receive treatment. She died a year later on 29 April 2014, aged 68.\n\nUpon hearing of her death, David McAllister, artistic director of the Australian Ballet, paid tribute to her. \"She was a passionate, intelligent and dynamic dancer whose career saw her dance across the globe. Rising from one of the youngest dancers in the company to the rank of ballerina, she danced in all the major classical repertoire (and was) a part of the many important new creations during her time with the company.\"\n\nMcAllister added, \"Her success continued after leaving the stage, as a teacher of note and an innovative ballet school director, notably at both the Australian Ballet School and more recently the Royal Ballet School. Her legacy lives on in the thousands of dancers whose careers she touched and nurtured during these prestigious positions.\"\n\n"}

She served as the academy's director for around two decades after the its establishment.\n\nGilbert was born as Irene Liebert or Liebeschutz in Brandenburg, Germany on August 25, 1934. She immigrated to New York City with her parents, Gaston and Lucie Liebert (or Liebeschutz), just before the outbreak of World War II. Her parents were killed by a drunk driver when she was just five years old. She was raised by her aunt and her four older brothers.\n\nShe changed her surname to Gilbert when she began her acting career, reportedly because she felt that it eemed \"movie-star-esque.\" Her acting career extended into the late 1980s. Her television credits included roles in \"Cannon\", \"Barnaby Jones\", and \"Emergency!\" in the 1970s.\n\nGilbert became friends with New York City-based acting coach Stella Adler during the 1960s. In 1985, Gilbert and actress Joanne Linville pursued Adler to open a branch of the Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles.\n\nGilbert also served as the school's director for 20 years. A fire at the school, which was originally located in a small theater at Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle Avenue, forced the school's temporary closure in 1991. The school's building was further threatened with demolition to make way for a proposed subway line at the time of Adler's death, in 1992.\n\nGilbert moved and reopened the school in 1994 at a building which was once the Embassy Club, a private club in the 1930s at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. She continued to teach acting at the school and produce stage productions. The Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles named one of its theaters, the Irene Gilbert Theatre, in honor of her.\n\nMarried once, to Ronald Packenham Law, Irene Gilbert died, aged 76, from complications of Alzheimer's disease, at the home of her son, Randall Garrett Herzon, in Eureka, California.\n"}

{"id": "578090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=578090", "title": "King Saud University", "text": "King Saud University\n\nKing Saud University (KSU, ) is a public university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, founded in 1957 by King Saud bin Abdulaziz as Riyadh University, as the first university in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The university was created to meet the shortage of skilled workers in Saudi Arabia. It was renamed King Saud University in 1982.\n\nThe student body of KSU today consists of 40,000 male and female students, 7% of which are international. The female students have their own disciplinary panel, and there is a center supervising the progress of female students, either personally by female faculty members or by male faculty members via a closed television network. The university offers courses in the natural sciences, the humanities, and professional studies, and many courses are tuition-free. The medium of instruction in undergraduate programs is English and Arabic depending on the chosen major. Among Arab universities, its medical programs are highly regarded.\n\nEstablishing Saudi Arabia's first university was a response to the educational and professional needs of a young nation. King Abdulaziz became king in 1932, and began laying the foundations for modernizing his country and establishing an educational system. In 1953 King Saud, the eldest son of Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne upon his father's death, and instituted the Council of Ministers and the Ministry Education.\n\nPrince Fahd, who eventually became the Saudi King, was the first minister of education. Following the first session of the Council of Ministers, he announced that the first Saudi University would be established as a house of culture and sciences. Prince Fahd said that he was committed to promoting higher education.\n\nIn 1957, according to the dictates of the Royal Decree No. 17, Prince Fahd announced the founding of King Saud University, established in order to, \"Disseminate and promote knowledge in Our Kingdom for widening the base of scientific and literary study, and for keeping abreast with other nations in the arts and sciences and for contributing with them discovery and invention, in addition to reviving Islamic civilization and articulate its benefits and glories, along with its ambitions to nurture the young virtuously and to guarantee their healthy minds and ethics.\"\n\nStudents began studying at the College of Arts in the 1957-58 academic year. Since then KSU developed further according to the needs of the nation.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1960 the College of Sciences, the College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy were established.\n\nRoyal Decree no. 112 of 1961 recognized that King Saud University was an independent legal entity, with a budget of its own, responsible for higher education, promoting scholarly research, and advancement of sciences and arts in the country. Naming the Minister of Education as the President of the university, the Statute ordered that the University have a Vice President and Secretary General, and that each college and institute have a Dean, Vice Dean, and a council.\n\nIn 1965 the College of Agriculture was established and KSU assumed control over the Colleges of Engineering and Education, formerly under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with UNESCO.\n\nRoyal Decree no M/11 of 1967 enforced the Statute of the University of Riyadh (currently King Saud University), rescinding all earlier statutes, bylaws, and regulations. Of the main landmarks of the new Statute is the creation of the Higher Council of the University as one of its administrative powers. The membership of the new council includes two active or inactive university Presidents, two faculty members who had assumed such positions outside the country, or two native leading intellectuals.\n\nThe Higher Council of the University is the dominant power over the university affairs: it draws out policies, issues decisions to implement and achieve the objectives of the university (especially those pertaining to the creation of new colleges and departments), proposes budgets, and systems of faculty salaries, annuities, and financial awards.\n\nRoyal Decree no M/6 of 1972 superseded the Statute of 1967. With the new Statute, the membership of the Higher Council of the University includes five active or inactive university Presidents, or native leading intellectuals. To the council are also added the University Secretary General and two other non-university members. Again, the Statute dictates the creation of an Academic Council overlooking scholarly research and studies. The Higher Council of the University issues the bylaws governing the number of the Academic Council's members, responsibilities, and powers.\n\nThese decrees were issued in response to the growing and widening needs of the university as the establishment of new colleges started. Between 1958 and 1960, three colleges were established: the College of Sciences, College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy. In 1961/1962 women were first admitted into the College of Arts and the College of Public Administration.\n\nFive years later the College of Agriculture was established. In the same year the College of Engineering and College of Education, having been under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the UNESCO, were annexed to the University. A year later (1969/1970) the College of Medicine opened. In 1974/1975 the Arabic Language Institute was inaugurated to serve non-Arabic speakers. At this time deanships of Admission and Registration, Students Affairs, Libraries were also established. Again, a year later (1976) the College of Dentistry and the College of Applied Medical Sciences were added to the Riyadh campus, while launching at the same time the Abha-based campus with the College of Education. In 1977, the Graduate College assumed its office in supervising and organizing all graduate programs in the various departments of the University.\n\nAt Abha, the College of Medicine was established according to Royal Order no. 3/M/380 of 1979 and was added to the University according to Royal Directive no. 15128 of 29 June 1400H. Formal study there started in the academic year of 1980/1981.\n\nIn 1980 another branch of the University opened at Qassim with three colleges: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, and Economics and Administration. Formal study started in 1980/1981 academic year.\n\nIn 1981, celebrating its 25th anniversary, the University of Riyadh went back to its original name of King Saud University at the orders of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz. In that year, too, the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education replaced the Center for Community Service, and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) was formally opened.\n\nTwo years later (1983) two other colleges were created: the College of Computer and Information Science Sciences and the College of Architecture and Planning. Later, in 1990, the Institute of Languages and Translation was established to be turned four years later into the full-fledged College of Languages and Translation.\n\nIn 1993, the Royal ratification of the System of the Council of Higher Education and Universities was issued dictating that each university form its own Council which attends to its academic, administrative, and financial affairs, and carries out its general policy.\n\nIn 1996, the Council of Higher Education issued its decision no. 1282/A approving the creation of the Center for Consulting and Research which was renamed King Abdullah Center for Consulting and Research.\n\nIn 1997, Royal Decree no. 33 dictated the creation of a King Saud University Community College in Jazan, as well as the establishment of the College of Sciences at the Qassim campus.\n\nIn 1998, Royal Order no. 7/78/M of 11 March 1419 decreed that King Khalid University be created in the south. The branches of Imam University and of King Saud University consequently formed the new university. In the same year, after the issuance of the unified regulations for Graduate Studies at Saudi universities, the Graduate College became the Deanship of Graduate Studies, and the Deanship of Academic Research was established in accordance with the dictates of the System of Academic Research issued that year.\n\nIn 2000, the College of Medicine was established at the Qassim campus, and the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education was turned into the College of Applied Studies and Community Service.\n\nIn 2001, the Community College in Riyadh was inaugurated according to the Cabinet Council no. 73. During the academic year of 2002/2003 the College of Science at Al-Jouf was established. That same year the College of Engineering was opened at the Qassim campus, and the creation of community colleges at Al-Majma’ah, Al-Aflaj, and Al-Qurayat was approved.\n\nBeginning with the academic year 2003/2004 the Qassim campus became an independent university. On 2003, the Council of Higher Education approved the promotion of the Department of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences, into the College of Nursing.\n\nThe following individuals have served as the rectors of the university since its inception:\n\nThe school's current main campus was designed by HOK Architects, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Mechanical and Electrical systems were designed by Syska Hennessy Group, Inc. New York City, New York. The facility was constructed in the 1980s by Blount International, a construction firm led by Winton M. Blount headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama, after the firm was awarded the world's then-largest fixed-price contract in history for the sum of approximately $5 billion.\n\nKing Saud University has a total of eighteen libraries, making up the main nerve of the academic and learning disciplines of the university. At the time of its transition into its current location, the university added the collections of nine of its libraries to the main library, thereby forming the central library. Later renamed King Salman Central library, it now enjoys seven branch libraries.\nIdeally housed in its seven floor building, with an area of 51400 square meters and more than 4000 reading seats, the central library occupies a central location among colleges and facilities, providing students, faculties, employees and other members of the community easy access to its location and holdings. Its collections include books, periodicals, manuscripts, government publications, academic theses, dissertations, press clippings, audio-visual and electronic media. \nThe Libraries Deanship launched this site to help Internet surfers and interested individuals gain access to catalogs, holding locations, galleries, and electronic databases, along with other different facilities.\n\nThe first university Hospital was King Abdulaziz University Hospital which was founded in 1956 but only got affiliated to the college in 1976.\nThis facility now specializes in ENT and ophthalmology. These two departments are among the largest in the Middle East in these specialties. They host skilled physicians in all subspecialties of ENT and ophthalmology as well as world class researchers. In addition, it contains some general medical and pediatric services as well as the university diabetes center. All care is free of charge for all King Saud University staff and students. The hospital provides primary and secondary care services for Saudi patients from Northern Riyadh area. It also provides tertiary care services to all Saudi citizens on referral basis.\n\nIn 1982, a dedicated university hospital was opened and was named King Khalid University Hospital. This facility is an 850-bed facility with all general and subspecialty medical services. It contains a special outpatient building, more than 20 operating rooms, and a fully equipped and staffed laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy services in addition to all other supporting services.\nThe hospital provides primary and secondary care services for Saudi patients from Northern Riyadh area. It also provides tertiary care services to all Saudi citizens on referral bases. All care is free of charge for all King Saud University staff and students.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Basil Al Bayati won the 1st prize in the King Saud Competition to build the main mosque for the university. His design incorporated extensively the motif of the palm trunk, as used in the very first Mosque of the Prophet in Medina. It was highly praised and was even claimed to \"mark the beginning of a new era, a new revival in Islamic architecture.\"\nThe interior calligraphy above the doors and in the mihrab was done by Ghani Alani, the last of the Baghdad School of Calligraphy. He was a student of Hashem al-Khattat. Ghani Alani taught Dr. Bayati whilst at the College of Engineering in Baghdad. The building was also nominated for the 1992 Aga Khan Award for Architecture.\n\nAs well as designing the mosque, Dr. Basil Al Bayati also designed the entrance gates to the university which are based upon the theme of faith and knowledge; two pillars of Islam that must be taken together, \"Knowledge cannot do without faith nor can faith ignore knowledge for Islam calls always for faith and knowledge to run in parallel.\" \"The design consists of two books representing knowledge and faith. They have been so placed so that their pages are interlocked thus showing the close connection between faith and knowledge. Verses from the Quran on faith and knowledge are written in script on the cover of each book.\"\n\n\nThe university offers a broad range of undergraduate courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, the humanities and professional studies. Tuition is completely free and generous scholarships are available for Saudi and international students. The medium of instruction in undergraduate programs is English and Arabic. Applicants are required to pass an Arabic examination if they are from a non-Arabic speaking country. English language support at all levels is provided by the Languages Unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia witnesses exceptional progress in many fields such as health and science. The King Saud University College of Medicine was established in 1967 during the reign of King Faisal. Actual studies began in 1969. The choice of members for the Teaching Board and the supervision of exams until 1978 were done cooperatively between the faculty and the University of London. In 1974/1975, the College opened a special department for female students and incorporated the Ministry of Health's Prince ts name was changed to King Abdulaziz University Hospital to be utilized for training male and female students in the clinical stage. At the 25th anniversary of inauguration of King Saud University 1981, the building of College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital were inaugurated for teaching and health services. The College has also made agreements with different universities in America, Canada and U.K. to support this Academic Board in the College and to train graduate Saudi doctors, as well as to provide preparation for their higher studies and specialization in different medical disciplines.\n\nThe College of Science was established in 1958, one year after the founding of King Saud University. In the beginning, the College had few students and a small number of lectures halls and laboratories. In keeping with the growth of the university at large, the College has witnessed considerable progress in many respects. The number of departments has increased, laboratories have improved, and the College now attracts a large number of students.As of today, the following bachelor's degrees are offered in the college of science:\nStatistics,\nOperations Research,\nGeology,\nGeophysics,\nChemistry,\nBiochemistry,\nZoology,\nBotany,\nMicrobiology,\nMathematics,\nFinancial Mathematics,\nPhysics.\n\nThe College of Engineering was established as a joint project between the Ministry of Education of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and UNESCO in November 1962. This project lasted until 1969 when the College of Engineering became an official part of King Saud University.\n\nThe college started with three departments: the department of civil engineering (CE), the department of electrical engineering (EE), and the department of mechanical engineering (ME). In 1968, the department of architecture was established and it became a college in 1984 under the name the College of Architecture and Planning.\n\nIn 1974 two departments were established: the department of chemical engineering (CHE) and the department of petroleum engineering (PGE). In 1988 surveying engineering (SE) was also established as a program in the department of civil engineering(CE). In 1982, the program of industrial engineering was established in the department of mechanical engineering. Later on the program became the department of industrial engineering (IE) in 2002. In sum, there are now seven departments offering the Bachelor of Science Degree in the following fields;\n\n\nThe number of students of the college has risen from 17 in 1962 to more than 4000 students in 2005. The Faculty members have similarly grown in number from 4 to 210 (including lecturers and teaching assistants) within the same time span.\n\nCollege of Architecture and Planning\n\nThe College of Architecture and Planning has been initially started as a department in the College of Engineering in 1968. It was extended as a college in 1984 which included the other department \"Urban Planning\".\n\nThe university also offers foreign students the opportunity to enroll through the Vice Rectorate for Knowledge Exchange and Technology Transfer in the fields of engineering, sciences, medicine, and arts.\n\nThe university offers science and health major students 990 SR/month (264 $), and humanities students 840 SR/month (224 $), a 75% discount on foreign books, and fully furnished residences at the university housing/hostels complex, food within the university restaurant, free medical treatment, and full return tickets to their home country.\n\nIn 2014, a student who suffered from a heart attack died on campus. The Saudi news outlet \"Okaz\" claimed that the campus' male ER staff was not allowed for more than an hour to enter the women-only campus where the patient was waiting, which subsequently caused her death, a story that created an outrage on campus and on social networks. Badran Al-Omar, the rector of the university, stated the opposite, assuring that the paramedics were allowed in the premises as soon as they arrived on site, and that the patient was treated with the best of care. However, the campus' paramedics failed to revive her and called for help from a local hospital who brought her to a care center nearby, stretching the total time of intervention to almost 2 hours.\n\n\nThe Riyadh Techno Valley, is one of the contributions of King Saud University in building partnership with the public and private sectors in the area of knowledge economics. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adopted a long term economic strategy that shifts its focus to develop a knowledge-based economy. King Saud University (KSU) is seeking to play a full part in this strategy through the development of a substantial science park, \"Riyadh Techno Valley - King Saud University (RTV- KSU)\", on its Riyadh campus. Through this project, KSU aims to satisfy the demands of the knowledge-based industries, and to commercialize its research outcomes, in addition to enhancing the research environment and encouraging researchers and graduates to participate in the incubation program and to establish spin-off knowledge-based companies.\nThe university is currently focusing its research on polymers, catalytic and bio technology pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1960, NACA links the higher education and entertainment communities in a business and learning partnership, creating educational and business opportunities for our student and professional members.\n\nThe National Association for Campus Activities (NACA) is a non-profit organization that hosts events which showcase musical artists, comedians, stage shows, and a variety of other acts. It is a member-based organization that works as the main connection between higher education institutions (called school members) and the entertainment community (called associate members). Through its regional conferences and National Convention, members of NACA have the opportunity to showcase their acts and meet with schools that are interested in having acts perform on their campus.\n\nNACA was founded in 1960. In 2010, it celebrated its 50th Anniversary at its annual National Convention.\n\nEach year there are seven regional conferences and one National Convention, as well as various workshops and Webinars.\n\nThe National Convention is hosted each February. The four-day event provides networking opportunities with other campus activities professionals, students and the entertainment community. About 3,000 people attend the Convention each year, with hundreds of colleges and universities attending from around the United States. NACA’s National Convention is the nation's largest campus activities marketplace.\n\nThe Convention hosts more than 80 live performances ranging from music and comedy to lecture and interactive programs. Another aspect of the NACA conferences are the Educational Sessions with topics ranging from motivation, to leadership or even self beneficial workshops. These sessions focus on professional and student leadership development, programming, multicultural education, campus organization dynamics and advising, and identification of current trends in the field of campus activities. \n\nNACA’s Campus Activities Marketplace (CAMP) puts campus programmers in direct contact with the agents and/or artists.

The Ohio River Greenway Trail is a proposed route that would interconnect existing trails in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. The proposal is spearheaded by the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC), a volunteer-led, non-profit organization. The ORTC is an Internal Revenue Service registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization which relies on corporate, foundation, government, and private grants and donations to achieve its stated mission of creating a multi-use trail along the Ohio River and its tributaries. The Council is headquartered in Monaca, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Ohio River Trail Project was conceptualized on January 2, 2009, in coordination with Beaver County Planning Commission's Shared Greenways & Environmental Planner Doniele Andrus; the Borough of Monaca Manager Mario Leone Jr; and Dr. Vincent Troia.\n\nOn May 26, 2009, the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) was incorporated by Dr. Vincent Troia and Mario Leone, for the purpose of establishing a multi-use trail along the Ohio River to promote the growth in River & Trail towns of recreation, health, wellness, transportation, cultural and historical amenities, education, charity, the protection and conservation of natural resources and to stimulate the local economies.\n\nThe Trail and its proposed connections were conceived by Dr. Vincent Troia.\n\nThe Ohio River Trail Council began as a grass-roots effort to support a progressing state and national movement to develop greenways, especially since 1987 when President Reagan's Commission on \"American Outdoors\" recommended establishing a national greenways network. Pennsylvania's statewide greenways program was established by Governor Tom Ridge in 2001 to promote and support the greenway efforts occurring in all sixty-seven counties.\n\nThe trail is proposed to run from the Point of Beginning (mile marker zero) at the OH-PA-WV state line near the Little Beaver Creek Greenway Trail, a segment of the Great Ohio Lake-to-River Greenway, to the Beaver River Trail, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Trail via the Montour Trail in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, the Three Rivers Heritage Trail in Pittsburgh and the Great Allegheny Passage. The proposed ORT is a critical and missing link to nationally significant trail linkages in the tri-state area and is intended to become an important segment in a \"mega-trail\" from the Great Lakes region, through to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn addition to the Tri-state Greenway, the ORTC also supports that the Ohio River Trail serve as part of the U.S. Bicycle Route System Route 50 and the Adventure Cycling Association Underground Railroad, Pittsburgh spur. The Ohio River Trail corridor is part of the National Park Service Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area.\n\nThe Ohio River Trail is intended to improve the quality of life of its users by providing fitness and recreation opportunities. In addition, the ORT can serve as an alternative transportation corridor between communities, as well as reducing vehicle congestion and pollution. Plans also exist to enable the disabled to comfortably make use of the trail. The project includes the reallocation of abandoned rail corridors, bridges, interurban or trolley lines, and canal towpaths as public multi-use trails. An emphasis exists on showcasing and preserving historical and cultural sites along the trail, alongside the establishment of an Ohio River Trail Museum and endorsement of the revitalization of the surrounding area.\n\nThe Trail is composed of thirty-one (31) Western Pennsylvania communities.\n\nThere are twelve (12) Ohio River North Shore communities: Glasgow, Ohioville, Midland, Industry, Vanport Township, Beaver, Bridgewater, Fallston, New Brighton, Rochester, and Rochester Township.\n\nIn addition, the Ohio River North Shore Extension includes the eight (8) communities of Ambridge, Baden, Edgeworth, Freedom, Glen Osborne, Harmony Township, Leetsdale, and Sewickley. The Bradys Run Extension adds Patterson Township and Brighton Township.\n\nThere are also ten (10) Ohio River South Shore communities: Monaca, Center Township, Aliquippa, Hopewell Township, South Heights, Crescent Township, Moon Township, Coraopolis, and Montour Junction. Neville Township is the tenth community with the extension over the Neville Island Bridge.\n\nThe Ohio River Trail Council has also proposed and developed the Ohio River Water Trail. The Ohio River Water Trail consists of canoe, kayak and rowing access to the Ohio River and its tributaries. Presently the Little Beaver Creek has access at Lock 57 Park in Ohioville, the Ohio River has access at Monaca, and the Beaver River has access at Bridgewater & Rochester's Riverfront Park. The ORTC supports the design, construction and the installation of a kayak and canoe launch site in these areas with amenities including signage and a canoe/kayak storage rack.\n\nThe project is expected to bring economic boons to Western Pennsylvania through the growth of the construction and maintenance industries, in addition to tourism-related opportunities such as rafting tours, bicycle sales and rentals, restaurants, and lodging.\n\nThe campaign to build the rail trail that will eventually link Lake Erie with Washington, D.C. via Beaver County, has progressed to the point that the organizers, Vincent Troia and Mario Leone, are prepared to display their work. In an interview with Beaver County Times journalist Michael Pound, regarding the status of the Ohio River Trail Project, the pair stated they have successfully solicited resolutions of support from the Beaver County communities, through which the South Shore Trail would pass, and that they will soon have similar resolutions from the Allegheny County communities.\n\nThe cost of the South Shore feasibility study is estimated at $50,000. Leone and Troia stated that the not-for-profit organization has already put together sufficient money for the match required for a grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The feasibility study has been awarded to Stromberg, Garrigan & Associates, and it is estimated to require six to ten months to complete.\n\nOn January 6, 2010, the Ohio River Trail South Shore feasibility study began with a project steering committee meeting. The feasibility study for the south shore is expected to be completed in the spring of 2011 at a projected cost of $50,000.\n\nOn June 12, 2010, the \"Plant a Wish\" project took place at the Point of Beginning. The project was intended to raise awareness of the Ohio River Trail effort, with participants from Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia writing down their wishes on pieces of paper, which were then buried beneath the site of a newly planted tree. It is hoped that the Point of Beginning will also host the beginning of a bike trail that would run up the Ohio River and conclude at Montour Creek.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the Council was awarded a $10,000 grant by the Port of Pittsburgh Commission on the understanding that it will be used to develop blueways and build bike and canoe racks at points in Rochester, Monaca, Bridgewater, and Ohioville.\n\nThe cost of the North Shore feasibility study is estimated at $56,000. On October 14, 2010 the Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources (DCNR) awarded the Ohio River Trail a $29,000 grant for the North Shore Feasibility Study. The North Shore Feasibility Study began in January 2011. \nOn October 15, 2010 the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) and its partner the Borough of Monaca, PA along with three of its partner municipalities, Aliquippa, Coraopolis and Midland has received a grant for a $150,000 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Brownfields Area-Wide Planning Program Grant and Assistance to advance our ongoing regional brownfields revitalization. These municipalities have joined to undertake a grass-roots effort to re-think the future of our communities as a way to overcome the loss of a major portion of our manufacturing base and the post-industrial brownfields legacy that remains from that loss.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, the National Park Service (NPS) Rivers, Trails, and Conservation (RTCA) Program approved an application for a technical assistance grant for the Ohio River Trail Council. Over the next year, the NPS Rivers & Trails staff will assist the ORTC with the completion of a Feasibility Study and to expand public involvement in the project. Efforts are underway to communicate and collaborate with other trail groups, and to establish a Tri-State Trail Alliance in order to increase visibility and success of each smaller trail component of a greater linking trail system. The National Park Service is proud to support such a capable partner and eager to help contribute to the ORT Initiative. Through the RTCA Program, the NPS helps communities and neighborhoods improve their important local resources, protect river resources, develop new trails and greenways and create and manage open space. \n\n\"In September of 2010, a planning grant was awarded to the Friends of the Riverfront to begin an effort to connect the Three Rivers\nHeritage Trail from the City of Pittsburgh to Coraopolis. This eight mile segment will traverse through the City of Pittsburgh, McKees\nRocks, Stowe Township, Moon Township, Neville Township and Coraopolis. This effort will compliment the work of the Ohio River Trail Council and Lawrence and Beaver Counties, which have completed trail feasibility work outside of Allegheny County. Once feasibility work from the City of Pittsburgh to Coraopolis is complete, we will have a good understanding of the opportunity for trail development along the Ohio River all the way to Ohio. In Ohio, groups are working to connect to our trail here in Pennsylvania. You will see a lot more activity along the Ohio River in 2011.\" \n\nThe South Shore Feasibility Study which began on Jan 6, 2010 was completed in March 2011. The resultant Ohio River South Shore Trail is approximately 15.6 miles from Monaca to the beginning of the Montour Trail.\n\nIn 2011, the first year of assistance from the NPS, the RTCA assisted with the development of the Ohio River Water Trail and the Ohio River Land Trail feasibility studies. In addition, the RTCA supported the ORTC in a multi-state effort, which included eighteen counties in three states to link a system of trails in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. On March 29, 2011 a Tri-state Trail Alliance meeting of 80 trail advocates and on October 13, 2011 a regional trails meeting hosted by the Power of 32 occurred to support the vision of linking a system of trails in the tri-state area.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, the National Park Service (NPS) Rivers, Trails, and Conservation (RTCA) Program awarded a second year of technical assistance to the Ohio River Trail Council. In 2012, the NPS Rivers & Trails staff will focus on identifying an on-the-ground section of the Ohio River Land/Water Trail to develop and continue the oversight for the Tri-State Trail Initiative.\n\nOn April 6, 2011 the ORTC received a second grant from the Port of Pittsburgh Commission to establish a small watercraft launch in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn October 26, 2011 the National Park Service approved the Ohio River Trail Council's application for a second year of technical assistance from the Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program. In the first year of assistance, RTCA assisted the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) with the development of the Ohio River Water Trail and the Ohio River Land Trail Feasibility Studies. In addition, the RTCA helped coordinate the March 29, 2011 Tri-state Trail Alliance meeting of about 80 trail advocates, and the October 13, 2011 regional trails meeting hosted by the Power of 32, to support the vision of linking a system of trails in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In 2012, the NPS Rivers & Trails staff will focus on identifying an on-the-ground section of the Ohio River Land/Water Trail to develop, and continue the oversight for the Tri-State Trail Initiative, a multi-state effort which includes eighteen counties in three states. The Pennsylvania counties include Beaver, Crawford, Erie, Greene, Lawrence, Mercer and Washington. The Ohio Counties include Ashtabula, Belmont, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Monroe and Trumbull. The West Virginia counties include Brooke, Hancock, Marshall and Ohio.\n\nOn December 5, 2011 the Ohio River Trail Council, Beaver County Planning Commission and Midland hosted a public hearing regarding the feasibility study of a bicycle and pedestrian trail along the north side of the Ohio River. The proposed trail would connect with the planned Ohio River South Shore Trail at the Monaca-Rochester Bridge and continue to the Ohio-West Virginia state line.\n\n\n"}

The term refers generally to activities that either enhance learning opportunities within formal education systems or broaden learning opportunities beyond formal education systems. Open learning involves but is not limited to: classroom teaching methods, approaches to interactive learning, formats in work-related education and training, the cultures and ecologies of learning communities, and the development and use of open educational resources. While there is no agreed-upon, comprehensive definition of open learning, central focus is commonly placed on the \"needs of the learner as perceived by the learner.\" Case studies illustrate open learning as an innovation both within and across academic disciplines, professions, social sectors and national boundaries, and in business and industry, higher education institutions, collaborative initiatives between institutions, and schooling for young learners.\n\nOpen learning as a teaching method is founded on the work of Célestin Freinet in France and Maria Montessori in Italy, among others.\nOpen learning is supposed to allow pupils self-determined, independent and interest-guided learning. A prominent example is the language experience approach to teaching initial literacy (cf. Brügelmann/ Brinkmann 2011).\nMore recent work on open learning has been conducted by the German pedagogues Hans Brügelmann (1975; 1999), Falko Peschel (2002), Jörg Ramseger (1977) and Wulf Wallrabenstein (1991).

Representatives from both casinos accused PennPraxis of being biased against them. It was later reported that PennPraxis hired five experts to devise alternative plans for the casinos, accommodating for reduced on-site parking, a breakdown from a more singular building mass to allow more public access to the river, a 30-percent allotment of the area for open space, use of green roofs and accommodations for mass transit, to conform to PennPraxis' civic vision, parts of which the mayor has since promised to accept.\n\nDesigns by PennPraxis influenced plans for the regeneration of Philadelphia's waterfront announced in 2012.\n\n"}

From the first years of the sixteenth century, one of the major reasonings used to this end by the most eminent humanists (François Rabelais, Girolamo Cardano, Jean Bodin, Louis LeRoy, Tommaso Campanella, Francis Bacon, etc.) was that of the \"Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times\" – the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass – which together allowed the Moderns to communicate, exert power, and travel at distances never imagined by the Ancients. When the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns later arose in France, the \"Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times\" would almost invariably be adduced as evidence of the Moderns' superiority.\n\nThe debate became known as 'a quarrel' after the frequently made pun on Charles Perrault's title \"Parallel of the Ancients and the Moderns\", the French word 'querelle' being substituted for 'parallele'.\n\nOn one side of the debate were the Ancients (\"Anciens\"), led by Boileau. The Ancients supported the merits of the ancient authors, and contended that a writer could do no better than imitate them. On the other side were the Moderns (\"Modernes\"), who opened fire first with Perrault's \"Le siècle de Louis le Grand\" (\"The Century of Louis the Great,\" 1687), in which he supported the merits of the authors of the century of Louis XIV and expressed the Moderns' stance in a nutshell:\n\nLearned Antiquity, through all its extent, Was never enlightened to equal our times.\nFontenelle quickly followed with his \"Digression sur les anciens et les modernes\" (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.\n\nIn the opening years of the next century, Marivaux was to show himself a Modern by establishing a new genre of theatre, unknown to the Ancients, the sentimental comedy (\"comédie larmoyante\"). In it the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears. By constraining his choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of Antiquity, Jean Racine showed himself one of the Ancients. He also restricted his tragedies by the classical unities, derived by the classicists from Aristotle's \"Poetics\": the unities of place, time, and action (one scene location, 24 hours, and consistent actions respectively).\n\nThe Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns was a cover, often a witty one, for deeper opposed views. The very idea of Progress was under attack on the one side, and Authority on the other. The new antiquarian interests led to critical reassessment of the products of Antiquity that would eventually bring Scripture itself under the magnifying glass of some Moderns. The attack on authority in literary criticism had analogues in the rise of scientific inquiry, and the Moderns' challenge to authority in literature foreshadowed a later extension of challenging inquiry in systems of politics and religion.\n\nIn the 17th century, Sir William Temple argued against the Modern position in his essay \"On Ancient and Modern Learning\"; therein he repeated the commonplace, originally from Bernard of Chartres, that we see more only because we are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants. Temple's essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were classicist and editor Richard Bentley and critic William Wotton.\n\nThe entire discussion in England was over by 1696, but it was revisited by Jonathan Swift, who saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general orientations or ways of life. He articulated his discussion most notably in his satire \"A Tale of a Tub\", composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704 with the famous prolegomenon \"The Battle of the Books\", long after the initial salvoes were over in France. Swift's polarizing satire provided a framework for other satirists in his circle of the Scriblerians.\n\nTwo other distinguished 18th-century philosophers who wrote at length concerning the distinction between moderns and ancients are Giambattista Vico (cf. e.g. his \"De nostri temporis studiorum ratione\") and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (for whom the moderns see 'more,' but the ancients see 'better').\n\nIn 19th-century England, highlighting the distinction between Hellenism (\"Athens\"/reason or \"sweetness and light\") and Hebraism (\"Jerusalem\"/faith), Matthew Arnold defended the ancients (most notably Plato and Aristotle) against the dominant progressive intellectual trends of his times. Arnold drew attention to the fact that the great divide between ancients and modernists pertained to the understanding of the relation between liberty/reason and authority.\n\nCountering the thrust of much of 20th-century intellectual history and literary criticism, Leo Strauss has contended that the debate between ancients and moderns (or the defenders of either camp) is ill understood when reduced to questions of progress or regress. Strauss himself revived the old \"querelle,\" siding with the ancients (against the modernist position advocated, e.g., by Strauss's friend Alexandre Kojève).\n\n\n\n"}

It comprises three sections, Junior, Senior and Open, each of which is open to all pre-university students studying in Singapore who meet the age requirements for the particular section. The competition is held annually, and the first round of each section is usually held in late May or early June. The second round is usually held in late June or early July.\n\nThe Junior Section consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, each with five options, and 20 open-ended questions, geared towards Lower Secondary students. Topics tested include number theory, calculus, pattern recognition, geometry, simple combinatorics and algebra. Noticeably, trigonometry is not included as a test subject, because trigonometry is not included in the Lower Secondary mathematical curriculum.\nBeginning in 2006, a second round was added, based on the Senior Invitational Round, and consists of a 6-question, 3hour long essay/proof.\n\nThere are two rounds to the Senior Section: a written round (Round 1) and an invitational round (Round 2).\n\nThe exam in Round 1 consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, each with five options, and 20 open-ended questions. The Senior Test is geared towards Upper Secondary students, and topics tested include number theory, combinatorics, geometry, algebra, probability.\n\nThe second round, the Senior Invitational Round consists of a 5-question, 4-hour long paper, with each question of varying difficulty. Only the top scorers of Round 1 are invited to take this test, and helps determine the individual rankings of the test takers.\n\nSimilar to the Senior Section, there are also two rounds, the written round (Round 1) and the invitational round (Round 2).\n\nThe paper in Round 1 comprises 25 open-ended questions, and geared towards pre-university students. Topics tested include number theory, combinatorics, geometry, algebra, probability, but of a higher difficulty level than the Senior Section.\n\nThe Open Invitational Round consists of a 5-question, 4.5-hour long paper, in which only the top scorers of Round 1 are invited to take. This test will help determine the individual rankings of the scorers, and in addition, it acts as a guideline to select Singaporean or Permanent Resident participants for the National Team training team, whereby a further six will then be selected for the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nAs of 2006, in each of the Junior and Senior sections, prizes are awarded to the 30 individuals with the highest total scores in the first and special rounds, as well as to the 20 secondary schools with the highest team scores. The team score is computed by summing the three best scores from students of their school in the first round alone. In the Open section, prizes are similarly awarded to the top 30 individuals, as well as to the 10 institutions (secondary schools and junior colleges with the highest team scores from the first round.\n\nEffective 2012, however, school awards are also awarded based purely on the sum of the 3 highest scorers, including both the first and second round.\n\nThe above prizes take the form of cash awards, certificates displaying the individual's/team's ranking, as well as trophies. Individuals who do not place in the top 30 may also receive gold, silver, bronze, honourable mentions or participation, in decreasing order of merit.\n\n"}

{"id": "24879559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24879559", "title": "Texas Slavery Project", "text": "Texas Slavery Project\n\nThe Texas Slavery Project is a digital history project created by Andrew J. Torget, currently Assistant Professor of History at the University of North Texas. It aims to explore the expansion of slavery between the years 1837 and 1845 in the lands in and around what would eventually become the state of Texas. It has been listed as among \"the best and most important new work\" in the developing digital history medium. The project was presented at the 2007 Nebraska Digital Workshop held by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nThe initial creation of the \"Texas Slavery Project\" arose from the needs of Andrew J. Torget while writing his doctoral dissertation examining the movement of American slaveholders and their slaves into Mexico during the 1820-1840s. Using the collection of tax information Torget assembled during his research, he created a database of population levels which was adapted into a digital MySQL format to allow greater control over the information contained in the database. Using the data from this new database, Torget then used Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) to visualize the spatial relations reflected in the population information which created highly complicated interactive maps. In an interview with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's \"Digital History\" website, Torget claimed that that use of these digital techniques provided for him \"a microscope, of sorts, to look into the data that I already have in ways that, otherwise, I couldn't have done.\"\n\nIn their examination of \"exemplar\" digital history projects in the May 2009 issue of the American Historical Society's \"Perspectives on History\", historians Douglas Seefeldt and William G. Thomas heralded the \"Texas Slavery Project\" for its display of \"how a digital project might extend, deepen, and launch interpretive aspects of a dissertation.\"\n\nAccording to the project's founder and director, Andrew J. Torget, the \"Texas Slavery Project\" endeavors to use digital technologies such as the MySQL database system and GIS mapping tools in order to analyze the spread of American slavery into the borderlands between Mexico and the United States. Through the use of digital maps, a database of historical population levels, and digitized primary source documents, the project examines the role of slavery in the development of the American Southwest.\n\nThe maps contained within the project are, in fact, one decidedly interactive map for the years 1837-1845 which displays slave and slaveholder population statistics of the counties of Texas as well as various layers of data such as U.S. borders, regional rivers, a moveable timeline, and graphs displaying the rate of change in the population data. The information on the map can also be animated to see how the trends change over time. An additional feature graphs the information contained on the map and allows users to control the contents of the graph. The map and graph are in turn linked directly to the information in the database. For example, clicking on the outline of Nacogdoches County with the timeline demarking 1838 reveals the population information pertinent to Nacogdoches in 1838. This information is also provided by clicking on the point of the Nacogdoches county graph indicating 1838. \"As a research and education tool this has the capacity to quickly show historical patterns and correlations that would otherwise have been extremely difficult to identify and illustrate.\"\n\nThe project contains a searchable database of the population information compiled from Texas tax records. It is searchable by County or County Criteria, both of which allow the user to filter the search results as he or she chooses. The database contains information regarding the total slave population, total master population, masters with 1-4 slaves, masters with 5-9 slaves, masters with 10-19 slaves, masters with 20-49 slaves, masters with 50+ slaves, and the average slaveholding. The search results are downloadable in a text format. There are also a variety of graphs and statistics from data in the population database.\n\nThe project contains digitized copies of primary source documents from the 1820s through the 1840s. The documents are organized by the type of document: \"The Laws of Texas\", the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Republic of Texas, the James F. Perry Papers, the \"Telegraph & Texas Register\" of Houston, and the \"Civilian & Galveston Gazette\". The user has the option of browsing the documents or using the search engine.\n\n\n"}

The University offers an American-style liberal arts education to students from various economic, ethnic and religious backgrounds. Since its founding in 2007, the University has been committed to producing knowledgeable and skilled graduates.\n\nThe University opened its doors in 2007 to 45 students from across Iraq. By the end of its second year, the university had 256 enrolled students, 20 of which were in the MBA program. Today, AUIS provides undergraduates with instruction in humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, information technology, business and engineering. The language of instruction at AUIS is exclusively English. Students with low English scores are required to complete the Academic Preparatory Program, where they improve their English language skills and learn critical thinking, before entering the undergraduate programs. \n\nThe American University of Iraq, Sulaimani was founded in 2006 by a Board of Trustees who set out to establish an institution dedicated to offering a comprehensive, American-style education in Iraq. The University, modeled after the famous private universities in Cairo and Beirut, was created amid the turmoils of war but in the relatively secure Kurdish region of Iraq. The purpose of founding such a university, according to Dr. Barham Salih was to stimulate reform in the Iraqi education system. Its location, however, was contested by Arab education officials in Baghdad who argued that the university should be built there and not in a region with historically secessionist ambitions.\n\nIntellectuals such as Kanan Makiya, Fouad Ajami and John Agresto, many of whom supported the 2003 American invasion, supported the establishment of AUIS. John Agresto went on to become the University’s Acting Chancellor for a brief interregnum, after serving as a Coalition Provisional Authority Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Baghdad. Joshua Mitchell, professor of political theory at Georgetown University became Acting Chancellor in 2008 and remained in his position for two years while on leave from Georgetown. From 2010 to 2013, Athanasios Moulakis served as Acting President and he continues to hold the title of President Emeritus of the University. In May 2013, the Board of Trustees chose Dawn Dekle as president. She became the first female president of an Iraqi university when she took up her position at AUIS. She ended her tenure at AUIS in November 2014 due to family circumstances. Esther Mulnix was chosen to serve as interim president after Dekle’s departure.\n\nThe main campus has 169-hectares of land situated on the Sulaimani-Kirkuk Road, close to the University of Sulaymaniyah. Construction of the campus was completed at the start of the academic year in 2011. The campus has several buildings, including an administrative building with a multipurpose auditorium, an academic building, a state-of-the-art science labs, a gym, male and female dormitories, as well as two basketball courts and one soccer field. The AUIS library is located in the academic building while its cafeteria is housed in the administrative building. AUIS is currently located just outside the city limits of Sulaimani. The AUIS academic building opened in October 2011 while its administrative building opened in the spring semester of 2012. Moreover, the new student dorm facilities opened in November 2012.\n\nAUIS was first located in a temporary campus in the heart of Sulaimani. The campus consisted of about 50 temporary classrooms and offices built near a main administrative building, which housed the university's cafeteria, library, and several large classrooms. As of 2012, the former campus is an admission campus.\n\nThe University has a Board of Trustees composed of prominent Iraqi and American leaders from across a wide range of sectors, including government, business, nonprofit and education sectors. The Board of Trustees oversees the management and operations of the University and is a self-perpetuating body that establishes it policies.\n\nThe Academic Preparatory Program (APP) prepares non-native English speaking high school graduates to undertake undergraduate studies at AUIS. In addition to English Language skills, they teach critical thinking and study habits. The APP ensures that students have the necessary proficiency in English reading, speaking and writing along with awareness of academic cultural norms and expectations to succeed in their undergraduates studies at AUIS.\n\nThe Undergraduate program at AUIS is modeled after the liberal American-style of education and includes seven different majors. AUIS undergraduates explore different disciplines before choosing a major. The six different departments at AUIS include the Department of Business Administration, Engineering, English and Journalism, Information Technology, Social Sciences and Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Students also have the option of pursuing a secondary course of study in addition to their degree program.\n\nAll instruction at AUIS is in English, and all language instructors are native English speakers.\n\nAUIS offers an MBA program through its Business and Administration Department.\n\nThe Professional Development Institute (PDI) complements the educational objectives of the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani by providing opportunities for lifelong learning through programs and services that enables participants to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve personal and professional goals, improve the productivity of organizations, and provide leadership and service to their communities. PDI is a certified Cisco Academy and is accredited by the Association of Chartered Certified Account, the Project Management Institute and ICDL. PDI has also been certified as a PMI Registered Education Provider.\n\nAUIS provides a thriving and vibrant culture of extracurricular activities and sports on campus. Students can take part in many activities including drama, debate, linguistics, music, athletics, social work and indoor games like chess. There are several clubs and societies as well as sports and athletic teams for both men and women at AUIS. Throughout the year, these clubs and societies arrange events and meet to engage more students in creative, extracurricular initiatives. \nThe University frequently takes part in arranging cultural events outside the campus as well. In 2013, the Drama Club and English Department joined forces to hold The Art of Social Justice - a one-week festival celebrating creative arts. The festival, backed by the US State Department, hosted performances, workshops, discussions and field trips by renowned American and Iraqi artists. Later, AUIS senior lecturer Marie Labrosse published a book, SoJust, that chronicled the arts festival in Sulaimani.\n\nThe University has also held events and performances at important cultural landmarks like the Cultural Cafe and Chai Xana Sha’ab, in keeping with the strong traditions of the cultural capital of Kurdistan. It has also held various poetry recitations, like the Poetry Slam, and the poetry workshop at Koc University in Istanbul. \nAUIS students are generally very active in volunteer and social work. They have led several charity drives, cook-offs, and international donation initiatives to help the displaced persons and refugees from Iraq and Syria, in partnership with organisations like Kurdistan Save the Children. Most of these initiatives are led by students independently. Startup Weekend Slemani is another independent initiative, pioneered predominantly by a group of talented AUIS alumni. The popular event brings together professionals and young entrepreneurs to encourage startup companies and businesses in Kurdistan.\n\nSeveral clubs and societies at AUIS allow students with similar interests to mingle with each other, and hone their extracurricular skills. The student organisations vary from developing professional skills like IT and business; to creative arts like anime, drama, music, debate, and literature; to indoor games like chess; as well as sports, hiking and cycling. \nThe AUIS drama club produces plays and dramas throughout the year. Some of their productions include “Twelve Angry (Wo)men”, “Noor”, “Will’s Cafe” - a play to celebrate Shakespeare's 450th birthday; and “The Arranged” - a commentary on the tradition of arranged marriages also written by a student Mahdi Murad, and “9 Parts of Desire” - performed during the Art of Social Justice Festival focussing on Iraqi migrant women. \nIn December 2015, two AUIS students, Leah Farooq and Beyan Tahir, were selected to participate in the Home Grown program - an intensive theatrical training provided jointly by the Kevin Spacey Foundation and The Middle East Theatre Academy. The students were part of a troupe of 35 talented young people scouted from all over the Middle East for the workshop. Both participants selected from Iraq were students at AUIS. The workshop culminated in a theatrical performance in Sharjah on January 25, 2015. Kevin Spacey trained the students and watched their performance in Sharjah. \nAUIS also hosts the offices of the first independent, English language, student newspaper in Iraq, The AUIS Voice. The AUIS Voice is run by an editorial board composed solely of students, and is published biweekly. The Washington Post included two pictures of the AUIS Voice staff in a photo collection titled “Youths in Iraq: The War Generation.” AUIS Voice is also a member of the Associated Collegiate Press. The editorial board selects new editors in the beginning of the fall semester, and the paper is regularly published throughout the fall and spring semester.\n\nStudent at AUIS, both men and women, are able to be active in sports. The University has two basketball courts and one football field on campus. The official mascot for the athletics teams is the Eagle, and the teams include men’s and women’s basketball and football, ping-pong or table tennis, and tai chi. The teams play intercollegiate as well as intramural matches at AUIS, and have also been on international tours. Students on both the women’s and men’s basketball team at AUIS participated in the 34th Annual Sports Fest at Boğaziçi Üniversitesi in 2014. \nIn 2011, a documentary made by an American film company gained international recognition for the women’s basketball team. The film Salaam Dunk was shown at several international film festivals including Chicago International film festival and Los Angeles film festival.\n\nAUIS houses Sulaimani’s independent research centre, the Institute of Regional and International Studies (IRIS). The centre focuses on the local, regional, and international, social and political issues through research, scholarships, debate and conferences. According to the university website, the institute “examines the region’s most complex issues through rigorous scholarship, advanced research, and open dialogue among academic and influential public leaders.”\nThe centre conducts meetings, round-tables, conferences and lectures on topics pertinent to the local and regional politics. It invites leading figures from the government, political parties, businesses, historical and cultural institutions to have meaningful dialogues on issues and challenges pertinent to the region. Housed in a tolerant and diverse institution, IRIS provides a neutral space for open and critical dialogue on challenging topics. The centre runs one of the most strategic conferences, the Sulaimani Forum, which has rapidly gained recognition throughout the region. \nChristine van den Toorn became IRIS Director in 2015. She writes for local and international publications and is frequently quoted and interviewed about local and regional issues in Kurdistan and Iraq in Al-Jazeera, The Daily Beast, the podcast Iraq Matters and Musings on Iraq. She is the director and founder of The Primary Source, which provides research and reporting services to the KRG and wider Iraq.\n\nThe Institute of Regional and International Studies (IRIS) at AUIS organises an annual forum to open dialogue and debate on the challenging regional political issues concerning the Middle East. The Sulaimani Forum is held in March/April every year and focuses on the most pressing local and regional issues through in-depth panel discussions and debates. The forum invites prominent speakers and specialists on the topic from both within Iraq, the wider region and Europe and the United States. The forum is covered extensively by the local and international media. During the inaugural Forum in 2013, the event trended on Twitter with #SulaimaniForum in Egypt and Iraq. The hashtag #suliforum created quite a buzz on Twitter during the second Sulaimani Forum in 2014. \nThe first Sulaimani Forum, in March 2013 held at AUIS, explored the changing dynamics of the Middle East. The forum created a very open debate on issues such as Iraq’s internal and external relations, oil, security, Kurdistan and the Arab Spring, etc. The speakers and panelists included distinguished names such as Hoshyar Zebari, Zalmay Khalilzad, and Max Rodenbeck among others. “For an Iraqi Kurd and someone who has attended many such events around the world, the Sulaimani Forum provided the most relevant discussions on Iraq, its politics and future” reviewed Kurdish journalist and commentator Hiwa Osman on his blog. \nThe second Sulaimani Forum, “Navigating Challenges in the Middle East” brought together experts from around the region on 4–5 March 2014. The list of speakers included Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the KRG, who gave a speech at the forum. Others included Hoshyar Zebari, Ahmet Davutoğlu, Zalmay Khalilzad, Falah Al Fayad and Bernard Kouchner. This forum was also covered extensively by several media and publications. “While its unofficial epithet, The Davos of the Middle East, may be ambitious, the 2014 Sulaimani Forum, hosted by the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani (AUIS) on March 4th and 5th, was not far off the mark—especially considering that this year’s annual Forum was only the second of its kind.” reviewed the Invest In Group, covering the highlights of the Forum.\n\nThe third annual Sulaimani Forum was hosted at AUIS on 11–12 March 2015. The 2016 forum was held in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nThe Institute provides grants and assistance to visiting faculty to pursue research projects pertinent to the region. The fellows are provided research grants as well as research assistance by their students. Most visiting fellows are encouraged to teach courses relevant to the research as well. The 2014-15 fellows include Maria Fantappie, Maria Saldarriaga, and Vanessa Iaria. \nFantappie was a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut, has worked for the International Crisis Group in Iraq, and is considered a specialist on Kurdish issues. She has written extensively, on the Kurdish issues and Iraq’s domestic political challenges. In March 2014, she was interviewed for ‘Inside the Middle East’ Q&A series hosted by the Belfer Center. She has published several reports on Iraq, Syria, and the rising issue of the Kurds in the region for the International Crisis Group. Her research at AUIS focuses on the Kurdish youth and their relationship with the traditional Kurdish political parties.\n\nOne of the 2013-14 IRIS fellows is Bilal Wahab - a lecturer of social sciences at AUIS, and a commentator on issues related to Kurdistan, including oil and energy policies in Iraq. As part of his fellowship, Dr. Wahab published on Iraq and KRG’s energy policies. His interviews and quotes appear frequently in Invest In Group, Rudaw, NPR and PUKMedia, etc. He has appeared as a panelist in a discussion on national reconciliation prospects in Iraq and Syria at the Johns Hopkins University in Washington.\nIRIS fellow, Maria Saldarriaga, is conducting her research on traditional water sources (karez) and the sustainable management of groundwater resources in Iraq and Kurdistan. At the same time, she is teaching a special course on water in Iraq, including “history, water resources, traditional water systems, quality, in addition to the current challenges.”\n\nIRIS has published the analyses and summaries of the first and the second annual Sulaimani Forum, as well as the report on energy policies by Bilal Wahab.\n\nIn 2009, \"CounterPunch\" ran an article by former English instructor Mark Grueter who stated that the university functioned more as a political tool than as an educational institution. Faculty members and students have complained about mismanagement and incompetence.\n\nIn 2010, \"AlterNet\" ran an article by former English instructor John Dolan which affirmed Grueter's viewpoint and detailed the university's connections to Donald Rumsfeld via John Agresto.\n\nIn 2011, Salon.com noted the university's link to President George W. Bush through Donald Rumsfeld protegee, John Agresto, who was then serving as AUIS's Provost.\n\n\n"}

It ranks what it calls the Top 300 United States colleges and universities. The guide includes specialty and for profit schools including Art, Business, Design, Music, and Online Education. The TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Rankings are produced twice a year by the Global Language Monitor of Austin, Texas.\n\nThe TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Rankings are produced twice a year by the Global Language Monitor. GLM describes their rankings as measuring the Internet “Brand Equity” of the colleges and universities. Time Magazine described internet brand equity as \"a measure of who's talking about you online, based on Internet data, social media, blogs and the top 75,000 print and electronic media outlets. \nGLM ranks the schools \"according to their online presence -- or internet brand equity ... By focusing on online presence, the Monitor hopes to avoid the biases that characterize other rankings, which commonly rely on the opinions of university officials and college counselors rather than that of the greater public.\" GLM believes the rankings provide an up-to-date perspective on which schools have the most popular brand. \nfor example, it cites the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania (ranked fifth in 2010 by U.S. News) fared almost equivalently to Penn State (ranked 47th in 2010 by U.S. News), ranking 22nd and 24th respectively.\" The resulting tool, the group claims, gauges the relative value of the various institutions and how they change over time.\n\nThe rankings are the only ones that contain specialty schools which are typically assigned to \"unranked\" or \"other' categories. \"The rankings include specialty (and for profit) schools as well, such as Art, Business, Design, Music, and even Online Education. Most specialty schools are included in the College category with the exception of the online university, which is assigned to the University category ... \nThe MediaBuzz list also compiles the Best of Class (BOC) from among all, the designation being awarded to those schools that are first in terms of brand repute and impact, either in the overall ranking or in a specific classification, such as Top Catholic College or University.\"\n\nThe TrendTopper MediaBuzz Analysis uses the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s classifications as the basis to distinguish between Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges. The schools were ranked in the last week of December with a mid-year snapshot, and the last day of 2009 as the base.\n\nGLM claims that TrendTopper MediaBuzz utilizes a mathematical model that ‘normalizes’ the data collected from the Internet, social media, and blogosphere as well as the top 75,000 print and electronic media and that the end result is a non-biased analytical tool that provides a gauge of relative values among various institutions, as well as measures of how that value changes over time. The basics of the methodology are available for download directly from the Global Language Monitor site.\n\nTrendTopper MediaBuzz uses narrative tracking technology, where the words, phrases and concepts are tracked in relation to their frequency, contextual usage and appearance in global media outlets. This exclusive ranking is based upon GLM's Narrative Tracking technology. NarrativeTracker analyzes the Internet, blogosphere, the 75,000 print and electronic media, as well as new social media sources (such as Twitter). NarrativeTracker replaced the controversial PQI index, which had been criticized by a number of linguists, but no media tracking, or computer scientists or other members of the academic community, for its use in the counting of the number of English words.\n\nThe Global Language Monitor also sells the TrendTopper MediaBuzz Reputation Management solution for higher education for which \"colleges and universities can enhance their standings among peers\". The Global Language Monitor states that it \"does not influence the Higher Education rankings in any way\".\n\nMilwaukee Magazine stated that \"a study by Kiplinger’s that buttresses Global Language Monitor’s findings, researchers conclude that UW-Madison is one of the best values in higher education. The study ranked schools based on academic caliber – graduation and retention rates, student-to-teacher ratios and the SAT and ACT scores of incoming students – and affordability\". Comparisons are frequently made between the TrendTopper MediaBuzz College rankings and the \"Princeton Review\" and the U.S. News & World Report College and University rankings, which suggest that \"a brand equity service based on \"buzz\" is certainly important, and reflects a more democratic perspective. It is a good contender against rankings posted by U.S. News & World Report or The Princeton Review. However, there are others who question the value of using brand equity studies with higher education.\n"}

The WCG serves as a resource for learning about the care of art collections.\n\nThe Washington Conservation Guild (WCG) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1967 for professional conservators, students, and others interested in the preservation of art and historic materials.\n\nThe idea for the regional conservation group was proposed as early as 1965, when the International Council of Museums (ICOM) Committee for Conservation met in Washington, DC. The first steering committee met informally in the summer of 1967; here, it was decided that the primary intentions of the group was to provide a public forum where members could meet and \"sponsor presentations to promote the exchange of ideas among conservators in all fields in the Washington area.\"\n\nBylaws or Code of Ethics put forward by the WCG to define its governance and for its members as a condition of membership.\n\nBased in Washington, D.C., the WCG draws its members primarily from Washington, Maryland, and northern Virginia. Members include both professional conservators and non-conservators - from government, state, and private museums; as well as studios, laboratories, and other cultural or academic organizations. There are no restrictions on who may apply for membership.\n\nThe Washington Conservation Guild is governed by all-volunteered, membership-elected Board of Directors. The Board is composed of five officers and several directors. The WCG is also composed of several committees, led by Board-appointed chairs.\n\nElections for WCG Board Officers and Directors take place May at the Annual Business Meeting.\n\nThe WCG holds meetings from October through May each year, generally on the first Thursday of each month. Once annually, the Guild hosts the 3-Ring Circus event. The '3-Ring Circus' held January 9, 2014 in partnership with the National Museum of African Art, ran with three consecutive sessions. The themes for the January 2014 3-Ring Circus were \"Conservation in Far Flung Places;\" \"Analytical;\" and \"Contemporary.\"\n\nThe Guild also holds several monthly events over the course of the year. These events have included lectures, workshops, and networking sessions.\n\nThe Angels Project is designed to \"promote a broader understanding of the importance of cultural preservation while providing meaningful assistance to important local collections.\" Members participating in the Projects work pro-bono, volunteering their time and conservation expertise at a particular historic site. The Angels Project originally began in 1988 with the WCG's parent group, the American Institute of Conservation, pairing conservators with collections that need care.\n\nOn April 30, 2007, a three-alarm fire caused significant damage to the Georgetown branch of the DC Public Library. City officials estimated the cost to repair the library at about $20 million; the renovation included the restoration of exterior doors and windows, stone masonry, and ornamental railings and grates. Members of the WCG responded and coordinated with the DC library officials to set up disaster recovery efforts. At its annual meeting days later on May 3, 2007, the WCG held a fundraiser raffle. The proceeds went to support the conservation of the library's artwork, manuscripts, maps, and documents damaged in the fire.\n\nThe Washington Conservation Guild published a quarterly newsletter written and edited by volunteers to benefit guild members. Offered at first only as a printed edition, the newsletter transitioned to an online PDF. The newsletter was published as a PDF until December 2012, when it was replaced by a continuously-updated blog-style website. Archived newsletters can be found on the WCG website.\n\nIn 2004, the Washington Conservation Guild published the second edition of its eBook, \"Conservation Resources for Art and Antiques\". \"Conservation Resources\" is a guide describing how to care for and preserve fine art, antiques, family heirlooms, memorabilia, and personal collections.\n\n\n"}

The program begins and ends with practical service (usually some form of voluntary work in the NGO or political sectors) in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It was originally called The Young Leaders Program.\n\nIn Washington, participants get first-hand experience with U.S. government and politics and an immersion in American culture by living with an area host family. Through an eight-week schedule, participants are encouraged to work and learn as a team and to create an environment of mutual respect. The program aims to send students home with enhanced professional and interpersonal skills and a new confidence in their own leadership abilities which they are expected to demonstrate through service to their own communities. Among the 2007 Internship opportunities were placements in the Senate offices of then Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nCurrent Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was a member of the Class of 2000.\n\nSince its inception in 1995, the program has expanded from four to eight weeks, allowing time for both leadership training and work experience. Students are placed in offices across the Washington metropolitan region representing federal and local government, businesses, non-profit organizations, professional services firms and media organizations. Placements have included The White House, Congressional offices, The Northern Ireland Bureau, The World Bank, Habitat for Humanity, AFL-CIO, CNN and CBS, Library of Congress, Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, The Justice Project, Imagination Stage and Solas Nua, among many others.\n\nParticipants develop practical leadership abilities by committing to 30 hours of service in their own communities before the summer and 40 hours in a Group Service Project when they return. Students also help launch and run the following year's program by assisting with marketing, recruiting, selecting and mentoring the succeeding WIP class.\n\nSuccessful candidates must be Irish-born, or Irish or British (NI) citizens with current passports. They must be full-time students in Ireland or the United Kingdom, between the ages of 18 and 25, and passing their subjects at a better than passing grade. Moreover, they must be willing to demonstrate leadership through service before and after the program, and be ready to participate in diverse leadership teams. Program applicants have represented more than 30 different universities in Northern Ireland, Ireland, England and Scotland.\n\nTo date, 300 young adults have graduated from the program. Many WIP graduates have moved into important careers in politics, business, media and education. These include: a research officer to the NI First Minister in Westminster; television and radio news journalists; reporters for major newspapers in Belfast and London; barristers and solicitors; university professors and primary school teachers; consultants with Accenture and PriceWaterhouseCoopers; Dublin PR firm managers; assistant to Members of the NI Assembly and the Irish Parliament; political party operatives in Northern Ireland and the Republic; and Executive Officer for the Home Office in London. Among the notable alumni is Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\n\nInitially begun in partnership with the Students' Union at Queen's University, Belfast, WIP has received support from the Irish Government through its Department of Education and the International Fund for Ireland as well as the UK government and the US State Department. The program is now actively developing partnerships with other government departments, universities, businesses, foundations and individuals that will support its core program and help expand alumni programs.\n\nThe Washington-Ireland Program is an extension of Project Children, a program that sponsors six-week summer holidays in the U.S. for young people from Northern Ireland. The participants, who stay with American Host Families, range in age from 10–14 years old and come from neighborhoods in which the Protestant-Catholic conflict has taken an especially heavy toll. For most children, these visits provide a first-time opportunity to get to know people from the other side of the sectarian divide. In its 27-year existence, Project Children has had 17,000 participants. Project Children also works with vocational trainees from Northern Ireland and the Republic who get on-site work experience in the U.S. by building homes with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nIn 2001, alumni members of the Washington-Ireland Programme established a charity known as the Youth Empowerment Scheme, a mentoring programme for children aged 11–14 years old from across Belfast. The aim of YES is to promote social inclusion of children from different ethnic, religious, educational and socio-economic backgrounds.\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed and published by Excalibur Publishing Limited.\n\nThe goal of the game is to build a successful water park. When a world is launched, there is a large fenced-in space where the player can build their water park, as well as a ticket booth. The park is closed when by default, but the player can open it at anytime, which will cause guests to be able to enter the park. Several types of pools, water slides, playground rides, food stalls, and vegetation are available for the player to improve the park. When any of these are bought, the player will lose money. Money is gained when guests buy food or drink, or purchase a park ticket. The player can set the price of both of these, but if the price is too high, guests will not want to purchase an article or ticket, and the park rating will drop.\n\nThe park rating is represented by a star with a number in it as well as a percentage on the top right of the screen. The percentage and number start off at 0, but as the water park is expanded and improved, the percentage will go up, causing the number to come up too. Once the percentage gets to 90%, the number will be up to 5, which is the highest it can go. In addition to building attractions and stalls, the player can also hire staff. These staff will perform tasks such as cleaning up the park, improving safety, and watering plants. Staff help improve the park greatly, and will therefore increase the park rating. However, the more staff you hire, the more money you lose at the end of an in-game month.\n"}

Just under 20% of undergraduate places are awarded through the Pool.\n\nAny strong applicant who cannot be offered a place by their first choice college will be placed in the Pool and other colleges will be recommended to consider them. All applicants, except those for Mathematics and Medicine, who meet a minimum academic standard of an average of 93% or more across their three best subjects at AS level will be automatically pooled even if they did not perform well at interview.\n\nApplicants in the Pool are graded according to four criteria:\n\nThe Pool takes place over two days in early January. Pooled applicants who are \"fished\" by a college may be offered a place immediately or they may be invited for interview.\n\nEach year about 3,000 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 600 to 700 applicants are made an offer by another college through the Pool. On average one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of a place.\n\nStatistics released by the University show that some of the more popular and oversubscribed colleges such as Clare College, Pembroke College, King's College and Trinity College rarely take applicants from the Pool while others such as Girton College, Murray Edwards College (New Hall) and Newnham College draw a substantial proportion of their undergraduate intake from the Pool. The Pool thus provides a means of transferring strong applicants from oversubscribed colleges to undersubscribed ones.\n"}
