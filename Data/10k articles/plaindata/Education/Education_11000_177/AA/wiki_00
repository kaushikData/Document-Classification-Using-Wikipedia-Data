These programs include sail training, marine science, and SCUBA training courses in locations throughout the Caribbean, Australia, Ecuador and the Galapagos, Tahiti, and the Mediterranean. ActionQuest is a member of the Global Expeditions Group family of brands. ActionQuest is a Tall Ships America affiliate member and participates in its annual conference in Boston. \n\nActionQuest is an institution dedicated to \"guiding diverse groups of young adults on exceptional global expeditions; challenging them with high action adventures that promote personal growth, teamwork and leadership\".\n\nActionQuest began running programs in the British Virgin Islands in the mid-1980s; however, its seafaring history extends back to the Flint School. In his youth before starting ActionQuest, Jim Stoll worked as an educator and sailed with his mother and father at their family preparatory school known as the Flint School. Additionally, he had the opportunity to sail with Irving and Exy Johnson, who are considered the pioneers of sea training and was inspired to continue creating sail training programs himself.\n\nActionQuest headquarters are located in Sarasota, Florida. A large bulk of the summer programs are run out of West End, Tortola, at Soper's Hole Marina using yachts chartered from Sunsail. Sunsail has since moved its charter base from West End to Hodge's Creek and finally to Road Town in 2007. ActionQuest continues to charter boats through them.\n\nWhen the founder's son decided to complete his goal of sailing around the world, he sailed to various locations in which ActionQuest later decided to expand their programs. By the late 1990s, ActionQuest included programs in satellite locations such as Tahiti and French Polynesia, Fiji, Australia, and the Galapagos.\n\nIn 2006, ActionQuest's sister company Sea|mester built the 112-foot staysail schooner \"Argo\" for college students; however, in the summertime, programs are opened to high school teenagers to sail aboard in either the Mediterranean or the Western Pacific.\n\nActionQuest uses PADI certified scuba instructors and offers courses from Open Water Diver through Divemaster. ActionQuest also works with International Yachtmaster Training (IYT) for sailing certifications. The Majority of students gain an Open Water certification in the British Virgin Islands. Marine Biology is also offered for high school credit in the BVI's. [3]\n\nFrom ActionQuest grew two other institutions, Sea|mester Global Programs and GoBeyond Student Travel. Sea|mester owns two schooners, \"Ocean Star\" and \"Argo\" to run full-time training programs for college students around the world. GoBeyond Student Travel runs community-service based programs in the British Virgin Islands, Australia, China, Galapagos, Costa Rica, and Thailand.\n\n\n"}

In the book, We Are Not Such Things, it is also reported that by 2013, Linda Biehl had been at odds with the South African foundation for several years, after mismanagement by its South African directors\n\nThe original foundation strived to fulfil three rights in the South African Constitution: the right to education, the right to equal employment, and the right to health. The foundation's mission statement is \"to weave a barrier against violence\" and \"to prevent youth violence through a holistic approach to community development in socio-economically disadvantaged communities in and around Cape Town.\" It aimed to do so by empowering the youths of the townships around Cape Town, mainly through after-school programs with activities like music, dance, drama, sports, crafts and HIV/AIDS peer education. These programs were run at several township-schools every afternoon, and in addition the foundation ran weekly activities outside the townships for some of the children, and they also have Saturday and Holiday programs. The Foundation initially received funding from USAID as well as private donations.\n\nLinda Biehl, Amy's mother and a founder of the trust, speaks on the promise of restorative justice, and continues the work of the foundation. She was awarded the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo (bronze class) in 2008 by South African President Thabo Mbeki.\n\nTwo of the four men convicted for Biehl's murder, Easy Nofemela and Ntobeko Peni, have since reconciled with her parents, and are now working for the Foundation in South Africa.\n\n"}

{"id": "5531689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5531689", "title": "Antiscience", "text": "Antiscience\n\nAntiscience is a position that rejects science and the scientific method. People holding antiscientific views do not accept that science as an objective method can generate universal knowledge. They also contend that scientific reductionism in particular is an inherently limited means to reach understanding of a complex world.\n\nIn the beginnings of the scientific revolution, scientists such as Robert Boyle found themselves in conflict with those such as Thomas Hobbes, who were skeptical of whether science was a satisfactory way to obtain genuine knowledge about the world.\n\nHobbes' stance is sometimes regarded as an antiscience position:\n\nIn his \"Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics,\"...[published in 1656, Hobbes] distinguished 'demonstrable' fields, as 'those the construction of the subject whereof is in the power of the artist himself,' from 'indemonstrable' ones 'where the causes are to seek for.' We can only know the causes of what we make. So geometry is demonstrable, because 'the lines and figures from which we reason are drawn and described by ourselves' and 'civil philosophy is demonstrable, because we make the commonwealth ourselves.' But we can only speculate about the natural world, because 'we know not the construction, but seek it from the effects.'\n\nIt was also Hobbes who \"put forth the idea of the significance of the nonrational in human behaviour.\" Jones goes on to group Hobbes along with others he classes as 'antireductionists' and 'individualists,' such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Karl Marx, Jeremy Bentham and J S Mill, and then he adds Karl Popper, John Rawls, and E. O. Wilson.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, in his \"Discourse on the Arts and Sciences\", claimed that science can lead to immorality. \"Rousseau argues that the progression of the sciences and arts has caused the corruption of virtue and morality\" and his \"critique of science has much to teach us about the dangers involved in our political commitment to scientific progress, and about the ways in which the future happiness of mankind might be secured\". Nevertheless, Rousseau does not state in his Discourses that sciences are \"necessarily\" bad, and states that figures like René Descartes, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton should be held in high regard. In the conclusion to the Discourses, he says that these (aforementioned) can cultivate sciences to great benefit, and that morality's corruption is mostly because of society's bad influence on scientists.\n\nWilliam Blake reacted strongly against the work of Isaac Newton in his paintings and writings, and is seen as being perhaps the earliest (and almost certainly the most prominent and enduring) example of what is seen by historians as the aesthetic or romantic antiscience response. For example, in his 1795 poem Auguries of Innocence, Blake describes the beautiful and natural robin redbreast imprisoned by the materialistic cage of Newtonian mathematics and science. In Blake's painting of Newton, he is depicted \"as a misguided hero whose gaze was directed only at sterile geometrical diagrams drawn on the ground\". Blake thought that \"Newton, Bacon, and Locke with their emphasis on reason were nothing more than 'the three great teachers of atheism, or Satan's Doctrine'...the picture progresses from exuberance and colour on the left, to sterility and blackness on the right. In Blake's view Newton brings not light, but night\". In a poem, W.H. Auden summarises Blake's anti-scientific views by saying that he \"[broke] off relations in a curse, with the Newtonian Universe\".\n\nOne recent biographer of Newton considers him more as a renaissance alchemist, natural philosopher, and magician rather than a true representative of scientific illuminism, as popularized by Voltaire and other illuminist Newtonians.\n\nAntiscience issues are seen as a fundamental consideration in the transition from 'pre-science' or 'protoscience' such as that evident in alchemy. Many disciplines that pre-date the widespread adoption and acceptance of the scientific method, such as geometry and astronomy, are not seen as anti-science. However, some of the orthodoxies within those disciplines that predate a scientific approach (such as those orthodoxies repudiated by the discoveries of Galileo) are seen as being a product of an anti-scientific stance.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche stated within The Gay Science that “in Science, convictions have no rights of citizenship, as is said with good reason. Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of a hypothesis, of a provisional experimental point of view, of a regulative fiction, maybe they be granted admission and even a certain value within the realm of knowledge—though always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. But does this not mean, more precisely considered, that a conviction may obtain admission to Science only when it ceases to be a conviction? Would not the discipline of the scientific spirit begin with this, no longer to permit oneself any convictions? Probably that is how it is. But one must still ask whether it is not the case that, in order that this discipline could begin, a conviction must have been there already, and even such a commanding and unconditional one that it sacrificed all other convictions for its own sake. It is clear that Science too rests on a faith; there is no Science ‘without presuppositions.’ The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance, but affirmed to the extent that the principle, the faith, the conviction is expressed: ‘nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it, everything else has only second-rate value.”\n\nThe term 'scientism' derives from science studies and is a term spawned and used by sociologists and philosophers of science to describe the views, beliefs and behavior of strong supporters of science. It is commonly used in a pejorative sense, for individuals who seem to be treating science in a similar way to a religion. The term reductionism is occasionally used in a similarly pejorative way (as a more subtle attack on scientists). However, some scientists feel comfortable being labelled as reductionists, while agreeing that there might be conceptual and philosophical shortcomings of reductionism.\n\nHowever, non-reductionist (see Emergentism) views of science have been formulated in varied forms in several scientific fields like statistical physics, chaos theory, complexity theory, cybernetics, systems theory, systems biology, ecology, information theory, etc. Such fields tend to assume that strong interaction between units produce new phenomena in higher levels that cannot be accounted for solely by reductionism. For example, it is not valuable (or currently possible) to describe a chess game or gene networks using quantum mechanics. The emergentist view of science (\"More is Different\", in the words of Nobel physicist Philip W. Anderson) has been inspired in its methodology by the European social sciences (Durkheim, Marx) which tend to reject methodological individualism.\n\nOne expression of antiscience is the \"denial of universality and... legitimisation of alternatives\", and that the results of scientific findings do not always represent any underlying reality, but can merely reflect the ideology of dominant groups within society. In this view, science is associated with the political Right and is seen as a belief system that is conservative and conformist, that suppresses innovation, that resists change and that acts dictatorially. This includes the view, for example, that science has a \"bourgeois and/or Eurocentric and/or masculinist world-view\".\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement, often associated with the left, has been criticized for overstating the negative effects of nuclear power, and understating the environmental costs of non-nuclear sources that can be prevented through nuclear energy. Many scientific fields which straddle the boundary between the biological and social sciences have also experienced resistance from the left, such as sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and population genetics. This is due to the perceived association of these sciences with scientific racism and neocolonialism. Many critics of these fields, such as Stephen Jay Gould, have been accused of having strong political biases, and engaging in \"mob science\".\nThe origin of antiscience thinking may be traced back to the reaction of Romanticism to the Enlightenment, this movement is often referred to as the 'Counter-Enlightenment'. Romanticism emphasizes that intuition, passion and organic links to Nature are primal values and that rational thinking is merely a product of human life. There are many modern examples of conservative antiscience polemics. Primary among the latter are the polemics about evolutionary theory and modern cosmology teaching in high schools, and environmental issues related to global warming and energy crisis.\n\nCharacteristics of antiscience associated with the right include the appeal to conspiracy theories to explain why scientists believe what they believe, in an attempt to undermine the confidence or power usually associated to science (e.g. in global warming conspiracy theories).\n\nIn this context, antiscience may be considered dependent on religious, moral and cultural arguments. For this kind of religious antiscience philosophy, science is an anti-spiritual and materialistic force that undermines traditional values, ethnic identity and accumulated historical wisdom in favor of reason and cosmopolitanism. In particular, the traditional and ethnic values emphasized are similar to those of white supremacist Christian Identity theology, but similar right-wing views have been developed by radically conservative sects of Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. New religious movements such as New Age thinking also criticize the scientific worldview as favouring a reductionist, atheist, or materialist philosophy.\n\nA frequent basis of antiscientific sentiment is religious theism with literal interpretations of sacred text. Here, scientific theories that conflict with what is considered divinely-inspired knowledge are regarded as flawed. Over the centuries religious institutions have been hesitant to embrace such ideas as heliocentrism and planetary motion because they contradicted the dominant understanding of various passages of scripture. More recently the body of creation theologies known collectively as creationism, including the teleological theory of intelligent design, have been promoted by religious theists in response to the process of evolution by natural selection.\n\nTo the extent that attempts to overcome antiscience sentiments have failed, some argue that a different approach to science advocacy is needed. One such approach says that it is important to develop a more accurate understanding of those who deny science (avoiding stereotyping them as backward and uneducated) and also to attempt outreach via those who share cultural values with target audiences, such as scientists who also hold religious beliefs.\n\nHistorically, antiscience first arose as a reaction against scientific materialism. The 18th century Enlightenment had ushered in \"the ideal of a unified system of all the sciences\", but there were those fearful of this notion, who \"felt that constrictions of reason and science, of a single all-embracing system... were in some way constricting, an obstacle to their vision of the world, chains on their imagination or feeling\". Antiscience then is a rejection of \"the scientific model [or paradigm]... with its strong implication that only that which was quantifiable, or at any rate, measurable... was real\". In this sense, it comprises a \"critical attack upon the total claim of the new scientific method to dominate the entire field of human knowledge\". However, scientific positivism (logical positivism) does not deny the reality of non-measurable phenomena, only that those phenomena should not be adequate to scientific investigation. Moreover, positivism, as a philosophical basis for the scientific method, is not consensual or even dominant in the scientific community (see philosophy of science).\n\nThree major areas of antiscience can be seen in philosophy, sociology, and ecology. The following quotes explore this aspect of the subject.\n\nPhilosophical objections against science are often objections about the role of reductionism. For example, in the field of psychology, \"both reductionists and antireductionists accept that... non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones\". Further, \"epistemological antireductionism holds that, given our finite mental capacities, we would not be able to grasp the ultimate physical explanation of many complex phenomena even if we knew the laws governing their ultimate\nconstituents\". Some see antiscience as \"common...in academic settings...many people see that there are problems in demarcation between science, scientism, and pseudoscience resulting in an antiscience stance. Some argue that nothing can be known for sure\".\n\nMany philosophers are \"divided as to whether reduction should be a central strategy for understanding the world\". However, many agree that \"there are, nevertheless, reasons why we want science to discover properties and explanations other than reductive physical ones\". Such issues stem \"from an antireductionist worry that there is no absolute conception of reality, that is, a characterization of reality such as... science claims to provide\". This is close to the Kantian view that reality is ultimately unknowable and all models are just imperfect approximations to it.\n\nSociologist Thomas Gieryn refers to \"some sociologists who might appear to be antiscience\". Some \"philosophers and antiscience types\", he contends, may have presented \"unreal images of science that threaten the believability of scientific knowledge\", or appear to have gone \"too far in their antiscience deconstructions\". The question often lies in how much scientists conform to the standard ideal of \"communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, and... skepticism\". Unfortunately, \"scientists don't always conform... scientists do get passionate about pet theories; they do rely on reputation in judging a scientist's work; they do pursue fame and gain via research\". Thus, they may show inherent biases in their work. \"[Many] scientists are not as rational and logical as the legend would have them, nor are they as illogical or irrational as some relativists might say\".\n\nWithin the ecological and health spheres, Levins identifies a conflict \"not between science and antiscience, but rather between different pathways for science and technology; between a commodified science-for-profit and a gentle science for humane goals; between the sciences of the smallest parts and the sciences of dynamic wholes... [he] offers proposals for a more holistic, integral approach to understanding and addressing environmental issues\". These beliefs are also common within the scientific community, with for example, scientists being prominent in environmental campaigns warning of environmental dangers such as ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect. It can also be argued that this version of antiscience comes close to that found in the medical sphere, where patients and practitioners may choose to reject science and adopt a pseudoscientific approach to health problems. This can be both a practical and a conceptual shift and has attracted strong criticism: \"therapeutic touch, a healing technique based upon the laying-on of hands, has found wide acceptance in the nursing profession despite its lack of scientific plausibility. Its acceptance is indicative of a broad antiscientific trend in nursing\".\n\nGlazer also criticises the therapists and patients, \"for abandoning the biological underpinnings of nursing and for misreading philosophy in the service of an antiscientific world-view\". In contrast, Brian Martin criticized Gross and Levitt by saying that \"[their] basic approach is to attack constructivists for not being positivists,\" and that science is \"presented as a unitary object, usually identified with scientific knowledge. It is portrayed as neutral and objective. Second, science is claimed to be under attack by 'antiscience' which is composed essentially of ideologues who are threats to the neutrality and objectivity that are fundamental to science. Third, a highly selective attack is made on the arguments of 'antiscience'\". Such people allegedly then \"routinely equate critique of scientific knowledge with hostility to science, a jump that is logically unsupportable and empirically dubious\". Having then \"constructed two artificial entities, a unitary 'science' and a unitary 'academic left', each reduced to epistemological essences, Gross and Levitt proceed to attack. They pick out figures in each of several areas – science studies, postmodernism, feminism, environmentalism, AIDS activism – and criticise their critiques of science\".\n\nThe writings of Young serve to illustrate more antiscientific views: \"The strength of the antiscience movement and of alternative technology is that their advocates have managed to retain Utopian vision while still trying to create concrete instances of it\". \"The real social, ideological and economic forces shaping science...[have] been opposed to the point of suppression in many quarters. Most scientists hate it and label it 'antiscience'. But it is urgently needed, because it makes science self-conscious and hopefully self-critical and accountable with respect to the forces which shape research priorities, criteria, goals\".\n\nGenetically modified foods also bring about antiscience sentiment. The general public has recently become more aware of the dangers of a poor diet, as there have been numerous studies that show that the two are inextricably linked. Anti-science dictates that science is untrustworthy, because it is never complete and always being revised, which would be a probable cause for the fear that the general public has of genetically modified foods despite scientific reassurance that such foods are safe.\n\nAntivaccinationists rely on whatever comes to hand presenting some of their arguments as if scientific, however a strain of antiscience is part of their approach.\n\nA common antiscientific point of contention arises from the fact that mathematical models do not capture the full reality of existence, as can be seen in this quote:\nThe formulas of mathematical models are \"artificial constructions, logical figments with no necessary relation to the outside world\". These models always \"leave out the richest and most important part of human experience...daily life, history, human laws and institutions, the modes of human self-expression\". A failure to appreciate the subtle complexity of social worlds, means they get excluded from the formulas, even though, \"no easy reductionism will do justice to the material\". This approach often fails to concentrate \"on social structures, processes, and actions in a specific sense (inequality, mobility, classes, strata, ethnicity, gender relations, urbanization, work and life of different types of people, not just elites)\", and so tends to generate mostly meaningless oversimplifications.\n\nIt is also a common antiscientific point to state that \"verbal\" (say, literary and non-mathematical) models are poor representations of reality. If it is clear that a particular statistical or psychological study about romantic love or religious ecstasy (see neurotheology) captures only a tiny fraction of such human experiences, literary accounts and simplified verbal models also cannot adequately convey their full complexity. Both verbal and mathematical models are (partial) maps of reality, providing different points of view, but inherently incomplete descriptions of the territory of human and universe existence (see map–territory relation).\n\n\n"}

Wayne Dyer was the first celebrity to follow and publicize Pillai’s manifestation teachings through his book \"Manifest your Destiny\", which he dedicated to Pillai. The Tamil Siddhar are spiritual renegades who believed in 200% life, i.e. living a 100% material and 100% spiritual life simultaneously. Since March 2007 Pillai has attracted a large number of viewers as testified by his free YouTube videos teaching the Siddha knowledge. \"Time\" called Pillai the YouTube guru. As a philanthropist he has initiated many projects across India, Mexico and the U.S., which include the Million Meals Project and educating underprivileged children. His educational programs in public schools and tuition centers improves the academic and social skills of disadvantaged students in India, Mexico and the United States through brain-enhancement sounds. These programs are implemented through the Tripura Foundation, established by Pillai in 1991, a consulting non-governmental organization to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).\n\nBaskaran Pillai was born on 1 February 1949, in Rameswaram, an island in Southern India that lies between India and Sri Lanka. His father was Subramania Pillai, a painter and photographer who ran a small business for pilgrims who visited Rameswaram, which happens to be one of the most important holy places for all Hindus. His mother Nambu Lakshmi was a housewife and the daughter of the Village head of Rameswaram. Pillai grew up with four siblings, all boys, in an island without electricity, automobiles or any other modern amenities. As a child, Pillai's mother, concerned with Pillai’s spiritual attractions and sleeplessness, consulted physicians who found no medical issues. His family dissuaded him from pursuing spiritual interests and instead encouraged academics and mundane pursuits.\n\nPillai went to the government school in Rameswaram and later on to a government college in Ramanathapuram. In 1971 and 1977, he received his Bachelors and Master's degree respectively in English literature from the University of Madurai. Pillai’s interest in spirituality led him to become a TM teacher under the guidance of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during which time he spent a few years in and out of Rishikesh, Himalayas. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi appointed Pillai as the head of his organization in the state of Tamil Nadu, a post which Pillai ultimately renounced.\n\nDuring 1979-81 Pillai was awarded the University's Scholarship to do research on Comparative Literature. He received a second degree, a Master of Letters in 1982, writing a thesis comparing John Donne's poetry to that of Kalladanar, a Tamil poet of the 10th Century. Pillai recollects that the period of living with University wizards, planted the seeds of unquenchable thirst for knowledge and spirit of investigation which deeply impacted his personal teachings.\n\nIn 1983, he left for the US to pursue his PhD at the University of Pittsburgh. His graduate work involved phenomenology of religion with a dissertation on Manikkavacakar, a South Indian mystic. Pillai served as both faculty and teacher of the University of Pittsburgh's Informal Programs from 1985-1989. After receiving his PhD in 1989, Dr. Pillai served as the Coordinator of Indian Studies under the Asian Studies program. He then moved on to the Indian Heritage Research Foundation and became the subject editor for the Encyclopedia of Hinduism.\n\nIn 1976, Baskaran married Vasantha. Being a householder, his spirituality met with challenges of running a family life. He has one daughter.\n\nAlthough Pillai moved out of the TM movement, he continued spiritual pursuits. From 1984-1988, Pillai taught at the Pitt Informal Program (PIP) a variety of Buddhist, Tantric and Yogic meditation courses. While working on his Doctoral dissertation, Pillai lectured on Hinduism and Buddhism in and around the Pittsburgh area besides teaching undergraduate students a course on a Survey of World Religions. Pillai made a decision to leave the academia and to teach spirituality and accordingly from 1989 onwards he has traveled extensively teaching spirituality and meditation.\n\nIn 1990 Pillai moved briefly to Los Angeles, California and began to teach meditation seminars. By the same time, he also established Tripura Foundation, a charitable educational organization to educate people on the value of spirituality in human life and culture. Tripura Foundation has charitable projects in USA, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring this 10-year time (1990–2000) Dr. Pillai went through many personal transformations, changing his spiritual name many times. He was known as Sri Guruji, Brzee, Sri Siva, Siva Baba, Dattatreya Siva Baba and so on. Dr. Pillai jokingly calls his names as impersonations that he assumed based on divine palm leaves astrological readings that revealed his previous incarnations as Shirdi Baba, Dattatreya, Swami Ramalingam and others. Dr.Pillai was also independently listed in Walter Semkiw MD’s book \"Born Again: Reincarnation Cases Involving International Celebrities, India’s Political Legends and Film Stars\" with these prior incarnations.\n\nIt was during this time that he gave Wayne Dyer the ‘ Ah’ meditation, which became popular through Dyer’s book \"Manifest Your Destiny\". Dyer dedicated the book to Dr. Pillai who at the time was called Sri Guruji. Dr. Dyer paid tribute to Dr. Pillai in one of his last books \"I can See Clearly Now\", by writing of Dr. Pillai: \"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, Guruji, for being willing to bring this phenomenal teaching to me...\"\n\nPillai appeared briefly in the 1997 Italian movie \"Nirvana (film)\" as the guru to Christopher Lambert's character. During five years (2000–2005), Dr. Pillai self-published two books \"Life Changing Sounds: Tools from the Other Side\" and \"The One Minute Guide to Prosperity and Enlightenment\". These books are out of print now. Pillai produced many hundreds of video clips for YouTube for which Time Magazine dubbed him as the YouTube Guru.\n\nIn 2005, Pillai renamed his organization as Pillai Center for Mind Science and widened his vision to incorporate more scientific exploration of the spiritual principles. Einstein’s saying that religion without science is blind and science without religion is lame, was cited frequently by Pillai and he changed his organizations and teachings to reflect that ideology.\n\nPhonemic Intelligence is one of the first scientifically validated initiatives. Phonemic Intelligence is based on the theory that sounds (phonemes) can change one's intelligence. The first scientific research on phonemic intelligence was carried out by SRM University Medical School, Chennai, India in 2006. Medical students participated in the study and the results were published in a journal. In 2011, Brain Science International in San Francisco conducted QEEG research on Phonemic Intelligence and found that Phonemic Intelligence can activate the anterior cingulate, a part of the brain associated with intelligence and compassion. Currently Phonemic Intelligence is being researched at World Care Clinical and Harvard Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital. The pilot is expected to be completed by July 2016.\n\nTripura Foundation has carried out a number of charitable activities in India, the US and Mexico, its current goal is to teach Phonemic Intelligences to under-privileged children. In India, at about 101 Tripura Hope Centers, children are actively practicing Phonemic Intelligence. In the US, public schools in New York, Detroit and California have picked up instruction.\n\n\nDr. Pillai started the East West Integrative Medicine Center in 2013 which is an educational research institute for Ayurevedic and Siddha Herbs. Dr. Pillai is currently living in San Diego.\n\n10.https://www.pillaicenter.com/about-us/dr-pillai 11. https://www.astroved.com/cosrporate-info/aboutu \n\n12.https://www.speakingtree.in/dr-baskaran-pillai \n"}

All are funded by WUSTL's student government, the Washington University Student Union, which has an approximately $2.5 million annual budget that is completely student controlled and is one of the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, it sponsors large-scale campus programs including WILD (a semesterly concert in the quad), free copies of \"The New York Times\", \"USA Today\", and the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" through The Collegiate Readership Program; the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series; and the campus television station, WUTV and the radio station, KWUR and Filmboard. The Office of Student Activities provides advisors, leadership training, counseling, and other support to the student groups on campus.\n\nThe University is home to one of the largest collegiate Relay For Life in the country, raising over $200,000 last year in total donations. Additionally, there are over 50 community service groups on campus such as a Habitat for Humanity Campus Chapter.\n\nThere are 10 national fraternities and 8 national sororities on campus; there are also 8 national black Greek organizations which have citywide St. Louis chapters. 9 of the fraternities have houses on the Danforth Campus, while none of the sororities have houses by their own accord. Approximately 30% of Washington University students participate in Greek Life. Greek Organizations are governed by the principles of Arete, which focuses on Integrity, Loyalty, Philanthropy, Responsibility, Friendship, and Intellectual Curiosity.\n\nThe Washington University Student Union is the undergraduate student government of Washington University in St. Louis.\nFounded in 1967, Student Union carries out three major activities: representing student interests; registering, funding, and supporting student groups; and planning campus-wide events. It is divided into three branches: the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. The Student Union Executive Branch comprises 5 elected individuals, who are the student body officials - the President, Vice President of Administration, Vice President of Finance, Vice President of Programming, and Vice President of Public Relations - who are charged with managing and allocating the budget, being the point of contact with University administration, and leading and setting the direction for Student Union. The Legislative branch includes the Treasury and the Senate. The Treasury of the Student Union hears appeals for finances from various student groups. Approximately 300 student groups on campus are registered SU groups, utilizing a large portion of the over $2 million budget. Recent resolutions of the Senate include improving Wi-Fi capabilities, improving relations between Alumni & Development and the Career Center, adding new capabilities to student ID cards, forming a LGBTQA task force, requiring all professors to distribute course syllabi and midterm grade progresses, and increasing the minimum wage of University workers. The SU Judicial Branch includes a Constitutional Council comprising a Chief Justice, four Associate Justices, and one Alternate. The Election Commissioners also fall under the Judicial Branch of Student Union. SU also publishes Bearings, the unofficial student handbook, and its supplemental website.\n\nThere is a large interest in A cappella music on campus, spawning groups such as After Dark, The Amateurs, The Aristocats, Deliverance, The Ghost Lights, The Greenleafs, More Fools Than Wise], The Mosaic Whispers, The Pikers, SensAsian, Staam, The Stereotypes, and Sur Awaaz. An umbrella organization known as ACAC (A Cappella Advisory Council) oversees auditions for its member groups each fall. Many of these groups are continually selected for national collegiate a cappella compilations, such as BOCA and Voices Only. The Stereotypes have also made it to the top 8 groups of the Midwest for the past three consecutive years in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella and represented the Midwest as its sole competitor at the International Competition at Lincoln Center in 2011 where they placed 4th and received the award for Outstanding Arrangement.\n\nAnother student-run music group, the Wash U Pops Orchestra (a.k.a. \"WU Pops\"), was founded in the '07-'08 school year in the spirit of traditional pops orchestras. It has grown significantly enough since founding to have spawned two chamber groups. The full orchestra performs at least once a semester, with the chamber groups performing many smaller gigs both on and off campus.\n\nThe University also has a Department of Music that, in addition to providing concentrated study for music majors, also provides instrument and voice lessons to students. There are also a number of instrumental groups and ensembles in which students may participate.\n\nOther student organizations, such as the Social Programming Board bring in popular musical acts for Walk In Lay Down and lesser-known independent performers. Recent WILD performers include Karmin, Chance the Rapper, Wolfgang Gartner, and Matt Kearney.\n\n75% of undergraduate students choose to live on campus. Housing is guaranteed for a student for all four years if a student chooses. Most of the dormitories on campus are located on the \"South 40\", named because of its adjacent location south of the Danforth Campus and its size of . It is the location of all the freshman dorms as well as several upperclassman dorms, which are occupied almost exclusively by sophomores. The majority of freshman dorms consist of double rooms; two double rooms share one connecting bathroom. Upperclass dorms are available in 4-person, 6-person, and 8-person suites and apartment-style units. All of the dorms are co-ed. In coming years, the University will be allowing upperclass students the option of mixed-gender housing, whereby any combination of males and females can live in the same suite if they so choose. The University is nearing the end of an era of replacing older residence halls with newer construction. In 2007, \"The Princeton Review\" rated Washington University in its top 20 list of schools whose dorms are \"like palaces.\"\n\nThe South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment where residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Wohl Student Center, the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, Cornerstone: The Center for Advanced Learning, University Police Headquarters, various student owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, \"Wash U Wash\", and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40. Also in 2007, \"The Princeton Review\" rated the University as 4th on its rankings for Best Quality of Life for students.\n\nThere are nearly 20 dining locations on the Washington University campus. In addition to a Subway restaurant, nearly all locations are operated by the catering service Bon Appétit Management Company. The cafeteria within the law school is operated by Aramark Corporation, and the Einstein Bros. Bagels branch within Simon Hall is independently operated. The University is one of the few that offer an abundance of Kosher food items available at the majority of dining locations on campus. The dining facilities and quality of food are consistently ranked highly by \"The Princeton Review\".\n\nResidences on the South Forty (\"the Forty\") are subdivided into smaller groups: residential colleges (\"res colleges\"). A live-in university staff member—the residential college director (\"RCD\")—organizes social events within his or her residential college, comprising several houses, administratively a single unit. When originally organized, residential colleges consisted of a freshman dormitory and an upperclassman dormitory, though, currently, only five of the nine meet these criteria. Within each residential college, an elected group of students plans community-building activities and events. The Congress of the South 40 oversees the residential college Councils and plans a popular event \"Residential College Olympics\" each spring.\n\nResidential Colleges include:\n\nEach Residential College includes the following amenities:\n\nThe South Forty Center is a mixed-use facility consisting of dining locations, a small auditorium, fitness center, convenience store, lounges, and residences on the upper floors. The dining location, known as Bear's Den, which includes stations such as the Cherry Tree Cafe (coffee and baked goods), Ciao Down (pasta and pizza), Grizzly Grill (burgers and other \"American-style\" food), WUrld Fusion (Indian inspired Global cuisine), L 'Chaim (fresh, Kosher meals), OSO Good (Mexican fare, such a tacos and burritos), and Sizzle & Stir (Mongolian-style stir-fry). The Center also features convenience store, \"Paws 'n' Go\". More commonly known to students as \"Bear Mart\", the store serves as a miniature grocery store, selling snacks, drinks, fresh fruit and vegetables, and frozen meals, as well as baking goods. The area also features a soup and salad bar. The South Forty Center also houses the work-out facilities for the South 40, as well as Residential Life and Dining Services offices, and student residences on the upper floors.\n\nAnother group of residences, known as the North Side, is located in the northwest corner of Danforth Campus. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites, as well as non-BLOC students. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn as well as its own student center.\n\nWashington University in St. Louis has eleven fraternities and eight sororities on-campus.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090221194530/http://www.washuifc.org/\n\n\nwww.wpa.wustl.edu\n\n\nThere are 11 a cappella groups on WashU's campus, specializing in everything from contemporary rock and pop music to jazz standards and Disney songs. A cappella groups on campus include After Dark, The Stereotypes, The Amateurs, The Pikers, The Mosaic Whispers, Sensasians, and the Greenleafs.\n\n"}

{"id": "11022472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11022472", "title": "Culturology", "text": "Culturology\n\nCulturology or science of culture is a branch of social sciences concerned with the scientific understanding, description, analysis, and prediction of cultures as a whole. While different cultural practices were studied by ethnology and anthropology, these studies included diverse aspects: sociological, psychological, etc. and the need was recognized in a discipline focused exclusively on cultural aspects. \nThe notion of culturology (), as an interdisciplinary branch of the humanities, may be traced in Russia to the late 1960s and associated with the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, Aleksei Losev, Sergey Averintsev, Georgy Gachev, Yuri Lotman, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, and others. This kind of research challenged Marxist socio–political approach to culture. \n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, culturology was reintroduced into the Higher Attestation Commission's list of specialties for which scientific degrees may be awarded in the Russian Federation and is now a compulsory object of study during the first year at institutions of higher education and in secondary schools. Defined as the study of human cultures, their integral systems, and their influence on human behavior, it may be formally compared to the Western discipline of cultural studies, although it has a number of important distinctions.\n\nFormation of Cultural Sciences in Russia is connected with the activities of the Soviet-Armenian scientist Edward S. Markarian (1929–2011) and his first research on cultural from 1960 to 1970, opening a new direction in science for the Soviet Union. Outside Russia, between 1980 and 1990, culturology in Russia received official recognition and was legalized as a form of science and a subject of study for institutions of higher learning.\nOver the past decade the Russian Federation has created the following basic cultural schools:\n\n\nFrom 1992, research was started by the Russian Institute for Cultural Research. Today, along the line of the central office located in Moscow, three branches have been opened RIC – Siberian (opened in 1993 in Omsk), St. Petersburg Department (opened in 1997) and the Southern Branch (opened in 2012 in Krasnodar)\n\nIn 1990, at the faculty of philosophy, a chair of the history and theory of world culture was created. Many prominent Soviet and Russian scholars like V. V. Ivanov, S. S. Averintsev, A. Y. Gurevich, M. L. Gasparov, G. S. Knabe, E. M. Miletinskiy, V. N. Romanov, T. V. Vasilyeva, N. V. Braginskaya, V. V. Bibikhin, Alexander Dobrokhotov have worked there.\n\nYuri Rozhdestvensky founded a school of Culturology at the Department of Language Studies of Moscow Lomonosov University. Rozhdestvensky's approach to the development of culture (accumulation and mutual influence of layers) can be compared to the approach used in media ecology.\n\nIn Anglophone contemporary social sciences the word \"culturology\" was coined by American anthropologist Leslie White, who defined it as a field dedicated to the study of culture and cultural systems. White notices that culturology was earlier known as \"science of culture\" as defined by English anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor in his book 1872 \"Primitive Culture\". White also notices that he introduced this term in 1939 and for the first time the term appeared in English dictionaries in 1954. He also remarks that the corresponding German term \"Kulturwissenschaft\" was introduced by Wilhelm Ostwald in 1909.\n\nFollowing White, philosopher of science Mario Bunge defined culturology as the sociological, economic, political, and historical study of concrete cultural systems. \"Synchronic culturology\" is said to coincide with the anthropology, sociology, economics, and political ideology of cultures. By contrast, \"diachronic culturology\" is a component of history. According to Bunge, \"scientific culturology\" also differs from traditional cultural studies as the latter are often the work of idealist literary critics or pseudo-philosophers ignorant of the scientific method and incompetent in the study of social facts and concrete social systems.\n\nBunge’s systemic and materialist approach to the study of culture has given birth to a variety of new fields of research in the social sciences. Fabrice Rivault, for instance, was the first scholar to formalize and propose international political culturology as a subfield of international relations in order to understand the global cultural system, as well as its numerous subsystems, and explain how cultural variables interact with politics and economics to impact world affairs. This scientific approach differs radically from culturalism, constructivism, and cultural postmodernism because it is based on logic, empiricism, systemism, and emergent materialism. International political culturology is being studied by scholars around the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "355735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355735", "title": "Education in Scotland", "text": "Education in Scotland\n\nEducation in Scotland is overseen by the Scottish Government and has a history of universal provision of public education, and the Scottish education system is distinctly different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom. The Scotland Act 1998 gives the Scottish Parliament legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland. Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the English, Welsh and Northern Irish systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of subjects.\n\nFollowing this, Scottish universities generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the ancient universities of Scotland issue a Master of Arts as the first degree in humanities. State schools are owned and operated by the local authorities which act as \"Education Authorities\", and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school). Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by Education Scotland (formerly Learning and Teaching Scotland). There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with such schools in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.\n\nQualifications at the secondary school and post-secondary (further education) level are provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the Scottish Parliament and the Learning Directorate. Inspections and audits of educational standards are conducted by three bodies: Care Inspectorate inspects care standards in pre-school provision; Education Scotland (formerly Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education) for pre-school, primary, education, further and community education; with the Scottish office of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA Scotland) responsible for higher education.\n\nIn 2014, research by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, above countries like Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg, with roughly 40% of Scots aged 16–64 educated to NVQ level 4 and above.\n\nChildren start primary school aged between 4½ and 5½ depending on when the child's birthday falls. Scottish school policy places all those born between March of a given year and February of the following year in the same year group. Children born between March and August start school in August at between 5½ and 5 years old, and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4 years 11 months and 4½ years old. The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK, however, as parents of children born between September and December can decide to defer for 1 year (but may or may not receive a funded nursery place in the deferral year), whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August, with guaranteed nursery funding. This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre (formerly known as nursery).\n\nPupils remain at primary school for seven years. Then aged eleven or twelve, they start secondary school for a compulsory four years with the following two years being optional. In Scotland, pupils sit National 4/5 exams (previously Standard Grade or Intermediate exams) at the age of fifteen/sixteen, normally for between 6 and eight subjects including compulsory exams in English and Mathematics. A Science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and a Social Subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies) were also compulsory, but this was changed in accordance with the new curriculum. It is now required by the Scottish Parliament for students to have two hours of physical education a week; each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is generally sixteen (after completion of National 4/5s), after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Higher and/or Advanced Higher exams.\n\nA small number of students at certain private, independent schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSE instead of National 4/5s (Standard Grades), and towards A and AS-Levels instead of (or alongside) Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The International Baccalaureate has also been introduced in some independent schools.\n\nThe table below lists rough equivalences with the year system in the rest of the United Kingdom (For England and Wales, the equivalence given is for children born before 1 September; the equivalence for those born from September to February [December for deferred pupils] is given in brackets):\n\nGovernment funded schools are free for children aged 5–19. In many cases, this applies to children of international post-graduate students, and other immigrants.\n\nThe age ranges specify the youngest age for a child entering that year and the oldest age for a child leaving that year. Playgroup can be described as a daycare centre for toddlers, then children may go on to attend an early years centre as soon as they have passed their third birthday, and progress to Primary 1 in the August of the year in which they turn five. \n\nIn general, the cut-off point for ages is the end of February, so all children must be of a certain age on 1 March to begin class in August. \n\nAll parents of children born between September and February (i.e. still 4 years old on the school start date) are entitled to defer entry to Primary School if they believe their child is not ready for school.\n\nOnly children whose birthdays fall in January or February will be considered for funding for a subsequent year at an early years centre, unless there are special circumstances.\n\nChildren may leave school once they reach their statutory school leaving date; this is dependent on date of birth. For children born between 1 March and 30 September, this date is 31 May of their 4th year of secondary school. For children born between 1 October and 28 February, the last day of June is the first date they may leave school if they have a placement at college and the school have signed the health & safety forms.\n\nWhich high school the children go to depends on the area where they live, known as the \"catchment area\", which has a specific high school that takes children who live in that area.\n\nParents can also apply for a placement request if they would like their child to attend a school outside their catchment area and a panel will decide if the child is the most worthy (out of all placing requests) to take one of the spaces left after all children from the catchment area have been taken.\n\nThe table below lists list the numbers of children, schools and teachers in all publicly funded schools:\nHome education is also legal in Scotland. Parents wishing to home educate do not need the permission of the Local Authority unless the children are already registered at a school. There are no exact numbers available for children being educated at home in Scotland.\n\nWithin the Scottish Government, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills has overall responsibility for education provision in Scotland. The Cabinet Secretary is assisted by three junior ministers, currently the Minister for Childcare and Early Years, the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science and the Minister for Employability and Training. \n\nIn 2003, work began on an education reform programme, to produce a new \"Curriculum for Excellence\" that would replace existing guidance on the school curriculum. Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish secondary schools from school session 2012–2013.\n\nIn 2017, new reforms were introduced moving control over curriculum and schools more towards head teachers and parents.\n\nProgression in Qualifications\nThe vast majority of Scottish pupils take Scottish Qualifications Certificate qualifications provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). Generally, most pupils take National 4/5s (previously Standard Grades, but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and Highers in S5. The number of National 4/5 qualifications a pupil enters can vary drastically depending on the individual, with the most common number of National 5s taken, per pupil, in 2017 being 6, however some may choose to untertake as few as one or two, or as many as eight or nine. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and Advanced Highers (formerly CSYS) in S6 can be taken. Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 qualifications – were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively, but in practice (although may vary from subject to subject), Intermediate 1 was easier than General, and Intermediate 2 harder than Credit – can also be taken in lieu of any of the aforementioned qualifications.\n\nPupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities where degrees are normally four years long; however, recently it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers. The majority of English universities, the most popular choice for Scottish students who wish to study university degrees outside of Scotland, require Advanced Higher qualification levels as these are deemed by the English universities to be most similar to A-levels.\n\nAll educational qualifications in Scotland are part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.\n\nIn 2015, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge which aims to achieve equity in educational outcomes throughout Scotland. The Scottish Government envisages equity being achieved by ensuring every child has the same opportunity to succeed, with a particular focus on closing the poverty-related attainment gap. It is underpinned by national Scottish educational policies such as Curriculum for Excellence, Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) as well as the National Improvement Framework. The attainment challenge focuses and accelerates targeted improvement activity in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing in specific areas of Scotland, known as \"challenge authorities\" (those councils with a higher percentage of children growing up in poverty and deprivation). At a cost of £750 million to the Scottish Government through the Attainment Scotland Fund, the challenge is a targeted initiative focused on supporting pupils in the local authorities of Scotland with the highest concentrations of deprivation. Currently, the nine 'Challenge Authorities' are Glasgow City Council, Dundee City Council, Inverclyde, West Dunbartonshire, North Ayrshire, Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.\n\nOn 1 February 2017 the share each primary and secondary school will receive for the academic year 2017–2018 from the Scottish Government's £120 million Pupil Equity Funding was announced by the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills John Swinney. This funding is provided through the Attainment Scotland Fund and allocated directly to schools, targeted at those children most affected by the poverty related attainment gap.\n\nThere is not a set name for secondary schools in Scotland, but whatever they might be called, with just a few specific exceptions in mainly rural or island authorities, state secondary schools in Scotland are fully comprehensive and non-selective. Amongst the state-run secondary schools:\n\n\nOther schools include The Community School of Auchterarder, Auchterarder, Perth and Kinross; The Nicolson Institute, Stornoway, Western Isles; North Walls Community School on Hoy, Orkney Islands and Wester Hailes Education Centre, Wester Hailes, Edinburgh. All of these are, equally, fully comprehensive non-selective schools, differing only in designation from all other state secondary schools in Scotland.\n\nThe vast majority of schools are non-denominational, and include the parish schools, pioneered by the Church of Scotland and other Protestant Churches, which became state schools in 1872. Religious education is taught in non-denominational schools and in denominational schools. Of over 2,500 schools in Scotland, there are 366 state schools which are Roman Catholic, three Episcopalian and one Jewish. The Education (Scotland) Act 1918 brought Roman Catholic schools within the State education system, ensuring the promotion of a Roman Catholic ethos within such schools.\n\nVocational education is provided in Further Education Colleges and through apprenticeships. Due to the growing surplus of university graduates in many fields of study, along with that of lower level apprentices, higher level apprenticeships are seen as providing the lowest risk of unemployment or underemployment. Skills Development Scotland has introduced \"Graduate Level Apprenticeships\" in order to promote this option.\n\nMusic education is available at several levels. Formal music education begins at 4½ years and can progress as high as postgraduate studies. Music education can take place within a Scottish Music school; through a music service or privately.\n\nSome schools in Scotland provide education given in the Scottish Gaelic language. They are mainly located in the main cities of Scotland and in areas with higher amounts of Gaelic speakers. Gaelic medium education is becoming increasingly popular throughout Scotland, and the number of pupils who are in Gaelic medium education at primary school level has risen from 24 in 1985, to 2500 in the 2012–13 school year.\n\nThere are fifteen universities in Scotland and three other institutions of higher education which have the authority to award academic degrees. The oldest is St. Andrews, which was founded in 1413. Three other \"ancient universities\", Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, date from before 1600. The University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) gained full university status in 2011, having been created through the federation of 13 colleges and research institutions across the Highlands and Islands, a process that began in 2001.\n\nAll Scottish universities have the power to award degrees at all levels: undergraduate, taught postgraduate, and doctoral. Education in Scotland is controlled by the Scottish Government under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. The minister responsible for higher education is the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, currently Angela Constance MSP of the Scottish National Party. University status in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom today is conferred by the Privy Council which takes advice from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.\n\nAll Scottish universities are public universities and funded by the Scottish Government (through its Scottish Funding Council) and financial support is provided for Scottish-domiciled students by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Students ordinarily resident in Scotland or the European Union do not pay tuition fees for their first undergraduate degree, but tuition fees are charged for those from the rest of the United Kingdom. All students are required to pay tuition fees for postgraduate education (e.g. MSc, PhD), except in certain priority areas funded by the Scottish Government, or if another source of funding can be found (e.g. research council studentship for a PhD). A representative body called Universities Scotland works to promote Scotland's universities, as well as six other higher education institutions.\n\nThe university sector in Scotland had a total income of £3.5 billion in 2014/15 with the Scottish Government giving approximately £623 million in funding for individual university student support. The Scottish Funding Council contributing £1.1 billion of public money to the fifteen universities, this was a six per cent reduction since 2010/11.\nIn 2014–15, approximately 232,570 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56% were female and 44% male, with 66% being domiciled in Scotland, 12% from the rest of the United Kingdom, 9% from the EU and the remaining 13% being international students. Of all these, approximately 76% were studying for their first degree (i.e. undergraduate level) and 24% for a taught postgraduate degree (primarily a master's degree) or a doctoral research degree (primarily PhD). The remainder were mostly on other programmes such as Higher National Diploma. 16,000 students were studying in Scotland with The Open University via distance-learning, and the Open University teaches 40 per cent of Scotland's part-time undergraduates.\n\nIn the 2016–17 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, five Scottish universities are among the top 200 worldwide: University of Edinburgh (at 27), University of Glasgow (at 88), University of St. Andrews (at =110), University of Dundee (at =180), and the University of Aberdeen (at =188).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10674678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10674678", "title": "Emergent curriculum", "text": "Emergent curriculum\n\nEmergent curriculum is a philosophy of teaching and way of planning curriculum that focuses on being responsive to children's interests to create meaningful learning experiences. It can be practiced at any grade level. This philosophy prioritizes active participation, relationship building, flexible and adaptable methods, inquiry, and play-based learning. Curriculum is child-initiated, collaborative and responsive to the children's needs. Proponents of this style of teaching advocate that knowledge of the children is the key to success in your program (Cassidy, Mims, Rucker, & Boone, 2003; Crowther, 2005).\n\nTo plan an emergent curriculum requires observation, documentation, creative brainstorming, flexibility and patience. Rather than starting with a lesson plan which requires a “hook” to get the children interested, emergent curriculum starts with the observation of the children for insight into their interests. Additionally, content is influenced by values held for the children's learning by the school, community, family and culture (MachLachlan, 2013). The classroom typically consists of learning centres that expand and facilitate children's learning (Crowther, 2005) and encourage independent learning skills (MachLachlan, 2013).\n\nTeachers who employ emergent curriculum understand that the trajectory of learning happens as a consequence of the children's genuine interest, response, and connection to the subject (Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011, MachLachlan et al., 2013). In order for this to happen, the teacher must consider their position as a facilitator in the classroom. This role involves careful observations of the children and their play as well as flexibility and creativity in order to develop learning opportunities that align with their interests (Cassidy et al., 2003; Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2009a/2011b; Machlachlan et al., 2013; Wein, 2008; Wright, 1997). Carolyn Edwards notes: “The teachers honestly do not know where the group will end up. Although this openness adds a dimension of difficulty to their work, it also makes it more exciting.” (Edwards, Gandini & Foreman, 1993, pp. 159). Teachers in these settings act as researchers who are constantly learning in their roles by collecting data, implementing strategies and assessing their outcomes (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Success in implementing emergent curriculum requires a curious disposition about children and their learning (Stacey, 2009).\n\nIt is the role of the teacher to be a participant-observer in the children's play (Wright, 1997). These programs give power to children's voices and are consistently scaffolding their learning (Stacey, 2009). The teacher is constantly going through the process of observing and documenting, planning learning experiences, implementing plans, documenting and beginning the cycle again (Crowther, 2005; MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009a/ 2011b). In these types of settings, a few educational initiatives are often implemented by teachers. For example, learning is viewed as a process-oriented experience where children are praised for their effort over final product (Stacey, 2011; Wright, 1997). Additionally, children in these settings are given options and choice about how they wish to spend their time, activities and learning centres they wish to participate in and how they engage in organized activities (Stacey, 2009). This is believed to develop curiosity, initiative, self-direction and persistence (MachLachlan et al., 2013).\n\nBecause the curriculum is continually changing, developing and growing, teachers need to ensure that they make time to reflect on their observations and strategies implemented (Stacey 2009a/2011b). One way to engage in reflection is through discussion with colleagues (Stacey, 2009). Reflection allows the teacher to think about what happens next in the child's learning, how to proceed, and what to look for in future observations (Stacey, 2011). It is important for teachers to be aware of their own knowledge and where it is lacking, as this type of environment can lead to investigations in an unlimited number of directions (Crowther, 2005). Teachers are also individuals with interests and passions, and sharing these with the class can provide a great opportunity to model knowledge and enthusiasm (MachLachlan et al., 2013).\n\nThese programs are meant to be culturally responsive and inclusive in nature, so that all children are able to work at their own pace (Crowther, 2005). To help facilitate this, teachers follow the children's lead, expand on their interests, provide meaningful and developmentally appropriate materials, and promote independent learning skills (Crowther, 2005; Stacey, 2009; Wien, 2008).\n\nOnce teachers see an interest “emerging” they brainstorm ways to study the topic in depth. From these observations and brainstorming, the teacher comes up activities that compliment and build upon the emerging interest, with opportunities for play at multiple ability levels. Once activities have been implemented, the teacher observes the children's use of them, constantly modifying them to accommodate increasing interest or change in direction of the learning. The teacher documents these observations and reflects on the effectiveness of the activities. Then the process begins again. The teacher may be at different levels of this planning cycle for multiple activities or learning outcomes at once (Cassidy et al., 2003; Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2009a/2011b; Machlachlan et al., 2013; Wein, 2008; Wright, 1997).\n\nIn these settings, learning plans are often more of a loose outline because, in order for the program to be successful, there is often spontaneous deterrence from plans to support engagement (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Webbing is often used because of its flexible nature. A web doesn’t show everything that will be learned, it shows many things that could be learned as well as connections to curriculum expectations (MachLachlan et al., 2013). However, it is important to use the web as a tool to open the teacher to possibilities not a “plan.” Teachers brainstorm many possibilities for study sparked from the particular interest, not as a plan but more as a ‘road map’ as one teacher put it:\nTo get a plan, we chose an idea and brainstormed ways that children could play it – hands-on activities we could provide. Putting all the activities on a web gives you a road map full of possible journeys. (Jones p. 129)\n\nAn idea for a curriculum topic may be sparked by things, people, events in the environment, issues that arise in the classroom, etc. (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). For instance, a teacher may overhear a group of students having a discussion about bugs that leads to the class sitting down and coming up with a web topic that explores all the possible directions the class could go in their quest to learn all they can about the topic of bugs. Ideas may also be sparked by offering experiences such as taking a walk through the neighborhood, visiting local businesses, or reading books.\n\nThese classrooms are often organized into core curriculum areas, where activities may have a curricular theme while following student interest (Crowther, 2005). For example, while students are demonstrating an interest in restaurants, the literacy area may allow opportunity to write customer orders while the math area may have plastic money for the children to experiment with. These centres are meant to encourage active participation with the content (Crowther, 2005). In emergent curriculum settings, there should be opportunity to involve all the senses, challenge creativity, hear and use oral and written language, explore art media, practice solving interpersonal problems, conduct investigations and ask questions, explore and order material, and acquire various physical skills (Crowther, 2005; MachLachlan et al., 2013; Wright, 1997).\n\nTeachers see learning as a process through which children first engage in exploration and physical action which then leads to mastery of skills (MachLachlan et al., 2013). Some researchers argue that this method of planning is more effective for learning because it relies on the intrinsic motivation of students, therefore facilitating increased engagement with the material (Stacey, 2011). However, because of this, it is normal to have multiple children or groups interested in completely different content (Stacey 2009a/2011b). This makes documentation and preparation very important.\n\nEmergent learning classrooms still maintain much of the structure of a regular classroom. It is important for children to still experience schedule and organization. Therefore, in these classrooms you will often still find large and small group instructional times, but the implementation of them is more flexible (Stacey 2009a/2011b).\n\nBecause emergent curriculum programs emphasize independence and persistence in their programs, learning centres are typically set up in very particular ways. Items and materials that are stored are easily accessible to the children visually and physically. Things are usually labeled with words and pictures to assist children, and clear storage containers are preferred (Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2011).\n\nStudents can be seen working in a variety of social environments. The learning environment should offer opportunities to work in groups of all different sizes, as well as individually (Crowther, 2005). Students are also given opportunities to experience materials in different ways, such as quiet reading corners and dramatic play areas (Stacey, 2011)\n\n\"Montessori\" and \"Reggio Emilia\" schools are two varieties of school that use emergent curriculum.\n\nDocumentation is a very important and very time consuming aspect of this type of programming (Stacey, 2011). Because teachers are held accountable to parents, licensing boards and colleagues, it is necessary that thorough documentation is kept (Crowther, 2005; Stacey, 2009).\n\nBecause of the reliance on observational methods to inform planning and assessment, it is crucial for teachers to have strategies in place to expedite the process. Some examples of tools use by teachers are sticky notes, observation baskets around the room to collect small anecdotal notes, file folder systems for each student or area of the classroom, clipboards, digital recorders, photography, and video and audiotaping. These methods allow learning to become visually represented and are good for reflection and validation of methods (Stacey, 2009).\n\nThese strategies can be effective in ensuring proper assessment procedures (Cassidy et al., 2003). The use of student portfolios can be a great way to assess learning and share it with parents/guardians (Stacey 2009a/2011b). Additionally, the use of pre populated data collection sheets can be helpful to keep good records (Stacey, 2011)\n\nUse of webs and other graphic organizers can be a good way to demonstrate how the students are being exposed to curriculum expectations and brainstorm related ideas (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Keeping track of interest paths that develop in the classroom can help teachers demonstrate the process of learning, revise and reflect on it and develop future directions (Stacey, 2009).\n\nEach learning or interest centre in the classroom usually has its own plan, as well as activities facilitated by the teacher (Stacey, 2011).\n\nEmergent curriculum involved students being collaborative partners in their learning (Stacey, 2009), therefore it is important to incorporate children in displaying and documenting their learning (; Stacey, 2009; Wright, 1997). Some strategies teachers can use for this are audio and visual recordings, samples of children's work, photos, learning logs, and display boards (Stacey, 2009). These approaches can help students develop pride in their work, show off skills to parents/guardians, and display their interests (Crowther, 2005). These processes are not static, rather these projects grow as learning develops (Crowther, 2005).\n\n"}

{"id": "2231314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231314", "title": "Filippo Taglioni", "text": "Filippo Taglioni\n\nFilippo Taglioni (aka Philippe Taglioni; 5 November 1777 – 11 February 1871) was an Italian dancer and choreographer and personal teacher to his own daughter, the famous Romantic ballerina Marie Taglioni. (He had another child who also danced ballet, Paul Taglioni.) Also, although August Bournonville's version is better known, it was Taglioni who was the original choreographer of \"La Sylphide\", in 1832.\n\nBorn in Milan to father Carlo, he received his dance training predominantly with Carlo Blasis and Jean-François Coulon. He made his dancing debut at age 17 in Pisa performing female roles. He danced in other Italian cities before becoming a dancer (at age 22) with the Paris Opera. With Vestris firmly in control there, he readily accepted an invitation to be a principal dancer and ballet master for the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nIn Stockholm, he married the dancer Sophie Karsten, daughter of a famous Swedish opera singer Christoffer Christian Karsten and the Polish actress Sophie Stebnowska, in 1803. Together, they had two children, Marie Taglioni and Paul Taglioni, both of whom became dancers themselves.\n\nFor several years the family lived in Vienna and Germany but to escape the dangers of the Napoleonic wars, Filippo moved them to Paris. He danced and choreographed throughout Europe, mostly in Italy, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Finally, he was invited to take a more permanent position with the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna.\n\nOnce settled in Vienna, he sent for Marie, who had been studying ballet in Paris. Upon her arrival, Filippo was discouraged by her artistic progress and began training her himself. He had her practice ballet six hours a day for six months, using a level method of technique training. He was very strict with her, and had no sympathy for her aching and bleeding toes. He sought to make her style light and delicate, with an emphasis on jumps with \"ballon\" and pointe work, something that was unheard of before this time. When she was ready he took her back to Paris.\n\nAfter Marie's professional debut she became so popular that Filippo was able to negotiate a six-year contract for the two of them. The triumphant première of \"La Sylphide\" on 12 March 1832, made her the most acclaimed prima ballerina of the Romantic period and him the most renowned choreographer of the day. It is said that the great Romantic period of dance was ushered in on that night. Because of this immense success, the two of them traveled widely together and toured both Europe and Russia.\n\nAs he grew older, he became eccentric and unpredictable, and eventually lost all of Marie's carefully amassed fortune in unwise speculations. Nevertheless, he must be recognized as a pioneer in a ballet style that was to alter forever the very nature of the art.\n\nTaglioni died in Como, Italy on 5 February 1871, at the age of 93.\n\nThe ballet-going public knows the Romantic ballet \"La Sylphide\" as being choreographed by the Danish ballet master August Bournonville. That is indeed the \"La Sylphide\" audiences are most familiar with today but was not the version given in 1832.\n\nThe original production of \"La Sylphide\" was first presented by the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier in 1832, and was choreographed by Filippo Taglioni himself to the music of Jean Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer, with libretto by Adolphe Nourrit after a story by Charles Nodier. The leading roles were danced by Marie Taglioni and Joseph Mazilier.\n\nBournonville originally intended to stage the 1832 version in Denmark, but the Paris Opéra demanded too high a price for the orchestral parts of Schneitzhoeffer's score. In light of this, Bournonville decided to stage his own version of \"La Sylphide\" on the same scenario, with a new score by Herman Severin Løvenskiold. The production premiered in 1836 with the prodigy Lucile Grahn and Bournonville in the principal roles. Due to the strong tradition of the Royal Danish Ballet this version is still being performed in Denmark to this day, and has since been staged throughout the world.\n\nIn 1972 the ballet master Pierre Lacotte revived Filippo Talgioni's original \"La Sylphide\" for the Paris Opera Ballet, with the noted ballerina Ghislaine Thesmar as the Sylph. Schneitzhoeffer's original score was reconstructed from a manuscript held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. As Taglioni's original choreography was lost long ago, Lacotte choreographed the ballet in the style of the epoch. The Paris Opera Ballet has since released the production onto DVD/video twice.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28248191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28248191", "title": "Funding bias", "text": "Funding bias\n\nFunding bias, also known as sponsorship bias, funding outcome bias, funding publication bias, and funding effect, refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study's financial sponsor. This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies. Funding bias has been associated, in particular, with research into chemical toxicity, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs. It is an instance of experimenter's bias.\n\nThe psychology text \"\" describes the act of reciprocity as a trait in which a person feels obliged to return favors. This trait is embodied in all human cultures. Human nature may influence even the most ethical researchers to be affected by their sponsors, although they may genuinely deny it.\n\nScientific malpractice involving shoddy research or data manipulation does occur in rare instances. Often, however, the quality of manufacturers' studies are at least as good as studies that were not funded by a special interest. Therefore, bias usually occurs for other reasons.\n\nResearch results can be selected or discarded to support a predetermined conclusion. The tobacco industry, for example, would publish their own internal research that invariably found minimal adverse health effects of passive smoking.\n\nA company that hires researchers to perform a study may require the researchers to sign a nondisclosure agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor. The sponsor may fund several studies at the same time, suppressing results found contrary to their business interests while publicizing the results that support their interests. Indeed, a review of pharmaceutical studies revealed that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published, but the drug-company-funded research that was published was more likely to report outcomes favorable to the sponsor.\n\nA double-blind study with only objective measures is less likely to be biased to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind.\n\nScientist researcher Anders Sandberg writes that funding bias may be a form of publication bias. Because it is easier to publish positive results than inconclusive or no results, positive results may be correlated with being positive for the sponsor.\n\nOutcome reporting bias is related to publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple outcomes are measured but only the significant outcomes are reported, while insignificant or unfavorable outcomes are ignored.\n\nSelection bias may result in a non-representative population of test subjects in spite of best efforts to obtain a representative sample. Even a double-blind study may be subject to biased selection of dependent variables, population (via inclusion and exclusion criteria), sample size, statistical methods, or inappropriate comparators, any of which can bias the outcome of a study to favor a particular conclusion.\n\n\n\n"}

A desire to reduce suffering, save lives and maintain human dignity is central to understanding humanitarian education. It is based on the assumption that people have an innate desire to help others, so is centrally concerned with our shared humanity.\n\nHumanitarian education is an area of learning that concentrates on the desire or impulse to save lives, protect human dignity and reduce suffering. It particularly relates to offering assistance to others in an emergency or crisis and is also used to refer to the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed for individuals and communities to help themselves. In the UK it may appear within curriculum subjects such as citizenship and Personal, Social and Health Education. It began to be developed and encouraged in the UK by the British Red Cross during 2005.\n\nThe goal of humanitarian education is that communities increase their resilience and that individuals and groups are more confident, able and willing to help themselves and others when faced with a crisis.\n\nBy exploring crisis situations humanitarian education enables students to recognise that people can overcome adversity. It develops their understanding of humanitarian issues, the skills that build resilience and encourages them to intervene to support others in crisis.\n\nThe way in which educators explore with students any topic, issue or event must be within the framework of the principles of humanity and impartiality. It does not directly address causes and explicitly avoids exploring political, religious, social class, nationality, economic, environmental or other factors that might contribute to or create a crisis.\n\nIts origins in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement mean that humanitarian education is sometimes confused with development education or global education, or simply teaching about the work of aid or development NGOs. Adherents also stress that humanitarian education is philosophically and practically distinct from human rights education, since the humanitarian impulse is founded on needs rather than rights or entitlement.\n\nHumanitarian education is linked to, but distinct from, education about international humanitarian law, often referred to as the laws of war. Aspects of IHL are often topics within humanitarian education.\n\n\n"}

Daalder (born March 2, 1960 in The Hague, Netherlands), has served as President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs since July, 2013. He was the U.S. Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) from May 2009 to July 2013. He is a specialist in European security. He was a member of the staff of United States National Security Council (NSC) during the administration of President Bill Clinton, and was one of the foreign policy advisers to President Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nDaalder was educated at the University of Kent, Oxford University, and Georgetown University, and received his Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nHe was fellow at Harvard University's Center for Science and International Affairs and the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. He received a Pew Faculty Fellowship in International Affairs and an International Affairs Fellowship of the Council on Foreign Relations. Daalder was an associate professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs, where he was also director of research at the Center for International and Security Studies. He was a Senior Fellow in foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution from 1997 to 2009, where he was a specialist in European security, transatlantic relations, and national security affairs.\n\nIn 1995–1997, Daalder served as a director for European Affairs on the National Security Council staff under President Bill Clinton, where he was responsible for coordinating U.S. policy toward Bosnia. From 1998–2001, Daalder served as a member of the Study Group of the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century (the Hart-Rudman Commission), a multi-year examination of U.S. national security requirements and institutions.\n\nOn March 11, 2009, President Obama nominated Daalder to become the United States Permanent Representative to NATO, a post commonly referred to as \"U.S. Ambassador to NATO\".\n\nOne of the issues that Daalder has addressed is the lack of communication on security issues between NATO and the European Union. In October 2010 he wrote in the \"International Herald Tribune\": \"NATO and E.U. capabilities need to be in synch, and their operations need to be complementary. We should regularly engage in a robust and transparent exchange of views on a wide range of shared interests. Policy should support work in the field; those in harm's way shouldn't have to work around our failures in Brussels.\"\n\nDaalder was U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO in February 2011 when the Libyan Civil War began with uprisings against Muammar Gaddafi in several cities, followed by a military crackdown by the Gaddafi regime. On March 17, 2011, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling upon the international community to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians in Libya. On March 19, following UN authorization, the United States led a coalition of allied countries, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom, launching air strikes against Gaddafi's forces, destroying his air defense system and imposing a no-fly zone and a naval blockade to prevent shipments of arms.\n\nFollowing this first success, Daalder led the U.S. efforts to persuade NATO to take over command and control of the operation. On March 27, the North Atlantic Council voted unanimously to take charge of what became known as Operation Unified Protector. The Operation had three missions; to police the arms embargo, to patrol the no-fly zone, and to protect civilians. Fourteen NATO allies took part in the actual operations, along with contingents from Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. In Libya, unlike other military intervention in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States played a largely supporting role, providing intelligence, aerial surveillance and refueling, while other NATO allies, including France, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Belgium, flew most of the bombing missions.\n\nThe first two missions were quickly put into place, but, due to the presence of Gaddafi forces in or near civilian areas, NATO was unable to strike with full force. By August 2011, however, the opposition forces were strong enough to seize Tripoli and within two months had taken control of the entire country. On October 23, 2011–233 days after Operation Unified Protector had begun—the NATO North Atlantic Council declared its mission complete.\n\nIn February 2012, Daalder and Admiral James Stavridis, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, wrote their own verdict on the operation in \"Foreign Affairs\": \"NATO's operation in Libya has rightly been hailed as a model intervention. The alliance responded rapidly to a deteriorating situation that threatened hundreds of thousands of civilians rebelling against an oppressive regime. It succeeded in protecting those civilians and, ultimately, in providing the time and space for local forces to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. And it did so by involving partners in the region and sharing the burden among the alliance's partners\".\n\nIn July 2013, Daalder became President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs – an independent, nonpartisan think tank that convenes leading global voices, conducts independent research, and engages the public to provide insights and influence the public discourse on critical global issues. Under Daalder, the Council has extended the reach and relevance of its global work by increasing its roster of experts and portfolio of issues; extending the Council's historic platform for global leaders to engage the public; building a global audience by connecting through digital and social media channels; revitalizing the Council's brand; and growing its financial, foundation, and membership support. Daalder also conceived and spearheaded the 2015 Chicago Forum on Global Cities, a now annual conference in partnership with the Financial Times that convenes leaders and delegates from around the world for a cross-sector exploration of the influence and impact of global cities in shaping the world's future. Following this rapid growth, the Council was ranked the top \"Think Tank to Watch\" by the University of Pennsylvania's 2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1850132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850132", "title": "Kansas evolution hearings", "text": "Kansas evolution hearings\n\nThe Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, United States from May 5 to 12, 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the Board of Education with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the Teach the Controversy method.\n\nThe hearings raised the issues of creation and evolution in public education and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities.\n\nThe Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.\n\nLocal science advocacy group Kansas Citizens for Science organized a boycott of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings.\n\nKansas Board of Education member Kathy Martin declared at the beginning of the hearings, \"Evolution has been proven false. ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts.\" At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is \"an unproven, often disproven\" theory. \"ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic,\" asserted Martin.\n\nThe scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the United States National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying \"Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.\" (See also List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design)\n\nOn February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.\n\nThe hearings were one of a number of Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns that sought to establish new science education standards consistent with conservative Christian beliefs, both in the state and nationwide, and reverse what they saw as a domination in science education by actual science, specifically the scientific theory of evolution, which they viewed as atheistic, in direct conflict to their religious beliefs.\n\nKansas Board of Education elections in 2004 gave religious conservatives a 6-4 majority. In 2005, prompted by the Kansas Intelligent Design Network and the Discovery Institute, the board sought new high school science standards. The revisions did not entirely eliminate evolution from instruction, but presented it as a theory greatly challenged and disputed, in line with the Discovery Institute's Teach the Controversy campaign. The new standards presented intelligent design as an alternative to evolution through the Institute's \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\". Board member Connie Morris sent a taxpayer-funded newsletter to constituents calling evolution an \"age-old fairy tale\" that was defended with \"anti-God contempt and arrogance.\" Describing herself as a Christian who believes in a literal interpretation of Genesis, Morris wrote that evolution was \"biologically, genetically, mathematically, chemically, metaphysically and etc. wildly and utterly impossible.\"\n\nThe Intelligent Design Network originally proposed over 20 pages of revisions to the science standards. Their proposals were rejected by the science standards committee (made up of Kansas scientists and educators) appointed by the Board of Education, and were also rejected by 12 independent scientists who reviewed the proposed revisions.\n\nEach side was invited to provide witnesses to testify before the board for intelligent design or evolution, with the taxpayers of Kansas covering the travel expenses. The scientific community refused to participate \"en masse\". The pro-intelligent design group, the Intelligent Design Network, invited 22 witnesses. Among these were a number of non-scientists, and a number of scientists with no professional experience in biology.\n\nOn November 8, 2005 the Kansas Board of Education approved the following changes to its science standards:\n\n\nIn addition to the over 70 scientific societies, institutions and other scientific professional groups that have issued statements supporting evolution education and opposing intelligent design, the Kansas Board of Education was presented a letter from 38 Nobel laureates, the \"Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Nobel Laureates Initiative\", calling upon the Board of Education to reject intelligent design and support the teaching of evolution. It stated: \n\nLogically derived from confirmable evidence, evolution is understood to be the result of an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection. As the foundation of modern biology, its indispensable role has been further strengthened by the capacity to study DNA. In contrast, intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent.\n\nThe Discovery Institute has consistently insisted that its \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" lesson plan is not another attempt to open the door of public high school science classrooms for intelligent design, and hence supernatural explanations. Discovery Institute spokesman Casey Luskin in February 2006 coined the term \"false fear syndrome\" of those who said it was, and said:\n\nThis is simply another instance of Darwinists attempting to oppose critical analysis of evolution by pretending that it is equivalent to teaching intelligent design. This is a political tactic based upon misinformation, misrepresentation, emotions, and false fears.\n\nIn response, Nick Matzke says that it has proved that \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" is a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label.\n\nThe Kansas science standards as proposed by the Discovery Institute and adopted by the state were said to be \"ID in disguise\" by an assistant of a Discovery Institute Fellow, confirming the criticisms of opponents to the standards. In discussing Discovery Institute radio commercials supporting their campaign airing in Kansas on the blog of William A. Dembski, Dembski's research assistant and co-moderator of the site, Joel Borofsky, said:\n\nTo the statement that the Kansas science standards had nothing to do with intelligent design but were only about teaching evolution in a \"balanced\" way, Borofsky responded: \n\nIt really is ID in disguise. The entire purpose behind all of this is to shift it into schools ... at least that is the hope/fear among some science teachers in the area. The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause ... which is what the Kansas board is attempting to do. When you do that, you have to invoke the idea of ID.\n\nIn response to the reception to his comments, Dembski's research assistant issued a clarification, stating that he was only voicing his personal opinion, not that of others in the movement, and that he is Dembski's \"assistant on theological work, not necessarily the ID movement.\"\n\nThe Discovery Institute continues to deny allegations that its true agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when ABC News asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying \"I don't think we want to go down that path.\"\n\nBoth the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Teachers Association spoke out against the new science standards; in addition to separate statements from each opposing the standards, the two groups issued a joint statement that the new Kansas standards are improved, but as currently written, they overemphasize controversy in the theory of evolution and distort the definition of science. The National Academy of Sciences and National Science Teachers Association offered to work with the board to resolve these issues so the state standards could use text from the National Research Council's \"National Science Education Standards\" and National Science Teachers Association's \"Pathways to Science Standards\", though they ultimately declined to grant use of the text due to Kansas State Board of Education members insisting on language \"emphasizing controversy in the theory of evolution\" and \"distorting the definition of science.\"\n\nThe position of the scientific community is that there is no controversy to teach, that evolution is widely accepted within the scientific community as a valid, well-supported theory and that such disagreements that do exist are about the details of evolution's mechanisms, not the validity of evolution itself.\n\nFor example, the National Association of Biology Teachers in a statement endorsing evolution as noncontroversial quoted Theodosius Dobzhansky \"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\" and went on to state that the quote \"accurately reflects the central, unifying role of evolution in biology. The theory of evolution provides a framework that explains both the history of life and the ongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and changes.\" They emphasized that \"Scientists have firmly established evolution as an important natural process\" and that \"The selection of topics covered in a biology curriculum should accurately reflect the principles of biological science. Teaching biology in an effective and scientifically honest manner requires that evolution be taught in a standards-based instructional framework with effective classroom discussions and laboratory experiences.\"\n\nThe hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture, played a central role in bringing about the Kansas evolution hearings, first by supporting ID proponents in their bids for seats on the board, and later in aggressively lobbying for a \"Teach the Controversy\" solution. Teach the Controversy is a controversial political-action campaign originating from the Discovery Institute that seeks to advance an education policy for US public schools that introduces intelligent design to public school science curricula and seeks to redefine science to allow for supernatural explanations by eliminating \"methodological naturalism\" from science and replacing it with \"theistic realism\". Teach the Controversy proponents portray evolution as a \"theory in crisis.\"\n\nAs well as proposing its own draft science standards to the Kansas State Board of Education and \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" high school lesson plan, the Discovery Institute participated in presenting a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education from Institute associate, Dr. Philip S. Skell. A notable intelligent design proponent, Dr. Skell's letter to the board touts the alleged benefits of the Teach the Controversy approach, as well his credentials as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, despite the fact the National Academy of Sciences issued a policy statement against the Teach the Controversy solution and intelligent design as a concept.\n\nTwo intelligent design proponents, John H. Calvert, a lawyer and a Managing Director of Intelligent Design Network, Inc., and William S. Harris, Ph.D., co-author with Calvert of \"Intelligent Design: The Scientific Alternative to Evolution\" (National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly, Autumn 2003) were instrumental in pushing for the successful adoption of the new standards, including submitting a \"Suggested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\" and numerous other documents. Both are active participants in the intelligent design movement.\n\nDiscovery Institute fellows used the media coverage of the hearings to take their message to the public. The Institute's vice president and program director, Stephen C. Meyer, appeared on the Fox News show \"The Big Story\" with John Gibson, where he debated Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education. There Meyer sought to convey the Institute's message that debate over evolution is not a ploy to get religious ideas into public schools, that evolution is a theory in crisis, and that students were currently being taught in error there was no scientific controversy over evolution.\n\nThe proposed changes were not supported by most of the 26 members of the panel that reviews state science curriculum.\n\nOn November 8, 2005, the Board of Education voted to instruct science students along the lines of the Discovery Institute, that evolution could not rule out a supernatural or theistic source, that evolution itself was not fact but only a theory and one in crisis, and that ID must be considered a viable alternative to evolution.\n\nThe following is a list of those who testified in the Kansas evolution hearings (in order), most of whom are affiliated with the Discovery Institute and all of whom are intelligent design advocates or other forms of creationists, or advocates of some other form of anti-evolution.\n\nThe Kansas Board of Education voted 6–4 August 9, 2005 to include greater criticism of evolution in its school science standards, but it decided to send the standards to an outside academic for review before taking a final vote. The standards received final approval on November 8, 2005. The new standards were approved by 6 to 4, reflecting the makeup of religious conservatives on the board. In July 2006 the Board of Standards issued a \"rationale statement\" which claimed that the current science curriculum standards do not include intelligent design. Members of the scientific community critical of the standards contended that the board's statement was misleading in that they contained a \"significant editorializing that supports the Discovery Institute and the Intelligent Design network's campaign position that Intelligent Design is not included in the standards\", the standards did \"say that students should learn about ID, and that ID content ought to be in the standards\", and that the standards presented the controversy over intelligent design as a scientific one, denying the mainstream scientific view.\n\nKansas joined Ohio in adopting the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution public school science standards during that period. While other states were backing away from teaching alternatives to evolution, the Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday, March 2, 2006 that contained Discovery Institute language encouraging schools to expose students to alternative views about the origin of life. Popular reaction included the creation of the intelligent design parody Pastafarianism (the worship of a Flying Spaghetti Monster). Its founder insisted it should be offered as a \"third\" theory on origins, suggesting possible legal action if it was not included and intelligent design was.\n\nOn August 1, 2006, 4 of the 6 conservative Republicans who approved the Critical Analysis of Evolution classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election. The moderate Republican and liberal Democrats gaining seats, largely supported by Governor Kathleen Sebelius, vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board.\n\nOne of the members who lost her seat, Connie Morris, a conservative from St. Francis in the northwest corner of the state, pointed to the \"liberal media\" for her loss, noting that \"liberal opportunists\" do not mind \"slandering people and harming their families and their reputation and their business and their communities and their state ... It's a shame, and I feel bad for them when they face God on Judgment Day.\" Although four members who claimed to be born-again Christians remained on the Board, she believed that the new board would waste no time adopting new science standards, expecting that in the following January, when the new members were sworn in, the Board would rescind existing standards and adopt new ones that \"let government schools teach children that we are no more than chaotic, random mutants.\"\n\nOn February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again returned to \"the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe.\"\n\n\n"}

Media literacy is not restricted to one medium and therefore has had several different attempts to have a specific definition over the years. Media literacy definitions have been defined based on general skills pertinent to all media or definitions relating to specific mean forms of media. The US-based National Association for Media Literacy Education defines it as a series of communication competencies with the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and communicate in a variety of forms which can be print or non-print messages. They find that media literacy allows people to be critical thinkers and creative in many messages like image, language, and sound.\n\nThere are four important skills that help the viewer or reader understand the meaning of media literacy: \n\n\nMedia literacy typically lends itself to a deeper meaning and analysis of the work, not necessarily just a direct understanding of fact represented in the work. Media Literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create media in a variety of forms. Media literacy also concerns the ability to identify when there is a problem that impacts democracy, thus allowing the public to generate its own opinion, which can influence society.\n\nMedia literacy education for children and youth is intended to promote awareness of media influence and create an active stance towards both consuming and creating media. By teaching children to have a critical eye toward media, they learn how to interpret information and communicate more efficiently, which may impact their everyday lives. Media literacy education is part of the curriculum in the United States and some European Union countries, and an interdisciplinary global community of media literacy scholars and educators engages in knowledge sharing through scholarly and professional journals and national membership associations. In some countries and locations, however, teachers lack appropriate qualifications and the application of best practices is deficient. \n\nThe terms 'media literacy' and 'media education' are used synonymously in most English-speaking nations. Many scholars and educators consider media literacy to be an expanded conceptualization of literacy. In 1993, a gathering of the media literacy community in the United States developed a definition of media literacy as the ability of a citizen to access, analyze, and produce information for specific outcomes. \n\nMedia literacy has a long history and over the years a number of different terms have been used to capture the skills, competencies, knowledge and habits of mind that are required for full participation in media-saturated societies. In England, the term \"media education\" is used to define the process of teaching and learning about media. It is about developing people's critical and creative abilities when it comes to mass media, popular culture and digital media. Media education is the process and media literacy is the outcome, but neither term should be confused with educational technology or with educational media. When people understand media and technology, they are able to access, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a wide variety of media, genres, and forms.\n\nEducation for media literacy often uses an inquiry-based pedagogic model that encourages people to ask questions about what they watch, hear, and read. Media literacy education provides tools to help people critically analyze messages, offers opportunities for learners to broaden their experience of media, and helps them develop creative skills in making their own media messages. Critical analyses can include identifying author, purpose and point of view, examining construction techniques and genres, examining patterns of media representation, and detecting propaganda, censorship, and bias in news and public affairs programming (and the reasons for these). Media literacy education may explore how structural features—such as media ownership, or its funding model—affect the information presented.\n\nIn North America and Europe, media literacy includes both empowerment and protectionist perspectives. Media literate people should be able to skillfully create and produce media messages, both to show understanding of the specific qualities of each medium, as well as to create independent media and participate as active citizens. Media literacy can be seen as contributing to an expanded conceptualization of literacy, treating mass media, popular culture and digital media as new types of 'texts' that require analysis and evaluation. By transforming the process of media consumption into an active and critical process, people gain greater awareness of the potential for misrepresentation and manipulation (especially through commercials and public relations techniques), and understand the role of mass media and participatory media in constructing views of reality.\n\nMedia literacy education is sometimes conceptualized as a way to address the negative dimensions of mass media, popular culture and digital media, including media violence, gender and racial stereotypes, the sexualization of children, and concerns about loss of privacy, cyberbullying and Internet predators. By building knowledge and competencies in using media and technology, media literacy education may provide a type of protection to children and young people by helping them make good choices in their media consumption habits, and patterns of usage.\n\nA variety of scholars have proposed theoretical frameworks for media literacy. Renee Hobbs identifies three frames for introducing media literacy to learners: authors and audiences (AA), messages and meanings (MM), and representation and reality (RR). In synthesizing the literature from media literacy, information literacy, visual literacy and new literacies, she identifies these core ideas that form the theoretical context for media literacy.\nDavid Buckingham has come up with four key concepts that \"provide a theoretical framework which can be applied to the whole range of contemporary media and to 'older' media as well: Production, Language, Representation, and Audience.\" These concepts are defined as follows:\n\nMedia texts are consciously made. Some are made by individuals working alone, just for themselves or their family and friends, but most are produced and distributed by groups of people often for commercial profit. Economic interests and the generation of profit are often at stake in media production.\n\nThe notion of 'representation' is one of the first established principles of media education. Media offers viewers a facilitated outlook of the world and a re-representation of reality. Media production involves selecting and combining incidents, making events into stories, and creating characters. Media representations allow viewers to see the world in some particular ways and not others. Audiences also compare media with their own experiences and make judgements about how realistic they are. Media representations can be seen as real in some ways but not in others: viewers may understand that what they are seeing is only imaginary and yet they still know it can explain reality.\n\nStudying audiences means looking at how demographic audiences are targeted and measured, and how media are circulated and distributed throughout. It looks at different ways in which individuals use, interpret, and respond to media. The media increasingly have had to compete for people's attention and interest because research has shown that audiences are now much more sophisticated and diverse than has been suggested in the past decades. Debating views about audiences and attempting to understand and reflect on our own and others' use of media is, therefore, a crucial element of media education.\n\nTo elaborate on the concepts presented by David Buckingham, Henry Jenkins discusses the emergence of a participatory culture, in which our students are actively engaged. With the emergence of this participatory culture, schools must focus on what Jenkins calls the \"new media literacies\", that is a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need in the new media landscape. In the new media literacies we see a shift in focus from individual expression to community involvement, involving the development of social skills through collaboration and networking.\n\nJeff Share (2002) has categorized the different approaches to media education to fit into 4 different areas. These are the protectionist approach, media arts education, media literacy movement, and critical media literacy (of which he is an advocate). The protectionist approach views audiences of mass media as dupes of the media, vulnerable to cultural, ideological or moral influences, and needing protection by education. The media arts education approach focuses on creative production of different media forms by learners. The media literacy movement is an attempt to bring traditional aspects of literacy from the educational sphere and apply it to media.\n\nEmpowerment and protection are complementary strategies for media literacy education and are fundamentally linked together. Beginning in the 1930s, media literacy educators recognized the need to increase appreciation for quality media content. Edgar Dale's film appreciation movement embodies the concept of empowerment, helping a generation of students learn how to critically analyze film in the context of English education. By the 1970s, awareness of the impact of media influence on children's behavior increased the focus on building students' awareness of the impact of media violence, including concepts like desensitization, to help students recognize and resist the messages that make violence look heroic, justified and appealing. The Center for Media Literacy's MediaLit Kit (TM) embodies the values of the \"empowerment through education\" approach to media literacy. Common Sense Media's media literacy curriculum, which emphasizes internet safety, information literacy, cyberbullying and digital drama, creative credit and copyright, self-image and identity, privacy and security, digital footprint and reputation balances the empowerment and protection approaches.\n\nAn arts-based approach to media education falls into related but distinct traditions. A longstanding emphasis is associated with traditions of film education, which typically place a central focus on film as an art-form, on its aesthetic and cultural value, and on the creative processes of young people's film-making. A study commissioned by the European Commission, led by the British Film Institute, shows how these values are generally supported across European countries. In spite of such support by educators, however, the study shows that most European countries allocate few resources or curriculum emphasis to film education. More generally, a media arts approach has been developed as a cross-curricular model, most conspicuously in a group of UK schools adopting the UK government's 1997 option to specialize in media arts, an approach documented by Andrew Burn and James Durran. This account exemplifies how creative production work in media art forms such as comicstrip, animation, television, film and videogames promotes the cultural, critical and creative aspects of media literacy. It also models the use of the media arts beyond the literacy curriculum, in subjects such as Geography and Science. Meanwhile, a third strand of media arts work foregrounds the digital aspect of contemporary media arts, associating creative media production with programming and computer science.\n\nIn the classroom, students are encouraged to understand the value of the arts while using creativity to express themselves through creating their own art. Incorporating the arts into a students public education can lead to students becoming more engaged, hands-on and motivated to express themselves freely. \n\nCritical media literacy is defined originally by Douglas Kellner and Share in \"Critical Media Literacy is Not an Option\", as \"an educational response that expands the notion of literacy to include different forms of mass communication, popular culture, and new technologies. It deepens the potential of literacy education to critically analyze relationships between media and audiences, information, and power. Along with this mainstream analysis, alternative media production empowers students to create their own messages that can challenge media texts and narratives.\"\nCritical media literacy aims to analyze and understand the power structures that lay within the media and understand the underpinnings of the politics that go into representation of gender, race, class and sexuality in the media. This approach is different than \"media literacy\" because it critically works to understand that there are dominant power structures that audiences work to make meaning between the dominant, oppositional and negotiated readings of media.\n\nWithin society, there are many different ideologies operating in media culture at any given time. Stuart Hall argues that ideologies exist in every aspect of life and are not separate and isolated. Ideologies are understood by the individual but created collectively. Critical media literacy examines ideologies that govern social institutions, government, and lived lives.\nThe benefit of a critical media literacy approach is that audiences engage with and analyze dominant readings and codes within media and contribute to a better understanding of the world's \"social realities\". Instead of taking a mediated image at face value, the reader can understand the history and the characteristics of the image and make meaning in various ways.\n\nPeople often use the skills of critical media literacy without even noticing while watching television, using social media, reading books, listening to music, etc.. Critical media literacy allows people to interpret the messages conveyed onscreen and apply them to their lives. By using this strategy, critical media literacy contribute to social change and activism. As stated by Douglas Kellner in \"Cultural Studies, Multiculturalism, and Media Culture\", \"The gaining of critical media literacy is an important resource for individuals and citizens in learning how to cope with a seductive cultural environment. Learning how to read, criticize, and resist sociocultural manipulation can help one empower oneself in relation to dominant forms of media and culture.\" There are multiple different ways that individuals can analyze, interpret, and evaluate media texts, specifically critical visual analysis and audience research. Critical visual analysis is different than visual analysis because of its interdisciplinary way of critical analyzing the frame of reference of a visual artifact and the power structures that are embedded in it. This is a great way to utilize critical media literacy in the classroom. As for an example of audience research, Kellner says \"Fandoms of all sorts, from Star Trek fans (\"Trekkies\"/\"Trekkers\") to devotees of various soap operas, reality shows, or current highly popular TV series, also form communities that enable them to relate to others who share their interests and hobbies.\" Audience reception is important within critical media literacy because it offers the understanding that the audience will take in various forms of media and make meaning of them. A viewer is different than the audience because a viewer is just an individual who makes meaning, where the audience is a collective whole. The differences comes into play when one does research using the skills of critical media literacy. In order to understand a piece of media it is absolutely essential to make meaning of the audience and ask questions of who is this targeted at, focused on, and who is viewing it.\n\nProponents of media literacy education argue that the inclusion of media literacy into school curriculum promotes civic engagement, increases awareness of the power structures inherent in popular media and aids students in gaining the necessary critical and inquiry skills needed in today's society. Educators have argued for decades that teaching media literacy in the classroom is crucial in shaping critical thinkers, well-informed citizens and conscientious consumers in order to be aware about the risks present in the constant use of media and Internet. There is a growing body of research focusing on the impacts of media literacy on students. In an important meta-analysis of more than 50 studies published in the Journal of Communication, media literacy interventions were found to have positive effects on knowledge, criticism, perceived realism, influence, behavioral beliefs, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior.\n\nThe digital age has made it easy for anyone to create media. We don't always know who created something, why they made it, and whether it's credible. This makes media literacy tricky to learn and teach. Nonetheless, media literacy is an essential skill in the digital age. \n\nCritical thinking skills that are the basis of media literacy education are utilized to decrease substance abuse in adolescents. A correlative study evaluated the relationship between skills commonly taught in media literacy programs. This study examined the ability to critically deconstruct media messages and adolescent's intent to use substances. \n\nStudents who were better able to critically examine and decode media messages reported that they were less likely to use drugs and alcohol in the future. The findings suggest, based on youth exposure to substances in the media, that media literacy programs may be a valuable tool for preventing harmful adolescent health behavior. Media literacy education is a tool to combat childhood obesity and promote healthy consumer habits. \n\n140 fifth-grade Taiwanese students participated in a study examining the effects of a food advertising literacy program on food purchasing habits. The media literacy program introduced marketing strategies surrounding food advertisements, teaching students to evaluate the nutritional value of advertised foods and promote healthy food among their peers using learned marketing strategies. The study found that students who had completed the food literacy program showed significantly greater improvements in nutritional food knowledge, food purchasing behavior and food advertising literacy. However, after a 1-month follow up students showed a decrease in the above-mentioned categories.\n\nMedia literacy programs can be used as a sexual health promotion. These programs allow people to be actively involved as they use media and technology as a source of information. Digital technology has become a part of millennials everyday lives. With this form of access to the internet, millennials have a larger pool of information. A Journal of Media Literacy Education study found that using MLE, adolescents could gather and learn information regarding sexual health as well as media literacy (e.g., how to make safe-sex decisions and how to improve media skills). Media literacy programs apply to HIV prevention. MLE allows people to learn valuable skills to understand and detect the falsity of information found in the media about HIV, decreasing the risks and spread of HIV.\n\nMedia literacy programs can be a violence-prevention strategy. Results from a major longitudinal study conducted by UCLA with more than 2,000 Southern California middle school students found that introducing a curriculum aimed at deconstructing violence in the media resulted in increased student knowledge acquisition regarding media literacy and effects of violent media on individuals and society, changed attitudes toward media violence, as well as playground behaviors and media usage. The study used a self-report survey to compare participant's knowledge and attitudes surrounding violence pre-intervention and post-intervention. The study not only evaluated the curriculum, Beyond Blame: Challenging Violence in the Media, but also the Center for Media Literacy's frameworks for addressing media-related themes and topics.\n\nA recent study examines the effects of a media literacy program geared at exploring gender stereotypes expressed in the media on middle school students. The research measured the extent to which participants learned to be critical consumers of media, especially in regards to stereotypical portrayals of men and women. Results were gathered through student surveys administered pre-intervention and post-intervention and concluded that participants who received the intervention were more likely to believe that the media influences the way people think about men and women and that the media reinforces gender stereotypes in regards to occupation.\n\nMedia literacy can be an effective tool for addressing issues surrounding women's body image. In a study conducted among female college students, participants were shown a 25-minute video that exposes how the advertising industry influences female body image, particularly the messages that certain media texts are sending to viewers about how an ideal woman should look. The study found that participants who watched the video reported greater satisfaction with their body, meaning the difference between their perceived body type and their ideal body type was much smaller compared to those who did not watch the video.\n\nThe above studies used self-report post-treatment surveys in order to gather their data. The limitations of this measure are that data collected about student behavior and experience is self-reported and can easily be distorted. Participants can exaggerate their responses, claiming that the media literacy lessons were more impactful than they actually were.\n\nThere is a wealth of research regarding youth exposure to media in all its forms. There are numerous articles seeking to explore the consequences of such exposure on adolescent behavior, but there are surprisingly few studies that explore the efficacy of certain tools that can be used to combat the harmful consequences of media exposure. Media literacy education is purported to lessen the negative impacts of media exposure, but precious few studies have been conducted to prove the statement. Perhaps further evidence demonstrating the benefits of media literacy as an intervention would encourage more educators to embrace the practice and incorporate programs into the classroom.\n\nIn 2001, a media education survey by UNESCO investigated which countries were incorporating media studies into different schools' curricula, as well as to help develop new initiatives in the field of media education. A questionnaire was sent to a total of 72 experts on media education in 52 different countries around the world. The people who received this questionnaire were people involved in academics (such as teachers), policymakers, and educational advisers. The questionnaire addressed three key areas:\n\n\nThe results from the answers to the survey were double-sided. It was noted that media education had been making a very uneven progress because while in one country there was an abundant amount of work towards media education, another country may have hardly even heard of the concept. Media education has not taken a full swing in some countries due to the lack of policymakers addressing the issue. In some developing countries, educators say that media education was only just beginning to register as a concern because they were just starting to develop basic print literacy.\n\nIn the countries where media education existed at all, it would be offered as an elective class or an optional area of the school system rather than being on its own. Many countries argued that media education should not be a separate part of the curriculum but rather should be added to a subject already established. The countries which deemed media education as a part of the curriculum included the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Australia. Many countries lacked even just basic research on media education as a topic, including Russia and Sweden. Some said that popular culture is not worthy enough of study. But all of the correspondents realized the importance of media education as well as the importance of formal recognition from their government and policymakers that media education should be taught in schools.\n\nMedia literacy education is actively focused on the instructional methods and pedagogy of media literacy, integrating theoretical and critical frameworks rising from constructivist learning theory, media studies, and cultural studies scholarship. This work has arisen from a legacy of media and technology use in education throughout the 20th century and the emergence of cross-disciplinary work at the intersections of scholarly work in media studies and education. The Voices of Media Literacy was a project through the Center for Media Literacy sponsored by Tessa Jolls. It included first-person interviews with 20 media literacy pioneers active prior to the 1990s in English-speaking countries. The project provided historical context for the rise of media literacy from individuals who helped influenced the field. Media education is developing in Great Britain, Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, with a growing interest in the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Austria, Switzerland, India, Russia and among many other nations.\n\nEducation, for what is now termed media literacy, has been developing in the UK since at least the 1930s. In the 1960s, there was a paradigm shift in the field of media literacy to emphasize working within popular culture rather than trying to convince people that popular culture was primarily destructive. This was known as the popular arts paradigm. In the 1970s, there came a recognition that the ideological power of the media was tied to the naturalization of the image. Forged messages were being passed off as natural ones. The focus of media literacy also shifted to the consumption of images and representations, also known as the representational paradigm. Development has gathered pace since the 1970s when the first formal courses in Film Studies and, later, Media Studies, were established as options for young people in the 14-19 age range: over 100,000 students (about 5% of this age range) now take these courses annually. Scotland has always had a separate education system from the rest of the UK and began to develop policies for media education in the 1980s. In England, the creation of the National Curriculum in 1990 included some limited requirements for teaching about the media as part of English. In Scotland, teachers are represented by the professional association AMES (Association of Media Educators, Scotland); while in England the MEA (Media Education Association) fulfills this purpose.\n\nThe UK is widely regarded as a leader in the development of education for media literacy. Key agencies that have been involved in this development include the British Film Institute, the English and Media Centre Film Education the Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media at the Institute of Education, London, and the DARE centre (Digital Arts Research Education), a collaboration between University College London and the British Film Institute.\n\nThe ‘promotion' of media literacy also became a UK Government policy under New Labour, and was enshrined in the Communications Act 2003 as a responsibility of the new media regulator, Ofcom.  After an initial burst of activity, however, Ofcom’s work in this regard was progressively reduced in scope, and from the Coalition government onwards, the promotion of media literacy was reduced to a matter of market research – what Wallis & Buckingham have described as an ‘undead' policy.\n\nThere are eighteen key media literacy stakeholders were identified in the UK.ten of these stakeholders are categorized as ‘Civil Society’, when four are categorized as ‘Public Authorities’. Two stakeholders are categorized as ‘Academia’, when the sectors of ‘Media Regulatory Authorities’ and ‘Audiovisual Content Providers’ account for one key media literacy stakeholder each. Two main stakeholders in the UK have a duty in relation to media literacy. The development of media literacy is a duty placed on Ofcom by Section 11 of the Communications Act 2003. Also, Under its new Charter, the principal Public Service Broadcaster, the BBC, has a duty to enhance media literacy.\n\nIn Australia, media education was influenced by developments in Britain related to the inoculation, popular arts, and demystification approaches. Key theorists who influenced Australian media education were Graeme Turner and John Hartley who helped develop Australian media and cultural studies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Western Australians Robyn Quin and Barrie MacMahon wrote seminal textbooks such as \"Real Images\", translating many complex media theories into classroom appropriate learning frameworks. In most Australian states, media is one of five strands of the Arts Key Learning Area and includes \"essential learnings\" or \"outcomes\" listed for various stages of development. At the senior level (years 11 and 12), several states offer Media Studies as an elective. For example, many Queensland schools offer Film, Television and New Media, while Victorian schools offer VCE Media. Media education is supported by the teacher professional association Australian Teachers of Media. With the introduction of a new Australian National Curriculum, schools are beginning to implement media education as part of the arts curriculum, using media literacy as a means to educate students how to deconstruct, construct and identify themes in media.\n\nIn South Africa, the increasing demand for Media Education has evolved from the dismantling of apartheid and the 1994 democratic elections. The first national Media Education conference in South Africa was actually held in 1990 and the new national curriculum has been in the writing stages since 1997. Since this curriculum strives to reflect the values and principles of a democratic society there seems to be an opportunity for critical literacy and Media Education in Languages and Culture courses.\n\nProfessor Ralph A. Akinfeleye, Ph.D, points out that there have been many strides taken to use media to educate and expose South Africans to sexuality. This new openness has led to more sex scenes in movies, a boost in sales for the pornography industry, and an increase in sex shops. Although many newspapers are attempting to shed light on important issues related to sexuality, such as women's sexual rights, many people in South Africa are still hesitant to the media openness. One of the main issues that critics point out with the openness to sexuality in the media is the presentation of scholarly articles related to sexuality in print media next to pictures of women dressed scandalously trying to sell something, and how this sends mixed signals about sexuality to viewers. In addition, South Africa is faced with trying to balance its newfound popularity of sex with providing a safe environment that does not spread HIV/AIDS and sexual violence, two issues that South Africa has been plagued with in the past. Although there are issues that South Africa is facing in the adjustment to this new openness of sexuality in the media, the steps being taken to educate the public about issues with sexuality in South Africa is a huge move towards Media Education.\n\nIn areas of Europe, media education has seen many different forms. Media education was introduced into the Finnish elementary curriculum in 1970 and into high schools in 1977. But the media education we know today did not evolve in Finland until the 1990s. Media education has been compulsory in Sweden since 1980 and in Denmark since 1970. In both these countries, media education evolved in the 1980s and 1990s as media education gradually moved away from moralizing attitudes towards an approach that is more searching and pupil-centered. In 1994, the Danish education bill gave recognition to media education but it is still not an integrated part of the school. The focus in Denmark seems to be on information technology.\n\nFrance has taught film from the inception of the medium, but it has only been recently that conferences and media courses for teachers have been organized with the inclusion of media production. Germany saw theoretical publications on media literacy in the 1970s and 1980s, with a growing interest for media education inside and outside the educational system in the 80s and 90s. In the Netherlands media literacy was placed in the agenda by the Dutch government in 2006 as an important subject for the Dutch society. In April, 2008, an official center has been created (mediawijsheid expertisecentrum = medialiteracy expertisecenter) by the Dutch government. This center is more a network organization existing out of different partners who have their own expertise with the subject of media education. The idea is that media education will become a part of the official curriculum.\n\nThe history of media education in Russia goes back to the 1920s. The first attempts to instruct in media education (on the press and film materials, with the vigorous emphasis on the communist ideology) appeared in the 1920s but were stopped by Joseph Stalin’s repressions. The end of the 1950s - the beginning of the 1960s was the time of the revival of media education in secondary schools, universities, after-school children centers (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Voronezh, Samara, Kurgan, Tver, Rostov on Don, Taganrog, Novosibirsk, Ekaterinburg, etc.), the revival of media education seminars and conferences for the teachers. During the time when the intensive rethinking of media education approaches was on the upgrade in the Western hemisphere, in Russia of the 1970s–1980s media education was still developing within the aesthetic concept. Among the important achievements of 1970s-1990s one can recall the first official programs of film and media education, published by Ministry of Education, increasing interest of Ph.D. to media education, experimental theoretic and practical work on media education by O.Baranov (Tver), S.Penzin (Voronezh), G.Polichko, U.Rabinovich (Kurgan), Y.Usov (Moscow), Alexander Fedorov (Taganrog), A.Sharikov (Moscow) and others. The important events in media education development in Russia are the registration of the new specialization (since 2002) for the pedagogical universities – ‘Media Education’ (№ 03.13.30), and the launch of a new academic journal ‘Media Education’ (since January 2005), partly sponsored by the ICOS UNESCO ‘Information for All’. Additionally, the Internet sites of Russian Association for Film and Media Education \n(English and Russian versions) were created. Taking into account the fact that UNESCO defines media education as the priority field of the cultural educational development in the 21st century, media literacy has good prospects in Russia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the few countries in the world that have introduced media education into their curriculums, when in 2009 “media literacy” was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17 year old students of Gymnasium high schools.\n\nIn Ukraine, media education has been developed according to the Conception of implementing media education Ukraine since its approval in 2010 in the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences. Nowdays its implementaton is on the second stage (2017–2020) of its gradual establishing and standardization in education. There are main centres of media education in Ukraine aimed at its development thanks to relevant scientists such as Ivan Franko University of Lviv (Boris Potyatinnik), Institute of Higher Education of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Hanna Onkovych), Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Lyubov Naidyonova). Besides, there are other institutions which make a contribution to developing media education including the Academy of Ukrainian Press and some of Ukrainian universities where journalists are mostly trained. As a result of activities of these centres and organizations websites were created including the following ones: 1) http://medialiteracy.org.ua founded in 2013 on the basis of the library of the Academy of Ukrainian Press which is an online interactive platform for communication of media educators; 2) http://mediaosvita.org.ua/pro-nas founded by the Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine, and aimed at solving problems of media psychology and media education; 3) http://osvita.mediasapiens.ua founded in 2010 by Detector Media (a non-government organization), and aimed at educating media consumers; 4) http://mediadriver.online is another project of Detector Media which is a multimedia manual with texts, photos, video, and even cartoons about advantages and disadvantages including non-safety of media and aimed at forming media culture of media consumers. There are also other websites devoted to the development of mass media in Ukraine (Media school of Professor Ganna Onkovych (https://www.facebook.com/groups/ 898909013519964/, http://wiki.iteach.com.ua/Тренінг_\"Критичне_оцінювання_ресурсів_інтернету\"_ для_вчителів_ і_учнів), but the above-mentioned ones are key websites for media educators. Perspectives for media education development are defined in the Conception of implementing media education Ukraine according to which on the third stage (2021–2025) there should be the introduction of the media educational component in the curriculum of high schools of training of specialists in humanitarian sciences and appropriate information and communication technologies \n\nIn North America, the beginnings of a formalized approach to media literacy as a topic of education is often attributed to the 1978 formation of the Ontario-based Association for Media Literacy (AML). Before that time, instruction in media education was usually the purview of individual teachers and practitioners. Canada was the first country in North America to require media literacy in the school curriculum. Every province has mandated media education in its curriculum. For example, the new curriculum of Quebec mandates media literacy from Grade 1 until final year of secondary school (Secondary V). The launching of media education in Canada came about for two reasons. One reason was the concern about the pervasiveness of American popular culture and the other was the education system-driven necessity of contexts for new educational paradigms. Canadian communication scholar Marshall McLuhan ignited the North American educational movement for media literacy in the 1950s and 1960s. Two of Canada's leaders in Media Literacy and Media Education are Barry Duncan and John Pungente. Duncan died on June 6, 2012. Even after he retired from classroom teaching, Barry had still been active in media education. Pungente is a Jesuit priest who has promoted media literacy since the early 1960s.\n\nMedia literacy education has been an interest in the United States since the early 20th century, when high school English teachers first started using film to develop students' critical thinking and communication skills. However, media literacy education is distinct from simply using media and technology in the classroom, a distinction that is exemplified by the difference between \"teaching with media\" and \"teaching about media.\" In the 1950s and 60s, the ‘film grammar’ approach to media literacy education developed in the United States. Where educators began to show commercial films to children, having them learn a new terminology consisting of words such as: fade, dissolve, truck, pan, zoom, and cut. Films were connected to literature and history. To understand the constructed nature of film, students explored plot development, character, mood and tone. Then, during the 1970s and 1980s, attitudes about mass media and mass culture began to shift around the English-speaking world. Educators began to realize the need to “guard against our prejudice of thinking of print as the only real medium that the English teacher has a stake in.” A whole generation of educators began to not only acknowledge film and television as new, legitimate forms of expression and communication, but also explored practical ways to promote serious inquiry and analysis—- in higher education, in the family, in schools and in society. Typically, U.S. media literacy education includes a focus on news, advertising, issues of representation, and media ownership. Media literacy competencies can also be cultivated in the home, through activities including co-viewing and discussion. In 1976, Project Censored began using a service learning model to cultivate media literacy skills among students and faculty in higher education.\n\nMedia literacy education began to appear in state English education curriculum frameworks by the early 1990s, as a result of increased awareness in the central role of visual, electronic and digital media in the context of contemporary culture. Nearly all 50 states have language that supports media literacy in state curriculum frameworks. In 2004, Montana developed educational standards around media literacy that students are required to be competent in by grades 4, 8, and 12. Additionally, an increasing number of school districts have begun to develop school-wide programs, elective courses, and other after-school opportunities for media analysis and production.\n\nThere is no national data on the reach of media literacy programs in the United States. The evolution of information and communication technologies has expanded the subject of media literacy to incorporate information literacy, collaboration and problem-solving skills, and emphasis on the social responsibilities of communication. Various stakeholders struggle over nuances of meaning associated with the conceptualization of the practice on media literacy education. Educational scholars may use the term \"critical media literacy\" to emphasize the exploration of power and ideology in media analysis. Other scholars may use terms like \"new media literacy\" to emphasize the application of media literacy to user-generated content or \"21st century literacy\" to emphasize the use of technology tools. As far back as 2001, the Action Coalition for Media Education (ACME) split from the main media literacy organization as the result of debate about whether or not the media industry should support the growth of media literacy education in the United States. Renee Hobbs of Temple University in Philadelphia wrote about this general question as one of the \"Seven Great Debates\" in media literacy education in an influential 1998 Journal of Communication article.\n\nThe media industry has supported media literacy education in the United States. Make Media Matter is one of the many blogs (an “interactive forum”) the Independent Film Channel features as a way for individuals to assess the role media plays in society and the world. The television program, The Media Project, offers a critical look at the state of news media in contemporary society. During the 1990s, the Discovery Channel supported the implementation of Assignment: Media Literacy, a statewide educational initiative for K-12 students developed in collaboration with the Maryland State Board of Education.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the education system in a country with 70 million children now in public or private schools, media literacy education develops as the result of groups of advocates in school districts, states or regions who lobby for its inclusion in the curriculum. There is no central authority making nationwide curriculum recommendations and each of the fifty states has numerous school districts, each of which operates with a great degree of independence from one another. However, most U.S. states include media literacy in health education, with an emphasis on understanding environmental influences on health decision-making. Tobacco and alcohol advertising are frequently targeted as objects for \"deconstruction, \" which is one of the instructional methods of media literacy education. This resulted from an emphasis on media literacy generated by the Clinton White House. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) held a series of conferences in 1996 and 1997 which brought greater awareness of media literacy education as a promising practice in health and substance abuse prevention education. The medical and public health community now recognizes the media as a cultural environmental influence on health and sees media literacy education as a strategy to support the development of healthy behavior.\n\nInterdisciplinary scholarship in media literacy education is emerging. In 2009, a scholarly journal was launched, the Journal of Media Literacy Education, to support the work of scholars and practitioners in the field. Universities such as Appalachian State University, Columbia University, Ithaca College, New York University, Brooklyn College of the City, University of New York, the University of Texas-Austin, The University of Rhode Island and the University of Maryland offer courses and summer institutes in media literacy for pre-service teachers and graduate students. Brigham Young University offers a graduate program in media education specifically for inservice teachers. The Salzburg Academy for Media and Global Change is another program that educates students and professionals from around the world the importance of being literate about the media.\n\nIn 2018 California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill allowing media literacy to be taught in California .\n\nMedia literacy education appears to have a positive impact on overall youth civic engagement. Youth who attend schools that offer media literacy programs are more likely to politically engage online and are more likely to report encountering diverse viewpoints online.\n\nA nationally representative survey found that 84% of young people think they and their friends would benefit from training on verifying information found online. The Common Sense Institute Research found that around the 50% of young people like to keep themselves informed and 2/3 of them want to be informed about the latest news of the world.\n\nBeginning in the 2017 school year, children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources. Called \"media literacy,\" the course provides training in journalism in the new information society.\n\n\nhttps://books.google.com.pk/books/about/Introduction_to_Mass_Communication.html?id=O52Fv9CrCRYC&redir_esc=y\n\nhttp://www.ksro.com/2018/09/26/governor-brown-signs-dodd-bill-to-teach-media-literacy-in-california-schools/"}

Ammukutty, better known as Ammu Swaminathan, a social worker and independence activist . She spent her childhood in Switzerland, where, she received her first lessons in the Dalcroze school, a Western technique of dance movements. She was educated at Shantiniketan under the guidance of Rabindranath Tagore where she realised her true calling. She then went for a short time to the United States where she enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

She has a son, Kartikeya and a daughter Mallika who too went on to attain fame in dance and theatre. Mrinalini founded Darpana in Ahmedabad in 1948. A year later, she performed at the Théâtre national de Chaillot in Paris where she received a lot of critical acclaim.\n\nMrinalini and Vikram had a troubled marriage. According to biographer Amrita Shah, Vikram Sarabhai had a void in his personal life he sought to fill by dedicating himself to applying science for social good.\n\nBesides choreographing more than three hundred dance dramas, she has also written many novels, poetry, plays and stories for children. She was the chairperson of the Gujarat State Handicrafts and Handloom Development Corporation Ltd.

Her mother Ammu Swaminathan was a remarkable woman of her times, and a great freedom fighter. Her elder sister Lakshmi Sehgal was the commander-in-chief of Subhas Chandra Bose's 'Rani of Jhansi Regiment' of the Indian National Army ( Azad Hind Fauj). Her elder brother, Govind Swaminathan, was a famous barrister who practised in Madras as a specialist in constitutional and criminal law apart from civil law and company law; he served as the attorney general for Madras State (now Tamil Nadu) with great distinction.\n\nShe was admitted to hospital on 20 January 2016 and died the next day at the age of 97.\"My mother just left for her eternal dance,\" her daughter, leading danseuse, actor and activist Mallika Sarabhai, said in a Facebook post announcing the death--\n\nMrinalini Sarabhai has been awarded by the Indian government with the national civilian awards Padma Bhushan in 1992 and the Padma Shri in 1965.

Baker\n\nRobert Allen Baker Jr. (June 27, 1921 – August 8, 2005) was an American psychologist, professor of psychology emeritus of the University of Kentucky, skeptic, author, and investigator of ghosts, UFO abductions, lake monsters and other paranormal phenomena. He is the editor of Psychology in the Wry, a collection of satire, and was formerly the co-editor of Approaches, a quarterly journal of contemporary poetry. His satirical and humorous verses have appeared in Vogue, Saturday Review, The Journal of Irreproducible Results, Worm-Runners' Digest, and other journals. He wrote 15 books and is a Past Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nBaker was born in 1921 in the little community of Blackford, in Webster County, Kentucky. His father did shoe repair and his mother was a drugstore clerk. Despite their own lack of education, his parents encouraged him to study from an early age. He attended primary school in Hopkinsville, Kentucky and graduated from Hopkinsville High School in 1939. He served in the Army Air Forces as a cryptographer during World War II, and began reading about human psychology at that time.\n\nBaker died of congestive heart failure on the 52nd anniversary of his marriage to Rose Paalz \"Dolly\" Baker, with whom he fathered six children.\n\nBaker graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1948 and later returned to receive a master's degree in psychology. He received a doctorate in psychology from Stanford University in 1951.\n\nAfter completing his PhD, he became a staff scientist at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, doing military research. In 1953 he joined the Human Resources Research Office at Fort Knox, where he did human factors research relating to the Army.\n\nHe served on the faculty of Chico State College and Indiana University Southeast and was a staff psychologist for the Kentucky Department of Corrections. In 1969 he joined the faculty of the University of Kentucky in the psychology department. He was chairman of the psychology department for four years. Baker spent the last 20 years of his career here, until his retirement.\n\nHe served as president of the Kentucky Psychological Association and was a fellow of the American Psychological Association.\n\nBaker was a critic of pseudoscience in the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy, and of the coercive nature of psychiatry. He wrote on this topic and allied himself with Thomas Szasz in his criticism. In a 2002 letter to Szasz, Baker metaphorically refereed to psychiatrists as \"rapists wearing the mantle of science.\"\n\nHis parents instilled skepticism in him from an early age. He was interested in ghosts as a child, but was disappointed to discover upon investigation that the noises emanating from a nearby \"haunted cave\" were actually natural in origin.\n\nAs a university psychologist, he sometimes encountered cases with a paranormal element. He would do his best to find a non-paranormal explanation or resolution for these cases, and eventually gained a reputation as a \"ghost buster\".\n\nWhen Joe Nickell was seeking an advanced degree at the University of Kentucky, the two met. They later worked together on several paranormal investigations and co-wrote a book on the topic. Nickell once said, \"No one knew more about alien abductions than Robert Baker.\"\n\nAfter retiring from the university in 1989, he devoted much of his time to anomalistic psychology and scientific skepticism, writing several books on related topics including hypnosis, ghosts, alien abductions and false memory syndrome. Baker wrote that many paranormal phenomena can be explained via psychological effects such as hallucinations, sleep paralysis and hidden memories, a phenomenon in which experiences that originally make little conscious impression are filed away in the brain to be suddenly remembered later in an altered form.\n\nHe was an organizer with and served as president of the Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics. He wrote numerous articles and book reviews for Skeptical Inquirer magazine and CSI's Skeptical Briefs newsletter.\n\nIn 2000, he was acknowledged when a panel of experts chose the outstanding skeptics of the 20th Century.\n\nAt a meeting of the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) in Denver, Colorado in April 2011, Baker was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56505154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56505154", "title": "School security", "text": "School security\n\nSchool security encompasses all measures taken to combat threats to people and property in education environments. One term connected to school security is school safety, which is defined as the sheltering of students from violence and bullying, as well as exposure to harmful elements such as drugs and gang activity. Along with other public places, schools are at risk for invasion from outside as well as attacks from students or faculty because of the high traffic of potential assailants and availability of victims.\n\nIn the US, as of January 2018, since 1990, at least 240 school shootings have occurred. It's over a 450% increase of the previous 30 years, in which there were only 53 shootings. School bombings are less frequent at 22 in 2016, but according to the US Bomb Data Center, education related buildings are over twice as threatened than any other target. Over 74% of education related threats were middle schools, junior high, and high schools. Due to safety threats, during the 2013-2014 school year, reports say 93% of public schools lock or monitor doors and gates as a means of controlling access to the school; this is an 18% increase since the turn of the century. Metal detectors are installed at many entrances of public schools to deter students from bringing weaponry into schools.\n\nVandalism is often a problem for schools as they are an easy target. What constitutes vandalism varies among reports, which makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the extent of vandalism. However, vandalism generally refers to damage to property (graffiti, etc.), and break-ins. The Center for Problem Oriented Policing categorizes break-ins as being of three types: nuisance break-ins, where a break-in is done just for the sake of it; professional break-ins, with an intent of theft; and malicious break-ins, where damage is caused out of spite. Solutions for preventing vandalism include providing after-school and evening programs to engage youth that are loitering, improving lighting, adding security patrols, and education for students on anti-vandalism.\n\n\"see Education in New Zealand\"\n\nThe New Zealand government provides funding to public schools to repair vandalism. This funding comes from different sources depending on the type of damage that occurs. Two important guidelines regarding vandalism repair are that it must \"be carried out immediately, and comply with Ministry standards.\"\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the U.S., 20.8% of students ages 12–18 experienced bullying at school in 2014-15. Prevention for bullying by parents, teachers, and other adults includes talking to students about bullying, modeling good examples of treating others with kindness, and helping students get involved in something they're passionate about. Helping students understand the importance of reporting bullying and teaching them ways to stop others from bullying can also be effective.\n\nBetween the ages of 11-15, in most countries around the world, boys are bullied more than girls. As reported by Young People's Health in Context, in Israel, almost twice as many boys ages 13–15 are bullied than girls; Belgium has a difference nearly as high. On average, bullying tends to peak at age 13. Lithuania experiences the highest level of bullying, with an average of 63.6% for girls between the ages of 11-15, and an average of 65% for boys between the ages of 11-15. Sweden experiences the lowest level of bullying, with an average of 14.7% for girls between 11-15, and an average of 15.3% for boys between 11-15.\n\nThe National School Boards Association states that ensuring safety and security in schools is the primary responsibility of every school district.\n\nAs we see a rise in gang and drug activity among other safety threats in our schools, there has been an increase in police presence on school campuses. In 2014 the National Center for Education Statistics reported that 43% of schools in the U.S. had School Resource Officers on their campuses anywhere from once a week to full-time hours of operation.\n\nSchool Resource Officers, also known as S.R.O.s, are often responsible for teaching a gang-resistance program to students. Commonly referred to as G.R.E.A.T., this program has been shown to be 39% effective at deterring at-risk youth from becoming involved in gangs or gang-related activity.\n\nSome of these S.R.O.s are accompanied by dogs that are fully trained in drug and bomb sniffing. Although this could be potentially helpful, especially in the drug culture among students, it is a highly controversial issue as some believe it may go against Fourth (and possibly Fifth) Amendment Rights.\n\nDigital surveillance technology monitoring students, staff and visitors is currently being employed in schools around the world. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, by 2014 an average of 80% of secondary schools in the United States had installed security cameras. This was over 300% increase compared to the 19% of public educational facilities using video surveillance in 2000. Closed-circuit television (CCTV), the most common type of video monitoring system, is also reported to be prevalent in the United Kingdom and Australia. A possible 85-90% of secondary schools used CCTV in Britain, according to statistics claimed by Big Brother Watch. Cameras are also installed on buses to prevent violence, theft, illegal activity by students or drivers and as evidence against motorists who violate traffic laws regarding school buses.\n\nIn the new wave of technology, cyber-security has also become a concern as schools try to balance advancement in students' technological skills with the possibilities for misuse of borrowed devices and breeches in school servers.\n\nStudent and faculty ID cards and/or badges are a possible way of improving school security. They allow school authorities to know immediately that the people carrying or wearing ID belong there. Student ID cards can also help keep track of where students are. Tracking students through tracking chips has been controversial, however, due to concerns for privacy.\n\nIdentification badges for visitors to schools can alleviate confusion about who someone unfamiliar is, and school authorities will easily be able to determine where the visitor is authorized to go. These visitor badges can also be a way to conduct background checks before the visitor enters a school campus.\n\nStudents in schools abroad (outside of Poland) who are learning Polish language or academic subjects taught in Polish are eligible for Polish student ID cards. These cards provide benefits including transportation, museum, and national park discounts while visiting Poland. Students under age 18 can get one of these IDs, as well as teachers of Polish. They are valid for one school year.\n\nWithin the United Kingdom and around the globe one of the first line of school security measures is the application of a fencing system to control ingress and egress from the school grounds. Recently guidance by NaCTSO is that 'Screen from View' fencing should be adopted on school perimeters to combat the terrorist threat to schools. Within the UK, one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of School Security Fencing is CLD Fencing Systems. For over 20 years their range of school fencing has provided protection for hundreds of thousands of pupils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nOFSTED now includes the perimeter school fencing and physical access control as an area of review in the safeguarding of pupils on school grounds.\n"}

Examples of large-scale projects are the hydroponic greenhouses of Lufa Farms, the rooftop farms of Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Farm, and the vertical farms of Sky Greens. Building types that can incorporate food growing technologies include: single-family home, multi-family housing, mixed-use buildings, schools, restaurants, institutional buildings, vertical farms, hoop houses and greenhouses that are designed to urban conditions. Existing urban buildings and structures can also be adaptively reused incorporating agricultural technologies to produce food for urban populations.\n"}

It is a celebration of when the second-year students (of the three-year lukio) become the seniors of the school. The prom is usually held the day after the third-year students (the seniors) stop attending school and start studying for their matriculation exams in February. The people attending the dances are called \"vanhat\" (\"seniors\"). Sometimes the first word is spelled with a \"w\" for a more archaic feel. \n\nAfter the ball, the students attend a dinner in the evening, which is sometimes in a very formal restaurant.\n\n"}

The society grew out of the Lithuanian National Revival, hopes of creating Lithuanian intelligentsia, and frustration over financial hardships faced by many young students. It was established in 1893 by Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė and Jadvyga Juškytė, and led by Felicija Bortkevičienė from 1903 until its dissolution in 1940.\n\nIt was established in 1893 by Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė and Jadvyga Juškytė with help from Vincas Kudirka and Jonas Jablonskis. The meeting took place in Jablonskis' home in Mitau (Jelgava); at the time he worked as a teacher at Jelgava Gymnasium. At the time it was an illegal organization as all Lithuanian organizations were banned after the Uprising of 1863. Petkevičaitė-Bitė was the driving force of the society; she was helped by many other wealthier women but their involvement was usually short. The funds were raised by various means, including donations from the public and Lithuanian Americans, card games among intellectuals, various events. For example, the first public Lithuanian theater performance \"Amerika pirtyje\" in 1899 donated some of the proceeds to Žiburėlis. In 1904, Povilas Višinskis suggested to publish and sell postcards. Up to 1900, the society distributed 3,258 rubles (1,629 U.S. dollars). By 1906, the amount grew to almost 8,000 rubles.\n\nIn 1903, Felicija Bortkevičienė took over the society and headed it until its dissolution in 1940. The death of Višinskis from tuberculosis that he had contracted as a student at the Saint Petersburg University became an impulse to legalize and expand the society. The society legalized its activities and became an officially registered organization on 14 January 1907. After Lithuania became independent, Žiburėlis grew and strengthened. It collected funds from membership fees, donations, proceeds from various events, including lotteries and concerts. After graduation, former aid recipients repaid their support. In 1921, it established a 30-room dormitory in Kaunas. The society had sections in other cities, including Šiauliai, Ukmergė, Panevėžys. The society ceased to exist when Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n\nDuring its existence the society supported some 300 gifted students many of whom who later became prominent figures in Lithuania, including forester Povilas Matulionis, writer Jonas Biliūnas, painter and composer Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis, jurist Rapolas Skipitis, diplomat Jurgis Šaulys, doctor Petras Avižonis, linguist Kazimieras Būga, operatic tenor Kipras Petrauskas, painter Adomas Varnas, sculptor Petras Rimša, sculptor Juozas Zikaras, priest Antanas Viskantas, Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas, Soviet revolutionary Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas, writers Julius Janonis and Jonas Biliūnas.\n"}
