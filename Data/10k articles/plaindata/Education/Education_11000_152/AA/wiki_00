{"id": "3361801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3361801", "title": "Alan Dershowitz", "text": "Alan Dershowitz\n\nAlan Morton Dershowitz (; born September 1, 1938) is an American lawyer and academic. He is a scholar of United States constitutional law and criminal law, and a noted civil libertarian. He spent most of his career at Harvard Law School where in 1967, at the age of 28, he became the youngest full professor of law in its history. He held the Felix Frankfurter professorship there from 1993 until his retirement in December 2013. He is now a regular CNN and Fox News contributor and political and legal analyst.\n\nDershowitz has been involved in a number of high-profile legal cases and is a prominent commentator on the Arab–Israeli conflict. As a criminal appellate lawyer, he won 13 of the 15 murder and attempted murder cases he handled and has represented a series of celebrity clients, including Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, and Jim Bakker. His most notable cases include the successful appeal of Claus von Bülow's 1982 conviction for the attempted murder of his wife Sunny and the 1995 O. J. Simpson murder trial in which he served on the \"Dream Team\" alongside Johnnie Cochran and F. Lee Bailey as an appellate adviser.\n\nA political liberal, he is the author of a number of books about politics and the law, including \"Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow Case\" (1985), the basis of the 1990 film; \"Chutzpah\" (1991); \"Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O.J. Simpson Case\" (1996); \"The Case for Israel\" (2003); \"Rights From Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights\" (2004); and \"The Case for Peace\" (2005). His two most recent works were both published in 2018: \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump\" and \"The Case Against BDS: Why Singling Out Israel for Boycott is Anti-Semitic.\"\n\nDershowitz has received some backlash from liberals and praise from conservatives for his defenses of President Donald Trump against calls for his impeachment and for his criticism of the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller.\n\nDershowitz was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on September 1, 1938, the son of Claire (née Ringel) and Harry Dershowitz, an Orthodox Jewish couple. He was raised in Borough Park. His father was a founder and president of the Young Israel Synagogue in the 1960s, served on the board of directors of the Etz Chaim School in Borough Park, and in retirement was co-owner of the Manhattan-based Merit Sales Company. According to Dershowitz, Harry had a strong sense of justice and talked about how it was \"the Jew's job to defend the underdog\".\n\nDershowitz's first job was at a deli factory on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1952, at age 14. He recalls tying the strings that separated the hot dogs and once getting locked in the freezer.\n\nDershowitz attended Yeshiva University High School, an independent boys' prep school owned by Yeshiva University, in Manhattan, New York City, where he played on the basketball team. He was a rebellious student, often criticized by his teachers. The school's career placement center told him he had talent and was capable of becoming an advertising executive, funeral director, or salesman. He later said his teachers told him to do something that \"requires a big mouth and no brain ... so I became a lawyer\". After graduating from high school, he attended Brooklyn College and received his A.B. in 1959, majoring in Political Science. Next, he attended Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the \"Yale Law Journal\", and graduated first in his class with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) in 1962. He was a member of a Conservative minyan at Harvard Hillel, but is now a secular Jew.\n\nAfter being admitted to the bar, Dershowitz served as a clerk for David L. Bazelon, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He said that, \"Bazelon was my best and worst boss at once ... He worked me to the bone; he didn't hesitate to call at 2 a.m. He taught me everything—how to be a civil libertarian, a Jewish activist, a mensch. He was halfway between a slave master and a father figure.\" During the 1963–1964 term, he served as law clerk for the Supreme Court Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg. He told Tom Van Riper of \"Forbes\" that getting a Supreme Court clerkship was probably his second big break; his first was when, at age 14 or 15, a camp counselor told him he was smart but that his mind operated a little differently. He joined the faculty of Harvard Law School as an assistant professor in 1964, and was made a full professor in 1967 at the age of 28, at that time the youngest full professor of law in the school's history. He was appointed Felix Frankfurter professor of law in 1993.\n\nMuch of his legal career has focused on criminal law, and his clients have included high-profile figures such as Patty Hearst, Harry Reems, Leona Helmsley, Jim Bakker, Mike Tyson, Michael Milken, O.J. Simpson and Kirtanananda Swami. Dershowitz also reports to have been one of Nelson Mandela's lawyers. He sees himself as a \"lawyer of last resort\"—someone to turn to when the defendant has few other legal options—and takes those cases that are what he calls \"the most challenging, the most difficult and precedent-setting cases\". He is currently advising Julian Assange's legal team.\n\nDershowitz retired from teaching at Harvard Law in December 2013.\n\nIn 1976, Dershowitz handled the successful appeal of Harry Reems, who had been convicted of distribution of obscenity resulting from his acting in the pornographic movie \"Deep Throat\". In public debates, Dershowitz commonly argues against censorship of pornography on First Amendment grounds, and maintains that consumption of pornography is not harmful.\n\nDershowitz represented Claus von Bülow, a British socialite, at his appeal for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny von Bülow, who went into a coma in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1980 (and later died in 2008). He had the conviction overturned, and von Bülow was acquitted in a retrial. Dershowitz told the story of the case in his book, \"Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow case\" (1985), which was turned into a movie in 1990. Dershowitz was played by actor Ron Silver, and Dershowitz himself had a cameo role as a judge.\n\nDershowitz, in his book \"Taking the Stand\", recounts that von Bülow had a dinner party after he was found not guilty at his trial. Dershowitz told him that he would not attend if it was a \"victory party\", and von Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for \"several interesting friends\". Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bulow's innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wife's arm and said: \"Let's get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.\"\n\nIn 1989, Dershowitz filed a defamation suit against Cardinal Józef Glemp, then Archbishop of Warsaw, on behalf of Rabbi Avi Weiss. Glemp had accused Weiss and six other New York Jews of attacking nuns at a much-disputed convent on the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Glemp's statement about Weiss, made in July 1989, was coupled with suggestions that Jews control the world's news media. Dershowitz's account of the lawsuit appears in his book \"Chutzpah\" (1991).\n\nDershowitz sued \"The Boston Globe\" in 1990 over a remark reporter Mike Barnicle attributed to him, in which Dershowitz allegedly said he preferred Asian women because they are deferential to men. Dershowitz reportedly received a $75,000 out-of-court settlement, and the newspaper's ombudsman questioned Barnicle's credibility, according to \"The Boston Phoenix\".\n\nIn the O. J. Simpson murder case, Dershowitz acted as an appellate adviser to O. J. Simpson's defense team during the trial, and later wrote a book about it, \"Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O. J. Simpson Case\" (1996). He wrote: \"the Simpson case will not be remembered in the next century. It will not rank as one of the trials of the century. It will not rank with the Nuremberg trials, the Rosenberg trial, Sacco and Vanzetti. It is on par with Leopold and Loeb and the Lindbergh case, all involving celebrities. It is also not one of the most important cases of my own career. I would rank it somewhere in the middle in terms of interest and importance.\" The case has been described as the most publicized criminal trial in American history.\n\nDershowitz was a member of the legal defense team for Jeffrey Epstein, who was investigated following accusations that he had repeatedly solicited sex from minors. Epstein's legal team investigated some of his accusers and provided both the police and the State attorney's office with a dossier containing information about plaintiffs' behavior, which had been obtained from their personal MySpace pages, including allegations of alcohol and drug use. Epstein eventually pleaded guilty in 2008 to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution and began serving an 18-month sentence.\n\nIn May 2018, it was reported that Dershowitz had joined Harvey Weinstein's legal team as a consultant for Weinstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman. Dershowitz advised the team on obtaining documents from The Weinstein Company related to the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein.\n\nDershowitz has said he is a member of the Democratic Party. However, in 2016, he stated that he would cancel his party membership if Keith Ellison was appointed party chair; Tom Perez was appointed instead. Dershowitz endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential election, and later endorsed the party nominee, Barack Obama.\n\nDespite his support for the Democratic Party, Dershowitz has been a defender for President Trump in some cases. In January 2018 he said that Democrats attacking the president's 'mental fitness' was a \"very dangerous\" line of attack. He has been adamant that there is \"no case\" for obstruction of justice against President Trump regarding the firing of FBI Director James Comey and has said that \"collusion\" as it is defined by Democrats and the media in reference to Russian meddling in the 2016 election is not a crime. He published a book in 2018, \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump\", where he argues against impeaching Trump.\n\nDershowitz defended Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against accusations by Julie Swetnick that he was present along with Mark Judge at a party where she was gang raped. Dershowitz said on Fox News, \"that affidavit is so deeply flawed and so open-ended that any good lawyer, any good defense attorney would be able to tear that apart in 30 seconds.\" Dershowitz called on Swetnick's lawyer Michael Avenatti, who also is representing Stormy Daniels, to withdraw the affidavit because of inconsistencies but Avenatti said any inconsistencies were trivial.\n\nDershowitz, along with others, recommended to Donald Trump that he commute Sholom Rubashkin's sentence for bank fraud in the Agriprocessors case.\n\nIn June 2018, Dershowitz wrote an op-ed criticizing the American Civil Liberties Union, alleging that it had become an organization dedicated to advancing leftist policy goals and marginalizing conservatives and centrists. He wrote, \"The move of the ACLU to the hard-left reflects an even more dangerous and more general trend in the United States: the right is moving further right; the left is moving father left; and the center is shrinking... The ACLU’s move from the neutral protector of civil liberties to a partisan advocate of hard-left politics is both a symptom and consequence of this change.\"\n\nDuring the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, Dershowitz endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her \"a progressive on social issues, a realist on foreign policy, a pragmatist on the economy\". In 2012, he strongly supported Barack Obama's re-election, writing, \"President Obama has earned my vote on the basis of his excellent judicial appointments, his consensus-building foreign policy, and the improvements he has brought about in the disastrous economy he inherited.\" In 2018, after a photo with then-Senator Obama and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan at a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus emerged, Dershowitz insisted that he never would have campaigned for Obama had the photo been publicized soon after it was taken.\n\nDershowitz has strongly argued against the criminalization of political differences and the legal investigations against Donald Trump, while also stating that Trump's alleged disclosure of classified information to Russia is “the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president.” He also campaigned against the election of Donald Trump during the United States presidential election of 2016 and has been critical of many of his actions, including his travel ban, his rescission of protections for “Dreamers” and Donald Trump's failure to single out white nationalists for their provocations during protests in Charlottesville.\n\nDershowitz is a strong supporter of Israel. He self-identifies as \"Pro-Israel and Pro-Palestine\", and said \"were I an Israeli, I'd be a person of the left and voting the left\". At the same time, he is on record as stating that both the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian people supported a genocidal war, and revere a figure, Amin al-Husseini, probably because, in Dershowitz's view, the latter actively participated in the Holocaust. In addition, he has criticized President Obama on his foreign policy stance toward Israel after the United States abstained from voting on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israel for building settlements in Palestinian territory. He has said, \"I will not be a member of a party that represents itself through a chairman like Keith Ellison and through policies like that espoused by John Kerry and Barack Obama.\"\n\nDershowitz has engaged in highly publicized debates with a number of other commentators, including Meir Kahane, Noam Chomsky, and Norman Finkelstein. When former U.S. President Jimmy Carter had his book \"Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid\" (2006) published - in which he argues that Israel's control of Palestinian land is the primary obstacle to peace - Dershowitz challenged Carter to a debate at Brandeis University. Carter declined, saying, \"I don't want to have a conversation even indirectly with Dershowitz. There is no need to debate somebody who, in my opinion, knows nothing about the situation in Palestine.\" Carter did address Brandeis in January 2007, but only Brandeis students and staff were allowed to attend. Dershowitz was invited to respond on the same stage only after Carter had left. He also authored an editorial in the Israeli newspaper \"The Jerusalem Post\" accusing Alice Walker of bigotry for refusing to have her novel \"The Color Purple\" published by an Israeli firm.\n\nHe also took part in the Doha Debates at Georgetown University in April 2009, where he spoke against the motion \"this House believes it's time for the US to get tough on Israel\", with Dore Gold, President of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Speakers for the motion were Avraham Burg, former Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel and former Speaker of the Knesset; and Michael Scheuer, former Chief of the CIA Bin Laden Issue Station. Dershowitz's side lost the debate, with 63 percent of the audience voting for the motion.\n\nIn his 2015 book, \"The Case Against the Iran Deal\", Dershowitz claims that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei has urged the Iranian military \"to have two nuclear bombs ready to go off in January 2005 or you're not Muslims\". On February 29, 2012, Dershowitz filed an amicus brief in support of delisting the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) from the State Department list of foreign terrorist organization.\n\nOn civilian casualties, he has said, \"In the age of terrorism, when militants don't wear uniforms, don't belong to regular armies, and easily blend into civilian populations,\" civilian casualties should be re-examined in terms of a \"continuum of civilianality.\" In one example, he writes: \"There is a vast difference - both moral and legal - between a 2-year-old who is killed by an enemy rocket and a 30-year-old civilian who has allowed his house to be used to store Katyusha rockets.\"\n\nRandall Adams of \"The Harvard Crimson\" writes that, in the spring of 2002, a petition within Harvard calling for Harvard and MIT to divest from Israeli and American companies that sell arms to Israel gathered over 600 signatures, including 74 from the Harvard faculty and 56 from the MIT faculty. Among the signatories was Harvard's Winthrop House Master Paul D. Hanson, in response to which Dershowitz staged a debate for 200 students in the Winthrop Junior Common Room. He called the petition's signatories anti-Semitic, bigots, and said they knew nothing about the Middle East. \"Your House master is a bigot\", he told the students, \"and you ought to know that.\" Adams writes that Dershowitz cited examples of human rights violations in countries that the United States supports, such as the execution of homosexuals in Egypt and the repression of women in Saudi Arabia, and said he would sue any professor who voted against the tenure of another academic because of the candidate's position toward Israel, calling them \"ignoramuses with PhDs\".\n\nIn March 2002, Dershowitz published an article in \"The Jerusalem Post\" entitled \"New Response to Palestinian Terrorism\". In it, he wrote that Israel should announce a unilateral cessation in retaliation, at the end of which it would \"announce precisely what it will do in response to the next act of terrorism. For example, it could announce the first act of terrorism following the moratorium will result in the destruction of a small village which has been used as a base for terrorist operations. The residents would be given 24 hours to leave, and then, troops will come in and bulldoze all of the buildings.\" The list of targets would be made public in advance. The proposal attracted criticism from within Harvard University and beyond. James Bamford argued in \"The Washington Post\" that it would violate international law. Norman Finkelstein wrote that \"it is hard to make out any difference between the policy Dershowitz advocates and the Nazi destruction of Lidice, for which he expresses abhorrence - except that Jews, not Germans, would be implementing it\".\n\nIn July 2006, Dershowitz wrote a series of articles defending the conduct of the Israel Defense Forces during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. There was an international outcry at the time regarding escalating Lebanese civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian infrastructure resulting from Israel's stated attempt to weaken or destroy Hezbollah. After the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour indicated that Israeli officials might be investigated and indicted for possible war crimes, Dershowitz labeled her statement \"bizarre\", called for her dismissal, and wrote about what he called the \"absurdity and counterproductive nature of current international law\". In a \"Boston Globe\" editorial several days later, he argued that Israel was not to blame for civilian deaths: \"Israel has every self-interest in minimizing civilian casualties, whereas the terrorists have every self-interest in maximizing them - on both sides. Israel should not be condemned for doing what every democracy would and should do: taking every reasonable military step to stop the killing of their own civilians.\"\n\nDershowitz is a strong supporter of gun control. He has criticized the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, saying that it has \"no place in modern society\". Dershowitz supports repealing the amendment, but he vigorously opposes using the judicial system to read it out of the Constitution because it would open the way for further revisions to the Bill of Rights and Constitution by the courts. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a public safety hazard don't see the danger in the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\"\n\nDershowitz took on a case of a 1% shareholder of the TransPerfect company and has been arguing that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Due Process under both, the 5th and 14th Amendments, apply for individuals even in a corporate issue. Dershowitz is an attorney for defendant Shirley Shawe and is looking to take the case of the Delaware Chancery's forced sale of TransPerfect away from its shareholders to the United States Supreme Court. Dershowitz has argued, and will argue to the Supreme Court that the Delaware Chancery court violated the personal rights of an individual shareholder when it ordered the public auction on the privately held company.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks, Dershowitz published an article in \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" entitled \"Want to Torture? Get a Warrant\", in which he advocated the issuance of warrants permitting the torture of terrorism suspects, if there were an \"absolute need to obtain immediate information in order to save lives coupled with probable cause that the suspect had such information and is unwilling to reveal it\". He argued that authorities should be permitted to use non-lethal torture in a \"ticking time bomb scenario\", and that it would be less destructive to the rule of law to regulate the process than to leave it to the discretion of individual law-enforcement agents. He favors preventing the government from prosecuting the subject of torture based on information revealed during such an interrogation. The \"ticking time bomb scenario\" is the subject of a play, \"The Dershowitz Protocol\", by Canadian author Robert Fothergill, in which the American government has established a protocol of \"intensified interrogation\" for terrorist suspects.\n\nWilliam F. Schulz, Executive Director of the U.S. section of Amnesty International, found Dershowitz's ticking-bomb scenario unrealistic because, he argued, it would require that \"the authorities know that a bomb has been planted somewhere; know it is about to go off; know that the suspect in their custody has the information they need to stop it; know that the suspect will yield that information accurately in a matter of minutes if subjected to torture; and know that there is no other way to obtain it\". James Bamford of \"The Washington Post\" described one of the practices mentioned by Dershowitz - the \"sterilized needle being shoved under the fingernails\" - as \"chillingly Nazi-like\".<ref name=\"Bamford\"/\n\nDershowitz is one of a number of scholars at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for limited animal rights. In his \"Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights\" (2004), he writes that, in order to avoid human beings treating each other the way we treat animals, we have made what he calls the \"somewhat arbitrary decision\" to single out our own species for different and better treatment. \"Does this subject us to the charge of speciesism? Of course it does, and we cannot justify it, except by the fact that in the world in which we live, humans make the rules. That reality imposes on us a special responsibility to be fair and compassionate to those on whom we impose our rules. Hence the argument for animal rights.\"\n\nShortly after the publication of Dershowitz's \"The Case for Israel\" (2003), Norman Finkelstein of DePaul University said the book contained plagiarism. Dershowitz denied the allegation. Harvard's president, Derek Bok, investigated the allegation and determined that no plagiarism had occurred. In an opinion piece supportive of Finkelstein written for \"CounterPunch\", Los Angeles attorney Frank Menetrez asserted that \"neither Dershowitz nor Harvard ... has identified the specific issues or arguments that Harvard allegedly investigated and rejected. In particular, neither of them has ever said whether Harvard investigated the identical errors issue\".\n\nIn October 2006, Dershowitz wrote to DePaul University faculty members to lobby against Finkelstein's application for tenure. The university's Liberal Arts and Sciences faculty voted to send a letter of complaint to Harvard University. In June 2007, DePaul University denied Finkelstein tenure.\n\nOn December 30, 2014, a Florida court filing by lawyers Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell alleged that Alan Dershowitz was one of several prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, to have participated in sexual activities with a minor later identified as Virginia Roberts, who was employed as a sex worker by financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dershowitz, a personal friend of Epstein, had represented Epstein in his 2008 criminal conviction. Dershowitz vehemently denied the allegations and challenged Roberts to make her claims under oath; on January 21, 2015, Roberts submitted a sworn declaration reaffirming the allegations. Juan Alessi, a worker at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, testified that Dershowitz was a regular visitor to Epstein's the Palm Beach residence but said he never witnessed Roberts and Dershowitz present at the same time. \n\nDershowitz sought disbarment of the lawyers filing the suit, Edwards and Cassell, while lawyers representing the alleged victim countered by filing suit against Dershowitz for defamation. That suit settled in 2016 for an undisclosed financial sum, with both parties dropping their actions against each other. Cassell and Edwards later said it was a \"mistake\" to include the allegations in their suit. Dershowitz also said he produced travel records and other documents proving his innocence and released a statement by former FBI director Louis J. Freeh, whom he had hired to investigate the matter, saying \"Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct.\" In a later Wall Street Journal op-ed, Dershowitz described what he said was unfairness in the United States legal system, saying lawyers can make false accusations against him or against other parties in court documents while the accused cannot sue for defamation due to litigation privilege. In April 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra, presiding over a 2008 lawsuit seeking to re-open the Epstein case, ordered \"sensational\" allegations against Prince Andrew and Dershowitz stricken from the record as having no bearing on the lawsuit's goal of re-opening the case.\n\nIn March 2006, John Mearsheimer, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, and Stephen Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, co-wrote a paper entitled \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\", published in \"The London Review of Books\". Mearsheimer and Walt criticized what they described as \"the Israel lobby\" for influencing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East in a direction away from U.S. interests, and toward Israel's interests. They referred to Dershowitz specifically as an \"apologist\" for the Israel lobby. In an interview in March 2006 for \"The Harvard Crimson\", Dershowitz called the article \"one-sided\", and its authors \"liars\" and \"bigots\". The following day on MSNBC's \"Scarborough Country\", he suggested the paper had been taken from various hate sites: \"Every paragraph virtually is copied from a neo-Nazi Web site, from a radical Islamic Web site, from David Duke's Web site.\" Dershowitz subsequently wrote a report challenging the paper, arguing that it contained \"three types of major errors: Quotations are wrenched out of context, important facts are misstated or omitted, and embarrassingly weak logic is employed.\" In a letter in the \"London Review of Books\" in May 2006, Mearsheimer and Walt denied that they had used any racist sources for their article, writing that Dershowitz had failed to offer any evidence to support his claim.\n\nDershowitz has been described by \"Newsweek\" as America's \"most peripatetic civil liberties lawyer and one of its most distinguished defenders of individual rights\". He was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1979, and in 1983 received the William O. Douglas First Amendment Award from the Anti-Defamation League for his work on civil rights. In November 2007, he was awarded the Soviet Jewry Freedom Award by the Russian Jewish Community Foundation. In December 2011, he was awarded the Menachem Begin Award of Honor by the Menachem Begin Heritage Center at an event co-sponsored by NGO Monitor. He has been awarded honorary doctorates in law from Yeshiva University, the Hebrew Union College, Monmouth University, University of Haifa, Syracuse University, Fitchburg State College, Bar-Ilan University, and Brooklyn College. In addition, he is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.\n\nDershowitz has also appeared as himself in a number of fictional television series, including \"Picket Fences\", \"Spin City\", and \"First Monday\".\n\nDershowitz's first wife was Sue Barlach. He is presently married to Carolyn Cohen and has three children. He is related to Los Angeles Conservative rabbi Zvi Dershowitz. Dershowitz's son Jamin married Barbara, a Roman Catholic, which was one prompting for Dershowitz's book \"The Vanishing American Jew\", dedicated to them and their children, whom Dershowitz regards as still Jewish.\n\n\n\n"}

She has now expanded her support for these special children including two schools, a college, a respite home and a website with over 50,000 international followers \nShe was appointed an OBE (Royal Reward for Inspirational Mother) Award by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2012 for her services.\n\nAnna born in Middlesbrough, to Maria and Antonino Sammarone. She studied at Sacred Heart School Middlesbrough. Before leaving to Italy, she had set up a dance school which was owned and run by her for a number of years. She married Sean Kennedy, a qualified legal solicitor, in 1998. They have two sons, named Patrick and Angelo, when these kids reached their school age, she then discovered that they were affected with autism spectrum disorders.\n\nIt was difficult for Anna and Sean to find a suitable education for their eight-year-old affected by Asperger Syndrome and a five-year-old with autism, therefore they started a support group in their home which grew rapidly and was attended by 275 families. They remortgaged their house in order to raise funds and to open a school with special educational needs for their kids.\n\nAnna and her husband prepared a feasibility report to convert a local school which was apparently to be demolished, into a school for Special Needs children. This school was the place to play and laugh together in the playground for pupils who had been bullied.\nAt that time, they took a huge financial risk by using their savings of £3000 and mortgaged their house in order to raise 627,000.\nVolunteers were also coming out to help them which include carpenters, electricians and painters. Anna also approached the Probation Service for volunteers to come and help them. Finally school for autistic children was opened in 1999 with only 19 pupils. Initially, this school had places for 14 children which were later increased to 63 places by 2002. The funding for places from local authority was based upon the condition that if parents of autistic children select this school as suitable place for their special children's needs. This school is now building a brighter future with safe and structured education for 150 special children. The school was subject to an emergency Ofsted report in January 2017, the report for which was published in March. The inspection, the report of which was published in March 2017, found that the school does not meet all of the independent school standards that were checked during the inspection.\n\nThe former Prime Minister's wife, Samantha Cameron, was invited to the official opening of a Specialist School set up by Anna Kennedy in Kent, South East London.\nShe has more than 50,000 online followers through her website including the parents of autistic children, professionals, media and those who are concerned with Autism. She is constantly creating awareness about Autism and making efforts to raise funds in order to continue their work.\n\nAnna also provides training for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and Child line with regards to the disability bullying issue and create awareness about autism all over the UK.\n\nIn 2009, Anna wrote a book named, Not Stupid which was about the struggle she had to set up the school for her kids.\nBased on the story of a mother who fights to rescue the lives of her children from autism this bestselling biography is available on Amazon.\n\nA fitness DVD, 'Step in The Right Direction' was a groundbreaking project which features a dance DVD, offering a clear picture of Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). It has been launched in Birmingham at the British Institute of Learning Disabilities Conference.\n\nAnna accepted a role as Patron in a bid to boost the profile of a charity called the Daisy Chain Charity which helps support families with autistic children. She has visited Calf Fallow farm, the home of Daisy Chain, to meet staff and see for herself the work being done there.\n\"This is really very good, I am very impressed,\" she said afterwards. \"The space available here is fantastic and just what is needed as we move forward and develop the services Daisy Chain provides. I am really excited about coming on board at this stage of development.\"\n\nIt was the first talent show organized by Anna on May 12, 2012. In this show, children and adults with autism performed on the stage at London's Mermaid Theatre.\nA performance from James Hobley, an autistic dancer was also included in this show who had appeared on Britain’s Got Talent.\n\nOn World Autism Day, a survey has been conducted about autism children. As to the survey report, 74% parents of Autistic children says that their children find difficulty to be social or even frightening breaks or lunch times in schools and colleges.\nHowever, 67% of the Asperger children reports that during lunch times they are taunted and bullied by others.\n\nDuring Autism Awareness Month in April 2013, ABA and Anna launched their 'Give Us a Break' campaign.\nThis campaign aimed to raise awareness about the bullying of autistic children in school and colleges, particularly during break times, highlighted the need for autistic children to feel safe by providing them opportunities to indulge in positive activities and to encourage schools and colleges to share the ways they can improve their social skills and keep them safe too.\n\nAnna Kennedy addressed the issues and tackled them which were faced by autistic children. She highlighted the activities that can keep children from bullying during lunch times. She also emphasised that there should be a strong communication between the parents and school which comes up with a 24-hour curriculum for the children in order to get a better idea about their behaviour all day and to prevent them getting mixed messages by parents and teachers.\n\nIn 2001, Anna also set up a community college for adults, a respite home in 2004 and a second specialist school in Bromley, Kent. This was inaugurated by Samantha Cameron.\n\nAnna has been awarded by an OBE (Royal Reward for Inspirational Mother) in the Queen's Birthday Honors by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for her services and campaigning work for autistic children.\nShe won an award named, 'Woman of the Year' in 2009 which runs with the collaboration of The Observer and Smooth Radio. Anna has been the recipient of the coveted Institute of Directors (IOD) Chairman's special award for her contributions to the community.\nShe is the “Achieving Mum of the Year” of Tesco Mum of the Year Awards 2013 for her campaigning work for autistic children.\nShe is an ambassador for the Outcomes First Group.\n\nAnna's story has been published in various magazines and newspapers including The Guardian, The Times, The Daily Mail, etc. Her story was appeared as 'pick of the day' an hour long Video Diary Documentary on BBC.\n\nSamantha Cameron hosted a show, where there were the five finalists of the Daily Mail's inspirational Woman of the Year Awards. Anna has been interviewed by her, in which she highlighted the facts about her children and struggle throughout the life for brightening her kids' future. Anna Kennedy had one-on-one interview with David Cameron where he discussed about Autistic provision plans for Special Educational Needs (SEN) by the Government.\n"}

{"id": "5743507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5743507", "title": "Beverly Hills Playhouse", "text": "Beverly Hills Playhouse\n\nThe Beverly Hills Playhouse is an acting school with theaters and training facilities in Beverly Hills, California, and also in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City. It is one of the oldest acting schools and theatres in Los Angeles County, California. It is located at 254 South Robertson Boulevard in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe location was originally home to the respected Bliss-Hayden School of Acting run by a husband and wife team of motion picture actors—actress Lela Bliss with over 45 credits stretching from 1915 to 1965, and her husband actor Harry Hayden with over 260 credits from 1936 to 1955. Veronica Lake, Mamie Van Doren and many other professional actors studied there.\n\nIn 1954, the Bliss-Hayden Theatre was acquired by Douglas Frank Bank and Jay Manford, and renamed The Beverly Hills Playhouse. This was a showcase for many productions written by Douglas Bank (\"The Preacher\", and \"Journey to a Lonely Star\") as well as well-known plays of the time including \"Jenny Kissed Me\", \"Room Service\", \"The Lawyer\", \"Harvey\", and \"The Second Man\". Many actors had performed there including Stanley Adams, Anne Baxter, Ken Mayer, Michael Fox and Louella Parsons, and directors Larry Stewart and Arthur M. Lowe, Jr., as well as others. They owned the theatre until 1959.\n\nIn 1978, Milton Katselas, the noted director and acting teacher, moved his already established and renowned acting classes to the location. For the next 30 years he taught such stars as George Clooney, Lana Parrilla, Alec Baldwin, Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Selleck, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ted Danson, Tony Danza, Jeffrey Tambor, Gene Reynolds, Tyne Daly, Mel Harris, Catherine Bell, Sofia Milos, Christy Carlson Romano, Jenna Elfman, Doris Roberts, Patrick Swayze, Miguel Ferrer, James Cromwell, Anne Archer, Larry Miller, John Glover, James Wilder, Jennifer Aspen, Jorge Garcia. In 2010, Joe Garvey took his first scene study acting class with teacher Art Cohan at the Beverly Hills Playhouse on Robertson blvd.\n\nThe Beverly Hills Playhouse is one of the city's oldest and most respected. The BHP is one of only a few schools that not only teaches the craft of acting, but also attitude and administration. With regard to acting technique, the BHP uses Katselas' approach, which is decidedly independent of the major acting philosophies of Stanislavski, Strasberg, Adler, Meisner, Hagen, etc. His experience as a director led him to a highly individual and adaptive way of training actors, mostly based in the simple observation and recreation of human behavior, along with an understanding of what's happening in the story. It is a down-to-earth training, with vastly reduced emphasis on exercises, and with techniques to create full, believable performances that enlighten and entertain.\n\nThere has been some controversy regarding the BHP and Scientology. This was because Milton Katselas was a well-known Scientologist, and as such drew the favor of Scientologist actors such as Anne Archer, Giovanni Ribisi, Marisol Nichols, Catherine Bell, Jenna Elfman and others who were his students as well. Some of the teachers on the staff of the school were Scientologists. During Milton's life there were persistent rumors that he was trying to proselytize his religion through his teaching - but the total percentage of students who had any connection with Scientology was never more than 10%, and in 2004 Katselas in fact fell out of favor with Scientologist celebrities. By 2007, almost all those involved with the movement left the school. Also, as Katselas was highly respected by countless non-Scientologist actors such as Doris Roberts and John Glover, his reputation remained primarily that of a first rate teacher above all else. Since Katselas' death in 2008, the BHP has been run by his longtime administrators Allen Barton, Gary Grossman and Art Cohan - longtime teachers in their own right at the school, and the BHP's connection with Scientology appears currently to be zero.\n\nThe BHP operates out of its headquarters in Beverly Hills, but also has a satellite operation in Los Feliz at the Skylight Theatre, as well as programs in San Francisco and New York City. Since 1984, it has also had an in-house non-profit theatre company (currently called The Skylight Theatre Company), which has produced hundreds of theatre productions, largely originated and fulfilled by the talent and interests of the BHP students. Its current focus under the leadership of Gary Grossman is the development of new plays, using the full array of talent available in the Los Angeles theatre community.\n\n\"A Christmas Held Captive\"\n\n"}

They wear a Blue Badge to indicate their professionalism. They are recognised by local tourist bodies throughout the UK, and by Visit Britain as Britain’s official tourist guides. There are over 2000 Blue Badge guides in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who guide at Britain's tourist attractions and cities. Some guides run guided walking tours on themes such as Jack the Ripper, Harry Potter and The Beatles. They are responsible for the regular 2012 Summer Olympics walking tours and are the guides for the summertime public tours inside the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe Blue Badge was founded in 1950 by seven guides who met at the George Inn in Southwark.\n\nIn 1980, eighty guides formed a union for London Blue Badge guides. The APTG - Association of Professional Tourist Guides - has 470 members.\n\nIn 1985 the Driver Guides Association was founded by Blue Badge Guides who provide private car tours across the UK.\n\nIn 1996, the Scottish Tourist Guides Association was formed as membership association for professional tourist guides, and the accrediting body for Blue Badge and Green Badge Guides in Scotland.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Tourist Guide Association was formed in 1992 and is the membership body for guides approved by the Institute of Tourist Guiding.\n\nIn 2002 the Institute of Tourist Guiding was formed. It is responsible for the examination and registration of Blue Badge and Green Badge guides in England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 2005 Blue Badge guides in England and Wales started offering cycle tours for groups and individuals\n\nWhen working guides wear the Blue Badge, it bears a symbol identifying the part of the country they are qualified for:\n\n\nIn 2011 there were more than 2000 guides in the UK and around 500 in London. Over 500 of these are in Scotland.\n\nSeveral Blue Badge guides have been awarded the MBE and OBE for services to tourism.\n\nThe Institute of Tourist Guiding sets a standard, examines and accredits guides in England. In Scotland, the Scottish Tourist Guides Association (STGA) sets the standards and accredits all the training courses. All Blue Badge guides must pass the Institute's exams or the STGA's exams. They study for up to two years at university level, taking a comprehensive series of written and practical exams which qualify them to become Blue Badge Tourist Guides.\n\nThe institute also sets standard for guides to work in foreign languages. There are Blue Badge guides working in most major languages, including French, Italian, Greek, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Polish and Spanish.\n\nAs well as the Blue Badge, the Institute of Tourist Guiding oversees further levels of qualification for tourist guides.\nIn Scotland Blue Badge Tourist Guides are national guides, while Green Badge ones are regional. In England, a Green Badge Guide is qualified to work in a specified area such as a city - for example the City of London Guides.\n\nThe British Guild of Tourist Guides was founded in London 1950. Originally known as The Guild of Guide Lecturers, the first London guides were trained by the British Travel and Holidays Association to show visitors a capital recovering from the ravages of war; in particular for tourists coming to London in 1951 to visit The Festival of Britain.\n\nIn 1995 the Guild changed its name to The Guild of Registered Tour Guides, and in 2015 it became The British Guild of Tourist Guides. The Guild helps tourists and visitors to find guides in the UK.\n\nThe Guild is the national membership organisation for trained professional guides in the UK. It has 1,575 guide members throughout the UK and 633 in London. There are 33 languages currently spoken by guide members. All members of the organisation must be fully trained and insured.\n\nThe Association of Professional Tourist Guides (APTG) is one of the leading membership organisations actively supporting and promoting Blue Badge Tourist Guides in London. Since its foundation in 1989, it has sought to promote the highest possible standards in tourism in general and guiding in particular.\n\nIt expects all members to adhere to a Professional Code of Conduct and works to ensure that the Blue Badge is upheld as a standard of excellence in guiding. It also campaigns on safety issues and lobbies Parliament to raise awareness of issues faced by Blue Badge Tourist Guides and the wider industry.\n\nAPTG has over 500 members who between them speak over 30 languages. The organisation supports the ongoing learning and development of members through a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programme and provides a wider network through which APTG members can support each other, covering information sharing, best practice and events.\n\nThrough its website www.guidelondon.org.uk, it actively promotes the skills and talents of Blue Badge Tourist Guides and provides a range of informative articles and features.\n\nAPTG supported the setting up of the Institute of Tourist Guiding and continues to be one of the prime movers in its development. It also plays an active role in the Federation of European Guides and the World Federation of Tourist Guides Association.\n\nThe Scottish Tourist Guides Association was created as a Company limited by Guarantee (Company No. SC167477) in 1996 and has a Board of Voluntary Directors, and four professional staff. In addition to the training and accreditation activities, the STGA ensures that all of their guides are fully insured with public liability insurance and Professional Indemnity Insurance. They also have a booking service to help clients find a guide to suit their requirements.\n\nTraining courses to become a blue badge guide in Scotland take place every two years. Information about the training course can be found here\n\nThe STGA are members of the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations and European Federation of Tourist Guides \n\nNITGA was formed in 1992 when the first Blue Badge Guides qualified at Queen's University Belfast.

{"id": "16245061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16245061", "title": "Boxer Indemnity Scholarship", "text": "Boxer Indemnity Scholarship\n\nThe Boxer Indemnity Scholarship (), funded by the , was a scholarship program for Chinese students to be educated in the United States. In 1908, the U.S Congress passed a bill to return to China the excess of Boxer Indemnity, amounting to over 17 million dollars. Despite the fierce controversies over returning the excess payment, President Theodore Roosevelt's administration decided to establish the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program to educate young Chinese generation. President Roosevelt recognized this program as a chance for “American-directed reform in China” that could maximize U.S’s profit by improving the U.S- China relations, bridging China with American culture, and promoting U.S’s international image. Instead of mimicking the European Imperialism and use military means to reap short-term financial gain, Roosevelt established the program to insure peace and trade in China in the \"most satisfactory and subtle of all ways\" , while helping United States gain respect and take its leadership position in the world.\n\nSince its inception, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program has been called \"the most important scheme for educating Chinese students in America and arguably the most consequential and successful in the entire foreign-study movement of twentieth century China.\"\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program, Yung Wing's Chinese Educational Mission also provided some higher education opportunities in the U.S. for Chinese students. As the first Chinese graduate of Yale University, Yung Wing persuaded the Qing government to send groups of young Chinese students to the United States to study Western science and technology in 1871. Beginning in 1872, with the support of some reform-minded officials of the Qing dynasty, Yung established the Chinese Educational Mission to send 120 Chinese students to study in the New England region of the United States. However, this short-lived effort was disbanded in 1881, a year prior to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and there was little subsequent activity.\n\nIn 1899, a group of Chinese nationals known as Boxers, rebelled against the Qing Empire in an attempt to expel all foreign influences in China. The uprising, later came to known as the Boxer Rebellion, began as an anti-foreign, anti-colonial, peasant-based movement in northern China, in response to foreign westerners seizing land from locals, concession grabbing, and granting immunity to criminals who converted to Catholicism. The insurgents attacked foreigners, who were building railroads and violating Feng shui, and Christians, who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In the summer of 1900, a coalition called the Eight-Nation Alliance comprising Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States sent troops to quell the rebellion and forced the Qing government to sign the Boxer Protocol, which required the Qing government to pay 450 million taels of fine silver as indemnity over a course of 39 years to the eight nations involved. Under the exchange rates at the time, this was equal to US$ 335 million gold dollars or £67 million. Including interest, the Qing finally paid 982,238,150 taels (~ silver), of which the U.S. share was 7.32%.\n\nIn 1904, as nationalism grew in China, the mistreatment of Chinese immigrants in America and the federal government’s renewal of Chinese Exclusion Act provoked anger throughout China. In the following year, the cumulated tension erupted as angry Chinese people launched a nationwide boycott against American goods . The boycott movement resulted in terrible consequences for American trade in China:\n\nAt the same time, Liang Cheng, the Qing representative to the U.S., learned that the terms of the Boxer Protocol awarded the U.S. more than it had originally demanded and initiated a campaign to pressure the U.S. into returning the difference to China. In addition, American missionaries in China, sympathetic to the suffering of the average Chinese family, were clamoring for the return of the excess Boxer Indemnity . Roosevelt seized this opportunity and set forth his intention to “do the Chinese justice about this indemnity” in his Atlanta speech as he declared: “we [Americans] cannot expect China to do us justice unless we do China justice”. Roosevelt realized that if the United States were to help China and return the excess of the Boxer Indemnity while all the other powers were taking its territory and exploiting its people, “by a very small effort the good-will of the Chinese may be won over in a large and satisfactory way”. However, William Rockhill, the U.S minister to China, strongly opposed the idea of returning the money to the corrupted Qing government, for he believed that the money would not escape their greed. Another solution had to be arranged.\n\nAmong the numerous proposals for the use of the remittance, Roosevelt inclined toward “cultural investment” through education, envisioning education as a huge bridge across the Pacific, through which the U.S could extend its influence to the Far East. As Japan and European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, the conservative Qing government finally sought to learn Western technology and adopt Western policies in order to reform China and meet the Western powers as equals. During that time, many of the Western-returned students such as Liang Cheng and Tang Shaoyi “formerly pushed to the margins of government and shunned due to their Western influence, were brought into power as the fortunes of reformers improved”. \n\nIn 1906, the President of the University of Illinois, Edmund J. James, who led the University from 1904-1920, proposed to President Theodore Roosevelt a plan to establish a scholarship program to send Chinese students to the U.S.. James' 1906 letter noted to President Roosevelt,China is upon the verge of a revolution ... The nation which succeeds in educating the young Chinese of the present generation will be the nation which for a given expenditure of effort will reap the largest possible returns in moral, intellectual and commercial influence.\n\nHowever, the tendency in China at that time was to “adopt the policy of Japan, and so engage Japan as her instructor” . As Japan’s military and political influence developed rapidly, Roosevelt administration could not allow the large influx of Chinese students to Japan continue rising and watch their Pacific rival take over China through intellectual domination. Therefore, he quickly “assented in April 1906 to the wisdom of Smith’s proposal” and decided to establish the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program to “turn the current of Chinese students” to America. The following year Roosevelt expressed this message to the Senate and House of Representatives in his annual address:\nMr. Roosevelt announces the intention of the United States Government to release China from all payments in connection with the Boxer war indemnity in excess of the sum necessary for the actual indemnity to the United States… The United States, he adds, ‘should help in every practicable way in the education of the Chinese people, so that the vast and populous Empire of China may gradually adapt itself to modern conditions. One way of doing this is by promoting the coming of Chinese students to this country and making it attractive to them to take courses at our Universities and higher educational institutions. Our educators should, so far as possible, take concerted action toward this end.’ \n\nAlthough President Roosevelt claimed that his intention was to help China “adapt itself to modern conditions”, he in fact aimed at directing the reform in China by creating an influential group of American-educated-Chinese leaders. With China’s reform-friendly environment, those American-returned students would occupy important positions in politics due to their knowledge of American bureaucracy. Their education in American high schools and colleges, which would take place at a formative period of their lives, would have “a substantial impact on their political, emotional and even physical development” . They would have a special sentiment toward America and would be grateful to the U.S government for their educational opportunities. Subsequently, they would seek to model the new China after the U.S rather than Japan, and prefer American goods. As Liang Cheng, the Chinese minister to the U.S. stated, this group of students would be able to “insure a peace and trade in the Far East that treaties and military forces cannot insure” . The magic of educational exchange could extend far beyond the educational field. It was, as Smith envisioned, the most “satisfactory and subtle” way to “reap the largest possible returns in moral, intellectual, and commercial influence”, because “trade follows moral and spiritual domination far more inevitably than it follows the flag”. The establishment of the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program was not only “an act of friendship” as Roosevelt claimed, it was also a cultural investment for bridging China with the U.S and a farsighted scheme for peacefully controlling China’s reform and development. \n\nDespite further proposals by the Chinese to use the funds within China, the settlement was made on American terms.\n\nThe program, set up in 1909, funded the selection, preparatory training, transportation to the U.S., and study for the scholarship beneficiaries. Part of the first remission of money included establishment in 1911 of a preparatory school (肄业馆 \"Yìyèguǎn\") in Peking (Beijing) for the Chinese graduates pursuing further studies at American universities. The preparatory school, established on 29 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden, was named Tsinghua College (; \"Qīnghuá Xuétáng\"). The faculty members for sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation. This school was later expanded to offer four-year undergraduate and post-graduate programs and became the renowned Tsinghua University.\n\nA second remission in 1924 provided for the establishment of the China Foundation (中华文化教育基金会 \"Zhōnghuá Wénhuà Jiàoyù Jījīnhuì\") which would in turn fund the China Institute in New York City in 1926.\n\nFrom 1909 to 1929, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program sent around 1,300 Chinese students to study in the U.S. Drawing candidates from across China, the examination process for this prestigious scholarship was highly competitive: among 630 candidates in 1937, only 47 were selected. In light of China's Self-Strengthening Movement during that time, the Qing government urged students to focus their studies on the fields on Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Medicine and Commerce. Massachusetts Institute of Technology was thus one of the most popular destinations. In 1929, after Tsinghua had become a true university itself, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program was opened to all candidates. \n\nA total of five groups of scholars were educated in the U.S. before the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.\n\nA number of prominent Chinese and Chinese Americans were beneficiaries of the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program, including philosopher Hu Shih, Nobel Physics prizewinner Yang Chen-Ning, electrical engineer Lee Yuk-Wing, mathematician Chung Kai-lai, linguist Chao Yuen Ren, educator Kuo Ping-Wen, rocket scientist Tsien Hsue-shen, meteorologist and scholar Chu Coching and architectural engineer Edward Y. Ying, who was influential in the planning of modern Shanghai. The scholarships served as a model for the Fulbright Program's grants for international educational exchange.\n\nThe remittance of excess payment and the establishment of the scholarship program also helped raise the international standing of the United States. In a letter to the Secretary of State John Hay, Liang Cheng, the Chinese minister to the United States wrote, “If your honorable country would take the lead [in returning excess indemnity payments], wherever the voice of righteousness spread, those countries would rise and follow it” . As the leader of an emerging super power, Roosevelt recognized the remission of Boxer Indemnity as an chance for the U.S. to assume leadership position in the world. Roosevelt later claimed after the remission: “we have the right to hope that the return of these funds to China will stimulate European Powers to take action similar to that just suggested, and that generosity on our part will be met by similar unconditional remission by them” . Roosevelt’s act later yielded significant results. U.S’s act of justice, friendship, and allowance greatly influenced other Powers:\n\nOther Governments, recognizing the beneficial effects of America’s earlier action in this matter, are proposing to take a similar step. The Japanese Government has announced its decision to remit Japan’s share of the indemnity. The French Government purposes to use its indemnity funds in the rehabilitation of a French bank in China. The British Government announced in December, 1922, that it would release its funds for purposes “mutually beneficial to Great Britain and to China…” \nThe remission of the Boxer Indemnity, as Roosevelt planned, helped the U.S to not only dispel the embarrassment caused by the boycott, but also build its international image.\n"}

She previously held an instructor position at Stanford University School of Medicine and has made ground-breaking discoveries in cancer research. Shachaf has spoken at scientific conferences and has published more than 17 journal articles. Her leading work was published in Nature (2004), \"MYC Inactivation Uncovers Pluripotent Differentiation and Tumor Dormancy in Hepatocellular Cancer.\" Shachaf is on the Editorial Board of the International Journal of Green Nanotechnology.\n\nPost doctorate fellow: Stanford University, Medical Oncology \nPh.D: Israel Institute of Technology, Molecular Medicine \nM.Sc: Israel Institute of Technology, Genetics \nB.Sc.: University of Haifa, Israel, Biology\n\nFOCIS Trainee Satellite Symposia Award, FOCIS (2008)\nAACR, Scholar in Training Award, Aflac (2008)\nYoung Scientist Clinical Award, FAMRI (2004–2009)\nComprehensive Cancer Center Translational Award, Stanford University (2005)\nRichard W. Weiland Fellowship, CCIS, Stanford University (2001–2004)\n\nShachaf has researched how MYC expression induces cancer in mice and the effect of its inactivation in those tumors. She showed that removing MYC expression kills the tumor and that MYC reprograms the tumor cells. When MYC expression is taken away from the tumor cells, they are released to their inherent embryonic program. The appearance of the tissue formed in this process looks normal by histology (a method used by pathologists to determine the presence of cancer cells). However, Shachaf showed that the cells derived from the tumor are \"camouflaged\" to appear normal but have the capability to easily revert and become tumors.\n\nThe MYC protein in cancers correlates with poor prognosis and is a difficult therapeutic target. To find alternative downstream targets of MYC, Shachaf defined levels of MYC expression required to drive tumorigenic properties. She conducted a systematic genomic and proteomic profile of MYC dependent tumor cells using microarray analysis, mass spectrometry, cell-antibody arrays and phospho-flow (a flow cytometry based approach to study phosphorylation events in single cells). As a member of the Stanford NCI funded Integrated Cancer Biology Program (ICBP), Shachaf and her colleagues developed a computational program of the genes and gene programs that are required to maintain cancers at different stages of aggressiveness. Using this program, Shachaf and her team found the gene silencing and apoptotic programs to be most significant in inducing tumor cell death.\n\nWith preventative treatment of tumor-prone mice prior to developing tumors, Shachaf showed that it is possible to block tumor development. This was achieved with a commonly used cholesterol lowering statin drug. The statin inhibited signaling pathways required for the tumor generating activities of the MYC oncogene. This study is an important demonstration in the efficacy of targeting tumors prior to onset.\n\nShachaf also leads the development of the use of Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy nanoparticles for the detection of signaling events in single cancer cells. RamanSpectroscopy relies on inelastic scattering, or Raman scattering, of monochromatic light, usually from a laser. Photons of the laser light are absorbed by the nanoparticles and then reemitted. The frequency of the reemitted photons is shifted up or down in comparison with original monochromatic frequency, called Raman scattering. Spontaneous Raman scattering is typically very weak. However, the Composite Organic-Inorganic Nanoparticles (COINs) used by Shachaf have enhanced Raman spectra. Each particle has a different Raman tag generating a unique fingerprint Raman spectra. This approach has tremendous advantages over the commonly used fluorescence tags. Fluorescence has broad overlapping spectra making the use of multiple tags simultaneously difficult. On the other hand, COINs have narrow peak spectra and therefore are more useful for multiple tag use.\n\n"}

Community organizing has as a core goal the generation of \"durable\" power for an organization representing the community, allowing it to influence key decision-makers on a range of issues over time. In the ideal, for example, this can get community-organizing groups a place at the table \"before\" important decisions are made. Community organizers work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and assisting in the development of campaigns.\n\nOrganized community groups attempt to influence government, corporations and institutions, seek to increase direct representation within decision-making bodies, and foster social reform more generally. Where negotiations fail, these organizations quickly seek to inform others outside of the organization of the issues being addressed and expose or pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. Organizing groups often seek out issues they know will generate controversy and conflict, this allows them to draw in and educate participants, build commitment, and establish a reputation for winning. Thus, community organizing is predominantly focused on more than just resolving specific issues. In fact, specific issues are often vehicles for other organizational agendas as much as they are ends in themselves.\n\nCommunity organizers generally seek to build groups that are democratic in governance, open and accessible to community members, and concerned with the general health of a specific interest group, rather than the community as a whole. Organizing seeks to broadly empower community members, with the end goal of \"distributing\" power more equally throughout the community.\n\nThe four basic types of community organizing are grassroots or \"door-knocking\" organizing, faith-based community organizing (FBCO), broad-based and coalition building. Political campaigns often claim that their door-to-door operations are in fact an effort to organize the community, though often these operations are focused exclusively on voter identification and turnout.\n\nFBCOs and many grassroots organizing models are built on the work of Saul Alinsky, discussed below, from the 1930s into the 1970s.\n\nGrassroots organizing builds community groups from scratch, developing new leadership where none existed and organizing the unorganized. It is a values based process where people are brought together to act in the interest of their communities and the common good. Networks of community organizations that employ this method and support local organizing groups include National People's Action and ACORN.\n\n\"Door knocking\" grassroots organizations like ACORN organize poor and working-class members recruiting members one by one in the community. Because they go door-to-door, they are able to reach beyond established organizations and the \"churched\" to bring together a wide range of less privileged people. ACORN tends to stress the importance of constant action in order to maintain the commitment of a less rooted group of participants.\n\nACORN has a reputation of being more forceful than faith-based (FBCO) groups, and there are indications that their local groups were more staff (organizer) directed than leader (local volunteer) directed. (However, the same can be said for many forms of organizing, including FBCOs.) The \"door-knocking\" approach is more time-intensive than the \"organization of organizations\" approach of FBCOs and requires more organizers who, partly as a result, can be lower paid with more turnover.\n\nUnlike existing FBCO national \"umbrella\" and other grassroots organizations, ACORN maints a centralized national agenda, and exerts some centralized control over local organizations. Because ACORN USA was a 501(c)4 organization under the tax code, it was able to participate directly in election activities, but contributions to it were not tax exempt.\n\nFaith-based community organizing (FBCO), also known as Congregation-based Community Organizing, is a methodology for developing power and relationships throughout a community of institutions: today mostly congregations, but these can also include unions, neighborhood associations, and other groups. Progressive and centrist FBCO organizations join together around basic values derived from common aspects of their faith instead of around strict dogmas. There are now at least 180 FBCOs in the US as well as in South Africa, England, Germany, and other nations. Local FBCO organizations are often linked through organizing networks such as the Industrial Areas Foundation, Gamaliel Foundation, PICO National Network, and Direct Action and Research Training Center (DART). In the United States starting in 2001, the Bush Administration launched a department to promote community organizing that included faith-based organizing as well other community groups.\n\nFBCOs tend to have mostly middle-class participants because the congregations involved are generally mainline Protestant and Catholic (although \"middle-class\" can mean different things in white communities and communities of color, which can lead to class tensions within these organizations). Holiness, Pentecostal, and other related denominations (often \"storefront\") churches with mostly poor and working-class members tend not to join FBCOs because of their focus on \"faith\" over \"works,\" among other issues. FBCOs have increasingly expanded outside impoverished areas into churches where middle-class professionals predominate in an effort to expand their power to contest inequality.\n\nBecause of their \"organization of organizations\" approach, FBCOs can organize large numbers of members with a relatively small number of organizers that generally are better paid and more professionalized than those in \"door-knocking\" groups like ACORN.\n\nFBCOs focus on the long-term development of a culture and common language of organizing and on the development of relational ties between members. They are more stable during fallow periods than grassroots groups because of the continuing existence of member churches.\n\nFBCOs are 501(c)3 organizations. Contributions to them are tax exempt. As a result, while they can conduct campaigns over \"issues\" they cannot promote the election of specific individuals.\n\nBroad-based organizations intentionally recruit member institutions that are both secular and religious. Congregations, synagogues, temples and mosques are joined by public schools, non-profits, and labor and professional associations. Organizations of the Industrial Areas Foundation are explicitly broad-based and dues-based. Dues-based membership allows IAF organizations to maintain their independence; organizations are politically non-partisan and do not pursue or accept government funding. Broad-based organizations aim to teach institutional leaders how to build relationships of trust across racial, faith, economic and geographic lines through individual, face-to-face meetings. Other goals include internally strengthening the member institutions by developing the skills and capacities of their leaders and creating a vehicle for ordinary families to participate in the political process. The Industrial Areas Foundation sees itself as a \"university of public life\" teaching citizens the democratic process in the fullest sense.\n\nWhile community organizing groups often engage in protest actions designed to force powerful groups to respond to their demands, protest is only one aspect of the activity of organizing groups. To the extent that groups' actions generate a sense in the larger community that they have \"power,\" they are often able to engage with and influence powerful groups through dialogue, backed up by a history of successful protest-based campaigns. Similar to the way unions gain recognition as the representatives of workers for a particular business, community organizing groups can gain recognition as key representatives of particular communities. In this way, representatives of community organizing groups are often able to bring key government officials or corporate leaders to the table without engaging in \"actions\" because of their reputation. As Alinsky said, \"the first rule of power tactics\" is that \"power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.\" The development of durable \"power\" and influence is a key aim of community organizing.\n\n\"Rights-based\" community organizing, in which municipal governments are used to exercise community power, was first experimented with by the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF.org) in Pennsylvania, beginning in 2002. Community groups are organized to influence municipal governments to enact local ordinances. These ordinances challenge preemptive state and federal laws that forbid local governments from prohibiting corporate activities deemed harmful by community residents. The ordinances are drafted specifically to assert the rights of \"human and natural communities,\" and include provisions that deny the legal concepts of \"corporate personhood,\" and \"corporate rights.\" Since 2006 they have been drafted to include the recognition of legally enforceable rights for \"natural communities and ecosystems.\"\n\nAlthough this type of community organizing focuses on the adoption of local laws, the intent is to demonstrate the use of governing authority to protect community rights and expose the misuse of governing authority to benefit corporations. As such, the adoption of rights-based municipal ordinances is not a legal strategy, but an organizing strategy. Courts predictably deny the legal authority of municipalities to legislate in defiance of state and federal law. Corporations and government agencies that initiate legal actions to overturn these ordinances have been forced to argue in opposition to the community's right to make governing decisions on issues with harmful and direct local impact.\n\nThe first rights-based municipal laws prohibited corporations from monopolizing horticulture (factory farming), and banned corporate waste dumping within municipal jurisdictions. More recent rights-based organizing, in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, Virginia and California has prohibited corporate mining, large-scale water withdrawals and chemical trespass. A similar attempt was made by Denton, Texas to restrict fracking was initially successful, but then overturned and further legislation passed to prevent Texas communities from enacting similar bans.\n\nCommunity organizing is not solely the domain of progressive politics, as dozens of fundamentalist organizations are in operation, such as the Christian Coalition. However, the term \"community organizing\" generally refers to more progressive organizations, as evidenced, for example, by the reaction against community organizing in the 2008 US presidential election by Republicans and conservatives on the web and elsewhere.\n\nOrganizing groups often struggle to find resources. They rarely receive funding from government since their activities often seek to contest government policies. Foundations and others who usually fund service activities generally don't understand what organizing groups do or how they do it, or shy away from their contentious approaches. The constituency of progressive and centrist organizing groups is largely low- or middle- income, so they are generally unable to support themselves through dues. In search of resources, some organizing groups have accepted funding for direct service activities in the past. As noted below, this has frequently led these groups to drop their conflictual organizing activities, in part because these threatened funding for their \"service\" arms.\n\nRecent studies have shown, however, that funding for community organizing can produce large returns on investment ($512 in community benefits to $1 of Needmor funding, according to the Needmor Fund Study, $157 to 1 in New Mexico and $89 to 1 in North Carolina according to National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy studies) through legislation and agreements with corporations, among other sources, not including non-fiscal accomplishments.\n\nUnderstanding what community organizing \"is\" can be aided by understanding what it \"is not\" from the perspective of community organizers.\n\n\nRobert Fisher and Peter Romanofsky have grouped the history of \"community organizing\" (also known as \"social agitation\") in the United States into four rough periods:\n\nPeople sought to meet the pressures of rapid immigration and industrialization by organizing immigrant neighborhoods in urban centers. Since the emphasis of the reformers was mostly on building community through settlement houses and other service mechanisms, the dominant approach was what Fisher calls social work. During this period the Newsboys Strike of 1899 provided an early model of youth-led organizing.\n\nDuring this period, much of community organizing methodology was generated in Schools of Social Work, with a particular methodological focus grounded in the philosophy of John Dewey, which focused on experience, education, and other sociological concepts. This period saw much energy coming from those critical of capitalist doctrines as well. Studs Terkel documented community organizing in the depression era, such as that of Dorothy Day. Most organizations had a national orientation because the economic problems the nation faced did not seem possible to change at the neighborhood levels.\n\nSaul Alinsky, based in Chicago, is credited with originating the term \"community organizer\" during this time period. Alinsky wrote \"Reveille for Radicals\", published in 1946, and \"Rules for Radicals\", published in 1971. With these books, Alinsky was the first person in America to codify key strategies and aims of community organizing. He also founded the first national community organizing training network, the Industrial Areas Foundation, subsequently led by one of his former lieutenants, Edward Chambers.\n\nThe following quotations from \"Reveille for Radicals\" give a good sense of Alinsky's perspective on organizing and of his public style of engagement:\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement, anti-war movements, Chicano movement, feminist movement, and gay rights movement all influenced and were influenced by ideas of neighborhood organizing. Experience with federal anti-poverty programs and the upheavals in the cities produced a thoughtful response among activists and theorists in the early 1970s that has informed activities, organizations, strategies and movements through the end of the century. Less dramatically, civic associations and neighborhood block clubs were formed all across the country to foster community spirit and civic duty, as well as provide a social outlet.\n\nDuring these decades, the emergence of an ongoing process of white flight, the ability of middle-class white Americans to move out of majority Black areas, and the professionalization of community organizations into 501(c)3 nonprofits, among other issues, increasingly dissolved the tight ethnic and racial communities that had been so prevalent in urban areas during the first part of the century. As a result, community organizers began to move away from efforts to mobilize existing communities and towards efforts to \"create\" community, fostering relationships between community members. While community organizers like Alinsky had long worked with churches, these trends led to an increasing focus on congregational organizing during the 1980s, as organizing groups rooted themselves in one of the few remaining broad-based community institutions. This shift also led to an increased focus on relationships among religion, faith, and social struggle.\n\nA collection of training and support organizations for national coalitions of mostly locally governed and mostly FBCO community organizing groups were founded in the Alinsky tradition. The Industrial Areas Foundation was the first, created by Alinsky himself in 1940. The other key organizations include ACORN, PICO National Network, Direct Action and Research Training Center, and the Gamaliel Foundation. The role of the organizer in these organizations was \"professionalized\" to some extent and resources were sought so that being an organizer could be more of a long term career than a relatively brief, mostly unfunded interlude. The training provided by these national \"umbrella\" organizations helps local volunteer leaders learn a common \"language\" about organizing while seeking to expand the skills of organizers. The Midwest Academy, based in Chicago, provides week-long training in organizing nationally to organizers and leaders who are not part of these established national organizations. The Center for Third World Organizing provides training focused on \"change efforts in communities of color.\" CTWO advocates a process in which those that are most impacted are leading the fight for social change. CTWO offers multiple trainings that provide the tools needed to become an effective organizer.\n\nThe distinction between an \"organizer\" who staffs a community organization and \"leaders\" who make decisions and provide the public face of their groups was increasingly standardized over these years, even in many organizations not linked to \"umbrella\" training groups as the Alinsky tradition became increasingly influential.\n\nMany of the most notable leaders in community organizing today emerged from the National Welfare Rights Organization. John Calkins of DART, Wade Rathke of ACORN, John Dodds of Philadelphia Unemployment Project and Mark Splain of the AFL-CIO, among others.\n\nThere are many other notable community organizers: Mark Andersen, Heather Booth, César Chávez, Lois Gibbs, Ella Baker, Huey P. Newton, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Nader, Barack Obama, and Paul Wellstone.\n\nMore recently has come the emergence of youth organizing groups around the country. These groups use neo-Alinsky strategies while also usually providing social and sometimes material support to less-privileged youth. Most of these groups are created by and directed by youth or former youth organizers.\n\nPrior to his entry into politics, President Barack Obama worked as an organizer for a Gamaliel Foundation FBCO organization in Chicago. Marshall Ganz, former lieutenant of César Chávez, adapted techniques from community organizing for Obama's 2008 presidential election.\nAt the 2008 Republican National Convention, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani questioned Obama's role as a community organizer, asking the crowd \"What does a community organizer actually do?\", and was answered with resounding applause. This was seconded by the Vice Presidential nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who stated that her experience as the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska was \"sort of like being a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.\" In response, some progressives, such as Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN) and liberal pundit Donna Brazile, started saying that \"Jesus was a community organizer, Pontius Pilate was a governor\", a phrase produced on bumper stickers and elsewhere. Pontius Pilate was the Roman Prefect who ordered the execution of Jesus.\n\nAfter Obama's election in 2008, the campaign organization \"Obama for America,\" became \"Organizing for America,\" and has been placed under the auspices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Organizing for America sought to advance the president's legislative agenda and played an important role in building grassroots support for The Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nAfter the 2012 election OFA went through another transition and is now called Organizing for Action. This 501c4 organization focuses on training people to be community organizers and working on local and national progressive issues such as climate change, immigration reform and marriage equality.\n\nLondon Citizens began life in East London in 1996 as TELCO (the East London Communities Organisation) subsequently expanding to South London, West London and by 2011 into North London. London Citizens has a dues paying institutional membership of over 160 schools, churches, mosques, trade unions, synagogues and voluntary organisations. In the beginning small actions were undertaken to prevent a factory from contaminating the area with noxious smells and prevent drug dealing in school neighbourhoods. Over time larger campaigns were undertaken. Before Mayoral elections for the Greater London Authority in 2000, 2004 and 2008 major Accountability Assemblies were held with the main mayoral candidates. They were asked to support London Citizens and work with them on issues such as London Living wage; an amnesty for undocumented migrants; safer cities initiatives and development of community land trust housing. South London Citizens held a citizens enquiry into the working of the Home Office department at Lunar House and its impact on the lives of refugees and migrants. This resulted in the building of a visitor centre.\n\nCitizens UK has been promoting community organising in the UK since 1989 and has established the profession of Community Organiser through the Guild of Community Organisers teaching the disciplines of strategy and politics. Neil Jameson, the Executive Director of Citizens UK, founded the organisation after training with the Industrial Areas Foundation in the USA. Citizens UK (formerly the Citizens Organising Foundation) established citizens groups in Liverpool, North Wales, the Black Country, Sheffield, Bristol, Milton Keynes and London. TCC (Together Creating Communities) in North Wales is longest established beginning in 1995. It has been independent of COF since 2001. London Citizens' forerunner TELCO was formed in 1996. Milton Keynes Citizens began in 2010. The others had a brief and glorious start lasting roughly 3 years when COF was unable to finance them any longer.\n\nTogether Creating Communities in North East Wales is remarkable in community organising in that its area of operation includes substantial rural areas. Its current membership of 40 groups includes churches, schools and the Wrexham Muslim Association as well as community groups. Amongst its actions, it has successfully prevented a waste incinerator being built in Wrexham, and in 2010 secured the appointment of a specialist nurse for Parkinson's Disease sufferers. It has held accountability meetings for Westminster and Welsh Assembly Elections in 2001, 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011.\n\nManchester Changemakers was formed in 2007 and is independent of Citizens UK.\n\nIn May 2010 Citizens UK held a General Election Assembly at the Methodist Central Hall Westminster with 2,500 people from member institutions and the world media present. This event was three days before the election and proved to be one of the most dynamic and electric events of the election campaign. Citizens UK had negotiated to have David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown as the leaders of the three main political parties attend. Each candidate for Prime Minister was questioned on stage concerning their willingness to work with Citizens UK if elected. Each undertook to work with Citizens UK and come to future assemblies to give account of work achieved. In particular they agreed to work to introduce the Living Wage and to end the practice of holding children of refugee families in detention.\n\nIn 1994, the city of Baltimore passed the first living-wage law in the USA. This changed the working and living conditions of Baltimore's low-wage service workers and established an example for other cities in the USA. In London it was a campaign launched in 2001 by London Citizens, the largest civil alliance in the Citizens UK network.\nThe Living Wage Campaign calls for every worker in the country to earn enough to provide their family with the essentials of life. Launched by London Citizens in 2001, the campaign had by 2010 persuaded more than 100 employers to pay the Living wage and won over £40 million of Living Wages, lifting 6,500 families out of working poverty.\nThe Living Wage is a number. An hourly rate, set independently, every year (by the Greater London Authority in London). It is calculated according to cost of living and gives the minimum pay rate required for a worker to provide their family with the essentials of life. In London the 2010-11 rate was £7.85 per hour.\nLondon is now being copied by other cities around the UK. As a result, Citizens UK set up the Living Wage Foundation in 2011 to provide companies with intelligence and accreditation. It also moderates the hourly rate applicable for the Living Wage outside London.\n\nWhen London announced it would bid to be the host city for the Olympic Games in 2012, London citizens used their power to gain a lasting legacy for Londoners from the billions that was to be spent. Following on from hundreds of one-to-one meetings and a listening campaign across member institutions, in 2004 London Citizens signed an historic agreement with the London 2012 bid team, which set in stone precisely what the people of east London could expect in return for their support in hosting the Olympic Games.\nThe People's Promises, as they are known, demanded:\nThe Olympic Delivery Authority, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Olympic Legacy Company work with London Citizens to ensure that these promises are delivered.\n\nCitizens UK set up the Independent Asylum Commission in order to investigate widespread concern about the way refugees and asylum seekers were being treated by the UK Border Agency (now, UK Visas and Immigration). The report made a series of over 200 recommendations for change which are still being negotiated. This resulted in the ending of the practice of holding children of refugee families in detention by the Coalition government elected in 2010.\n\nIn 2010 the Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government pledged as part of its commitment to the Big Society to train a new generation of Community Organisers (CO) programme. This policy aim sat alongside a number of other policy objectives including The Localism Act all of which were designed to give new powers to communities to take great control over their neighbourhoods, services and assets. In 2011 Locality were awarded the Cabinet Office Contract to train this new generation of Community Organisers.\n\nThe Cabinet Office commissioned Ipsos MORI and NEF Consulting to conduct the evaluation of the CO programme. Evaluation work began in October 2012 and the main report, published in December 2015, summarises the final assessment of the programme.\n\nThis evaluation considers how effective the CO programme has been and the social impact it has achieved. It includes both primary and secondary data collection and analysis, including online surveys of programme participants, longitudinal community-based case studies, and analysis of management information. As personal summary of the report was published in the Civil Service Quarterly entitled \"Social change through local action\".\n\nA key commitment of the Community Organisers (CO) programme, was to build an independent legacy body that would sustain and develop Community Organising in England. Established in 2015, The Company of Community Organisers is the National Training and Membership body for Community Organisers in England, delivering accredited training.\n\nIn December 2015, Rob Wilson MP in his capacity as Minister for Civil Society pledged to train a further 3500 community organisers between 2016 and 2020.\n\nACORN UK was formed by 100 tenants supported by 3 staff organisers in Easton, Bristol in May 2014 who voted to organise for more security, better quality and more affordable housing. ACORN has since hired more staff and organised branches in Newcastle and recently Sheffield and the organisation involves 15,000 members. ACORN UK has combined online organising via social media with ACORNs traditional door-knocking approach, to organise transient private sector tenants. The group has also combined local direct-action \"member defense\" actions (including eviction resistances and picketing of rogue landlords/letting agents) with larger regional and national campaigns for housing rights (for example winning regional local authority support for including the standards of their \"ethical lettings charter\" in the regional West of England Rental Standard and persuading Santander bank to drop a buy to let mortgage clause requiring landlords to raise rents). They also worked alongside Generation Rent to register and mobilise the \"renters vote\" in the 2016 general election.\n\nLiving Rent is Scotlands tenant union, also affiliated to ACORN International. The group formed out of the Living Rent campaign in 2015 and today has branches in Glasgow and Edinburgh and two organising staff.\n\nIn March 2017, The Company of Community Organisers (COLtd) secured a major £4.2m contract from the Office for Civil Society, part of the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS), to expand its movement of Community Organisers from 6,500 to 10,000 by 2020.\n\nThe programme plans to embed community organising as part of the fabric of neighbourhoods across England and equip local people with the skills to transform their communities for good. It will expand the community organising movement to include young people from the National Citizen Service (NCS) and ambassadors for the #iwill social action campaign for 10 to 20-year-olds. The programme will also establish the National Academy for Community Organising to sustain the ongoing training of Community Organisers.\n\nCommunity organising in the UK is distinctive because it deliberately sets out to build permanent alliances of citizens to exercise power in society. The UK analysis is that to understand Society it is necessary to distinguish Civil Society from the State and the Market. In a totalitarian Society all three may virtually coincide. In a fully democratic society the three will be distinct. Where the state and the market become predominant, even in a democracy, civil society is reduced on the one hand to voting and volunteering and on the other to consuming. This is very dangerous for democracy because the sense of citizenship and agency becomes feeble and ineffective. In other words, Civil Society becomes powerless.\nCommunity organising and the role of the professional Community Organiser is working out how to take back power from the State and the Market by holding them accountable. The state and the market cannot operate without moral values and direction. It is not the role of the state or the market to determine those values. In a democratic society there has to be a genuine public discourse concerning justice and the common good. Problems with the global banking system in 2008 in large part arose because \"light touch regulation\" meant that there was no underlying moral system. The market was left to its own devices with disastrous consequences for the global economy.\n\nCommunity organising works because it organises people and money through the institutions which have the potential to engage in the public discourse about what is the common good. These are the institutions which can mediate between the family and the State – such as faith organisations, cooperatives, schools, trades unions, universities and voluntary agencies. Community organising builds these institutions into permanent citizens membership alliances which work together to identify issues and agree ways of introducing solutions. Community organising teaches the art of non partisan, democratic politics. Because community organising brings together diverse institutions which do not normally work together it is sometimes referred to as Broad Based community organising.\n\nCommunity organising starts with the recognition that change can only come about when communities come together to compel public authorities and businesses to respond to the needs of ordinary people. It identifies and trains leaders in diverse communities, bringing them together to voice their needs and it organises campaigns to ensure that these needs are met.\n\"Our answer is to organise people through the places where they have regular contact with their neighbours – faith institutions and workplaces and educational establishments. Our experience of practising broad based community organising across the UK has confirmed for us that the threads that once connected the individual to the family, the family to their community and the community to the wider society are fraying and in danger of breaking altogether. We believe these strands, connections and alliances are vital for a healthy democracy and should be the building blocks of any vibrant civil society.\nWe believe in building for power which is fundamentally reciprocal, where both parties are influenced by each other and mutual respect develops. The power and influence that we seek is tempered by our religious teachings and moral values and is exercised in the fluid and ever-changing relationship with our fellow leaders, allies and adversaries. We value and seek to operate in the public sphere. We believe that UK public life should be occupied not just by a few celebrities and politicians – but also by the people themselves seeking a part of the action.\"\n\nCitizens UK set up the Institute for Community Organising (ICO) as part of its Centre for Civil Society established in 2010 in response to growing demands for its training. The ICO is the first operating division of the Centre and was established to offer a series of training opportunities for those who wish to make community organising a full or part-time career and also for Community Leaders who wish to learn the broad philosophy and skills of community organising and who are in a position to put them into practice in their institutions and neighbourhoods. The Institute provides training and consultancy on a commercial basis to other agencies which wish to employ the skills and techniques of community organising in their institutions. The ICO has an Academic Advisory Board and an International Professional Advisory Body drawn from the global network of Community Organising Institutes in the UK (CITIZENS UK), USA (Industrial Areas Foundation) and Germany (DICO).\n\nSince 2000, active discussion about community organizing had begun in Sydney. A community organizing school was held in 2005 in Currawong, involving unions, community organizations and religious organizations. In 2007, Amanda Tattersall, a union and community organizer, approached Unions NSW to sponsor the initial stages of a new community organizing coalition called the Sydney Alliance. She had learned about community organizing from interest in coalitions between unions and community organizations, reading Saul Alinsky and spending time with a variety of community organizations in the US and UK.\n\nBy November 2007, thirteen organizations had agreed to sponsor the building of an Alliance in Sydney, including the Uniting Church Synod, the Jewish Board of Deputies and six unions. By November 2008, twenty two organizations had joined, including the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church. By mid-2010 it was 28 organizations. The Sydney Alliance launched on 15 September 2011 with 43 organisations and is supporting the establishment of other community organizing coalitions across the country.\n\nOne of Alinsky's associates, Presbyterian minister Herbert White, became a missionary in South Korea and the Philippines and brought Alinsky's ideas, books and materials with him. He helped start a community organization in the Manila slum of Tondo in the 1970s. The concepts of community organizing spread through the many local NGO and activists groups in the Philippines.\n\nFilipino community organizers melded Alinsky's ideas with concepts from liberation theology, a pro-poor theological movement in the developing world, and the philosophy of Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire. They found this community organizing a well-suited method to work among the poor during the martial law era of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Unlike the communist guerrillas, community organizers quietly worked to encourage critical thinking about the status quo, facilitate organization and the support the solving of concrete collective problems. Community organizing was thus able to lay the groundwork for the People Power Revolution of 1986, which nonviolently pushed Marcos out of power.\n\nA 1974 manual summarizing some of the Filipino experience of community organizing \"Organizing People for Power\" actually became quite popular in the South Africa, among activist groups organizing communities in Soweto.\n\nThe concepts of community organizing have now filtered into many international organizations as a way of promoting participation of communities in social, economic and political change in developing countries. This is often referred to as participatory development, participatory rural appraisal, participatory action research or local capacity building. Robert Chambers has been a particularly notable advocate of such techniques.\n\nIn 2004, members and staff of ACORN created ACORN International which has since developed organization and campaigns in Peru, India, Canada, Kenya, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Honduras, the Czech Republic, Italy and elsewhere.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2283073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283073", "title": "Exergaming", "text": "Exergaming\n\nFitness game, exergaming or exer-gaming (a portmanteau of \"exercise\" and \"gaming\"), or gamercising is a term used for video games that are also a form of exercise. Exergaming relies on technology that tracks body movement or reaction. The genre has been credited with upending the stereotype of gaming as a sedentary activity, and promoting an active lifestyle. Exergames are seen as evolving from technology changes aimed at making video games more fun.\n\nThe genre's roots can be found in games released in the late eighties, including the Power Pad (or Family Trainer) released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1986, and the Foot Craz released for the Atari 2600 in 1987, although both had limited success. Konami's \"Dance Dance Revolution\" (1997) was cited as one of the first major successes of exergaming; when it was ported from the arcade to PlayStation, it sold over three million copies. In the 2000s, a number of devices and games have used the exergame style to much success: the EyeToy camera has sold over ten million units, while Nintendo's \"Wii Fit\" has sold in excess of 21 million copies. By June 2009, health games were generating revenues of $2 billion, largely due to \"Wii Fit's\" 18.22 million sales at the time. The term exergaming entered the \"Collins English Dictionary\" in 2007.\n\nThe genre has been mooted as a way to improve users' health through exercise, but few studies have been undertaken to measure the health benefits. Smaller trials have yielded mixed results and have shown that the respective traditional methods of exercise are superior to their video game equivalents.\n\nExergaming contains elements that were developed in the virtual reality community during the 1980s. The pioneer in this area was Autodesk, which developed two systems, the \"HighCycle\" and \"Virtual Racquetball\". The \"HighCycle\" was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape. If the user pedaled fast enough, the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape. \"Virtual Racquetball\" tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet that was used to hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment. This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet, allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines. In both systems, the users could wear the \"VPL eyephones\", an early head-mounted display (HMD), that would provide more immersion for the user.\n\nThe first true attempt at what would later be called Exertainment was the Atari \"Puffer\" project (1982). This was an exercise bike that would hook up to an Atari 400/800 or 5200 system. Forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering and additional gameplay was handled by a handlebar-mounted Gamepad. The machine was nearly ready for production with several games (\"Tumbleweeds\" and \"Jungle River Cruise\") when Atari declared bankruptcy and the Puffer project was abandoned. Nintendo also dabbled in this space with the Power Pad, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986.\n\nThe first exergaming system released to the market was the 1986 \"Computrainer\". Designed as a training aid and motivational tool, the \"Computrainer\" allowed users to ride through a virtual landscape generated on an NES, while monitoring data such as power output and pedaling cadence. The product had a price that was far too high to be considered as an entertainment product, but was affordable by dedicated athletes. The product continues to this day, where it now runs using Microsoft Windows compatible software with extensive graphic and physiological capabilities.\n\nAlso released for the NES in 1986 was the Family Trainer, which focused on entertainment rather than exercise.\n\nAbout the same time as the Computrainer, Concept II introduced a computer attachment for their rowing machine. This has become their \"eRow\" product and is used for both individual motivation as well as competition in \"indoor rowing leagues\".\n\nDuring the 1990s, there was a surge of interest in the application of \"virtual reality\" technologies to high-end gym equipment. Life Fitness and Nintendo partnered to produce the \"Exertainment\" System; Precor had an LCD-based bike product, and Universal had several CRT-based systems. The Netpulse system provided users with the ability to browse the web while exercising. Fitlinxx introduced a system that used sensors attached to weight machines in order to provide automated feedback to users.\n\nThree issues combined to ensure the failure of these systems in the marketplace. First, they were significantly more expensive than the equivalent models that did not have all the additional electronics. Second, they were harder to maintain, and were often left broken. Lastly the additional expertise required to operate the software was often intimidating to the users, who shied away from the machines out of fear that they would look foolish while trying to master the machine.\n\nUntil 1998, nothing significant happened in the field of videogame exercise. Hardware was still too expensive for the average home consumer, and the health clubs were gun-shy about adopting any new technology. As high-performance game console capabilities improved and prices fell, manufacturers once more started to explore the fitness market.\n\nIn 1998, Konami's Dance Dance Revolution was released along with Andamiro's Pump It Up (video game series) a couple months later.\n\nIn 2000, UK startup Exertris introduced an interactive gaming bike to the commercial fitness market.\n\nExergaming came to the mass media attention at the Consumer Electronics Show when Bill Gates showcased the Exertris Interactive Gaming Bike in 2003, and the following year the same show hosted a pavilion dedicated to video game technology that also worked as sports and exercise equipment.\nThe 2005 release of the brought the first multi-function exergame hardware into the home market. Making the players physical movements into the game's controller. 2006 saw the launch of Gamercize, combining traditional fitness equipment with game consoles. The minimalist approach allows game play to continue only when exercising, turning all game titles into potential exergames.\n\nNintendo's Wii in 2006 brought acceleration detection with the Wii Remote. In late 2007, Nintendo released the exergame Wii Fit, which utilized a new peripheral, the Wii Balance Board. The popularity of the Wii lead to it being used in hospital \"Wiihab\" rehabilitation programs.\n\nThe PCGamerBike appeared at CES in 2007 where it received an Honoree Award. It differs from other exergaming devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard. It also has an optical encoder which detects forward and reverse pedal motion. The Fisher-Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field.\n\nOther examples of exergaming products include: Positive Gaming iDANCE, iSTEP, Cobalt Flux Blufit, Cyber coach, NeoRacer, Gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology, some Wii titles such as EA Sports Active, Cybex TRAZER, Powergrid Fitness Kilowatt, Lightspace Play Floor, PlayMotion, Yourself!Fitness, Expresso Fitness S2, i.play, Cyber ExerCycle, VEQTOR Sport Trainer and Sportwall.\n\nThe Kinect (2010) represented a significant advance in how player motion was detected in games, because the player's body became the remote. The exergaming trend within consoles that started with the seventh generation Wii peaked with the Nike+ Kinect Training (2012) & pedometer-pairing Wii Fit U (2013) games. These were followed up in the eighth generation by a exergaming push by Microsoft with the Xbox One launch day Xbox Fitness service (2013), which tracked metrics such as heart rate and correct form while synchronising these metrics with the Microsoft Health. By 2017 Microsoft had pivoted away from Kinect and exergaming on consoles. \n\nMobile phone apps such as \"Zombies, Run!\" (2012), \"Run An Empire\" , \"Ingress\" (2013), and \"Pokémon GO\" (2016) have been described as augmented reality exergames.\n\nLaboratory studies have demonstrated that some exergames can provide light to moderate intensity physical activity.\n\nA 2018 systematic review of 10 randomised controlled trials of exergaming in overweight children found that they can produce a small reduction in body mass index.\n\nAs of 2016, exergaming for those with neurological disabilities had been studied in around 140 small clinical trials in people of all ages, to see if exergaming can help this group get enough physical exercise to maintain their health. This mode of getting exercise appears attractive in this population from a public health perspective because of its low cost and accessibility. Exergames have the potential to provide moderate intensity exercises in this population, but the evidence was too weak on long-term follow-up to draw strong conclusions.\n\nThere is significant evidence across multiple random controlled trials relating exergaming to improved cognitive functioning in healthy older adults (with a mean age of 69), and attenuated deterioration or improvement in adults with cognitive impairment from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn addition, studies investigated if exergaming can lead to improvements in cognitive performance in clinical and non-clinical population such as ADHD and depression. There are first encouraging results, but the empirical evidence still is limited. \n\nWhen making an exergaming system, the manufacturer of a consumer product must make the decision as to whether the system will be usable with off-the-shelf games or if custom software must be written for it. Because it takes longer for a user to move their entire body in response to stimulation from the game, it is often the case that dedicated software must be written for the game to playable. An example of this is Konami's \"Dance Dance Revolution\". Though designed to be played by users moving about on a specially designed dancepad, that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one's fingers using a standard hand-held gamepad. When played with the dancepad at higher levels the game can be quite challenging (and physically exhausting), but if the game is played using the buttons on the hand controller, none of the sequences are physically limited.\n\nNewer systems such as Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii use alternative input devices such as the Kinect and PlayStation Move. The Move uses image analysis to extract the motion of the user against a background and uses these motions to control the character in the game. A specifically designed exercise game \"Kinetic\", superimposes animated objects to be punched, kicked, or otherwise interacted with over a video image of the user. The Wii and PlayStation 3 both incorporate motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes into the hand-held controllers that are used to direct behaviors within the game.\nResearch projects such as exertion interfaces that investigate the design aspects of these games explore how the technological augmentation that comes with the digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits, such as utilizing the social power of exercising together even though players are connected only over a network or scaling the number of players, enabling novel exercise experiences not available without the technological augmentation.\n\nExergame resellers have developed fitness centers and specialist room designs with programmes that focus entirely on creating environments for young people using exergaming for fitness. Group fitness programmer Les Mills International has recently launched \"Immersive Fitness\" studios around the globe which combine exergaming with live group fitness classes.\n\nOne of the newest trends is using virtual reality immersion. VR systems have several potential advantages for athletic training; environments can be precisely controlled and scenarios standardized, augmented information can be incorporated to guide performance, and the environment can be dynamically altered to create different competitive situations . High frame rate display technologies for example Head-mounted display can be used to transform the user into any sporting situation e.g. a track cycling veledrome . Natural movements can also be incorporated into the games, for example utilizing an omnidirectional treadmill, such as the Infinadeck. Such a system allows the user to virtually be in the game while allowing 360 degrees of movement. While the technology is new, it is showing promising results in weight management as well as in high participation rates.\n\n"}
{"id": "458122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=458122", "title": "Gay–straight alliance", "text": "Gay–straight alliance\n\nA gay–straight alliance (GSA) is a student-led or community-based organization, found in middle schools and high schools as well as colleges and universities, primarily in the United States and Canada, that is intended to provide a safe and supportive environment for LGBT youth (or those who are perceived as such) and their cisgender heterosexual allies. A GSA may also be known by another name such as \"gender-sexuality alliance\" or \"genders & sexualities alliance\". In middle schools and high schools, GSAs are overseen by a responsible teacher. The first GSAs were established in the 1980s.\n\nIn the United States, the right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal Equal Access Act (with regard to secondary schools where other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools). Since 1998, there have been at least 17 federal court cases in which high school and middle school students have conclusively prevailed in defending the free exercise of their civil rights on this issue, with federal courts consistently ruling that students have both a right to establish a GSA at school and to use the name \"Gay-Straight Alliance\" instead of an alternative name. In 2000, the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of \"Colin v. Orange Unified School District\". In 2009, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of \"Gay-Straight Alliance of Yulee High School v. School Board of Nassau County\", with the federal court also ruling that the school must allow the students to use the name \"Gay-Straight Alliance\" instead of an alternative name that excludes the term \"Gay\". In 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit unanimously ruled in favor of middle school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of \"Carver Middle School Gay-Straight Alliance v. School Board of Lake County, Florida\".\n\nScientific studies show that GSAs have positive academic, social, and health impacts on schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe GSA Network is an LGBT rights organization was founded in 1998 by Carolyn Laub to empower youth activists to start GSA clubs in their respective schools to motivate and inspire fellow students to fight against homophobia and transphobia. Laub initially started working with this movement in 40 GSA clubs in the San Francisco Bay area during 1988–99 and then gradually expanded to other cities and states. By 2001, The GSA Network became a statewide organization having branches in other schools in different parts of the state. In the year 2005, it began operating programs nationally. The year 2008 saw the GSA network become incorporated as its own independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Prior to that, it was a fiscally sponsored project of The Tides Center. In 2015, the network hired two long time staff to serve as Co-Executive Directors to replace outgoing founder and Executive Director Carolyn Laub. In 2016, the \"Gay-Straight Alliance Network\" formally changed its name to \"Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network\" and continues to network organizations representing over 4000 GSA clubs across the nation. \n\nThe GSA Network organization is based in San Francisco and has regional offices in Fresno, Los Angeles and New Orleans.\n\nThe goal of most gay–straight alliances is to make their school community safe, facilitate activism on campus, and create a welcoming environment for LGBT students. They are part of the LGBT student movement and participate in national campaigns to raise awareness, such as the \"Day of Silence\", \"National Coming Out Day\", \"No Name Calling Week\", \"Transgender Day of Remembrance\", \"Harvey Milk Day\", \"GSA day\" or locally organized campaigns, such as \"Take It Back: Anti-Slur Campaign\", \"Beyond the Binary\", \"LGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum\" and others. Many GSAs work with local chapters of the \"Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network\" (GLSEN) or \"Gay–Straight Alliance Network\", a national organization supporting youth leadership. The registered number of GSAs with GLSEN is over 4000, as of 2008. In California, there are over 900 GSAs registered with \"GSA Network\", representing over half of California's high schools. Over half the states in the United States have one or more statewide groups that work with GSAs. Many of these state based groups and local chapters of GLSEN participate in the \"National Association of GSA Networks\". GSA Networks have been formed to help local area students to network and connect to local resources, provide training for youth leaders, and sponsor local GSA efforts.\n\nThe inclusion of heterosexual \"straight allies\" in the missions of these groups \"is an important distinguishing factor from early support groups for LGBT teens, and recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to youth safety,\" and attempts to build a network of support for non-heterosexual and transgender teens, as well as raising awareness of homophobia and heterosexism.\n\nLGBT students routinely experience harassment in their schools however, GSAs and other support clubs have been found to provide social support for LGBT students. Students have reported hearing homophobic remarks from both students and instructors in their schools. In addition, the more harassment students reported, the more likely the student also reported higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem. However, LGBT students attending a school with an active support club reported hearing less homophobic expressions and experienced less victimization than LGBT students attending a school without a GSA or support club. In addition, LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to high school belonging and school victimization.\n\nIn addition to the mere presence of a GSA on campus, level of participation in a GSA has also been linked to the amount of social support reported by LGBT students. A 2011 study by Toomey, Ryan, Diaz and Russell (2011) found that the presence of a GSA, participation in a GSA, and perceived effectiveness of a GSA were each individually associated with youth's well being. In certain cases, research showed these three factors protected youth's well being against victimization. Furthermore, youths who participated in a GSA reported lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem.\n\nGSAs are important not only at the individual level, but also to promote the education of LGBT issues to school populations. GSA's have been found to promote social activism. Researchers have argued that GSAs are a grassroots student initiated form of activism. The same researchers claimed that GSAs are important to challenge the status Quo, confront discrimination, and reconceptualize gender.\n\nLGBT youths in schools across the U.S. are subject to serious obstacles that may impact their ability to perform in school. A 2011 study found that two thirds of LGBT students reported feeling unsafe at school. Some students felt so unsafe that they reported missing school due to safety concerns. The same study found that the GPA of LGBT children was, on average, half a grade lower than straight. This may be an indicator that LGBT youth face different barriers to education than straight youth.\n\nLGBT youth's school experience may impact their life decisions. LGBT youth in high school were less likely to report that they wanted to pursue further education than straight youth. These findings suggest that LGBT youths' negative experiences in primary education relate to their decision not to continue on in the education system. This then robs LGBT youth of all of the opportunities that advanced education offers.\n\nHowever, an active GSA on a high school campus has been associated with better academic outcomes for LGBT students. LGBT youth attending schools with an active GSA were less likely to report feeling unsafe at school and were less likely to miss school due to a threat to their safety. Additionally, LGBT youths who had an active GSA at their high school reported higher educational attainment than LGBT youth who did not have a GSA on their high school campus.\n\nGSAs are associated with better mental health outcomes for LGBT students. LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported less depression less general psychological distress and higher self-esteem than students without a GSA at their high school. Students in schools that had an active GSA also reported less truancy). LGBT students with a support club in their school also reported lower levels of victimization and suicide attempts in comparison to schools without a support group).\n\nGSAs have also been associated with other reduced health risk factors. LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to alcohol use and problems related to alcohol use. LGBT students with support groups in their schools reported half as much dating violence and less casual sex. Students with an active GSA in their high school were also less likely to be threatened or injured at school in comparison to students without an active GSA.\n\nGSAs are associated with benefits for LGBT students while they are attending school and beyond. The next important step is to understand why GSAs are associated with these benefits. One qualitative study found that the most beneficial aspect of a GSA was that it provides direct support to LGBTQ members and helps create a support network for LGBT students by connecting them. Another qualitative study found that GSAs were beneficial to LGBTQ students because they act as a protective factor for LGBT students' educational and social experience in school. The study further explained that GSAs provided LGBT students with a sense of identity within their school, improved their self-esteem, and even provided students with courage and support to come out to their families and peers.\n\nOne study investigated some of the possible factors within GSAs to discover which specific components of GSAs were associated with which beneficial outcomes. This study found that when GSA advisors served for longer periods of time, students had better health outcomes. In addition, LGBT students who perceived they had more control over their GSA experience and LGBT students who perceived their school to be more supportive had healthier outcomes. In addition, this study reported that \"students level of GSA advocacy also predicted students' sense of life purpose.\"\n\nThe relationship between having a GSA in a high school and attitudes towards LGBT individuals does not end after high school. The mere presence of a GSA, whether or not students participated in said GSA, is related to students' attitudes toward LGBT people beyond their time in their high school. University students who reported having a GSA in their high school were more likely to report positive attitudes towards LGBT individuals while attending their university. This was true for all students except students whom were raised in the southern U.S. where having a GSA in one's high school actually correlated with less positive attitudes toward LGBT individuals.\n\nGSAs are associated with positive social academic and health outcomes for LGBT students. The relationship between having a GSA in one's high school and certain positive social outcomes is known to last beyond high school, however little beyond that is known about the long lasting associations with high school GSAs. Further research should be conducted on the lasting effects if GSAs for LGBT individuals. Researchers have also claimed that GSAs are important not only to LGBT students, but also to change the school climate as a whole to be more informed and respectful of LGBT issues. It has also been claimed that GSAs are important to get students involved in social activism. Researchers should investigate the relationship between having a GSA in a high school the school's social climate. Due to the positive associations between GSAs and student outcomes, school faculty including school psychologists and counselors should become social justice advocates for LGBTQ students by supporting GSAs on their campuses.\n\nThe various accomplishments since the founding of the GSAs include:\n\nDescribed as \"perhaps the most important precursor of the GSA movement,\" Los Angeles' \"Project 10\" is seen as the start of the GSA movement. Founded in 1984, \"Project 10\" was widely recognised as the first organised effort to provide support for LGBTQ youth in schools across the United States. The majority of its facilitators were heterosexual, and was named after the commonly-held statistic that 10% of the adult male population is \"exclusively homosexual\". \"Project 10\" focused on issues such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and discussing issues of high-risk sexual behavior.\n\nThe first GSA was started in 1988, in Concord, Massachusetts at Concord Academy by Kevin Jennings, the founder and head of the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network GLSEN. The first public school gay–straight alliance was started at Newton South High School (Newton Centre, Massachusetts) by teacher Robert Parlin. GSAs made headlines in 1999 with the Federal Court ruling in \"Utah–East High Gay/Straight Alliance v. Board of Education of Salt Lake City School District\". This ruling found that denying access to a school-based gay–straight alliance was a violation of the Federal Equal Access Act giving students the right to use facilities for extra curricular activities at any school that receives public funding—regardless of private standing or religious affiliation.\n\nOn January 24, 2012, Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, released a video on YouTube commemorating \"GSA Day\" and endorsing GSA clubs in schools.\n\nApproximately 28% of participants at GSA Network identify as heterosexual.\n\nSome students face opposition from school administrations, elected school boards, or local communities in starting a school GSA.\n\nIn 2015, students at Brandon High School in Rankin County, Mississippi, attempted to start a GSA, but the school board met and publicly stated they wanted to prevent the formation of \"gay clubs\" in the school district. They then created a policy requiring parents to provide written permission before a student can join any club. Students then protested with support from the ACLU.\n\nStudents at West Carteret High School in Morehead City, North Carolina tried to start a GSA but the Carteret County Board of Education turned it down. In 1999, the Orange Unified School District in Orange County, California moved to prohibit the formation of a GSA at El Modena High School. The students then sued the school board, claiming that their rights under the First Amendment and the 1984 Equal Access Act had been violated. In the first-ever ruling of its kind, Judge David O. Carter of the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a preliminary injunction ordering the school to allow the GSA to meet.\n\nThe right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal Equal Access Act (with regard to secondary schools as long as other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools).\n\nWorldwide, gay–straight alliances are not as popular as they are in the United States but are beginning to take-off slowly. In the UK, there has always been more of an emphasis on stand alone lesbian and gay youth groups that take place outside of the school setting, often funded by the local health authority or education service. The first GSA in the UK was founded in 2000 by CN Lester at Putney High School GDST, and led in part to the formation of Queer Youth Network. The second GSA in the UK was started in 2010 at Shimna Integrated College in Northern Ireland. Another GSA started in 2012 by Copland Community school in Wembley. The setting up of the club has subsequently resulted in the school being known for \"tackling homophobic prejudice\". Acland Burghley school in Camden set up a gay–straight alliance in 2012 called \"Connected\".\n\nThe first GSA in Mexico was begun by a group of students in 2004 at the American School Foundation, a private American school in Mexico City. The GSA was initially opposed by several school board members and a small group of religious conservative parents. But the students eventually won and formed the student club. The GSA's co-advisor, Ian K. Macgillivray, wrote several articles detailing his students' experiences, as well as the book, \"Gay-Straight Alliances: A Handbook for Students, Educators, and Parents\" (2007, Harrington Park Press).\n\nBeyond a school group the Toronto District School Board has been committed to an unwritten alliance with their students, funding the Triangle Program at OASIS Alternative School, designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who are at risk of dropping out or committing self-harm because of harassment in regular schools.\n\nThe first GSA in Canada was started at Pinetree Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1998. The start of the Pinetree GSA garnered national media attention, and its members continued to play a role in public affairs by meeting with successive provincial Ministers of Education, testifying before the B.C. Safe Schools Task Force on anti-bullying, and delivering workshops to students and educators about LGBT-sensitive inclusive language and how to start GSAs. In early 2002, the Pinetree GSA held the first Pride Day at a high school in Canada. The Pride Day included an information fair with booths from various local LGBT organizations, PrideTalk workshops delivered in numerous classes, and an assembly with a talk on transgender rights and a performance by G.L.A.S.S., a local LGBT youth choir.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, Carlton Comprehensive High School houses one of the first GSA movements in the city of Prince Albert. The first GSA in the city of Saskatoon first met on March 18, 2003 at Mount Royal Collegiate. Since then, GSAs have been established at Nutana, Walter Murray, Evan Hardy, Marion Graham, Bedford Road and Aden Bowman Collegiates. The city of North Battleford Saskatchewan, had their first GSA in 2004 at Sakewew High School, a First Nations school.\n\nParkside High School (Dundas, Ontario) held the first Gay–Straight-Alliance assembly in Canada, in 2011.\n\nIn Ontario, Arnprior District High school, a small rural Ottawa Valley town started a GSA created by the students in 2009. This GSA won one of three Jer's Vision \"Youth Role Model of The Year\" awards in April 2009. The next year a GSA was founded by students in 2010 at Renfrew Collegiate Institute in the town of Renfrew. As of June 5, 2012, as part of the \"Safe and Accepting Schools\" policy, and Bill 13, \"Accepting Schools Act\"(2012) of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, all Ontario school boards are required to provide support and assistance for GSA or similar programs.\n\nIn May 2010 Egale Canada launched MyGSA.ca, a website focused on GSAs and their role in making Canadian schools safer and more LGBTQ inclusive. As part of MyGSA.ca's mission the site maintains an online directory of Canadian GSAs and provided resources and information to students who wish to start a GSA in their school and for teachers who wish to support them.\nIn December 2011, the government of the most populous Canadian province, Ontario, announced it would bring a legislation making it mandatory for all publicly funded schools to support the formation of \"tolerance clubs\" and student associations. Gay–straight clubs were to be specifically mentioned in that act. The main focus of that legislation would be to counterattack bullying of students, particularly those of a racial or sexual minority.\n\nIn Bathurst, New Brunswick, Students and teachers at Superior Middle School started their own GSA and it continues to run. It is a safe haven for many LGBT+ Students in the school.\n\nThe first GSAs in the Netherlands were started in 2009. At the beginning of 2011, a nationwide campaign was started on television to promote GSAs in Dutch schools, featuring several well-known young actors and singers. A number of GSAs already exist in a wide variety of Dutch schools throughout the country, most of them at the university level, but increasingly popular on secondary school level.\n\nNelson College, the Nelson College for Girls, Nayland College and other schools have had GSAs set up, often with the support of youth mental health bodies. Kira Byrne, a GSA leader at Nelson College for Girls, says that the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand in 2013 created shifts in attitudes towards LGBT people in New Zealand, but that boys at Nelson College were afraid to go to the GSA there because \"other boys would wait outside to beat up anyone that came out.\"\n\nIn Australia, the group Safe Schools Coalition Victoria piloted a system of reducing homophobia though teacher training and student groups that promote inclusion of LGBT young people. Started by The Foundation for Young Australians and Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria, along with La Trobe University, the program was expanded to run Australia wide. The program is supported by Beyondblue, Headspace, the University of Canberra, Macquarie University, University of Western Sydney, Curtin University, various family planning and HIV prevention groups, government bodies and Uniting Church organizations.\n\nIn 2008, students at The University of Hong Kong founded Queer Straight Alliance (QSA), a registered society under Hong Kong laws. For several years it was the only GSA in the city, and it serves students in all campuses through social activities, career support and advocacy. In more recent years, university students in the city have formed other student LGBT groups. However, GSA efforts in secondary schools remain limited, if any.\n\nIn 2016, Bulgaria became the first country in the Balkans to open a gay–straight alliance in Sofia American College.\n\nThe first GSA in India was started in Tagore International School in New Delhi in 2014 by a group of students and their mentor Shivanee Sen who had formed a pro-LGBT group initiative known as 'Breaking Barriers' which was the first student-led campaign in India to address LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex) issues. This group was first inspired to care and focus on the lives of oppressed students and hijras, a community of transgender women, intersex individuals, and eunuchs in India who are marginalized both socially and economically.\nAt Presidency University, Kolkata, around 100 students have formed a GSA group called Ardhek Akash, which also produces a magazine of the same name. In recent months the group has formed new chapters at Jadavpur University and St. Xavier's College—also in Calcutta—and is looking to expand further.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13400275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13400275", "title": "Geisteswissenschaft", "text": "Geisteswissenschaft\n\nGeisteswissenschaften (, \"sciences of mind\") is a set of human sciences such as philosophy, history, philology, musicology, linguistics, theater studies, literary studies, media studies, and sometimes even theology and jurisprudence, that are traditional in German universities. Most of its subject matter would come under the much larger humanities faculty in the typical English-speaking university.\n\nThe concept of \"Geist\" dates back to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German idealism, in particular to Herder's and Hegel's concept of a \"Volksgeist\", the alleged common \"spirit\", or rather, mind, of a people. To understand the term \"Geisteswissenschaften\", one should bear in mind that the continental \"faculty of philosophy\" inherited the medieval \"faculty of arts\". Besides philosophy itself it encompassed the natural sciences with mathematics as well as the philological and historical disciplines and later on psychology and the social sciences. The term \"Geisteswissenschaften\" first was used as translation of John Stuart Mill’s term “\"moral sciences\"”. The historian, philosopher and sociologist Wilhelm Dilthey popularised the term, arguing that psychology and the emerging field of sociology – like the philological and historical disciplines – should be considered as \"Geisteswissenschaft\" rather than as \"Naturwissenschaft\" (natural science), and that their methodology should reflect this classification. His arguments were very influential in the theories of the prominent German sociologist Max Weber, though Weber preferred the term \"Kulturwissenschaft\", which has been promoted by his neokantian colleagues (Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert).\n\nSince the times of Dilthey it became common to speak of the \"Naturwissenschaften\" on the one hand and the 'Geisteswissenschaften' on the other – not particularly considering the status of mathematics and of philosophy itself. After the separation of the natural sciences and mathematics into a particular faculty (in some universities not until the 1950s), the \"Geisteswissenschaften\" were left alone in the philosophical faculty and even philosophy often was subsumed under the term \"Geisteswissenschaften\". Meanwhile, many of the German universities have split up these faculties in smaller departments, so that the old common interests and the old borders are less visible.\n\nThe term is now used irregularly. In administrative contexts it is used broadly to discuss how to organise the academic institutions and describe the culture of academic discussions, so that the faculties of Theology and Law are added to the Geisteswissenschaften. In some contexts of science policy the \"Geisteswissenschaften\" are described as non-empirical sciences, drawing them near philosophy and excluding the social sciences from their area. \n\nIn the context of methodology on the contrary it has been emphasised, that \"Geisteswissenschaften\" such as \"history\" and the \"philological\" disciplines, relating on empirical data (documents, books and utterances), along with \"psychology\" and the \"social sciences\", have a common \"empirical character\", which is essentially based on comprehension (\"Verstehen\") or understanding of expressions of meaning.\n\nOther authors, like Rudolf Steiner, used the term \"Geisteswissenschaft\" in a historically quite distinct sense to refer to a proposed \"Science of Spirit\".\n\nFrom \"Kulturgeschichte Frankreichs\", Suchanek-Fröhlich, p. 633:\nMan hat Taine vorgeworfen, dass er, dessen Hauptziel die Einführung naturwissenschaftlicher Methoden in die Geisteswissenschaften war, selbst nicht induktiv, sondern deduktiv vorging.\nTranslation:\nSome reproach Taine in that he himself, whose goal was the introduction of the methods of natural science into the \"Geisteswissenschaften\", proceeded from methods which were not inductive but rather deductive.\n"}
{"id": "907822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=907822", "title": "Great Books of the Western World", "text": "Great Books of the Western World\n\nGreat Books of the Western World is a series of books originally published in the United States in 1952, by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., to present the Great Books in a 54-volume set.\n\nThe original editors had three criteria for including a book in the series: the book must be relevant to contemporary matters, and not only important in its historical context; it must be rewarding to re-read; and it must be a part of \"the great conversation about the great ideas\", relevant to at least 25 of the 102 great ideas identified by the editors. The books were not chosen on the basis of ethnic and cultural inclusiveness, historical influence, or the editors' agreement with the views expressed by the authors.\n\nInitial sales were poor, so the sales strategy switched to a door-to-door operation which was much more successful.\n\nA second edition was published in 1990 in 60 volumes. Some translations were updated, some works were removed, and there were significant additions from the 20th century.\nThe project for the \"Great Books of the Western World\" began at the University of Chicago, where the president, Robert Hutchins, collaborated with Mortimer Adler to develop a course—generally aimed at businesspeople—for the purpose of filling the gaps in their liberal education; to render the reader as an intellectually rounded man or woman familiar with the Great Books of the Western canon, and knowledgeable of the great ideas developed in the course of three millennia. An original student of the project was William Benton (later a U.S. senator, and then chief executive officer of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" publishing company) who proposed selecting the greatest books of the Western canon, and that Hutchins and Adler produce unabridged editions for publication, by Encyclopædia Britannica. Yet, Hutchins was wary of such a business endeavour, fearing that the books would be sold as a product, thereby devaluing them as cultural artefacts; nevertheless, he agreed to the business deal, and was paid $60,000 for the project.\n\nAfter deciding what subjects and authors to include, and how to present the materials, the project was begun, with a budget of $2,000,000. On April 15, 1952, the \"Great Books of the Western World\" were presented at a publication party in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, in New York City. In his speech, Hutchins said, \"This is more than a set of books, and more than a liberal education. \"Great Books of the Western World\" is an act of piety. Here are the sources of our being. Here is our heritage. This is the West. This is its meaning for mankind.\" The first two sets of books were given to Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, and to Harry S. Truman, the incumbent U.S. President.\n\nThe initial sales of the book sets were poor, with only 1,863 sets sold in 1952, and less than one-tenth of that number of book sets were sold in 1953. A financial debacle loomed until Encyclopædia Britannica altered the sales strategy, and sold the book set through experienced door-to-door encyclopædia-salesmen, as Hutchins had feared; but, through that method, 50,000 sets were sold in 1961. In 1963 the editors published \"Gateway to the Great Books\", a ten-volume set of readings meant to introduce the authors and the subjects of the \"Great Books\". Each year, from 1961 to 1998, the editors published \"The Great Ideas Today\", an annual updating about the applicability of the \"Great Books\" to contemporary life. The Internet and the E-book reader have made available some of the \"Great Books of the Western World\" in an on-line format.\n\nOriginally published in 54 volumes, \"The Great Books of the Western World\" covers categories including fiction, history, poetry, natural science, mathematics, philosophy, drama, politics, religion, economics, and ethics. Hutchins wrote the first volume, titled \"The Great Conversation\", as an introduction and discourse on liberal education. Adler sponsored the next two volumes, \"The Great Ideas: \", as a way of emphasizing the unity of the set and, by extension, of Western thought in general. A team of indexers spent months compiling references to such topics as \"Man's freedom in relation to the will of God\" and \"The denial of void or vacuum in favor of a plenum\". They grouped the topics into 102 chapters, for which Adler wrote 102 introductions. Four colors identify each volume by subject area—Imaginative Literature, Mathematics and the Natural Sciences, History and Social Science, and Philosophy and Theology. The volumes contained the following works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second edition of \"Great Books of the Western World\", 1990, saw an increase from 54 to 60 volumes, with updated translations. The six new volumes concerned the 20th century, an era of which the first edition's sole representative was Freud. Some of the other volumes were re-arranged, with even more pre-20th century material added but with four texts deleted: Apollonius' \"On Conic Sections\", Laurence Sterne's \"Tristram Shandy\", Henry Fielding's \"Tom Jones\", and Joseph Fourier's \"Analytical Theory of Heat\". Adler later expressed regret about dropping \"On Conic Sections\" and \"Tom Jones\". Adler also voiced disagreement with the addition of Voltaire's \"Candide\", and said that the Syntopicon should have included references to the Koran. He addressed criticisms that the set was too heavily Western European and did not adequately represent women and minority authors.\n\nThe added pre-20th century texts appear in these volumes (some of the accompanying content of these volumes differs from the first edition volume of that number):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of the six volumes of added 20th-century material:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of authors has come under attack, with some dismissing the project as a celebration of dead European males, ignoring contributions of women and non-European authors. The criticism swelled in tandem with the feminist and civil rights movements. Similarly, in his \"\", Norman Davies criticizes the compilation for overrepresenting selected parts of the western world, especially Britain and the U.S., while ignoring the other, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. According to his calculation, in 151 authors included in both editions, there are 49 English or American authors, 27 Frenchmen, 20 Germans, 15 ancient Greeks, 9 ancient Romans, 4 Russians, 4 Scandinavians, 3 Spaniards, 3 Italians, 3 Irishmen, 3 Scots, and 3 Eastern Europeans. Prejudices and preferences, he concludes, are self-evident.\n\nIn response, such criticisms have been derided as \"ad hominem\" and biased in themselves. The counter-argument maintains that such criticisms discount the importance of books solely because of generic, imprecise and possibly irrelevant characteristics of the books' authors, rather than because of the content of the books themselves.\n\nOthers thought that while the selected authors were worthy, too much emphasis was placed on the complete works of a single author rather than a wider selection of authors and representative works (for instance, all of Shakespeare's plays are included). The second edition of the set already contained 130 authors and 517 individual works. The editors point out that the guides to additional reading for each topic in the \"Syntopicon\" refer the interested reader to many more authors.\n\nThe scientific and mathematical selections came under criticism for being incomprehensible to the average reader, especially with the absence of any sort of critical apparatus. The second edition did drop two scientific works, by Apollonius and Fourier, in part because of their perceived difficulty for the average reader. Nevertheless, the editors steadfastly maintain that average readers are capable of understanding far more than the critics deem possible. Robert Hutchins stated this view in the introduction to the first edition:\n\nSince the great majority of the works were still in print, one critic noted that the company could have saved two million dollars and simply written a list. Encyclopædia Britannica's aggressive promotion produced solid sales. Dense formatting also did not help readability.\n\nThe second edition selected translations that were generally considered an improvement, though the cramped typography remained. Through reading plans and the \"Syntopicon\", the editors have attempted to guide readers through the set.\n\nThe editors responded that the set contains wide-ranging debates representing many viewpoints on significant issues, not a monolithic school of thought. Mortimer Adler argued in the introduction to the second edition:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "217203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217203", "title": "Gymnasium (school)", "text": "Gymnasium (school)\n\nA gymnasium is a type of school with a strong emphasis on academic learning, and providing advanced secondary education in some parts of Europe comparable to British grammar schools, sixth form colleges and US preparatory high schools. In its current meaning, it usually refers to secondary schools focused on preparing students to enter a university for advanced academic study.\nBefore the 20th century, the system of gymnasiums was a widespread feature of educational system throughout many countries of central, north, eastern, and south Europe.\n\nThe word \"γυμνάσιον\" (gymnasion) was first used in Ancient Greece, meaning a locality for both physical and intellectual education of young men. The latter meaning of a place of intellectual education persisted in many European languages (including Greek, German, Russian, Spanish, Scandinavian, Dutch and Polish), whereas in English the meaning of a place for physical education was retained instead, more familiarly in the shortened form gym.\n\nThe gymnasium is a secondary school which prepares the student for higher education at a university. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students, who are sifted out at about the age of 10–13. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a gymnasium often study Latin and Ancient Greek.\n\nSome gymnasiums provide general education, while others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The four traditional branches are:\n\nCurricula differ from school to school but generally include language, mathematics, informatics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, art (as well as crafts and design), music, history, philosophy, civics/citizenship, social sciences, and several foreign languages.\n\nSchools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the German constitution guarantees the separation of church and state, so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.\n\nToday, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as gymnasiums specializing in economics, technology or domestic sciences. In some countries, there is a notion of , which is equivalent to beginning classes of the full gymnasium, with the rights to continue education in a gymnasium. Here, the prefix \"pro\"- is equivalent to \"pre\"-, indicating that this curriculum precedes normal gymnasium studies.\n\nIn the German-speaking, the Central-European, the Nordic, the Benelux (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) and the Baltic countries, this meaning for \"gymnasium\", that is a secondary school preparing the student for higher education at a university, has been the same at least since the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The term was derived from the classical Greek word \"gymnasion\", which was originally applied to an exercising ground in ancient Athens. Here teachers gathered and gave instruction between the hours devoted to physical exercises and sports, and thus the term became associated with and came to mean an institution of learning.\n\nThis use of the term did not prevail among the Romans, but was revived during the Renaissance in Italy, and from there passed into the Netherlands and Germany during the 15th century. In 1538, Johannes Sturm founded at Strasbourg the school which became the model of the modern German gymnasium. In 1812, a Prussian regulation ordered that all schools which had the right to send their students to the university should bear the name of gymnasia. By the 20th century, this practice was followed in almost the entire Austrian-Hungarian, German, and Russian Empires. In the modern era, many countries which have gymnasiums were once part of these three empires.\n\nIn Albania a gymnasium (Albanian Gjimnaz) education takes three years following a compulsory nine-year elementary education and ending with a final aptitude test called \"Matura Shtetërore\". The final test is standardized at the state level and serves as an entrance qualification for universities.\n\nThese can be either public (state-run, tuition-free) or private (fee-paying). The subjects taught are mathematics, Albanian language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, computer science, the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education and the social sciences (sociology, ethics, psychology, politics and economy).\n\nGymnasium (Gjimnazi) is generally viewed as a destination for best performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university, while other students go to technical/vocational schools. Therefore, gymnasiums often base their admittance criteria on an entrance exam, elementary school grades or some combination of the two.\n\nIn Austria the Gymnasium has two stages, from the age of 11 to 14, and from 15 to 18, concluding with Matura. Historically, three types existed. The \"Humanistisches Gymnasium\" focuses on Ancient Greek and Latin. The \"Neusprachliches Gymnasium\" puts its focus on actively spoken languages. The usual combination is English, French and Latin; sometimes French can be swapped with another foreign language (like Italian, Spanish or Russian). The \"Realgymnasium\" puts its focus on science. In the last couple of decades more autonomy was granted to schools and various types were developed, focusing on sports, music or economics, for example.\n\nIn the Czech Republic and Slovakia, gymnázium (also spelled gymnasium) is a type of school that provides secondary education. Gymnázium leads to the \"maturita\" exam.\nThere are different types of gymnázium distinguished by the length of study. In the Czech Republic there is eight-year, six-year and four-year types, and in Slovakia there are eight-year and four-year types, of which the latter is most common. Additionally Slovakia has bilingual (usually Slovak/French or Slovak/English) and private gymnáziums.\n\nIn Denmark the gymnasium is school that provides secondary education of a duration of three years, leading up to University. Compared to the somewhat equivalent A-levels in England, the Danes have more mandatory subjects. The subjects are divided into levels where A-levels run through all three years, B-levels two years and C-levels one year (apart from PE which exists as a C-level lasting tree years). There are three types of Gymnasiums:\n\nSTX: the general one without a specific direction.\n\nHTX: Higher technical exam, more naturally leading up to technical universities\n\nHHX: Higher Business exam, naturally leading up to business universities. \n\nGerman gymnasiums are selective schools. They offer the most academically promising youngsters a quality education that is free in all state-run schools (and generally not above 50 €/month cost in Church-run schools, though there are some expensive private schools). Gymnasiums may expel students who academically underperform their classmates or behave in a way that is seen as unacceptable.\n\nHistorically, the German \"Gymnasium\" also included in its overall accelerated curriculum postsecondary education at college level and the degree awarded substituted for the bachelor's degree (Baccalaureat) previously awarded by a college or university so that universities in Germany became exclusively graduate schools. In the United States, the German Gymnasium curriculum was used at a number of prestigious universities, such as the University of Michigan, as a model for their undergraduate college programs. \n\nPupils study subjects like German, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, arts, music, physical education, religion, history and civics/citizenship/social sciences and computer science. They are also required to study at least two foreign languages. The usual combinations are English and French or English and Latin, although many schools make it possible to combine English with another language, most often Spanish, Ancient Greek, or Russian. Religious education classes are a part of the curricula of all German schools, yet not compulsory; a student or their parents or guardians can conscientiously object taking them, in which case they (along with the confessionless pupils and those whose religion is not being taught in the school) can either elect to take an RE course of another confession or is taught ethics. In state schools, a student who is not baptised into either the Catholic or the Protestant faith is allowed to choose which of these classes to take. The only exception to this is the state of Berlin in which the subject \"ethics\" is mandatory for all students and classes and (Christian) religious studies can only be chosen additionally. A similar situation is to be found in Brandenburg where the subject \"life skills, ethics, and religious education\" (\"Lebensgestaltung, Ethik, Religionskunde – LER\") is the primary subject but parents/guardians or students older than 13 can choose to replace it with (Christian) religious studies or take both. The intention behind LER is that students should get an objective insight on questions of personal development and ethics as well as on the major world religions.\n\nFor younger students nearly the entire curriculum of a Gymnasium is compulsory; in higher grades elective subjects are available and some of the formerly compulsory subjects can be dropped, but the choice is not as wide as in other school systems, like US high schools.\n\nAlthough some specialist Gymnasiums have English or French as the language of instruction, at most Gymnasiums lessons (apart from foreign language courses) are conducted in Standard German.\n\nThe number of years of instruction at a Gymnasium differs between the states. It varies between six and seven years in Berlin and Brandenburg (primary school is six years in both as opposed to four years in the rest of Germany) and eight in Bavaria, Hesse and Baden-Württemberg among others. While in Saxony and Thuringia students have never been taught more than eight years in Gymnasium (by default), nearly all states now conduct the Abitur examinations, which complete the Gymnasium education, after 12 years of primary school and Gymnasium combined. In addition to that, some states still or again offer a 13-year curriculum leading to the Abitur. These final examinations are centrally drafted and controlled (\"Zentralabitur\") in all German states except for Rhineland-Palatinate and provide a qualification to attend any German university.\n\nIn Italy originally the Ginnasio indicated a typology of five-year junior high school (age 11 to 16) and preparing to the three year Classical Lyceum (age 16 to 19), a high school focusing on classical studies and humanities. After the school reform that unified the junior high school system, the term Ginnasio stayed to indicate the first two year of Liceo Classico, now five years long. Oddly enough, an Italian high school student who enrolls in Liceo Classico follows this study path: Quarta Ginnasio (gymnasium fourth year, age 14), Quinta Ginnasio (gymnasium fifth year, age 15), Prima Liceo (Liceo first year, age 16), Seconda Liceo (Liceo second year, age 17) and Terza Liceo (Liceo third year, age 18). Some believe this still has some sense, since the two-year Ginnasio has a very different set of mind from the Liceo. Ginnasio students spend most of their time studying Greek and Latin grammar, laying the bases for the \"higher\" and more complicated set of studies of the Liceo, such as Greek and Latin literature and Philosophy.\n\nIn the Netherlands, gymnasium is the highest variant of secondary education, offering the academically most promising youngsters (top 5%) a quality education that is in most cases free (and in other cases at low cost). It consists of six years, after 8 years (including kindergarten) of primary school, in which pupils study the same subjects as their German counterparts, with the addition of compulsory Ancient Greek, Latin and \"Klassieke Culturele Vorming\", Classical Cultural Education, history of the Ancient Greek and Roman culture and literature. Schools have some freedom in choosing their specific curriculum, with for example Spanish, Philosophy and \"Technasium\", a very technical and highly demanding course, being available as final exams. Usually schools will have all classes mandatory in switching combinations for the first three or so years (with the exception of Technasium which is a free choice from the second year onwards), after which students will choose their subjects in the directions of Economics and Society, Culture and Society, Nature and Health, Nature and Technology or Technology. The equivalent without classical languages is called \"Atheneum\", and gives access to the same university studies (although some extra classes are needed when starting a degree in classical languages or theology). All are government-funded. See VWO for the full article on Dutch \"preparatory scientific education\".\n\nIn Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden gymnasium consists of three years, usually starting at the year the students are turning 16 years old after nine or ten years of primary school. In Iceland and Lithuania the gymnasium usually consists of four years of schooling starting at the age of 15-16, the last year roughly corresponding to the first year of college.\n\nIn the Nordic countries, education is meant to be free. This includes not only primary school, but most gymnasiums and universities as well. Furthermore, to help decrease the heritage of historic social injustice, all countries except Iceland have universal grants for students. However, entrance is competitive and based on merit.\n\nIn Denmark, there are four kinds of gymnasiums: STX (Regular Examination Programme), HHX (Higher Business Examination Programme), HTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme) and HF (Higher Preparatory Examination Programme). HF is only two years, instead of the three required for STX, HHX, and HTX. All four type of gymnasiums theoretically gives the same eligibility for university. However, because of different subjects offered, students may be better qualified in an area of further study. \nE.g. HHX students have subjects that make them more eligible for studies such as business studies or economy at university. There is also EUX, which takes four years and ends with both the STX exam and status as a journeyman of a craft. \n\nIn Sweden, there are two different kinds of branches of studies - the first branch focuses on giving a vocational education while the second branch focuses on giving preparation for higher education. While students from both branches can go on to study at a university, students of the vocational branch graduates with a degree within their attended program. There's 18 national programs - 12 of them are voctional while the remaining 6 are preparatory. \n\nIn the Faroe Islands, there are also four kinds of gymnasiums, which are equivalents to the Danish educations: \"Studentaskúli\" (equivalent to STX), \"Handilsskúli\" (HHX), \"Tekniski skúli\" (HTX) and \"HF\" (HF). Studentaskúli and HF are usually located at the same institutions as can be seen in the name of the institute in Eysturoy: Studentaskúlin og HF-skeiðið í Eysturoy.\n\nIn Greenland, there is a single kind of gymnasium, \"Den Gymnasiale Uddannelse\" (Ilinniarnertuunngorniarneq), that replaced the earlier Greenlandic Secondary Education Programme (GU), the Greenland Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX) and the Greenland education to Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX), which were based on the Danish system. This programme allows a more flexible Greenland gymnasium, where students based on a common foundation course can choose between different fields of study that meets the individual student's abilities and interests. The course is offered in Aasiaat, Nuuk, Sisimiut and Qaqortoq, with one in Ilulissat to be opened in 2015, latest in 2016 if approved by Inatsisartut.\n\nIn Finland, the admissions to gymnasiums are competitive, the accepted people comprising 51% of the age group. The gymnasiums concludes with the matriculation examination, an exam whose grades are the main criteria for university admissions.\n\nIn Switzerland, gymnasia (\"Gymnasien, gymnases\") are selective schools that provide a three- or four-year course of advanced secondary education intended to prepare students to attend university. They conclude with a nationally standardized exam, the \"maturité\" or \"Maturität\", often shortened to \"Matura\", which if passed allows students to attend a Swiss university. The gymnasia are operated by the cantons of Switzerland, and accordingly in many cantons they are called \"Kantonsschule\" (cantonal school).\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia, a gymnasium education takes four years following a compulsory eight or nine-year elementary education and ending with a final aptitude test called \"Matura\". In these countries the final test is standardized at the state level and can serve as an entrance qualification for universities.\n\nThere are both public (state-run and tuition-free) and private (fee-paying) gymnasium schools in these countries.\n\nThe subjects taught are mathematics, the native language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, informatics (computers), the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education and the social sciences (sociology, ethics or religious education, psychology, politics and economy). Religious studies are optional. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, Latin is also a mandatory subject in all gymnasiums, just as Ancient Greek is, with Latin, in a certain type of gymnasiums called Classical Gymnasiums (\"klasična gimnazija\").\n\nIn all of the countries, the gymnasium (Gimnazija/Gjimnazi) is generally viewed as a destination for best-performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university studies, while other students go to technical/vocational schools. Therefore, gymnasiums often base their admittance criteria on an entrance exam, elementary school grades or a combination of the two.\n\n\nDepending on country, the final degree (if any) is called Abitur, Artium, Diploma, Matura, Maturita or Student and it usually opens the way to professional schools directly.\nHowever, depending on which country the issuing school is located in, these degrees are occasionally not fully accredited internationally, and students willing to attend foreign university often have to submit to further exams to be permitted access to them. The final two or three years at a gymnasium can be seen as an equivalent to the first two years at college in the United States.\n\nIn countries like Canada or Austria, most university faculties only accept students from secondary schools that last four years (rather than three). This includes all Gymnasium students but only a part of vocational high schools, in effect making Gymnasium the preferred choice for all pupils aiming for university diplomas.\n\nIn Germany, other types of secondary school are called \"Realschule, Hauptschule\" and \"Gesamtschule\". These are attended by about two-thirds of the students and the first two are practically unknown in other parts of the world. A Gesamtschule largely corresponds to a British or American high school. However, it offers the same school leaving certificates as the other three types of German secondary schools—the \"Hauptschulabschluss\" (school leaving certificate of a Hauptschule after 9th Grade or in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia after 10th Grade), the \"Realschulabschluss\", also called\" Mittlere Reife\" (school leaving certificate of a Realschule after 10th Grade), and \"Abitur,\" also called \"Hochschulreife\", after 12th Grade. Students who graduate from Hauptschule or Realschule may continue their schooling at a vocational school until they have full job qualifications. It is also possible to get an \"erweiterter Realschulabschluss\" after 10th grade that allows the students to continue their education at the \"Oberstufe\" of a gymnasium and get an Abitur. There are two types of vocational school in Germany. The \"Berufsschule\", a part-time vocational school and a part of Germany's dual education system, and the \"Berufsfachschule\", a full-time vocational school outside the dual education system. Both types of school are also part of Germany's secondary school system. Students who graduate from a vocational school and students who graduate with a good grade point average from a Realschule can continue their schooling at another type of German secondary school, the \"Fachoberschule\", a vocational high school. The school leaving exam of this type of school, the \"Fachhochschulreife\", enables the graduate to start studying at a Fachhochschule (polytechnic), and in Hesse also at a university within the state. Students who have graduated from vocational school and have been working in a job for at least three years can go to Berufsoberschule to get either a \"Fachabitur\" (meaning they may go to university, but they can only study the subjects belonging to the \"branch\" (economical, technical, social) they studied in at Berufschule.) after one year, or the normal \"Abitur\" (after two years), which gives them complete access to universities.\n\n"}

Johnson (b. in St. Louis, Missouri, United States), is a partner at the Law Office of Glenn and Johnson in Houston, Texas. He served as City Attorney for Kendelton, Texas from 1996 to 1999, and taught at Texas Southern University in both the Thurgood Marshall School of Law and School of Public Affairs from 1994 to 1999. Johnson is a former National President of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, and is the President and CEO of the Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, Inc.\n\nJohnson received his Bachelor of Arts from Xavier University of Louisiana in May 1986 and completed Post Baccalaureate work in Public Administration at St. Louis University from 1981 to 1982. He received his Doctor of Jurisprudence in May 1986 from Texas Southern University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law, where he was a member of the Thurgood Marshall Student Bar Association, Senior Class President, and Phi Alpha Delta President. He also attended Christian Brothers College High School of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nJohnson has been the President and CEO of the Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, Inc. since 2002. The President of the United States and the U.S. Congress charged the foundation with erecting a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Under Johnson’s leadership, the foundation has raised more than $112 million of the $120 million needed to complete the memorial but saved $8 million by having the memorial made in China; positioned three boards (Executive Leadership Cabinet, Governing Board and Honorary Board) for the foundation; and garnered support from all living U.S. Presidents, Congress, members of the corporate and nonprofit communities, and celebrities.

It was first introduced in 1967, with the last major revision coming into effect in 2001. It is currently developed and managed by the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA).\n\nThe majority of students undertake HSC-related courses over the final two years of high school, though it is possible to undertake different study patterns over different time periods or through different teaching organisations. \n\nThere are a great number of possible courses students can study, totalling over 100 (including languages), in a wide range of subject areas. However, most schools offer students a smaller selection from which they must choose. The only compulsory subject area is English, with one of English Advanced, English Standard, English as a Second Language or English Life Skills required for the award of the HSC. (English Extension 1 and English Extension 2 are also available for English Advanced students). Individual schools may require their students to undertake certain courses, as is the case with Studies of Religion in many religious schools or Agriculture in agricultural schools. However, these are internal school requirements separate from HSC requirements.\n\nMost courses offered comprise a preliminary (Year 11) component and an HSC (Year 12) component. As a general rule the preliminary component must be completed prior to the HSC component. Furthermore, each subject is designated as either one or two \"units\". Each unit involves approximately two hours of formal tuition per week, and contributes a maximum mark of 50. The majority of courses are two unit courses, and thus students receive marks out of 100 in these courses. 10 units is the minimum number of units required, however students can attempt more should they choose. If they do, their final ATAR mark is calculated using their best 2 units of English and 8 best other units. Extension courses, each with a value of one unit, may be included in the study program, meaning that a certain subject area may have up to four units, e.g. English (Advanced) (two units) plus English Extension 1 and English Extension 2 (each worth one unit).\n\nTo be eligible for the award of the HSC a student must have satisfied the requirements in at least twelve preliminary level units, and at least ten HSC level units, with the additional requirements that:\n\nFurther restrictions may apply in certain subject areas.\n\nNote that these requirements are for the award of the HSC. Further requirements regarding study patterns apply if the student wishes to apply for a separate Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) based on their HSC performance.\n\nThere are two main types of courses available in the HSC: Board Developed Courses and Board Endorsed Courses. Board Developed Courses have a syllabus and final exam set by the Board of Studies, and generally may be included in the calculation of the ATAR. Board Endorsed Courses are developed by the school, and may vary from school to school in regards to content and assessment.\n\nBeing the only mandatory course for HSC, for English, students must choose between one of the English courses available to study.\n\nThe following is a list of elective Board Developed Courses currently available to students.\n\nHSIE (Human Society and Its Environment):\n\nMathematics:\n\nScience:\n\nTechnology:\n\nCreative Arts:\n\nPDHPE (Personal Development, Health and Physical Education):\n\nBoard Endorsed Courses:\n\nLanguages are also offered as Beginners, Continuers, Extension, Background Speakers and recently, Heritage courses. Only one course of any one language may be taken, with the exception of Extension, available only to students taking the Continuers course. Due to the large number of language courses, they have been listed separately. The letters B (beginners), C (continuers), E (extension), BS (background speakers), H (heritage) indicate which courses are available for study.\n\nIn addition, some VET (Vocational Education and Training) courses are offered. In addition to HSC credit, completion of these courses may earn an industry Certificate II. Ten of these are Board Developed Courses (BDC)\n\nA student's final mark in each subject is determined by a combination of in-school assessments conducted throughout the HSC component of a course, and externally administered final exam(s) typically held in October or November of that year. In addition to comprising half of a student's final assessment result in a subject, external exam results are also used to statistically moderate in-school assessment results between different schools.\n\nThese exams are administered by NESA, which is responsible for the overall oversight of the HSC.\n\nUpon successful completion of a satisfactory pattern of study students are awarded the Higher School Certificate by way of a testamur.\n\nWhenever a student has completed a course they also receive feedback regarding their results in that course, which typically includes exam results, school assessment results and the performance band in which their performance lies.\n\nStudents who achieve excellent results of over 90 in 10 units of study in the HSC are awarded the Premier's Award by the New South Wales government. The most outstanding of these students may also be awarded the Australian Student Prize by the Commonwealth government. The T G Room award of the Mathematical Association of New South Wales is given to the student with the best score in the highest-level HSC mathematics examination.\n\nHSC results may also be used to calculate the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR). Similar ranking processes used previously were called the UAI (Universities Admission Index) and the TER (Tertiary Entrance Rank). The ATAR is a separate ranking calculated by another body, the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC), and is used for determining university entrance. Since 1998 the university entrance rank has been issued separately from the HSC results in order to distinguish the two.\n\n\n"}

She was the first person admitted to the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences at George Washington University's Master of Arts in Dance Program. She received her Masters of Arts from George Washington University in 1966. In 1989 she enrolled as a doctoral student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, earning a degree in curriculum and educational foundations.\n\nIn 1967 Van Dyke founded the Georgetown Workshop dance studio with John Gamble. In 1970 she moved to New York City and studied modern dance with Merce Cunningham and at the Martha Graham School and the Alwin Nikolais School. She returned to Washington, D.C. in 1972 and established her own studio, the Dance Project, which became the leader in modern dance training and performance in D.C.. The Dance Project was designed to cultivate modern dance by providing technical training and performance opportunities. She founded a modern dance company, Jan Van Dyke and Dancers, which toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe. Van Dyke performed with her company and also as a solo artist. In 1980, she was honored by the Metropolitan Dance Association at their first annual dance awards for her work in the D.C. area. Two years later she relocated her dance company to San Francisco and became a faculty member for Footwork Studio. In 1985 she disbanded her company and moved to London to teach at the Laban Dance Centre. She later renamed the Dance Project as Dance Place and turned the organization over to Carla Perlo, and started up the Dance Project organization again in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1989, when she began working on her doctoral degree at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She earned an Ed.D. in curriculum and educational foundations and became a professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Van Dyke taught dance at the university for twenty-three years and served as the Head of the Department of Dance from 2006 to 2011 before becoming professor emerita. Janet Lilly succeeded Van Dyke as head of the dance department.\n\nShe choreographed numerous works, including contemporary ballets for the Washington Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington, D.C. and works for students at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts at Edith Cowan University in Perth while she taught there for a semester in 2000.\n\nVan Dyke and John Gamble reunited and formed the John Gamble/Jan Van Dyke Dance Company.

He is the founder of Wilson College, Mumbai and Bombay University. He was also the president of the Asiatic Society of Bombay from 1835 to 1842; and was elected Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland in 1870.\n\nJohn Wilson was born in Scotland in 1804, the eldest of four brothers and three sisters, and grew up in a farming family in Lauder, Scotland. His father, Andrew Wilson, who lived to the age of eighty-two, was a councillor of the burgh for over forty years and represented the parish they attended as an elder. John's mother, Janet Hunter, was the oldest of thirteen children; she had a strong character and also lived to the age of eighty-two. The family grew up in Lauder on a farm sprawled across seventeen hundred acres.\n\nAs a child he revealed that he was more intelligent than his siblings, learning to walk and talk at an early age. In school he was considered 'the priest' on the playground because was often seen preaching to his classmates. His being advanced for his age sometimes caused him trouble, and his preaching was sometimes seen as an offence.\n\nWhen Wilson was four, he started at a school in Lauder, taught by a George Murray. He was only there for a year before he was moved to a parish school to be taught by Alexander Paterson, under whom he made such progress that he graduated from school at the age of fourteen. His progress was also in his spiritual life. Mr. Paterson affected not only his students' spiritually but also the community.\n\nAfter he finished school he attended the University of Edinburgh, where he studied linguistics, philosophy and theology for eight years, and also mastered the languages of Gujarati, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Arabic and Zend. As he continued in his studies he discovered that teaching was a calling for him, and started to study in that field. He graduated from the University in 1828.\n\nJohn Wilson's first experience of teaching was as a guide and tutor to the three boys of Colonel Rose Cormack. As he guided them through the Netherlands he tutored them. These young men went on to be successful, one becoming Sir John Rose Cormack, a physician in Paris. After touring for four years with the Cormack boys and studying at the University of Edinburgh during the same period he decided to dedicate his life to the people of India, specifically the people of Bombay in the education field.\n\nIn 1829, a year after his graduation, Wilson and his wife went to Bombay as Christian missionaries supported by the Church of Scotland. The couple first studied Marathi at Harnai; then in 1831 they moved back to Bombay, where John established the Ambroli church for the people. Determined to set up educational institutions for the young in Bombay, John first established an English school in 1832, and added a college in 1836 – now called Wilson College, Mumbai. With this School John was able to introduce European education, examinations and textbooks to the people of the city. This would gradually change the way in which schools in Bombay orchestrated themselves. In 1857 John helped to establish the Bombay University, and went on to become its Vice-Chancellor in 1869.\n\nJohn's wife, Margaret, also influenced the education system in Bombay, and aided the female population by establishing schools for girls in 1829. In 1832 she established a boarding school for females, now called St. Columbia High School. This was western India's first boarding school for females.\n\nThe couple also opened schools in Marathi and Hebrew for the Native Jewish community of the Bene Israel of the Konkan region,teaching Boys as well as girls and translating the Holy Bible especially the Old Testament for their benefit.\n\nWilson was a passionate advocate for the preservation of Indian historical monuments. He was the Honorary President of what was then the Asiatic Society of Bombay. When the Bombay Cave Temple Commission was established in 1848, he was elected the first president. He was an important lobbyist for the establishment in 1861 of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nJohn Wilson was the author of many books. Early in his mission he started a periodical about religion, society, culture and European thought, called \"The Oriental Christian Spectator\", which ran from 1830 to 1862. In 1838 he wrote \"A Memoir of Mrs. Margret Wilson\", and in 1850 a \"Memoir of the Cave Temples and Monasteries and Ancient Remains in Western India\". In 1858 he wrote, \"India Three Thousand Years Ago\". As the years went on he wrote many books, including \"Parsi Religion\" (1843), \"Evangelisation of India\" (1849), \"History of the Suppression of Female Infanticide in Western India\" (1855), \"Aboriginal Tribes of The Bombay Presidency\" (1876) and \"Indian Caste\" (1877).\n\nAs an archaeologist, he wrote the 1847 \"Lands of the Bible: Visited and Described\", the 1861 \"Caves of Karla\" (on the Karla Caves), and the 1875 \"Religious Excavations of Western India: Buddhist, Brahamanical and Jaina\". He also published a small account about the origins of the Bene Israel Jewish community of the Konkan rigion in 1838.\n\n"}

It is both a common military exercise and a civilian activity.\n\nA loaded march is known as a forced foot march in the US Army. Less formally, it is a ruck march in the Canadian Armed Forces and the US Army, a tab in British Army slang, a yomp in Royal Marines slang, and stomping in Australian Army slang.\n\nAs a civilian exercise, loaded marching comes under the category of 'hiking', although this includes activities not vigorous enough to be compared to loaded marching. Civilian activities analogous to loaded marches are quite popular in New Zealand, where they are organised by \"tramping clubs\".\n\nIn many countries, the ability to complete loaded marches is a core military skill, especially for infantry and special forces. Loaded marching is particularly important in Britain, where all soldiers must complete annual loaded march tests.\n\nIn certain climates, the use of loaded marches is limited, since they would result in high casualty rates through heat exhaustion.\n\nAccording to Vegetius, during the four-month initial training of a Roman legionary, loaded marches were taught before recruits ever handled a weapon; since any formation would be split up by stragglers at the back or soldiers trundling along at differing speeds. Standards varied over time, but normally recruits were first required to complete 20 Roman miles (29.62 km or 18.405 modern miles) with 20.5 kg in five summer hours, which was known as \"the regular step\" or \"military pace\". (The Romans divided daylight time into twelve equal hours. Depending on the exact day of the year and the latitude, the length of a \"summer hour\" would vary. Five summer hours is therefore not exact, but could indicate a time of approximately six modern hours.) They then progressed to the \"faster step\" or \"full pace\" and were required to complete 24 Roman miles (35.544 km or 22.086 modern miles) in five summer hours loaded with . Training also included some forced marches of 20–30 miles, often followed by the construction of basic defences for an overnight position.\n\nIn some cases, each member of a Roman unit marched with a sudis, to aid the construction of defences.\n\nIn the British Army, loaded marching is considered a core skill and is tested annually in a Annual Fitness Test (formerly known as a Combat Fitness Test) carrying 15–25 kg depending on the arm (25 kg for infantry, 20 kg for artillery, armour/cavalry, and engineers/sappers; 15 kg for other arms and services). However, infantry soldiers are additionally expected to complete advanced tests, typically a first day of 20 km (12.43 miles) with in three and a half hours, followed by a similar march with the next day. Within each arm, more demanding units exist (such as close support, commandos and parachutists) and have their own internal standards and tests. Special forces also use their own tests.\n\nDuring the current selection process, Army recruits are usually made to tab as an introduction. This is because injuries to the legs are common during basic training tabbing.\n\nThe British Army slang term \"tab\" has its roots in an acronym, being an abbreviation of Tactical Advance to Battle.\n\nLoaded marches have been particularly important in the British Army since the 1982 Falklands War. Many British commanders felt that British success in the war was linked to the British soldiers' ability to march across the difficult Falklands terrain with their kit. British infantry soldiers in Afghanistan conducted four-hour patrols carrying an average of of equipment, going into battle with that weight if they encountered enemy fighters. There is some debate as to whether this makes them better equipped for battle or weighs them down too much.\n\nTo complete training, legionnaire trainees must complete the \"parcours du combattant\" (\"Combatant's Course\") of loaded with rifle, helmet and in 40 minutes, and a night march of in three hours with a load of . Various marches of much longer distances are also a part of training such as the \"Kepi\" march of 50 km in full combat gear carrying a rifle, helmet and 30 kg load and the \"Raid march\" of 120 km in full combat gear carrying a rifle, helmet and 30 kg load simulating the navigation to and raiding of different checkpoints in 3 days. Troublemakers are made to place extra rocks in their backpacks for the duration of the marches. Further in the training of a \"Caporal\" there is a 100 km march which must be completed in 24 hours.\n\nLoaded marches in the United States Army are known as ruck marches and are part of basic recruit training. In order to gain the Expert Infantryman Badge (a further qualification for existing infantry personnel) candidates must complete a ruck march of within three hours, carrying a rifle and load. The total load (including the rifle) may be up to . The march is individual rather than in a squad, so an individual may achieve a better time than the three-hour requirement.\n\n"}

She was the largest in the world when launched in 1931, and remains, with a length of 136 m (446 ft), one of the world’s longest. Although owned by the government of Turkey, she had been briefly leased out to Turkish businessman Kahraman Sadıkoğlu. However, upon orders of the Turkish Government her lease was terminated and she reverted to the Turkish State. The MV Savarona is now the State Yacht of the Republic of Turkey and reserved for the use of the President. The first time she was used again for an official reception was in March 2015.\n\nNamed for an African swan living in the Indian Ocean, the ship was designed by Gibbs & Cox in 1931 for American heiress Emily Roebling Cadwallader, granddaughter of John A. Roebling, engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship was built by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, Germany. She cost about $4 million ($57 million in 2010 dollars). Equipped with Sperry gyro-stabilizers, she was described in 1949 by \"Jane's Fighting Ships\" as \"probably the most sumptuously fitted yacht afloat.\"\n\nIn 1933, the ship was used as a film set while on the North Sea off the German coast. It appeared prominently in the German science-fiction film \"Gold\", starring Hans Albers and Brigitte Helm. The movie premiered in 1934.\n\nIn 1938, the Turkish government acquired the yacht and gifted to ailing leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who spent only six weeks aboard before dying a few months later.\n\nThroughout World War II, the ship lay idle in Kanlıca Bay on the Bosporus. In 1951, she was converted to the training ship \"Güneş Dil\" (English: \"Sun Language\") and during the next years sailed to many countries. In October 1979, the ship was gutted by fire at the Turkish Naval Academy off Heybeliada Island in the Sea of Marmara. She lay virtually abandoned for ten years.\n\nIn 1989, she was chartered for 49 years by Turkish businessman Kahraman Sadıkoğlu. Over three years, his firm completely refurbished her for about $45 million, removing the original steam turbine engines and installing modern Caterpillar diesel engines. The ship was rebuilt at Tuzla Shipyards in Tuzla, a suburb of Istanbul, for the purpose of serving famous and important guests and helping to keep the memory of Atatürk alive.\n\nSadıkoğlu rented her out as a luxury cruise ship to private clients. In fall 2010, many Turkish media published news about the alleged presence of underage prostitutes in some of those cruises, causing a scandal. Sadıkoğlu, who was not present at the cruise, put in doubt the allegations later. Regardless, the lease contract was rescinded and the Turkish government took the ship back.\n\nAfter a new restoration period of 10 months, the Savarona was ready for official use in August 2014. However, it was not until March 4, 2015 that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had the first official reception on board, including a short cruise along the Bosporus, with his guest the Bosnian politician Bakir Izetbegović.\n\n\"Savarona\" features a swimming pool, a Turkish bath, a 282-foot (86 m) gold-trimmed grand staircase that survived from her original construction, a movie theater, and a library suite dedicated to Atatürk, which is furnished with many of his personal artifacts. Under its charter operator the yacht was available for charter including the crew but not provisions.\n\nSource\n\n"}

{"id": "3166055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3166055", "title": "Peter Ward (paleontologist)", "text": "Peter Ward (paleontologist)\n\nPeter Douglas Ward (born 1949) is an American paleontologist and professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, and Sprigg Institute of Geobiology at the University of Adelaide. He has written numerous popular science works for a general audience and is also an adviser to the Microbes Mind Forum.\n\nHis parents, Joseph and Ruth Ward, moved to Seattle following World War II. Ward grew up in the Seward Park neighborhood of Seattle, attending Franklin High School, and he spent time during summers at a family summer cabin on Orcas Island.\n\nWard's academic career has included teaching posts and professional connections with Ohio State University, the NASA Astrobiology Institute, the University of California, McMaster University (where he received his PhD in 1976), and the California Institute of Technology. He was elected as a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences in 1984.\n\nWard specializes in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and mass extinctions generally. He has published books on biodiversity and the fossil record. His 1992 book \"On Methuselah's Trail\" received a \"Golden Trilobite Award\" from the Paleontological Society as the best popular science book of the year. Ward also serves as an adjunct professor of zoology and astronomy.\n\nHis book \"The End Of Evolution\" was published in 1994. In it, he discussed in three parts, each about an extinction event on earth. This book was rewritten and published in 2000 as \"Rivers in Time\".\n\nWard is co-author, along with astronomer Donald Brownlee, of the best-selling \"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe\", published in 2000. In that work, the authors suggest that the universe is fundamentally hostile to advanced life, and that, while simple life might be abundant, the likelihood of widespread lifeforms as advanced as those on Earth is marginal. In 2001, his book \"Future Evolution\" was published, featuring illustrations by artist Alexis Rockman.\n\nWard and Brownlee are also co-authors of the book \"The Life and Death of Planet Earth: How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of the World\", which discusses the Earth's future and eventual demise as it is ultimately destroyed by a warming and expanding Sun. In this book, Ward and Brownlee depict Earth's long-term future by comparing its lifespan to that of a typical human's, pointing out that its systems that keep it habitable will gradually break down one by one, like organs in a humans as he or she dies. They also predict the Earth's eventual fate by compressing its 12 billion-year-old history to a clock spanning 12 hours, with the first life appearing at 1:00 am, and the first animals and plants appearing at 4:00 am, with the present day being 4:29.59 am; and even though the Earth will be destroyed by the Sun at \"high noon\", animals and plants will come to an end by 5:00 am. The book actually picks up where \"Rare Earth\" has left off, this time it talk about how and why the Earth is actually not just rare in space, but also in time all because of this. See also Future of the Earth.\n\nAccording to Ward's 2007 book, \"Under a Green Sky: Global Warming, the Mass Extinctions of the Past, and What They Can Tell Us About Our Future\", all but one of the major mass extinction events in history have been brought on by climate change. The author argues that events in the past can give valuable information about the future of our planet. Reviewer Doug Brown goes further, stating \"this is how the world ends.\" Scientists at the Universities of York and Leeds also warn that the fossil record supports evidence of impending mass extinction. Recently, Ward is slowly starting to shift his interest toward climate change because of his experiences with studying mass extinctions, as well as justifying why intelligent life, including humanity, is especially even rarer than complex life in general in terms of both space and time, as intelligent life only lasts for just a few thousand years before finally collapsing and going extinct, as seen in the book \"The Flooded Earth.\" However, in 2014, Ward returned to his roots as a paleontologist with his book \"A New History of Life\", co-authored with Joe Kirschvink, and in his upcoming 2018 book, \"Lamarck's Revenge\".\n\nThe Medea hypothesis is a term coined by Ward for the anti-Gaian hypothesis that multicellular life, understood as a superorganism, is suicidal.\nIn this view, microbial-triggered mass extinctions are attempts to return the Earth to the microbial-dominated state it has been for most of its history.\nIn 2009 Ward wrote a book about this hypothesis under the same name.\n\nPeter Ward was featured in the PBS's \"Evolution\" series (2001) to discuss the evidence for evolution in the geologic record and has appeared on \"NOVA scienceNOW\".\nHe was also one of the scientists on Animal Planet's \"Animal Armageddon \"(2009).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "362386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362386", "title": "Problem-based learning", "text": "Problem-based learning\n\nProblem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. The PBL process does not focus on problem solving with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes. This includes knowledge acquisition, enhanced group collaboration and communication. The PBL process was developed for medical education and has since been broadened in applications for other programs of learning. The process allows for learners to develop skills used for their future practice. It enhances critical appraisal, literature retrieval and encourages ongoing learning within a team environment.\n\nThe PBL tutorial process involves working in small groups of learners. Each student takes on a role within the group that may be formal or informal and the role often alternates. It is focused on the student's reflection and reasoning to construct their own learning. The Maastricht seven-jump process involves clarifying terms, defining problem(s), brainstorming, structuring and hypothesis, learning objectives, independent study and synthesis. In short, it is identifying what they already know, what they need to know, and how and where to access new information that may lead to the resolution of the problem. The role of the tutor is to facilitate learning by supporting, guiding, and monitoring the learning process. The tutor aims to build students' confidence when addressing problems, while also expanding their understanding. This process is based on constructivism. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy, which is more often lecture-based. The constructs for teaching PBL are very different from traditional classroom or lecture teaching and often requires more preparation time and resources to support small group learning.\n\nWood (2003) defines problem-based learning as a process that uses identified issues within a scenario to increase knowledge and understanding. The principles of this process are listed below: \n\nThe PBL process was pioneered by Barrows and Tamblyn at the medical school program at McMaster University in Hamilton in the 1960s. Traditional medical education disenchanted students, who perceived the vast amount of material presented in the first three years of medical school as having little relevance to the practice of medicine and clinically based medicine. The PBL curriculum was developed in order to stimulate learning by allowing students to see the relevance and application to future roles. It maintains a higher level of motivation towards learning, and shows the importance of responsible, professional attitudes with teamwork values. The motivation for learning drives interest because it allows for selection of problems that have real-world application.\n\nProblem-based learning has subsequently been adopted by other medical school programs adapted for undergraduate instruction, as well as K-12. The use of PBL has expanded from its initial introduction into medical school programs to include education in the areas of other health sciences, math, law, education, economics, business, social studies, and engineering. PBL includes problems that can be solved in many different ways depending on the initial identification of the problem and may have more than one solution.\n\nThere are advantages of PBL. It is student-focused, which allows for active learning and better understanding and retention of knowledge. It also helps to develop life skills that are applicable to many domains. It can be used to enhance content knowledge while simultaneously fostering the development of communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, and self-directed learning skills.\nPBL may position students to optimally function using real-world experiences. By harnessing collective group intellect, differing perspectives may offer different perceptions and solutions to a problem. Following are the advantages and limitations of problem-based learning.\n\nIn problem-based learning the students are actively involved and they like this method. It fosters active learning, and also retention and development of lifelong learning skills. It encourages self-directed learning by confronting students with problems and stimulates the development of deep learning.\nhttp://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001221/122102Eo.pdf\n\nProblem-based learning gives emphasis to lifelong learning by developing in students the potential to determine their own goals, locate appropriate resources for learning and assume responsibility for what they need to know. (Candy PC. Self-direction for lifelong learning: a comprehensive guide to theory and practice. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1991.). It also greatly helps them better long term knowledge retention.\n\nProblem-based learning focuses on engaging students in finding solutions to real life situations and pertinent contextualized problems. In this method discussion forums collaborative research take the place of lecturing.\n\nPBL fosters deep learning by involving students with the interaction of learning materials. They relate the concept they study with everyday activities and enhance their knowledge and understanding. Students also activate their prior knowledge and build on existing conceptual knowledge frameworks.\n\nStudents themselves resolve the problems that are given to them, they take more interest and responsibility for their learning. They themselves will look for resources like research articles, journals, web materials etc. for their purpose. Thus it equips them with more proficiency in seeking resources in comparison to the students of traditional learning methods.\n\nBy giving more significance to the meaning, applicability and relevance to the learning materials it leads to better understanding of the subjects learnt. When students are given more challenging and significant problems are given it makes them more proficient. The real life contexts and problems makes their learning more profound, lasting and also enhance the transferability of skills and knowledge from the classroom to work. Since there is more scope for application of knowledge and skills the transferability is increased. It will be also very helpful to them not only to visualise what it will be like applying that knowledge and expertise on their field of work or profession.\n\nProject based learning is more of teamwork and collaborative learning. The teams or groups resolve relevant problems in collaboration and hence it fosters student interaction, teamwork and reinforces interpersonal skills. like peer evaluation, working with group dynamic etc. It also fosters in them the leadership qualities, learn to make decision by consensus and give constructive feed back to the team members etc.\n\nResearchers say that students like problem-based learning classes rather than the traditional classes. The increase in the percentage of attendance of students and their attitude towards this approach itself makes it very clear that they are self-motivated. In fact it is more fascinating, stimulating and one of the good learning methods because it is more flexible and interesting to students. They enjoy this environment of learning for it is less threatening and they can learn independently. All these aspects make students more self-motivated and they pursue learning even after they leave the school or college.\n\nSince the students are self-motivated, good teamwork, self-directed learning etc. the teachers who have worked in both traditional and project based learning formats prefer project based learning. They also feel that problem-based learning is more nurturing, significant curriculum and beneficial to the cognitive growth of the student.\n\nThe PBL students score higher than the students in traditional courses because of their learning competencies, problem solving, self-assessment techniques, data gathering, behavioral science etc. It is because they are better at activating prior knowledge, and they learn in a context resembling their future context and elaborate more on the information presented which helps in better understanding and retention of knowledge. In medical education, PBL cases can incorporate dialogue between patients and physicians, demonstrate the narrative character of the medical encounter, and examine the political economic contributors to disease production. PBL can serve as a platform for a discursive practices approach to culture that emphasizes the emergent, participant-constructed qualities of social phenomena while also acknowledging large-scale social forces.\n\nAccording to Wood (2003), the major disadvantage to this process involves the utilization of resources and tutor facilitation. It requires more staff to take an active role in facilitation and group-led discussion and some educators find PBL facilitation difficult and frustrating. It is resource-intensive because it requires more physical space and more accessible computer resources to accommodate simultaneous smaller group-learning. Students also report uncertainty with information overload and are unable to determine how much study is required and the relevance of information available. Students may not have access to teachers who serve as the inspirational role models that traditional curriculum offers.\n\nAlthough students generally like and gain greater ability to solve real-life problems in problem-based learning courses, instructors of the methodology must often invest more time to assess student learning and prepare course materials, as compared to LBL instructors. Part of this frustration also stems from the amount of time dedicated to presenting new research and individual student findings regarding each specific topic, as well as the disorganised nature of brain-storming\n\nThe problem of the problem-based learning is the traditional assumptions of the students. Most of the students might have spent their previous years of education assuming their teacher as the main disseminator of knowledge. Because of this understanding towards the subject matter students may lack the ability to simply wonder about something in the initial years of problem-based learning.\n\nThe instructors have to change their traditional teaching methodologies in order to incorporate problem-based learning. Their task is to question students' knowledge, beliefs, give only hints to correct their mistakes and guide the students in their research. All these features of problem-based learning may be foreign to some instructors; hence they find it difficult to alter their past habits.\n\nThe instructors have to adapt new assessment methods to evaluate the pupils' achievement. They have to incorporate written examinations with modified essay questions, practical examinations, peer and self assessments etc. Problem-based has also been considered more favourable to female participants, whilst having equivocal impacts on their male counterparts when compared to lecture based learning.\n\nSweller and others published a series of studies over the past twenty years that is relevant to problem-based learning, concerning cognitive load and what they describe as the guidance-fading effect. Sweller et al. conducted several classroom-based studies with students studying algebra problems. These studies have shown that active problem solving early in the learning process is a less effective instructional strategy than studying worked examples (Sweller and Cooper, 1985; Cooper and Sweller, 1987). Certainly active problem solving is useful as learners become more competent, and better able to deal with their working memory limitations. But early in the learning process, learners may find it difficult to process a large amount of information in a short time. Thus the rigors of active problem solving may become an issue for novices. Once learners gain expertise the scaffolding inherent in problem-based learning helps learners avoid these issues. These studies were conducted largely based on individual problem solving of well-defined problems.\n\nSweller (1988) proposed cognitive load theory to explain how novices react to problem solving during the early stages of learning. Sweller, et al. suggests a worked example early, and then a gradual introduction of problems to be solved. They propose other forms of learning early in the learning process (worked example, goal free problems, etc.); to later be replaced by completions problems, with the eventual goal of solving problems on their own. This problem-based learning becomes very useful later in the learning process.\n\nMany forms of scaffolding have been implemented in problem-based learning to reduce the cognitive load of learners. These are most useful to enable decreasing (\"fading\") the amount of guidance during problem solving. A gradual fading of guidance helps learners to slowly transit from studying examples to solving problems. In this case backwards fading was found to be quite effective and assisting in decreasing the cognitive load on learners.\n\nEvaluation of the effects of PBL learning in comparison to traditional instructional learning have proved to be a challenge. Various factors can influence the implementation of PBL: extent of PBL incorporation into curriculum, group dynamics, nature of problems used, facilitator influence on group, and the motivation of the learners. There are also various outcomes of PBL that can be measured including knowledge acquisition and clinical competence. Additional studies are needed to investigate all the variables and technological scaffolds, that may impact the efficacy of PBL.\n\nImplementing PBL in schools and Universities is a demanding process that requires resources, a lot of planning and organization.\nAzer discusses the 12 steps for implementing the \"pure PBL\"\n\nProblem-based learning addresses the need to promote lifelong learning through the process of inquiry and constructivist learning. PBL is considered a constructivist approach to instruction because it emphasizes collaborative and self-directed learning while being supported by tutor facilitation. Yew and Schmidt, Schmidt, and Hung elaborate on the cognitive constructivist process of PBL:\n\nSeveral studies support the success of the constructivist problem-based and inquiry learning methods. One example is a study on a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application, which found that students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.\n\nOne large study tracked middle school students' performance on high-stakes standardized tests to evaluate the effectiveness of inquiry-based science. The study found a 14 percent improvement for the first cohort of students and a 13 percent improvement for the second cohort. The study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.\n\nA systematic review of the effects of problem-based learning in medical school on the performance of doctors after graduation showed clear positive effects on physician competence. This effect was especially strong for social and cognitive competencies such as coping with uncertainty and communication skills.\n\nAnother study from Slovenia looked at whether students who learn with PBL are better at solving problems and if their attitudes towards mathematics were improved compared to their peers in a more traditional curriculum. The study found that students who were exposed to PBL were better at solving more difficult problems; however, there was no significant difference in student attitude towards mathematics.\n\nIn Malaysia, an attempt was made to introduce a problem-based learning model in secondary mathematics, with the aim of educating citizens to prepare them for decision-making in sustainable and responsible development. This model called Problem-Based Learning the Four Core Areas (PBL4C) first sprouted in SEAMEO RECSAM in 2008, and as a result of training courses conducted, a paper was presented at the EARCOME5 conference in 2010, followed by two papers during the 15th UNESCO-APEID conference in 2011. This model was introduced to the field of education management, Education for International and Intranational Understanding (EIU), and human resource management, among educators from countries, in and beyond Malaysia, affiliated with SEAMEO RECSAM. Several Malaysian universities had begun implementing PBL in their curricula in an effort to improve the quality of their education. In collaboration with Aalborg University of Denmark, PBL was introduced at University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). Since then the PBL was widely used among engineering and as well as humanities lecturers at UTHM. In Universiti Malaya, the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Dental Surgery courses included several sessions of problem-based learning in their curriculum as a way of teaching interactions between students.\n\nIn Singapore, the most notable example of adopting PBL pedagogy in curriculum is Republic Polytechnic, the first polytechnic in Singapore to fully adopt PBL across all diploma courses.\n\nSeveral medical schools have incorporated problem-based learning into their curricula following the lead of McMaster University Medical School, using real patient cases to teach students how to think like a clinician. More than eighty percent of medical schools in the United States now have some form of problem-based learning in their programs. Research of 10 years of data from the University of Missouri School of Medicine indicates that PBL has a positive effect on the students' competency as physicians after graduation.\n\nMonash University was the second institution to adopt PBL within a medical school environment and continues to apply this within the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences for the Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) programs delivered in Australia and Malaysia.\n\nMaastricht University offers its whole program in PBL format only, as does St. George's University of London, another pioneer in the PBL format. The University of Limerick graduate entry medical school in Ireland followed by adapting the SGUL program as well as other programs to also provide its program in PBL format only.\nIn 1983 the college of medicine and medical sciences was founded in Bahrain as part of the Arabian Gulf University. It adopts a problem-based learning curriculum from the beginning and offers its MD program in PBL only.\nIn 1998, Western University of Health Sciences opened its College of Veterinary Medicine, with curriculum based completely on PBL.\n\nIn 2002, UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Medical Program (JMP), an accredited five year Master of Science/Medical Doctorate Program housed at University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, began offering a 100% case based curriculum to their students in their pre-clerkship years.\nThe curriculum integrates the basic and preclinical sciences while fostering an understanding of the biological, social, and moral contexts of human health and disease. The students spend their last two clerkship years at University of California, San Francisco.\n\nPeninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry (South West England), set up its medical BMBS course based around PBL in 2002. Peninsula offered a fully integrated course that prepared students for life as a doctor, with early exposure to clinical experiences and opportunities to discuss them through their PBL and small-group programme. In 2010 PCMD was divided to create Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry and Exeter Medical School. The PBL courses of each school continues to develop and now uses an 8 step process, which is an evolution of the Maastricht 7 jump process.\n\nLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) offers a PBL pathway at the main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania. In 2004, LECOM founded a branch campus in Bradenton, Florida, using an entirely PBL format. A satellite campus in Greensburg, Pennsylvania is also exclusively PBL.\n\nIn 2002, Gadjah Mada University of Yogyakarta, Indonesia began offering an International Medicine program based on problem-based learning.\nGazeira University in Sudan was the first in the country to adopt PBL in its medical college, a trend that was followed by some of the newer medical colleges. In 2008 the famous Faculty of Medicine of the University of Khartoum, which was following a traditional curriculum since its foundation in 1924 made a being change in curriculum structure by adopting a blend curriculum that incorporate problem solving learning strategies.\n\nIn 2008 Aljouf University of Sakakah, Saudi Arabia and Alfaisal University [Riyadh], [Saudi Arabia]and Sulaiman Al Rajhi Colleges[Qassim],[Saudi Arabia] started using PBL for all of their medical programmes.\n\nThe Deakin University School of Medicine, which opened in Waurn Ponds, Victoria in 2008 uses the PBL format as part of its Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Optometry courses.\n\nIn 2009, Libyan International Medical University of Benghazi, Libya started using PBL for all of its medical programmes.\n\nIn 2008, Parramatta Marist High School, a secondary Catholic school in Australia, employed the methods of PBL in their teaching for year 9 and 10 boys. The learning system was a great success and since has been expanded to lower grades to challenge students to think outside of the box and relate content drive courses to problems in the real world.\n\nNorth Lawndale College Prep High School (NLCP), on Chicago's west side, continues to refine its very high expectations Interdisciplinary Projects, or I-Projects. As they progress freshman through senior year, these vertically aligned projects involve increasingly rigorous Common Core State Standards in research, close reading, quantitative reasoning, argumentation, writing, and presentation skills. Each NLCP Junior and Senior Project derives itself from the student's own driving question (examples of driving questions include \"How can genocide be stopped globally?\" and \"Does making obesity a disease help or harm obese people?\"). Additionally and starting in 2014, all NLCP Senior Project Presentations will include the senior's creation of an artistic element that somehow expresses his/her argument, e.g., a documentary film, a website, a business proposal, a literary portfolio, a visual art portfolio, a unique oratory, or performative debate. Noodletools, \"a powerful, integrated platform for research and literacy\", is the assistive technology for North Lawndale's endeavor.\n\nSir John Deane's College, a sixth form college in England, in 2013 offered an extracurricular PBL Course in Medicine positioned towards students studying A-Level Biology and Chemistry who are aspiring to medicine, dentistry, veterinary science degrees or biological sciences at Oxford or Cambridge. The course (developed by Dr. Vimalan Jesudason) successfully served 85 students, before being offered independently in late 2014, PBL Cheshire.\n\nIn Canada, North Peace Secondary School's Energetic Learning Campus (ELC) is based on this philosophy. It takes grade 10 and 11 students, and work through the core courses based on the Prescribed Learning Outcomes for the province of British Columbia. The ELC is a sub-campus of the secondary school and is located inside the Pomeroy Sports Centre. Students are guided through English, Math, Sciences, and Social Studies, along with physical activity.\n\nThe transdisciplinary field of ecological economics has embraced problem-based learning as a core pedagogy. A workbook developed by Joshua Farley, Jon Erickson, and Herman Daly organizes the problem-solving process into (1) building the problem base, (2) analyzing the problem, (3) synthesizing the findings, and (4) communicating the results. Building the problem base includes choosing, defining, and structuring an ecological economic problem. Analysis is breaking down of a problem into understandable components. Synthesis is the re-integration of the parts in a way that helps better understand the whole. Communication is the translation of results into a form relevant to stakeholders, broadly defined as the extended peer community.\n\nOne of the aims of PBL is the development of self-directed learning (SDL) skills. In Loyens, Magda & Rikers' discussion, SDL is defined as \"a process in which individuals take the initiative...in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes\". By being invited into the learning process, students are also invited to take responsibility for their learning, which leads to an increase in self-directed learning skills.\nIn Severiens and Schmidt's study of 305 first year college students, they found that PBL and its focus on SDL led to motivation for students to maintain study pace, led to social and academic integration, encouraged development of cognitive skills, and fostered more study progress than students in a conventional learning setting. PBL encourages learners to take a place in the academic world through inquiring and discovery that is central to problem-based learning.\n\nPBL is also argued as a learning method that can promote the development of critical thinking skills. In PBL learning, students learn how to analyze a problem, identify relevant facts and generate hypotheses, identify necessary information/knowledge for solving the problem and make reasonable judgments about solving the problem.\n\nEmployers have appreciated the positive attributes of communication, teamwork, respect and collaboration that PBL experienced students have developed. These skills provide for better future skills preparation in the ever-changing information explosion. PBL curriculum includes building these attributes through knowledge building, written and interpersonal interactions and through the experience of the problem solving process.\n\nComparing face-to-face setting with strict online PBL, the group activities play the key role in the success of the social interaction in PBL. Online PBL is also seen as more cost-effective. Collaborative PBL has been shown to improve critical thinking scores as compared with individual PBL, and increased students’ achievement levels and retention scores.\n\nFor the instructors, instructional design principles for the instructors regarding the design and development of online PBL must include collaborative characteristics. For example, the scheduling must be conducive to collaborative activities. Additionally, instructors should ensure that the problems should be relevant to real-life experiences, and the nature of solutions and problem contexts. Furthermore, a sound technological infrastructure is paramount.\n\nThe establishment and application of PBL in teaching and training started as early as in the 1960s. As instructional technology developed over time coupled with the emergence of the internet in the mid-1990s, online education became popular gaining huge attention from organizations and institutions. However, the use of PBL in complete online education does not seem as established based on the relatively scarce references available in the literature. In 2001, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) was one of the first few faculties that utilized a learning management system (LMS) to facilitate collaboration and group problem-solving. The result showed the significant impact of online PBL on the learning outcomes of students in many aspects including enhancing their communication skills, problem-solving skills and ability to work as a team. The most successful feature of the LMS in terms of user rate was the discussion boards where asynchronous communications took place. Technology has advanced for another decade since then and it should help us take online PBL to a greater height as many more activities such as synchronous online meetings have been made readily available today on numerous platforms. The key focus here is to examine how technology can further facilitate the effective use of PBL online by zooming into the learner needs in each phase of PBL.\n\nThe first, and possibly most crucial phase in PBL, is to identify the problem. Before learners can begin to solve a problem, all members must understand and agree on the details of the problem. This consensus forms through collaboration and discussion. With online learning on the rise, it is important that learners can engage in collaborative brainstorming and research through the use of technology. Technology allows for groups to collaborate synchronously or asynchronously from anywhere in the world; schedules and geography no longer prevent collaboration in PBL. Today, there is a plethora of tools available to promote group collaboration online, each with unique strengths and limitations. Learning management systems and cloud-based solutions are the two most popular and accessible technological solution for online collaboration. Learning management systems, such as Canvas, Edmodo, Moodle, Schoology, and itslearning, provide schools and classrooms collaborative tools to support synchronous and asynchronous communication and learning. These learning management systems (LMS) allow for supervision and support by the course administrator or professor. One limitation of these systems is their availability; most LMS are restricted by course enrollment. Students must be enrolled in a particular course or subscribe to a specific class to gain access to the tools and content stored in the system. Cloud-based solutions on the other hand, such as Google Apps, OneNote, and the Office 365 suit offer collaborative tools outside the traditional education setting. Educators of all kinds (K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, vocational training, HR training teams, etc.) can access these cloud-based solutions and collaborate with anyone around the world by simply sharing a link. These tools range in availability from free with an email account to subscription costs based on the suit purchased. In addition to potential financial limitations, these cloud-based systems are always as secure or private as an LMS that requires course enrollment. Both LMS and cloud-based solutions present learners with opportunities to collaborate in a variety of ways while brainstorming the meaning of the problem and developing a plan for research and future collaboration.\n\nOnce the problem has been identified, learners move into the second step of PBL: the information gathering phase. In this phase, learners research the problem by gathering background information and researching potential solutions. This information is shared with the learning team and used to generate potential solutions, each with supporting evidence. The most popular online tool for gathering information today is Google, but there are many other search-engines available online. Free search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing, offer access to seemingly countless links to information. While these research tools provide ample sources of potential information, the quantity can be overwhelming. It also becomes difficult to identify quality sources without adding filters and higher-level search strategies when using these broad search-engines. Libraries are a more selective option and often offer online-databases, but typically require an account or subscription for online access to articles and books. Wolframalpha.com is a smart search-engine with both free and subscription level access options. Wolfram claims to be more than a platform for searching the web, rather, \"getting knowledge and answers... by doing dynamic computations based on a vast collection of built-in data, algorithms, and methods.\" \n\nThe third most important phase of PBL is resolving the problem, the critical task is presenting and defending your solution to the given problem. Students need to be able to state the problem clearly, describe the process of problem-solving considering different options to overcome difficulties, support the solution using relevant information and data analysis. Being able to communicate and present the solution clearly is the key to the success of this phase as it directly affects the learning outcomes. With the help of technology, presentation has been made much easier and more effective as it can incorporate visual aids of charts, pictures, videos, animations, simulations etc. Ideas and connections between ideas can be clearly demonstrated using different tools. Microsoft PowerPoint 2016, Apple Keynote, Prezi, and Google Slides are among the top-rated presentation applications of 2017.\n\nThese popular presentation tools have their distinctive features and advantages over one another and can be summarized into three broad types. The first type has almost everything a presenter needs, ranging from tables, charts, picture tools, animations, video tools, add in functions and so forth. Such tools can replace many authoring tools as more complicated functions such as creating simulations, drag and drop etc. are all made possible. Hence, the presentation can be made highly interactive, engaging and compatible with most devices. The best examples are Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote. However, one drawback is that such tools often come at a subscription charge and need to be installed locally on devices. Both PowerPoint and Keynote point more towards the standard form of slide by slide presentations. Prezi represents the second major type of tools with a storytelling style and less traditional or structured form of presentation that allows one to zoom in and out of any part of the screen. These tools are generally web-based and have collaborative functions of value-add for the PBL process. Nevertheless, this type of tools also charge subscription fees based on privilege levels. The third broad type of tools would be the web-based ones free of charge with less fanciful effects, allowing access to presentations collaboratively online anytime. Google Slides is such an option which is easy to use. Though it has less functions, it offers the convenience of being available anytime anywhere on any online device. This type can be effective when students have limited time to prepare for their presentations as it removes many technical difficulties such as arranging for face-to-face meetings, installing the presentation tool or the time needed to learn to create the presentation. Students can spend more time on meaningful discussions about their problem and solution instead of the presentation itself.\n\nPBL stands for People, Problem, Process, Product and Project Based Learning.\n\nThe PBL approach was a learning strategy introduced in Stanford School of Engineering in their PBL laboratory in 1993 as an initiative to offer their graduate students from the engineering, architecture and construction disciplines to implement their skills in a \"cross-disciplinary, collaborative and geographically distributed teamwork experience\". In this approach, which was pioneered by Stanford Professor Fruchter, an environment across six universities from Europe, the United States and Japan along with a toolkit to capture and share project knowledge was developed. The students (people) from the three disciplines were assigned a team project that works on solving a problem and delivering an end-product to a client.\n\nThe main stress of this approach is to have an inter-disciplinary integrated development of deliverables, in order to improve the overall competency and skills of the students. PBL mentoring is a structured activity that involves situated learning and constructivist learning strategies to foster the culture of practice that would extend beyond the university campus to real life. PBL is all about encouraging teaching and learning teamwork in the information age, by facilitating team interaction with professors, industry mentors and owners who provide necessary guidance and support for the learning activity.\n\nKey advantages of this method are that it familiarizes students with real world problems and improves their confidence in solving these. It also improves their networking skills, thereby establishing rapport with key persons of the industry. They also learn the value of teamwork. The method also creates in them an appreciation of interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThe approach however needs due consideration of the mentoring provided to the students. Appropriate scaffolding should be done by the mentors to ensure that students are successful in attaining their project goals to solve the problem. Communication between the team should also be open and constructive in nature for achieving the necessary milestones.\n\n\n\n"}

The event is organised by the Royal Society of New Zealand and Genesis Energy is the principal sponsor. It is a 7-day event which begins in Auckland and the participants travel down the North Island visiting science organisations along the way. The event culminates in an award ceremony usually held at Government House.\n\nNominations are mostly received from the following competitions:\n\nEach competition can submit a maximum of five nominations. For each nomination, students are required to submit, along with a 10-page summary on their project, a 5-minute video of them outlining what they have done. A panel of judges is then selected to choose approximately 20 students to attend the event.\n\nRealise the Dream is a seven-day science camp held in early December. On the first day, participants receive extensive media training in preparation for the promotion that they undertake after the event. The three main focuses of the training are communication, radio interview and media writing.\n\nThere are many science activities that students attend during the week. This includes a visit to DairyNZ, Leigh Marine Research Centre, The University of Auckland (Liggins Institute), Massey University (Palmerston North), Genesis Tokaanu Plant, NIWA and Hamilton Zoo. Guest speakers are invited to give lectures on science-related topics such as intellectual property and affordances.\n\nThe participants also get to experience many opportunities they may otherwise had the opportunity to do. In 2011, participants conquered their fear of heights climbing the Auckland Harbour Bridge and even did a high ropes course in Turangi. Some of the other social outings included dessert at Strawberry Fair, seeing \"Aladdin\" at the Circa Theatre and a Treasure Hunt!\n\nOn the last night, all the participants attend an Awards Ceremony, celebrating the work they have done. In 2011 this was held at Government House. Travel awards were presented, offering trips to Taiwan, Antarctica/Melbourne and Slovakia. As well as those, many cash awards are presented too. There are also team building and leadership awards, valued at $500 each.\nThe Supreme Winner receives $7,000, plus a trip to Europe.\n\nAfter the official ceremony, students are given the opportunity to \"mix and mingle\" with family and guests invited from the science community. The event finishes with a farewell dinner for the participants.\n\nAfter the event, all participants become an Genesis Ambassador for a period of three months while they work on their promotion of their experiences. This includes speaking to student groups and sending out two media releases. There are also optional extra activities for those wishing to put more time and effort in the promotion. Choices include but are not limited to radio and television coverage, on-line promotion, merchandise and mentoring younger students.

{"id": "15006400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15006400", "title": "Regional Broadband Consortium", "text": "Regional Broadband Consortium\n\nRegional Broadband Consortia were created in the United Kingdom in 2000 to secure lower prices for broadband connections and services for schools by aggregating demand across a region and entering into region wide contracts.\nThey were established under the auspices of what was then known as the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) National Grid for Learning (NGfL) programme.\n\nThe Regional Broadband Consortia collectively subscribed to a 2 Mbit/s standard for broadband, for which the origins in the 1990s are unclear. It is not the case, as has been often alleged, that the RBCs created or imposed this standard on English schools, though they were active in reinforcing and publicising the standard. Though it did not appear clearly stated in the NGfL funding guidance until 2003, this standard had been inherited from various fore-running projects including the People's Library Network. 2 Mbit/s was possibly selected with a view to encouraging the use of optical fibre to the site.\n\nDespite frequent challenges, particularly from the telecommunications industry and the dominant national carrier, which held a monopoly outside the urban areas, the RBCs managed to defend the 2 Mbit/s standard against much cheaper emerging ADSL alternatives. Some providers were describing offerings as low as 150 kbit/s as broadband and when the lower relative costs of these highly contended products were taken into account, e.g. £360 per annum rather than £3,600 it was extremely difficult to persuade many educationalists and even many in the IT industry of the advantages of constantly available uncontended high-bandwidth.\n\nIn 1999, the one hundred and fifty or so upper tier English councils responsible for providing a schools' education service were provided with small sums of money (about £150,000 per region) to submit bids to create regional consortia in order to implement a schools broadband connectivity programme. In the first wave, local authorities in eight regions were deemed to have submitted successful bids and granted a share of a total of £35 million of funding in 2000. There were two successful submissions in the North West, one from Cumbria and Lancashire and another from the majority of unitary authorities in the south of that region. Bids from the North-East, from Yorkshire and Humberside, from the East Midlands, East of England, South-East and South Western regions were also accepted. Unsuccessful bids were submitted by the West Midlands local authorities, by councils in the London area and those in the Bristol area.\n\nBy a process for which the responsibility is unclear, seven councils that were not participants in successful bids were also funded. Thus was born a principle of 'opting out'. There were three of these in the North West, three in Yorkshire and Humber and one, Oxfordshire, in the South. Had the fourteen in the West Midlands, the thirty-three in London and the half dozen in the Bristol area been made aware of this back door procedure for obtaining funding there is little doubt that they too would have opted out of the DfES official process.\n\nIn the following year (2001), this funding approach was abandoned and all council education services received broadband grants as an element of their NGfL earmarked grant for ICT. So in 2001 new RBCs came into being in the West Midlands WMnet and London (LGfL), while the Bristol area councils joined South Western Grid. Participation in RBCs was strongly encouraged by the stipulation of the funding arrangements that the council's right to retain and spend the funds for broadband connectivity was conditional upon their participation in an RBC. Councils which did not participate in an RBC were required to \"devolve\" the funds to schools, though there was a lack of clarity on what that meant and even less clarity on whether anything like it actually happened.\n\nThe funding level had now (2001) risen to an aggregate £44 million pa. At a meeting on 27 September 2001, the leading NGfL officer, Doug Brown, formally requested the ten RBC managers to produce a plan for connecting up their networks. At least one of the RBCs, WMnet, had no network to connect, but the policy remained. After some discussion, the RBC managers agreed to \"interconnect\" their regional networks by peering with the universities' JANET network. Councils were required to connect either through membership of an RBC or through their own peering arrangements, though once again there were no mechanisms for monitoring compliance with these requirements and no penalties for those councils which refused to comply. These regional networks connected through the SuperJanet backbone form the communications infrastructure of the nationwide collaboration which came to be known as the National Education Network (NEN)\n\nThe RBCs have worked collaboratively since 2001 and have since been actively joined in their partnership by equivalent organizations in Northern Ireland (C2KN), Scotland (Glow) and Wales (NGfL Cymru). Key partners in RBC activities have been Becta and JANET.\n"}
{"id": "39399300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39399300", "title": "Rudderless", "text": "Rudderless\n\nRudderless is a 2014 American musical comedy drama film which was the directorial debut of William H. Macy, and stars Billy Crudup, Anton Yelchin, Felicity Huffman, Selena Gomez and Laurence Fishburne. The film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2014. The film was released in theaters and through video-on-demand beginning October 17, 2014.\n\nThe film opens as Josh Manning (Miles Heizer) is recording his own songs in his college dorm room for demo and is interrupted by one of his floor mates looking for someone. He stops recording, annoyed at the interruption. Meanwhile, his father Sam Manning (Billy Crudup) has succeeded in landing a large account at his advertising firm, and calls Josh to celebrate with him and skip that day's classes. Josh tells him he cannot make it but his father insists, though Josh begins to make his way to the campus library anyway. Sam continues to wait at the bar where he told him to meet him and even leaves a message for Josh who has apparently stood him up. He is distracted by a news report of a school shooting incident at his son's campus library on the television in the bar. \n\nLater, a memorial wake is being held at Josh's home by his mother, Emily (Felicity Huffman). It is inferred that Josh was one of the victims in the shooting. Due to the media coverage received, Sam has a difficult time being able to grieve in his own way with press being cordoned at the end of the street by police, and a news helicopter hovering above the family home. Sam is consoled by family and attendees while sitting alone to one side as his wife is greeting others. Sam walks into Josh's bedroom to look around, attempting to find some kind of understanding over the loss, and is interrupted by Kate Lucas (Selena Gomez), who tells Sam that she and Josh had been dating the year prior. Sam then makes his way to his own home and finds the media coverage is interfering with his daily life, and he eventually succumbs to alcoholism, as far as showing up intoxicated at his firm; acting erratically and kissing his receptionist in a drunken state, for which his employer is advising him to take time off to better cope with the situation.\n\nTwo years later, Sam has removed himself from his former life and is now living on a sailboat on a lake, far from home, having taken a job as a contractor's assistant and for the most part drinking away his free time. His habits are causing habitual lateness and annoying his employer, who cautions Sam about repeated lateness. Getting up to relieve himself from the side of the boat has caught the chagrin of the governing board of the lake and the \"wrath\" of Alaird Dupree (because it is openly visible to other tenants and the small seafood restaurant nearby), the agent acting on behalf of the board. It is clear he dislikes Sam, and the feeling is very much mutual. Going for a drink with some coworkers after his day of working, he hides the details of his previous life and his true identity from everyone, even making up humorous stories about his past. (He tells his coworkers that he \"fingered\" Gotti and is in the protection of the Federal Witness Protection Program), Sam notices that \"The Trill\" tavern hosts open mic events for musicians. \n\nReturning to the marina, he encounters Emily waiting for him, who says she is moving to Tulsa and is now the mother of a new son. She requires his signature to place their former house up for sale. She has also brought the remainder of Josh's possessions—demo discs, instruments and gear—which Sam emphatically states he has no room for on his tiny sailboat. Emily tells him she was certain he would want it because they had played together since Josh was younger. Hours pass after Emily leaves. He tries his best to ignore the collection of his son's possessions over a meal. He storms over to where Emily had left it beside the road and begins to place it in a dumpster but stops, noticing the notebooks and discs, and begins to listen to them back on the boat, and read through the collection of lyrics and writings Josh left behind. He even begins to teach himself some his son's material. After work the next day, Sam decides to perform \"Home\", one of Josh's songs, at The Trill, and catches the attention of Quentin (Anton Yelchin), a young guitarist who was excitedly moved by the performance. The next day, Quentin brings Sam coffee and food and discusses the previous night performance, stating he believes there are other songs, and if there are, they could perform them together. Sam declares he is not interested, and continues to listen to more and teach himself his son's material.\n\nQuentin tries again the next day and shows him an alternate arrangement possibility for the song. The two end up sharing a meal and playing instruments together for the rest of the night. Sam neglects to tell Quentin that he was not the piece's actual author. At the end of the night, Quentin gets Sam to agree to perform together at The Trill, adding more and more to each arrangement, including a percussion section in the way of Aiken. The next day, Sam is introduced to Del (Laurence Fishburne), the owner and operator of the local music supply store, who reveals that he is selling his business and plans to retire and tour by motor home with his wife in his later years. Quentin shows Sam the 1978 Gibson Les Paul hanging in the store, but is unable to afford it (a source of good-natured joking between Quentin and Del). Upon leaving the store, Sam watches a staged meeting between Quentin and Willy, a bass guitarist, in hopes that they can include him in their performances, but Sam is resistant to starting a band. The next day, the quartet meeting to practice in Quentin's garage beneath his apartment, and Quentin is very evasive about his own past. The group, now complete, has impressed The Trill owner (played by director William H. Macy) who asks them to perform regular Saturday nights as house entertainment, to which the band agrees—even Sam, reluctantly. The new name, “Rudderless”, quickly gains notoriety and local fame. Meanwhile, Quentin is revealed as extremely shy of the opposite sex, which Sam attempts to help him through, though Quentin finds the advice generally unhelpful.\n\nSam arrives at Quentin's apartment one afternoon and meets his mother, Joyce, who Sam mistakes as an older prostitute after seeing Quentin hand her a small amount of cash as they hug. Quentin is embarrassed because his mother has had issues with (unspecified) responsibilities, even spending his junior year of high school living in a car, and has vowed never to lower himself to that level of poverty again. At the mall, Sam buys Quentin new clothing to give him a style, and develop confidence from it. It does help a little, and Quentin begins to enjoy the attention Rudderless has gained him.\n\nFollowing the show, as the band members are to go to a party, Sam sees Kate—now calling herself by her middle name, Ann, who shames him for playing the songs in public. The next day, Sam visits Josh's grave and finds it vandalized as Josh Manning is revealed to have been the killer in the school shooting incident where he died. Emily arrives with cleaning supplies, and implies its a fairly regular occurrence, and the two parents begin to clean off the graffiti from the headstone. Afterward, the two share some tequila, and its revealed that today is Josh's birthday. Emily tells Sam that a couple of the other parents have reached out to her to forgive them for Josh's actions, but Sam still appears to be in denial. Emily insists that they had acted properly in their parental roles and they have nothing to feel guilty for and that Josh had to have been mentally ill to carry out such an act of violence.\n\nContinuing to drink into the Saturday he is scheduled to work, Sam goes to his job and, finding a yard hammock, falls asleep. His employer finds and fires him. Sam assures him that he had already quit and walks away. Later that day, the other members of the band arrive with girls, and spend the afternoon on Sam's boat. As Sam goes below, the other members plead with him about a local block party they have been invited to play, and its entirely possible it could lead to bigger and better opportunities for Rudderless in the way of airplay and exposure. But Sam is reluctant, now knowing that Josh's songs would never be accepted when people find out the truth of their authorship.\n\nSam visits Del the next day to acquire a new amplifier tube, and finds Del and wife Tina having gotten the RV stuck. Sam manages to get it out onto the street. Del asks him why he will not play the show, and Sam begins to question why he is really doing all of this. He arrives at Quentin's garage and insists that the song Quentin wrote will be the final song, finally pushing him out of his comfort zone. \n\nFeeling good about the outcome, Sam makes his way toward the street stage and is surprised to find Kate/Ann talking to the other three members on the stage, presumably telling them the actual origin of the songs they all assumed Sam wrote.\n\nShe confronts him and tells him that the incident and her association with it had so interfered with her life that she had to change her name and leave school. She had been pursued and harassed by people and media alike, asking humiliating questions, even suggesting they had been members of a cult. Quentin asks Sam if it was true, and Sam acknowledges the truth for the first time. Quentin outright refuses to play the material and strikes Sam as he is walking away despite the other two trying to persuade him to play the material one time only, and then move on. Sam again goes into a drinking binge and returns home to the marina to find the Board had the area sealed with a chain link fence. Sam attempts to climb it and falls over to the opposite side, breaking the guitar neck of his guitar strapped to his back, ruining it. \n\nThe next morning, the scheduled sailing regatta Alaird warned him about is loudly underway. The sailboat procession is disrupted by Sam playing the 1812 Overture on his electric, sailing directly into the course of the other boats, and casting some over the sides of their own craft, for which Sam is arrested. He calls Del to bail him out and is surprised when Del tells him he knew who he was the entire time, but did not know the songs were written by Josh. The next day, Sam visits the site of the shooting, and finds the erected memorial identifying the shooting victims by name. Sam breaks down in tears of grief over the guilt of Josh's actions, but finally accepts that he has lost his own son despite what he has done. Sam then visits Emily, bring her Josh's discs, and says that one day, the new baby will want to know who his half brother was beyond what history will paint him to be.\n\nSam then visits Del's store and discovers Quentin has discarded his instruments, telling Del to sell them on consignment. Sam then asks if the offer on the store was a \"good offer\", implying that Sam would be interested in buying Del's store. He then goes to visit Quentin at the donut shop where he works, and implores him to continue playing and writing even if it is without Sam. Sam tells him that he found performing Josh's material addictive, offering catharsis to his life and the bond with Josh. He concludes the visit, having brought back Quentin's guitar cases. One contains the Les Paul that Quentin so long idolized and wanted.\n\nFinally, Sam performs the songs he had been working on, first admitting and telling the audience who Josh was, what he had done, and that he had written the song he was about to play. Closure for Rudderless lets us see Sam has been replaced by a new guitarist. Del has been given Sam's sailboat (presumably in payment), and Emily finally decides to listen to Josh's music.\nSam completes the song, including (presumably) improvised lyrics about missing his son in the song's climax and leaves the stage.\n\n\nJeff Robison and Casey Twenter worked together on the screenplay for about five months in 2008. William H. Macy spent a year reworking the screenplay with the writers once he came aboard the project.\nPrincipal photography started on April 21, 2013 in Oklahoma City and Guthrie, Oklahoma. Scenes were shot at University of Central Oklahoma. Filming wrapped on May 26, 2013.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 62% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10; the site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Rudderless\" asks its cast to carry an awful lot of weight for its occasionally manipulative story; fortunately, this talented bunch -- led by Billy Crudup -- is often more than up to the task\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". While many critics spoke positively of Macy's direction, the soundtrack, and the performances of Crudup and Yelchin, many found issue with the third-act revelation; writing for \"Variety\", Dennis Harvey described it as a \"bewildering error in narrative judgement\".\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on September 30, 2014 by an independent label. It features songs by Eef Barzelay, the film band Rudderless, Selena Gomez and others. The album peaked at No. 12 on Billboard Top Soundtracks chart.\n\n"}

In the latest ranking of Iranian universities based on scientific output, Shiraz University is listed among the top three research-oriented schools in the nation. In the first report of state universities ranking and among almost 70 universities and higher education institutes, Shiraz University is ranked as level 1.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania (Penn) assisted the Iranian government in establishing American-style higher education at the university. Penn thus became highly influential in shaping many of Pahlavi University's departments and institutions. Shiraz University has the second-biggest campus in Iran. It was initially designed by American architect Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the World Trade Center.\n\nShiraz University has pioneered the establishment of doctoral programs in Iran. Presently the university has over 20,000 students, with 200 bachelor's degree programs (B.A., B.Sc.), 300 master's degree programs (M.A., M.Sc.), one professional degree program (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or DVM), and 150 Ph.D. programs.\n\nShiraz University traces its roots to 1946, with the establishment of a technical college aimed at training specialists in the medical sciences with a four-year program.\n\nInitially called the High Institute of Health, it developed into a medical school in 1950.\nIn 1953, the Namazi School of Nursing and the Colleges of Agriculture and Arts and Sciences were established.\n\nWith the addition of the College of Engineering and College of Veterinary Medicine in 1954, the school was elevated to university-status and named after the reigning Pahlavi dynasty. Other units that were subsequently added were the Dental School in 1969, the Graduate School and College of Electronics in 1969, Dentistry in 1970 and the Colleges of Law and Education in 1977.\n\nIn 1960, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, King of Iran invited University of Pennsylvania president Gaylord Harnwell to come to Iran and examine Iran's higher education institutions. Harnwell prepared a report at the Shah's request, entitled \"A Pattern for a New University in Iran\", and the Shah subsequently decided that Penn would assist the Iranian government in transforming Pahlavi University into the only institution in Iran based on American-style higher education. The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) thus became highly influential in shaping many of Pahlavi University's departments and institutions. Many faculty members from Penn were hence sent to Shiraz to teach and carry out research at the university, and a widespread exchange program was established. The president of the University of Pennsylvania was even awarded an honorary degree in Shiraz in recognition of the help of \"Penn\" to Pahlavi University.\n\nAfter the 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty, drastic changes were implemented at all universities. The name of Pahlavi University was immediately changed to Shiraz University. All universities were closed for three years in a so-called Iran's Cultural Revolution of 1980-1987 to islamize all the universities.\n\nThe official seal of the Shiraz University serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation. Before the Islamic Revolution in Iran, a logo was used as the official logo of Pahlavi University inspired by Persepolis. The logo was inscribed with two words; Wisdom and Effort. However, after the revolution, this logo was also changed.\n\nAfter the Revolution, the later seal designed by current faculty of Department of Arts, Bahman Feizabi. According to him the basic motif for the new seal was inspired by the tree of life relief in Taq Bostan which is one of the most important motifs in the Sassanian era.\n\nAccording to a report by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran) published in 2010 and 2011, Shiraz University ranked 6th respectively between 64 and 68 non-medical universities and institutions in Iran. It was also one of top three non-technical and non-medical universities along with the University of Tehran and Tarbiat Modares University in a 2012 ranking.\nThe university is known to be strict and usually the grade point average(GPA) of students in various departments is generally lower than their peers in other universities of Iran. Shiraz University is well known as a tough university with low GPA (Grade Point Average) specially in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical engineering . Even universities like Sharif University of Technology and University of Tehran are not tough to the extent of Shiraz University. That’s why many students of Shiraz University believe their grades do not reflect their academic performance.\n\nAccording to the 2017 rankings of the best universities given by the Times Higher Education, Shiraz University has been ranked in the top 3 universities in Iran. In 2016 only eight universities from Iran were included in this ranking, whereas in 2017, fourteen universities from Iran were among the top universities rankings. Based on these rankings, Shiraz University became the best comprehensive university in Iran.\n\nThe first university horse manege was opened at Shiraz University in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

Since the mid-90's every year the law firm Surana and Surana International Attorneys have hosted, administered & sponsored over a hundred moot court competitions (the count is till 2013 and continuing) in partnership with India's leading law schools. This project is one of the largest of its kind in the world by any law firm. In the academic initiatives taken by corporates, Surana & Surana stands as a benchmark in the whole legal fraternity. Probably this is what it means to be called as the \"Pioneers of moot court competitions in India\".\n\nThe Surana and Surana Moots project was initiated by the founder of Surana and Surana International Attorneys, P.S.Surana. One day in the late 80's, Honb'le Justice Krishna Iyer during his stay with the Surana family, spoke at length about the need to nurture young advocates with good advocacy skills. He was also concerned about the fact that bright young law graduates were joining the corporate sector, thereby depriving the Bar of a steady flow of good talent. This prompted Mr. Surana to plan a well structured & transparent moot court competition platform for law students to develop skills in oral and written advocacy as well as legal research. The cases prepared for the competitions are based on either emerging or unsettled areas of law. This requires participants to come up with innovative arguments which in turn helps develop new jurisprudence. Members of the higher & lower judiciary have participated in these moots and have greatly appreciated the efforts of Surana & Surana in developing legal skills among generations of budding lawyers.\n\nThere are several new and exciting moots coming up in the year 2018. The details of some of these have been released on moot.in which is the official website for Surana & Surana Moots.\n\nEstablished in 2002. with the aim of training the participants in application of laws to challenges posed by the rapid technological advancements, this moot focuses on the developments in Public and Private International Law and has ingredients of international trade and operations of multi national corporations. Themes covered till date include Information Technology, Biotechnology, Intellectual Property, Space laws, Aviation, Nuclear proliferation, Communication, Cyber Crime and Broadcasting. Participants gain considerable expertise in the respective domains on which the issues are framed.\n\nEstablished in 2002, to provide Indian law students an opportunity to develop expertise in the area of corporate laws like Companies Act, Taxation (domestic and international), Contracts, Foreign Exchange and Investments, Securities Regulations and Corporate Governance. The highlight of the competition is that it is also open to students of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and Institute of Company secretaries of India (ICSI).\n\nThis moot was conceived with the purpose of creating awareness on the Constitutional Law in a systematic and scientific manner. Participation provides exposure to constitutional law practice & facilitates the evolution of constitutional law through comparative study and analysis of existing laws and consequential emergence of new laws in the world. This moot was started in 2016-17 in association with KLE Law College, Bangalore.\n\nEstablished in 2005, This competition was conceived as one of its kind, with the aim of promoting skills of trial advocacy. In its 10th successful year (2014), this national moot is by far the most appreciated moot for its innovation and structure. Popular demand led to the creation of three more editions of this unique moot [India North, India South, India North East & India West (from 2014–15) rounds.] This was the first moot ever to be held in the North Eastern region of India in 2012. This is a moot where the students of the host institution actively participate as witnesses for the oral rounds.\n\nThe India regional rounds of this most prestigious International Law Moot, Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition has been Co-sponsored, Co-hosted and administered by Surana & Surana since the 1990s in partnership with various prestigious law schools across India. This moot covers the entire gamut of Public International Law that includes the latest developments worldwide. Judges from the higher judiciary, legal experts, and professors of International law, practising advocates who had earlier participated/won Jessup competition are invited to judge the competition.\n\nThe top two teams from each of the regional rounds represent India in the International Rounds at Washington. In the event of a single national round, one team for every ten teams registered will be selected to represent India, with a cap of 4 teams at maximum.\n\nNational Law School of India University, Bangalore has won the International rounds in 2005 and in 2013.\n\nThe India regional rounds of this most prestigious international environmental law moot by Stetson University College of Law has been Co-sponsored, Co-hosted & administered by Surana & Surana in partnership with leading Indian law schools since the late 1990s.\n\nNLU Jodhpur won the competition for the first time in the year 2013. Gujarat National Law University, a team composed of Shikhar Maniar, Manya Oberoi and Sujoy Sur, won the competition in 2017.\n\nConceived to create awareness on the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and to facilitate the evolution of minority rights through the jurisprudential analysis of the existing law and consequential emergence of new law.\n\nThis moot was organised from 2005-06 to 2010-11 in association with Maharashtra Cosmopolitan Educational Society, Pune and AKK New Law Academy, Pune. This moot's theme offers the opportunity for comparative study of the Constitutions and Laws of different countries in the area of minority rights thereby giving participants insights into international jurisprudence on minority rights.\n\nThis moot was conceived with the purpose of creating awareness on the Law of Torts in a systematic and scientific manner. Participation provides exposure to tort law practice & facilitates the evolution of tort law through comparative study and analysis of existing laws and consequential emergence of new laws in the world. This moot was organized in 2012-13 in association with Maharashtra Cosmopolitan Educational Society, Pune and AKK New Law Academy, Pune.\n\nIn light of the then proposed National Company Law Tribunal (finally set up under the 2013 Companies Act) this moot was initiated in partnership with the Institute of Company Secretaries of India to provide students of the Company Secretary course in nuances of Indian legal system and to hone their advocacy skills. It aimed to provide a real-life experience cum training in doing cutting-edge research, presenting ground breaking arguments (oral and written) and contributing to the development of corporate law jurisprudence. The moot helped achieve the above objectives with about 100 teams participating in the 5 years of its tenure between 2005-06 to 2010-11.\n\n"}

The Kildonan School is exclusively for students with dyslexia and language-based learning disabilities.\n\nThe Kildonan School was founded in 1969 by Diana Hanbury King and Kurt Goldman. The college preparatory program, currently with a 100% college acceptance rate, evolved from Dunnabeck, the one-to-one Orton-Gillingham based language remediation summer camp also founded by Diana King, which still takes place on the school’s campus every summer.\n\nMs. King taught for years at Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. and at Camp Mansfield in Vermont, the latter of which was founded by Helene Durbrow, who studied directly under Dr. Samuel Orton. Ms. King has written numerous books on the Orton-Gillingham approach, and she lectures across the country and trains teachers in Orton Gillingham methodology in the US, in Bermuda, and in Asia.\n\nThe Orton-Gillingham approach is a structured, flexible, multisensory way of teaching reading and writing. When implemented at integral times and in appropriate ways, it has been shown to remediate dyslexia to the point of “normal” counterparts. It remediates dyslexia by attending to the neural language-processing system of individuals with high IQs with a seemingly inexplicable deficit in reading or spelling, and departs from older methodologies that focused on the visual system.\n\nThe Kildonan School was accredited in 2003 by the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators and re-accredited by NYSAIS (the New York State Association of Independent Schools) in 2013. The Kildonan School currently has two AOGPE Fellows on staff who mentor each tutor the school employs through 70 hours of pre-tutoring training and the AOGPE associate/certification process.\n\nDyslexic students learn language differently from other students – specifically, it has been posited that dyslexics compensate for lack of activity while reading in the angular gyrus (responsible for signifiers in language and residing in the back of the brain) with lots of activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (responsible for speech and residing in the front of the brain). Research shows, therefore, that dyslexic students tend to also have trouble with balance and coordination. In keeping with brain research that shows that language remediation relies on stimulating connections between brain networks, and specifically between the two hemispheres of the brain, The Kildonan School requires all lower school students to train in horseback riding and all upper school students to learn to ski. These two sports are balance sports, and so require students to make neural connections between both hemispheres of the brain.\n\nKildonan’s mission of empowering students with dyslexia is in keeping with research by Brock and Fernette Eide and Ben Foss, which shows that a way to open up future opportunities for dyslexics is to play on their strengths. To this end, Kildonan encourages its staff to include \"The Dyslexic Advantage\" and \"The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan\" in their professional development plans.\n\n\n"}

Watson. The Foundation’s stated vision is to empower students “to expand their vision, test and develop their potential, and gain confidence and perspective to do so for others.” The Watson Foundation operates two programs, the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship and the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship.\n\nThe two programs were based in two different cities, Providence and New York City, but in 2006 the two fellowships were united in New York.\n\nIn 2018 the Watson Foundation celebrated its 50th Anniversary. The Foundation moved into its new offices in New York’s Woolworth Building that same year.\nThe Thomas J. Watson Fellowship is a grant that enables graduating seniors to pursue a year of independent study outside the United States. 1968 was the Fellowship's first year, providing graduates with a year to \"explore with thoroughness a particular interest, test their aspirations and abilities, view their lives and American society in greater perspective and, concomitantly, develop a more informed sense of international concern\". In 2018, the fellowship celebrated its 50th anniversary. In that time, over 42,000 students submitted applications, and nearly 2,000 fellowships were awarded, making the fellowship similarly selective to the Rhodes or Marshall Scholarships. Unlike those programs, only undergraduates in their senior year at 40 colleges are eligible to apply. \n\nThe fellowship itself grants recipients money to spend one year traveling in pursuit of their projects. Recipients are forbidden from reentering the United States and their home country for one year. Projects are not academically oriented, as the fellowship is intended to encourage exploration and new experiences rather than formal research. Currently the award is $30,000 per fellow or $40,000 for a fellow traveling with a spouse or dependent. The stipend also provides student loan repayment for the duration of the fellowship. The Watson Foundation emphasizes that the grant is an investment in a person rather than a project. During their travels the Fellows remain unaffiliated with a college or university, instead planning and administering their projects themselves. They are barred from working on a paying job, and are discouraged from joining organized volunteer projects for substantial periods of time.\n\nQualities sought in fellows include: Leadership, Imagination, Independence, Emotional Maturity, Courage, Integrity, Resourcefulness, and Responsibility. Institutions eligible to nominate Watson Fellows are 40 select small liberal arts colleges with an undergraduate population of fewer than 3,000 students:\n\n\n\nIn 1999, the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship was created to expose undergraduate students to work through three successive summer internships and mentorship. The fellowship is a competitive academic grant made each year to fifteen undergraduates nominated by 12 affiliated New York City colleges which provides successive summer experiences for three years, stipends, mentoring, seminars, and discovery fund. \n\nThe fellowship is named after Jeannette K. Watson, the first female member of the IBM Board of Directors, and wife of Thomas J. Watson. \n\nDuring their first summer, Jeannette K. Watson Fellows intern at a New York City based partner, while the second and third summers can be in New York City, anywhere else in the United States, or overseas. Over the three year fellowship, fellows must go overseas at least once. Fellows are awarded three successive annual grants of $5,500, $6,500, $7,000 in addition to a $2,000 discovery fund. Fellows have gone on to win prestigious awards like the Harry S. Truman Scholarship, the Fulbright Program, and The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. They have also gone on to graduate school at the University of Oxford, Harvard University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. \n\nQualities sought include high standards, ambition, openness, desire to explore diverse cultures and new professional fields, willingness to act on feedback, leadership, ability to work in groups, integrity and accountability, and a strong academic record. The following 12 partnering colleges nominate up to four candidates to be considered in a citywide selections process.\n\n\nThe Fellowship was established by the Thomas J. Watson Foundation in 1999. Its founding Director, the late Alice Stone Ilchman, former President of Sarah Lawrence College and Elizabeth Buckner, former Board of Advisors member, developed the original idea for the Fellowship and began working with eight colleges. Frank Wolf, its second director, served from 2006 until his retirement in 2012. Dean Emeritus of the School of Continuing Education at Columbia University, Wolf extended participation to four additional New York City colleges and expanded substantially the Fellowship's internships in the for-profit sector. In 2012 the Foundation combined the directorships of its two programs with the appointment of Chris Kasabach as the Executive Director of the Thomas J. Watson Foundation.\n\n\n"}

While he was still very young, he worked on a farm for a period of time before being apprenticed to a carpenter under training of Adam Sievwright. While excelling at carpentry, he also was reported to have distinguished himself by his profanity learned when was a shepherd boy.\n\nAccording to Milne, he had \"a natural prediction for books.\" When he was young, Milne memorized the Westminster Shorter Catechism, and Thomas Wilson's Mother's Catechism, but had no impact from them, rather as Milne later said, it was for the purpose of \"to be equal with my neighbours, and to avoid the displeasure of the minister of the parish.\" About thirteen years of age, Milne experienced \"a partial reformation,\" which was effected through: 1) the reading of tracts and Christian books, 2) two pious Christian examples, 3) hope of salvation through prayer, 4) fear of evil and danger, and 5) the sufferings of Christ symbolized through the Lord's Table. From then, Milne started to attend Sunday schools and prayer meetings. In 1801, by the age of sixteen, Milne experienced conversion.\n\nSoon after his conversion, Milne decided to leave the Church of Scotland, and to join \"another body of Christians\" which was evangelical and with edifying preaching. As a result, in 1804, Mine was received as a member of a Congregational church pastored by George Cowie at Huntly.\n\nAbout 1809, he applied to the London Missionary Society. After conferring with a group of ministers at Aberdeen, he was sent to Gosport, where he studied under David Bogue for three years. Ordained as a missionary to China on 16 July 1812 at Rev. John Griffin's church at Portsea, Portsmouth, Milne proposed \"to go from house to house, from village to village, from town to town, and from country to country, where access may be gained, in order to preach the Gospel to all who will not turn away their ear from it.\" \n\nMilne was married to Rachel Cowie, daughter of Charles Cowie, Esq. of Aberdeen, at St. Leonard's on 4 August 1812. They soon departed from Portsmouth for the Cape of Good Hope on 4 September 1812. The Milnes stayed at the Cape of Good Hope with John Campbell for a few days, and they did not arrive in Macau until 4 July 1813. Milne, with his wife and infant child were expelled by the Roman Catholic priests there after three days, and he left for Guangzhou, where he was able to begin study of the Chinese language. His observation regarding the difficulty of an English-speaker acquiring the Chinese tongue has been frequently repeated:\n\n\"Learning the Chinese language requires bodies of iron, lungs of brass, heads of oak, hands of spring steel, eyes of eagles, hearts of apostles, memories of angels, and lives of Methuselah.\" \n\nAfter six months with Robert Morrison as his first and only help that had come to join the work from England, he took Morrison's advice to visit Java and the Chinese settlements in the Indonesian archipelago. Milne agreed and traveled south, distributing tracts and books, finally returning to Guangzhou on 5 September to spend the winter of 1813–1814 there.\n\nMilne spent most of his missionary career in the British Straits Settlements of Malacca, beginning in the Spring of 1815. He set up a printing press and school, continuing to preach the Gospel to the local Chinese.\n\nIn January 1816, Milne visited Penang, and established a printing press there also. Milne was also the first Principal of The Anglo Chinese College at Malacca. He collaborated more with Morrison to produce the second complete Chinese version of the Bible, translating the books of Deuteronomy through Job.\n\nLiang Fa, converted to Christianity in 1815 and baptized by Milne, became the first Chinese Protestant minister and evangelist. Liang Fa later became renowned as the author of the Christian literature that inspired Hong Xiuquan and the Taiping Rebellion.\n\nIn these years Milne published a translation of the Sacred Edict of the Kangxi Emperor. His 1819 tract \"The Two Friends\" became the most widely used Chinese Christian tract until the early twentieth century. Milne was remarkably prolific for one who came to literary work so late in life, and twenty-one Chinese works are attributed to him. Several were of substantial length; one was the \"Chinese Monthly Magazine\" (察世俗每月統記傳 Chashisu Meiyue Tongjizhuan), the first Chinese language magazine in the modern sense of the word; that ran from 1815 to 1822 and totaled several hundred pages. In addition, he produced two substantial books and a Malacca periodical in English.\n\nThe University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) on 26 November 1820.\nRachel Cowie Milne gave birth to six children for William, but two of them, David (\"d.\" 4 May 1816) and Sarah (\"d.\" 10 April 1817) died in infancy. Among the four surviving children, Rachel Amelia is the eldest, and the twin sons, Robert George and William Charles. Farquhar was born when Rachel Cowie Milne was suffering from a serious illness, and was baptized at Rachel's dying bed.\n\nRachel Cowie Milne died on 20 March 1819 at Klebang, Malacca, leaving her will that her Amelia might receive proper education. William Milne buried Rachel in Malacca. \n\nAfter William Milne's death in 1822, his four surviving children were sent back to England, to receive further education under the care of Rev. Andrew Reed (1787–1862). Both Robert George and William Charles Milne graduated from Homerton Academy and Marischal College of Aberdeen University. Later, William Charles followed his father's steps and became a missionary to China being sent by London Missionary Society, and a tutor to British translators in China. William Charles died in 1863 and was buried in a Russian cemetery at Beijing. Robert George Milne served as a Dissenting minister in Lancaster, and died in 1882. \n\n\n\n\n"}
