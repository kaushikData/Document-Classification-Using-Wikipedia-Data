It is the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to tree planting. The Foundation's stated corporate mission is \"to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees.\" The Foundation programs are supported by members, donors, and corporate sponsors that share the same vision of a healthier and greener world.\n\nIn 1872, J. Sterling Morton started what would become Arbor Day in Nebraska City, Nebraska. This \"holiday\" is meant to recognize and support the planting of trees. Morton and his wife Caroline challenged people around the country to plant trees. In 1872, on the first Arbor Day, approximately one million trees were planted in Nebraska alone. Sterling and Caroline Morton lived in Nebraska City on a 72-acre estate, which is now known as Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum.\n\nIn Nebraska City, Nebraska, the home of Arbor Day, the Arbor Day Foundation built the Lied Lodge and Conference Center, which houses a full service meeting center and 140 guest rooms\" for conservation-minded organizations, members, forestry professionals, or other individuals that value the environmental operating practices offered by the facility. The property is also home to Arbor Day Farm, a National Historic Landmark and an educational visitor attraction; Arbor Day Farm Tree Adventure, including the Lied Greenhouse, Woodland Pavilion, the Tree House Trail, Canopy Tree House, Nature Explore Classrooms, Exploratory Trail, Nature Explore Club Cabin, and the Tree Adventure Discovery Ride. In 2014, the Arbor Day Foundation took over management of Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.\n\nThe Tree City USA program, which is co-sponsored by the National Association of State Foresters and the USDA Forest Service, has grown to include more than 3,400 towns, cities, and military bases in all 50 states. This program nationally recognizes cities and towns for urban and community forestry and helps provide assistance and public attention to showcase the importance of urban forestry.\n\nThe foundation encourages communities across the nation to become Tree City USA by meeting four standards:\n\n\nThe million members of the Arbor Day Foundation share the same vision to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. The trees planted by the members at their homes, businesses, and ranches provide cleaner air and water, shade, increased stormwater management, energy savings, soil protection, and habitat for wildlife.\n\nMembers are invited to receive 10 free trees through the Trees for America program. Between six and seven million trees are sent to members each year that help improve their communities and environment.\n\nAnother aspect of the Trees for America program is the Community Tree Recovery program, which brings hope and healing to communities in need by providing trees to replant after natural disasters.\n\nThrough partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters, Foundation corporate sponsors and members have planted more than 45 million trees in America's National Forests to help restore vitality and life to the forest land after devastation to the forests caused by insects, disease, and wildfires. Forests provide more than beauty to the nation, they provide drinking water to 180 million people, stop erosion around streams and lakes, and assist rain and snowmelt to soak into the soil. Trees also help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and replacing it with oxygen. The replanted forests provide a home to wolves, bald eagles, grizzly bears, and other endangered species.\n\nAn example of a forest replanting is the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, the largest national forest in California with two million acres. The summer of 2008 marked the worst fire season in the history of the forest and burned thousands of acres. Through the Replanting Our National Forest program, the Arbor Day Foundation with their partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, has planted more than one million trees to bring life back to the forest and ensure that it continues to thrive.\n\nDaily interactions with the natural world is a big benefit for children. The Arbor Day Foundation's Nature Explore program allows children to make deeper connections with the natural world.\n\nThrough a collaboration with Dimensions Educational Research Foundation, the Arbor Day Foundation is taking on the challenge of teaching the importance of nature to children and exposing them to the outdoors through their Nature Explore Classrooms. These research-based opportunities for learning are taught to school administrators, landscape architects, and families and give educators an opportunity to build and certify a Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom using safe, durable, natural components. Outdoor classrooms allow children to learn and play outside while they experience the wonder of nature. There are art stations with pine cones and acorns, allowing children to create their own masterpieces. Logs allow a natural climb and crawl experience. Above-ground gardens allow the children to plant flowers and vegetables and watch them grow. In this nature-based environment, children are allowed to play together, pretending, creating, and learning to care for the space that was built just for them. These nature-rich environments help kids connect to nature, inspiring the next generation of tree planters.\n\n237 colleges and universities are recognized as Tree Campus USA's. Tree Campus USA recognition is obtained by having a program in place that manages the campus tree inventory along with tree care and maintenance. Managed trees provide beauty to the campus along with a place for students to study, relax, and socialize. Students that have an opportunity to connect with trees and the environment when they are young will carry this on through their lifetime.\n\nThe Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue program saves thousands of acres of tropical rain forest each year with contributions from our generous members and sponsors. This tropical land is crucial to our survival and is home to many of the rarest animals on earth and plants that hold medicinal value and cures. Working with eight different countries and 59 different projects, preservation, tree-planting, and recovery is under way with on-location partners.\n\nShade-grown Arbor Day Specialty Coffee is another part of the Rain Forest Rescue program. The rain forests are not only home to many animals, they are home to millions of people. Through the Arbor Day Specialty Coffee program, the Foundation helps these people and farmers save and preserve the rain forest using sustainable agroforestry that includes production of coffee beans. Farmers grow coffee plants in the rain forest under the trees, offering a superior coffee bean and saving the rain forest from unwanted destruction. The Foundation offers education and economic incentives for rain forest restoration and preservation.\n\nLand conservation practices help conserve soil, water, wildlife, and the atmosphere. Through the Conservation Trees program, the Foundation works with ranchers, farmers, and landowners through communication and education encouraging environmental stewardship.\n\nTrees planted for conservation are “working trees.” They provide many benefits in communities and rural areas. Other than reducing soil erosion, cleaning waterways and air, trees cut energy costs and sequester carbon dioxide. They provide beauty to our land all the while providing food for wildlife and people.\n\nStrategically planting trees in a homeowner's yard lowers utility bills, conserves energy, and lowers peak electricity demand. The Foundation's Energy-Saving Trees program works with utility partners to plant trees in residential areas. An on-line tools allows the homeowner to choose a tree for their yard, plot the tree in their yard using satellite imagery to calculate the energy savings over time. This unique program allows Foundation partners and members to save energy through tree planting.\n\n"}

{"id": "53321604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53321604", "title": "Creative education", "text": "Creative education\n\nCreative education is when students are able to use imagination and critical thinking to create new and meaningful forms of ideas where they can take risks, be independent and flexible. Instead of being taught to reiterate what was learned, students learn to develop their ability to find various solutions to a problem. Coming up with various out-of-the box solutions is known as divergent thinking and there is no one way of cultivating this skill - largely due to the newness of the concept and the limited scientific information on creativity.\n\nThe increasing interest in creative education is due to the need for more critical thinkers in business science, politics and every subject to be able to solve complex problems. As the world becomes more interconnected, it is no longer possible to make linear decisions in business and in politics. Current leaders are looking for people who can bring about new ideas to solve pressing issues. For instance, in a 2010 IBM study, Chief Executive Officers from more than 60 countries and 33 different industries worldwide were surveyed on creativity. Those 1,500 CEOs believe that in order for the industries to keep growing in this increasingly complex world, creative strategies must be implemented in education so that these graduating students and future employees are better prepared for massive shifts in industries once they go to workplace. This soft skill of creativity has been identified as a competency for a successful enterprise in the future. \n\nWhen students have more say in their education, they become more engaged which helps facilitate learning. Plus, the goal of creative education is to challenge each student and encourage originality. Instead of \"standardizing\" how students approach a problem, different responses would be encouraged. This, in turn, allows more than one type of learner to exist within a classroom.\n\nA growing number of colleges and universities are realizing the needs for more creative students in every field of education. Therefore, they are opening centers, such as Stanford University’s d.school, Harvard University's i-lab, Oklahoma State University’s Institute for Creativity and Innovation and Ball State University's Center for Creative Inquiry, to increase divergent thinking. Those centers are teaching students creative problem solving and design thinking. Creativity is a set of teachable skills and many universities are requiring students to take creativity classes as part of their undergraduate study. \n\nResearch has found the following benefits for students using creativity in education:\n\n\nThese are few ways in which creativity in classroom can be increased: \n\nEarly research viewed creativity as an intellectual ability possessed by few people. Creativity has been linked to intelligence. However, today creativity is viewed as a set of teachable skills not linked to intelligence. Some of the research that was done in early 2000, indicated that as people grow older, their creativity dampens. According to the Robinson Report, by the age of 5, a child’s potential for creativity is 98%; by the age of 10, this percentage drops to 30%; at age of 15 it is 12%; and by the time we adults, our creativity is no more than 2%. \n\nAfter two decades, employers and universities realized the need to foster creativity in students and eventually in the workforce. \n\nIn Csikszentmihalyi's five-step process to elicit creative thinking, incubation is a necessary step. Meaning, the use of unconscious thought is needed to solve complex problems. A problem such as 2+2 is a linear thought process that can performed in the consciousness. Trying to solve the equation for gravity requires more complex connections in the brain which has been seen to require the unconscious thought process. In application to education, this may include requiring more recess time to facilitate the creative thought process. However, there is limited research on how exactly the creative thought process works and how it can be elicited.\n\nIn relevance to education, there is research that emphasizes that students \"and\" teachers need more freedom to allow a more creative education process to take place. Students who can participate in their education show more creativity but for this type of education to work, teachers must also have more control over the curriculum. This may look like the teacher determining the curriculum for the \"entire\" year or determining how much time each students needs to spend on each subject. Instead of the decision making starting from the top-down (state to schools), the decision making starts from the ground-up (teacher to schools). This isn't suggesting there shouldn't be \"some\" national guideline but the idea is to place more trust in the teachers as they are on-the-grounds, engaging with each student.\n\nThe CPS method is a more explicit form of cultivating creativity and uses divergent and convergent thinking skills. Students are asked to brainstorm, plan ahead, and find solutions. Instead of changing an entire curriculum to be creative focused, this method is a more obvious way to teach students how to critically approach assignments.\n\nThe Torrance Incubation Model (TIM), developed by Paul E. Torrance is made up of three stages: 1) Heighten Anticipation 2) Deepen Expectations 3) Extend the Learning. This model was created to allow instructors to integrate creativity into their lessons without affecting the subject material. Instead of having to put aside time to teach creativity, teachers can use the TIM model to address the subject and creativity at the same time. The teaching model also aspiries to help teachers teach better and to increase interest in students.\n\nCreative education is sometimes called design education but that may be confused with education pertaining to the design industry (i.e. architecture, graphic design, interior design, etc.).\n\nDesign thinking also explains the process of creatively solving problems in all faucets of life. Though this is very similar, creative education focuses on how classes are taught to oppress or encourage creativity.\n\nIn OECD's PISA global education survey, Singapore was named for having the best education system in 2015. Singapore not only uses technology heavily in their classrooms, but there is emphasis on the idea that the teacher is a facilitator of finding information not the source of information. The argument is that kids are exposed to engaging screens outside of school so expecting them to not use their phones in school makes school boring. By using technology in the classroom, the can use the interest in technology as leverage to maintain student engagement. The technology skills are also more relevant to today's time. Additionally, teachers are encouraged to continually learn and change their teaching strategy by speaking with other instructors and allowing others to weigh-in on their classes - so the teaching method is constantly improving.\n\nFinland has also been ranked as hosting one of the top education systems in the world. Not only does the country strive to have accessible education, but teachers usually stay with the same students over several years. The curriculum in Finland starts from the bottom-up so teachers have more control to change the design of the curriculum. This is partly due to the shift in how tests are viewed. Tests are still used as a means of assessing progress but there is no national testing.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 80's the UK's primary schools were recognized as innovative and surrounding around the child as recorded in the Plowden Report. A noteworthy school in the UK is A.S.'s Summerhill School which is a democratic school where parents, teachers, and students have a say in the education and where the education is designed around the students opposed to kids adapting to a standard school system.\n\nCompared to the European Union, the UK, especially Northern Ireland, have a more frequent usage of creativity across multiple school subjects.\n\nThe education system in the United States has been seen as an inhibitor of creativity. The extensive state-wide tests that are required have push educators to follow strict curriculum so there is less freedom among teachers. The tests also create a cyclical pattern in under-performing, poor schools - low performance leads to less funding. Essentially, money buys the quality of education in the United States.\n\nThe Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) in Australia has also begun to integrate more creativity within its education model in the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians.\n\nKen Robinson is an academic specializing in the need for creativity in education. He works with governments and education programs to work on creating more innovative education systems. He has a Tedtalk, \"Do schools kill creativity?\" that gained world recognition.\n\n"}

Although University of Lethbridge remains the main host and administrative home, the project now has a technical infrastructure which uses donated services from others including the University of Kentucky. The project grew out of a recognised need for best-practice advice on a disciplinary level in the creation of digital medieval resources. Although much of the advice and experience of those who would call themselves digital medievalists are applicable to other areas of the digital humanities and specifically academic research projects in this area, around the time of its creation an increasing need for discipline-based communities of this nature was beginning to be recognised. Partly in response to the overwhelming reception the creation of Digital Medievalist received, the Digital Classicist project was set up shortly after.\n\nDigital Medievalist as an organization is overseen by the volunteer efforts of a fully elected international executive board. Its bylaws state that its 8-member board are elected by the membership for overlapping two-year terms (thus 4 positions come up for election each year), and that the board chooses a director from amongst its members. Eligibility for election to the executive board is simply demonstrable participation in digital medieval activities or board-sanctioned equivalancies. These bylaws also state its commitment to be a non-profit organization, and its general purposes and objectives.\n\nMembership in Digital Medievalist is free and open to all. The sole criterion for membership is subscription to its free online discussion list 'dm-l'. Membership conveys the right to vote in Digital Medievalist elections, and if they have contributed in some meaningful manner, eligibility to run for election to the Digital Medievalist executive board.\n\nDigital Medievalist sees it as its mission to provide a framework to enable members of its community to share information. These activities include an electronic mailing list, the participation in and organisation of conference sessions or other events, and a website containing an open-access academic journal of record, a wiki/FAQ, and a facility to post news releases.\n\nDigital Medievalist runs an electronic mailing list and discussion forum (dm-l) where members of the community ask for advice, share problems, and discuss issues that affect them. The discussion list currently has around 540 members, many of whom are drawn from widely across the Humanities Computing field. The list traffic is low, with occasional bursts of interest in a particular issue, but is primarily used for announcements of interest to digital medievalists.\n\nDigital Medievalist runs a free peer-reviewed open-access online journal, also called 'Digital Medievalist', which acts as a journal of record for the digital medieval studies field. In many ways this is seen as the most significant output of Digital Medievalist and is where the majority of volunteer effort is directed. The journal has an entry in the Directory of Open Access Journals listed under the fields of both computer science and history. The Digital Medievalist ISSN number is 17150736, and University of Lethbridge is listed as the official publisher. In May 2017, the journal moved from its previous domain at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/ to the Open Library of Humanities platform, at http://journal.digitalmedievalist.org. The journal appears to release about one issue every year since 2005. It has experimented with different formats of releases, for example issue 3 is a rolling-release that previously submitted articles are being added to over time, while issue 4 was a thematic issue of articles arising out of the work of a cognate organization Digital Classicist in memory of a well-known academic in the field of digital humanities, Ross Scaife. In addition to experimenting with different models of publication, the project has taken an innovative stance on the problems of academic acceptance of research articles published online. This the use of so-called 'Ostentatious Peer Review', that is, the accepting editor and the recommending reader who reviewed the article have their name listed as doing so. The theory is that both the editors and reviewers do a better job (since their name is in evidence for everyone to see) and also by attracting big names in the medieval studies and/or humanities computing community, the online publication of the article may be taken more seriously by academic hiring and tenure committees. While there is informal hearsay evidence that this might be beneficial, and certainly leads to a higher editorial standard than some online journals, there is no hard evidence (yet) that this affects hiring committees.\n\nDigital Medievalist as an umbrella group for a community interested in digital methodologies in medieval studies has organized conference sessions many years at the most prestigious academic Medieval studies conferences in existence. For example, the International Congress on Medieval Studies organized by Western Michigan University and the International Medieval Congress organized by the University of Leeds amongst other conferences and events.\n\n\n"}

He transferred to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and then to Brigham Young University where he earned his bachelor's degree in English in 1960. At BYU Hall started what would become lifelong friendships with Alfred L. Bush and David Stires. The three enthusiastic writers lived and breathed literature and other creative arts. Bush became the Curator of Western Americana at the Firestone Library, Princeton University, and Stires became a publishing executive. Highlights of Hall's undergraduate years included study of the creative process with Brewster Ghiselin, editor of the landmark book \"The Creative Process\". Between his junior and senior years at BYU, Hall met and married Claire Nicholson, of Boise, Idaho. The two remained married for ten years.\nAfter earning his undergraduate degree at BYU, Hall was accepted into the prestigious Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa, Iowa City. For three years he worked as special assistant to Paul Engle, director of the program. While at the Writer's Workshop Hall befriended, among others, Mark Strand, Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Robert Bly, and Adrian Mitchell. Hall wrote and published extensively while at Iowa.\n\nHall's master of fine arts degree in Creative Writing from the University of Iowa's Writer's Workshop in 1963 led to a position at the University of Portland teaching Creative Writing and Literature. Hall and Claire moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1964. During his time at the University of Portland, Hall brought many well-known poets to the school for readings, such as Allen Ginsberg, W. H. Auden, Anaïs Nin, Gary Snyder, Robert Duncan, William Stafford, and Robert Bly. Hall also became active in an organization called American Writers Against the Vietnam War. At this time a friend lent Hall a camera and he taught himself photography, seriously studying photographic technique and style. He photographed poets and the group of artists he befriended in Portland, including Lee Kelly, Duane Zaloudek, Carl Morris, Hilda Morris, Doug Lynch, among others.\n\nHall's method of teaching creative writing included taking his students on car trips, overseeing student film productions, and having students grade themselves. His increasing interest in photography led to freelance photographic work. He photographed Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison of the Doors for Sunn Music, makers of amplifiers. He received various other commercial and magazine photographic assignments. Hall realized he could dedicate himself to his writing and photography and left the world of academia.\n\nIn 1967 Hall traveled throughout England, France, Italy, Spain, Morocco, and Portugal with his cameras. He shot his first images in the Dark Landscapes series. In 1968 Hall moved from Portland to London and continued work in advertising and on his series of artist and writer portraits and his art photography. He began formulating the idea of Passing, which dominated most of the philosophy behind his personal work.\n\nHall and his wife moved from London to New York City in 1968. He continued to photograph rock and roll stars, which resulted in the publication of \"Rock: A World Bold as Love\", released later in paperback as \"The Superstars: In Their Own Words\". In New York, Hall continued writing. He published his first novel, \"On the Way to the Sky\", in 1972. This book fictionalized Hall's childhood years in Vernal, Utah, and his renegade Hall relatives. Hall's time spent in the world of rock and roll led to his novel \"Rock and Roll Retreat Blues\", published in 1974.\n\nWhile driving across the country with his college friend Alfred Bush in 1969 to photograph American Indians, returning to the West of his youth, Hall shot his first Passing series. In 1971 he developed the first negatives for Passing II. The idea of time and the photograph continued to deepen and became the guiding influence behind his total photographic output.\n\nHall's marriage to Claire dissolved in 1970. He returned briefly to Portland, Oregon, and worked doing commercial photography jobs and writing. He met his future second wife, Dawn Claire Davidson, a fashion coordinator, in May 1971. The following December the two moved to New York and set up residence and studio in a loft on 21st Street and 7th Avenue. As they were moving in, comedian and filmmaker Christopher Guest was moving out. Of note, when Hall and Dawn moved out of the loft in 1976, the poet Mark Strand, Hall's friend, moved in.\n\nIn the 1970s Hall lived in New York but spent much time traveling. His work included writing a book about rodeo titled \"Let Er Buck\"; writing and codirecting a feature documentary film about rodeo titled \"The Great American Cowboy\", which won an Academy Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary; and publishing a photography book titled \"Rodeo\", which was followed in the early 1980s by another book about cowboys, this one about ranch cowboys, titled \"Working Cowboys\". Mark Strand writes, \"These cowboys, as opposed to urban cowboys, drugstore cowboys, rodeo cowboy, or movie cowboys, stay on horseback all day long working cattle. And when they stand in front of the camera—in Hall's best photos, they are standing, looking straight into the camera lens—their detached way of life shows.\" The 1970s also saw the publication of Hall's second novel, \"Rock and Roll Retreat Blues\". Significantly, in 1974, Hall exhibited his photographs for the first time, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. The exhibition and accompanying catalog, \"Photography in America\", is where the public first viewed the now iconic photograph \"Mesquite, Texas\".\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1970s and the early 1980s, Hall worked on books collaboratively for the first time in his career. In 1975 Hall's literary agent, Bob Dattila, asked him if he would be interested in working on a project with the bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Hall and Schwarzenegger published two books, \"Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder\" and \"Arnold's Bodyshaping for Women\". \"Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder\" was on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list for eleven weeks in 1978. In 2002, \"Sports Illustrated\" included the Hall/Schwarzenegger collaboration as number 71 on their \"Top 100 Sports Books of All Time\". During the writing and photographing of \"Bodyshaping for Women\", Hall became acquainted with the female bodybuilder Lisa Lyon; the friendship led to the publication of their \"Lisa Lyon's BodyMagic\". \"The Incredible Lou Ferrigno\", with bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno, rounded out Hall's collaborative publishing ventures with bodybuilders.\n\nIn 1977 Hall and his partner Dawn moved from New York to the small village of Alcalde, New Mexico. After living together for more than six years, they were married in Santa Fe on July 23, 1977. In 1980 their son Devon Douglas was born.\nHall traveled throughout the Southwest and along the Mexico-U.S. border in the 1980s gathering material for two photographic books. \"The Border: Life on the Line\" introduced Hall to the varied types of people who live and work on both sides of the border. The book includes many color photographs. \"In an ideal marriage of uncompromising photography and compelling prose, Hall transports us to 2,000 miles of borderland, revealing it in all its contradictory dimensions.\" \"Frontier Spirit: Early Churches of the Southwest\" also includes many color images. \"Photographer-author Douglas Kent Hall takes us to the most celebrated churches as well as to the most obscure, including hauntingly evocative ruins in remote parts of New Mexico.\" Known primarily for his black-and-white work, Hall's two books of color photographs highlight the diversity of his oeuvre.\n\nMost well known for his silver prints, in 1992 Hall began printing with platinum. His classic western images of cowboys and Matachines make up the suite of prints. Also in the early 1990s, Hall traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia, to document the Hermitage Museum's art school for children. He photographed in the students' homes and at the museum. During this period Hall also traveled to Minas Gerais, Brazil, to document the region's gold and gemstone miners.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Hall began producing one-of-a-kind photographic artworks. His Zen Ghost Horses series are images of Peruvian Paso and Clydesdale horses exposed onto handmade paper that was brushed with emulsion. Hall embellished the works with gold leaf, Chinese and Japanese calligraphy, and acrylics. Taking color images shot along the Mexico-U.S. border, Hall created a suite of artes de caja (art boxes). These pieces incorporate color photograph, poems, milagros, objects picked up while traveling the border, and pages from Mexican graphic novelettes into and on hand-painted wooden wine boxes. The Albuquerque Museum showed fifteen of the border boxes for four months as part of a tribute exhibition for Hall in the summer of 2008.\n\nThe Halls sold their Alcalde home and studio in 2001 and moved to Albuquerque, where they built a studio and wet and dry darkrooms onto an existing round house. Hall's New Mexico cohort included artists Larry Bell, Terry Allen, Bruce Nauman, Susan Rothenberg, Tom Palmore, Ken Price, Bill Barrett, Paul Pletka, Charles Strong, Ron Cooper, Gus Foster, and others.\nAfter being awarded the New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 2005, Hall's \"In New Mexico Light\", a compilation of his most enduring, compelling images taken over a forty-year time span, was published by the Museum of New Mexico Press.\n\nWriter and photographer Hall was not only a novelist, photographer, writer of nonfiction, and film script author, he was also a poet. In 2002 his first collection of poems was published in \"Visionary\". The book also contains an extended automemoir/poem.\n\nHall began studying and practicing Kaju Kenpo karate in Santa Fe in 1986, receiving his Nidan black belt in 1998. He taught karate in Española, New Mexico until 2002. While continuing to practice karate, Hall also incorporated Tai Chi into his daily spiritual practice. When photographer Joyce Tenneson selected Hall in 2004 for inclusion in her book \"Amazing Men\", she photographed him working with martial arts weapons.\n\nHall died suddenly, unexpectedly, at his home in Albuquerque on March 30, 2008; the cause of death was described as \"a cardiac incident.\" He was survived by his wife, Dawn, and son, Devon Hall, a composer and pianist. In a 2011 review of an exhibition of Hall's platinum photographic prints, art critic Wesley Pulkka wrote, \"He died suddenly . . . like a perfectly tuned race car with a hidden flaw whose engine implodes two-thirds down the straightaway while well in the lead.\"\n\nHall's first writing was fiction. His first novel, \"On the Way to the Sky\", is set in Utah and explores themes that surface frequently in his work: small-town life, surviving a broken home, Mormonism, hunting and fishing, music, and rodeo. Writer Mag Dimond asked Hall in 1997 which of his books were his favorite and why. \"His first choice was \"On the Way to the Sky\", the book he wrote when he was about twenty-one, a steely, sweet autobiographical novel he didn't publish until almost six years later. About this book he simply says, 'I was able to define my past, get it behind me where it belongs.' . . . This stunning little novel is rich in characters suggested by real people . . . written in startlingly original language.\" The \"New York Times Book Review\" noted, \"Mr. Hall invents distinctive family backgrounds for his three heroes and arranges them into an impressionistic chronicle.\" In \"Rock and Roll Retreat Blues\", his second novel, the humor is sardonic; it is a commentary on the world of rock and roll and the culture it creates and drives. According to a \"Publisher's Weekly\" review, \"The book is chock-full of familiar contemporary figures—Hell's Angels, revolutionaries, people spaced out on religion or brown rice or drugs, even such exotics as the \"plaster casters.\" Yet Hall is fresh and funny, and he makes Artie's [the protagonist's] search for his own psyche very real and very much a part of our times. (Excerpts ran in \"Penthouse\").\" The third novel, \"The Master of Oakwindsor\", set in 1908 England, explores the clash between rural England and a new and darker industrial Britain and between two families. \"Bestseller\" magazine writes, \"After three successful novels and an Academy Award–winning screenplay, it is no surprise that Hall's novel brings a fresh outlook to the overworked genre of historical romance. \"The Master of Oakwindsor\" is a diverse and brilliantly colored portrait of England and Europe at the turn of the century, bristling with event and detail.\"\n\nHall's numerous books of nonfiction, which include his photographs, treat various subjects, including rock and roll, rodeo, cowboy life, bodybuilding, prison, the historic churches of the Southwest, and the border between the United States and Mexico. \"\"The Border\", about desperate lives lived on both sides of the United States–Mexico border, is at once a compelling piece of work, a lucid and personal rendering of Hall's own border experiences both in words and 'pictures.'\" \"Let 'Er Buck\" is \"a really deep look at rodeo and some rodeo people. Most of us have seen what goes on in the arena; this book mostly deals with the rest of it. . . . What [Hall] has said with his typewriter and his camera is bound to be controversial.\" About Hall's book \"In New Mexico Light\", Bill Richardson, governor of New Mexico, wrote: \"the thoughtful text in this book [is] testimony to the work of an artist who has dedicated his life to observing the rich cultural texture of New Mexico.\" In \"New Mexico Magazine\", Jon Bowman writes, \"Hall accompanies the images [in \"In New Mexico Light\"] with some of the most lucid, engaging essays on the photographic process you'll ever read. He's a straight-shooter all the way. There's no mention of f-stops or arcane technical knowledge, but rather some fine storytelling, mixing in roughly equal doses of the sacred and the profane.\"\n\nMany of Hall's images have become known as icons of Americana, such as Mesquite, Texas 1973, and Jim Morrison, Portland. Princeton University curator Alfred L. Bush writes: \"Unlike the majority of the photographic explorers, who are continually clicking away at the American West, Douglas Hall's camera is firmly rooted in the region's very center.\" Hall's photographs are mainly of people; the protagonist in the Sam Shepard story \"San Juan Bautista\" says: \"I'm more into faces—people; Robert Frank, Douglas Kent Hall, guys like that.\" Hall finds his subjects worldwide, from New York to the Southwest, from Russia to Japan, Brazil to Mexico, as well as in places like Morocco and the Outer Hebrides Islands. On the occasion of the exhibition in Santa Fe of \"Os Brasileiros (The Brazilians)\", David Bell notes, \"Hall, who has recently made several trips to Brazil and the Amazon, takes as his subjects not only the miners who were his first objective but families, farmers . . . and students, too. The result is a composite portrait of a people who in most cases appear to give themselves with equal abandon to the camera and to life.\" He continued to work in film and branched into digital imagery, shooting both color and black-and-white. Hall crossed the digital photography boundary by moving into fine art color photographs printed on handmade watercolor paper. Mark Strand noted in Vogue Magazine, \"There is nothing provisional about Hall's enterprise; it is both broad and, in individual photographs, scrupulously resolved. His pictures have an edge, a magical certainty about them that not only justifies but also honors their subjects, no matter how odd or how exploited.\" Writing about Hall's 2007 book \"In New Mexico Light,\" Dave Gagon notes, \"A filmmaker and poet, as well as a photographer, Hall has photographed and written about New Mexico's unique mix of places and people, a broad representation including ancient sites and Spanish churches, Indian ceremonial dances, portraits of artists and writers, viejos and vagabonds. He invigorates his 182 black and white photographs with descriptive prose—something most visual artists have difficulty achieving.\" In his Foreword to \"In New Mexico Light\" actor/playwright Sam Shepard writes, \"The photographs in this book are naked impressions of the mind and spirit just waiting for somebody as lucky and gifted as Douglas Kent Hall to hunt them down and seize them with a little black box.\" When discussing the complex relationship of a photograph to history, Hall noted to the author of \"Photography: New Mexico\", Kristin Barendsen, \"that a photograph imparts the illusion of permanence, when in fact the scene depicted no longer exists. What's more, he said, the photograph does not represent exactly what its maker saw. It takes on a life of its own, and because each viewer experiences it differently, the image reflects an essence of the viewer. 'That's not my photograph,' he said, pointing to his most famous image, \"Mesquite, TX\", hanging in his studio. 'It belongs to the viewer.'\"\n\nHall started out with a 35mm camera, added a 2 square format camera, and kept working with those two formats using Nikons, Leica Cameras, and Hasselblads. In the mid-1990s he added digital cameras to his arsenal. In a Rangefinder magazine article, Hall said to author/photographer Paul Slaughter: \"I am using a Nikon D70s digital SLR and I always carry a Nikon point-and-shoot that fits into my pocket. It does interesting things to the color (which I like). I also use an Olympus C-5050 digital camera that has a wonderful f/1.8 lens. My new series, \"Travel\", is all digital color and I am fascinated by the images because they are different from anything I've done before. The creative part is the same, the tools are the tools—the cameras.\" Hall had five external hard drives full of images and did his best to keep them organized. He said to Slaughter, \"I am a bit haphazard in my approach to work. I am more intuitive than anything else. That is part of my imagery evolvement.\" Hall used the Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom software programs for after-capture processing and did his own printing, both digital and traditional. He had four Epson inkjet printers. For digital printing he favored watercolor papers as they render a softer image. He told Slaughter: \"I am often upset that I can no longer readily find traditional printing supplies. . . . That concerns me more than thinking about where photography is going. I look at the photographs being done and feel that the new digital work is less convincing than film work. But I feel certain that photographers such as Edward Weston would have brought a special look to digital. I hope I am doing the same. In the end, with either digital or film, I choose what pleases my eye. I think the world of professional photography is much like it has always been, full of challenge.\"\n\nDouglas Kent Hall's papers are held at Princeton University Library, Rare Books and Special Collections.

{"id": "25572436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25572436", "title": "Evidence-based education", "text": "Evidence-based education\n\nEvidence-based education is an approach to all aspects of education—from policy-making to classroom practice—where that is based on randomized trials, as with the testing of new drugs in evidence-based medicine. When several of these studies are compared, and their conclusions combined, we get a meta-study or meta-analysis. This is significantly more reliable than the results of individual studies due to the difficulty in controlling variables and individual bias.. \"Evidence-based teaching\" refers to the teaching aspects.\n\nThere are numerous researchers and institutions that produce analysis of the existing evidence, below are some.\n\n\"What Works Clearinghouse\" evaluates educational programs by evidence, rates the quality and quantity of the evidence and estimates the effectiveness. It's operated by the federal National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). The 10 interventions below are currently the interventions with both the highest effectiveness rating of strong evidence of a positive effect with no overriding contrary evidence.\n\nTwo sources of meta-analyses in education include: \"Visible Learning\" from a team in New Zealand under John Hattie and \"Classroom Instruction that Works\" from a Colorado, USA team under Robert Marzano.\n\nAccording to the Marzano study, there are ten classroom methods which have been shown to work significantly better than many others: \n\nAlthough Hattie's work does not exactly mirror this list, the main reason is that the New Zealand study looks at everything related to education, including family effects and changes to the curriculum, while the Colorado study looked only at classroom methods. There are, however, no incompatibilities and most of Marzano's top-ten appear high on Hattie's list.\n\nHattie points out that there is no shortage of effective methods - almost anything you try in education seems to have a small beneficial effect. He therefore uses a scale of \"effect size\" which measures by how much the learning is improved. As an effect-size of 0.4 is the average for all interventions (and also the effect of a hard working, well organised and enthusiastic teacher), he suggests that methods with an effect size above 0.4 should be used as a priority. This ties with Marzano, whose list starts at an effect size of 0.59 for Advance Organisers and increases up the list.\n\nThe Coalition For Evidence-Based Policy, which is a non-partisan, non-profit organization advocating the use of well conducted randomized controlled trials in policy, has recognized three educational programs as \"Top Tier\". Programs classified as \"Top Tier\" must have been proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials that were well designed and implemented.\n\nFor students' results to reflect these high effect-sizes, teachers need to develop the skills of their use. According to several studies, the time taken to do this lies somewhere between the learning of new facts and the development of a musical or sporting skill. While facts can be learned with a few repetitions, skills may need several hundred hours to develop. The evidence is that teachers start to become skilled with a particular method after about 10 repetitions with improvement plateauing after 6 months to 2 years of use.\nContinuing professional development (CPD) needs to reflect these findings. Teaching staff need the opportunity to learn about and then practice these skills. The role of CPD managers is to ensure that the time is available and the process takes place, not to instruct the teachers to follow directions.\nWhere staff self-select their training either from external providers or from a range of sessions on a training day, they do not have the chance to develop their skills. Training, development and discussion of a smaller list of high-effect-size methods will be more effective. This process is sometimes referred to as \"supported experimentation\" or peer mentoring.\n\nTeachers have more effect on the outcomes for their students than anyone else. The difference in outcomes for 2 teachers in the same college is significantly greater than the average of teachers in a 'good' rather than a 'weak' school. The main reason why some schools do better is that they have a higher percentage of teachers who use high effect-size methods.\nWhile individual teachers can improve their students' results using these methods in isolation, it is far more effective if they are adopted department or college-wide so that the discussions, observations and sharing-of-practice can take place easily.\n\n"}

It is the only Singaporean startup, and one of three others in Asia to receive this honour. It has been featured on print media such as The Straits Times and ChannelNewsAsia and blogs such as SG Entrepreneurs, E27 and Young Upstarts.\n\nIn the FameLeague, the player and the members of his/her social network were listed as stocks that could be purchased by others as shares. Shares on popular media such as music, movies and celebrities could also be traded. Like the actual stock exchange, the market price of a stock was determined by the number of shares traded for that stock. On top of that, prediction stock – or stock that specifies a possible outcome to an ongoing or future event – could also be traded, and their market prices depended on the expected outcome. The objective of the game was to earn as much Silver - the main currency in FameLeague - as possible, by making accurate forecasts while purchasing prediction stocks, and through ability to anticipate which stocks would become more popular on FameLeague when purchasing stock on friends, celebrities or media. \n\nIn May 2010, the management made a strategic decision to segment the broad-based game into individual products such as FameMark, a fantasy game for trading shares of people with a dating angle, and PremierX, a fantasy stock exchange for English Premier League. FameLeague was then developed into a generic technology engine that drives these segmented products upon customization. These three products (FameLeague, FameMark, PremierX) have been stalled in developments.\n\nIn February 2012, the company has become a full-fledged cloud-based gamification platform, initially a side project codenamed 'GameMaki' and later branded as Gametize. Along with this, the company also rebranded from 'Socialico' to 'Gametize'. Today, Gametize is a gamification company that uses game thinking and game psychology to help brands and organizations engage their target audience and motivate for target behaviours, such as in marketing, learning, and training. It engages and motivates behaviors with challenges such as quizzes, photo, QR code challenges. Users can earn rewards, compete, and socialize through a mobile/web experience that can be white-labeled and published in 5 minutes. The technology is used by major brands and enterprises such as Shell, DBS, Samsung, and P&G. It has more than 100,000 users, with more than 10 million challenge completions. Gametize was selected as Singapore's 20 hottest startups by \"Singapore Business Review\" magazine in 2015.\n\n\n"}

He was a long-time resident of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nMeyer was born near Hamelin, Germany, on November 6, 1872 into a family whose occupations were dominated by furniture craftsmen and weavers. He apprenticed as a cabinetmaker before he immigrated in 1888 to Fresno, California, where he worked in a large commercial nursery. In about 1890, he enrolled at the Cincinnati Technical School and two years later transferred to the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art. On November 7, 1893 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States of America. In the spring of 1895 he traveled to Germany, completed the program at the Royal Academy of Berlin for Fine Arts and Mechanical Sciences (aka Prussian Academy of Arts), and returned to the Pennsylvania Museum School, where he was awarded a master's degree.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1902 Meyer held the post of Supervisor of Art for the public schools in Stockton, California. In 1900 he hired as assistant art supervisor William S. Rice, whom he had met in Pennsylvania; Rice was promoted to Meyer's job in 1902. In Stockton Meyer met and married in June 1902 the Boston-born Laetitia Summerville. The couple relocated that fall to Berkeley, California, where he was hired as an “Instructor of Descriptive Geometry” (i.e. mechanical drawing) at the University of California. A year later was appointed Professor of Applied Arts and head of the Department of Industrial Design at San Francisco's Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, which was administered by U.C. Berkeley. In addition, he opened the Craftsman's Shop in San Francisco and designed custom furniture for prestigious clients, including the: Phoebe Hearst estate at Wyntoon (in association with Bernard Maybeck), California Building at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Faculty Club at U.C. Berkeley, and Sequoia Club in San Francisco. In October 1905 he was elected president of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts and his wife became its treasurer; they held both positions for two years. After the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fine in April 1906, which destroyed the Mark Hopkins Institute, he briefly traveled to Europe.\nMeyer expressed his dream of a school that would fuse the practical and ideal goals of craftsmen, designers, and artists, integrated into both theory and practice. Meyer founded the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts in June 1907 with its first location in the Studio Building, one block from the U.C. Berkeley campus. He had just $45.00 in cash, access to three classrooms and 43 students. The following year his school was renamed the California School of Arts and Crafts (CSAC) and briefly relocated to the space over a billiard parlor. In 1910, to accommodate the ever-expanding student body, the CSCA took over the campus of Berkley's old Commercial High School, where they remained until their move in 1923-24 to a larger facility in Oakland on Broadway Avenue. The school was renamed the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) in 1936 and opened a second campus in San Francisco in 1996. The school's name was changed for a fourth time in 2003 to the California College of the Arts (CCA). The school developed an international reputation because of Meyer's high standards and the renowned faculty that he hired, including Xavier Martinez, William S. Rice, Perham Wilhelm Nahl, Beniamino Bufano, Isabelle Percy-West, and Hamilton A. Wolf. Meyer became a popular figure though his many public lectures and sponsorship of exhibitions and charities. In 1940 he described himself in \"Who’s Who in America\" as a “Progressive Republican . . . and Protestant . . . who specializes in architectural designing, interior decorating and landscape gardening.” Meyer remained the CCAC's first president until his retirement in 1944. Frederick Meyer died at the age of 88 on January 6, 1961 in Oakland.\n"}

Its main aim is to give students in the fields of finance, economics, management and engineering, a path to enter the professional world of finance by providing them with lectures, workshops, competitions and connecting them through a global network.\n\nThe IFSA Network was founded in 2014 in Rotterdam, at the Rotterdam School of Management. Its first focus was to regroup people studying Finance, and connect them both between themselves and established financial actors. It quickly spread across Europe and Asia, before opening chapters in South Africa and the Americas.\n\nThe IFSA Network is composed of different chapters throughout the world. The concept is to have semi-independent units, each composed of their own board & active members and to create synergy between these in order to provide the best opportunities to their members. The objective of the association is to build a comprehensive network that connects finance students across the globe and enable them to interact and communicate with each other.\n\nEach chapter has a board, composed of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasure and General Secretary. This board manages day to day operations locally and supervises its regional activities. Chapters also typically have departments (Finance, Marketing, Events), with a department head managing the analysts.\nChairmen also regularly connect to establish international strategies and overview national operations.\n\nAs of 2017, The IFSA Network has the following chapters:\n\nRotterdam School of Management\n\nOxford University\n\nCambridge University\n\nUniversity College London\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nWarwick University\n\nImperial College, London\n\nEcole Polytechnique\n\nHEC Paris\n\nESSEC\n\nEcole Centrale Paris\n\nSupelec University\n\nENSAE\n\nSciences Po University\n\nEcole des Ponts\n\nEcole des Mines\n\nDauphine University\n\nTelecom University\n\nESCP Europe.\n\nUniversity of Geneva\n\nUniversity of Sankt-Gallen\n\nUniversity of Pavia\n\nUniversità Commerciale Luigi Bocconi\n\nNew Economic School\n\nTechnical University\n\nLudwig Maximilian University\n\nGoethe University\n\nHarvard University\n\nColumbia University\n\nFederal University of Rio de Janeiro\n\nUniversity of Cape Town\n\nKyoto University\n\nChinese University of Hong-Kong\n\nShaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies\n\nThe IFSA Trader’s Cup is the world’s largest student run trading challenge . All people studying in a recognised university are free to participate. The competition relies on securities trading, and aims to give students an opportunity to distinguish themselves from the competition. The competition is held once per academic year, starting in spring of 2016. For the second edition of the competition, students from more than 35 universities, located in 28 countries on 6 continents competed.\n\nThe Global Case Competition at Harvard is the world’s most prestigious case competition organized by students. Its goal is to regroup the best students in finance & economics throughout the world for the length of a few days, in order to test their knowledge and skills and offer them a fantastic opportunity to meet like-minded students, world leading institutions, and renowned guests. The competition is a unique opportunity for participants, connecting the worlds smartest academics from the U.S.A., Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. Taking part in this event is also a great moment in which people can interact with the invited companies , financial institutions, guests and partners. For the first two editions this event was organized with the Harvard Extension Business Society, an official Harvard Club.\nDuring the first edition, a team from HEC Paris, a leading French university, won the challenge.\nThe second edition was won by the London Business School.\n\nThe various IFSA Network chapters try to offer their communities various local events to connect with the professional world. Often, an industry professional will come to the IFSA Network events and meet students. The purpose of those venues is to give students a taste of the professional world, share tips and knowledge, and give an opportunity to network.\n\nIn 2018, the IFSA Network in cooperation with the Boston Consulting Group and InvestSoc, organised the first, three-week long International Cape Town Case Competition. The competition has a unique format where teams consisting of 2 to 4 participants, propose solutions for crises that are presented to them. In their solutions, participants are able to showcase their knowledge, creativity and problem-solving skills on a current macroeconomic issue. \nA jury picks the 15 best international teams and the best local teams, from Cape Town. The selected teams arrive in Cape Town, South Africa, to participate in the second round, and present in front of a select panel of distinguished professors and practitioners. The winning team is awarded a cash prize of 5000 South African Rand.\n\nThe IFSA Network is very selective when it comes to opening chapters and selecting board members. Striving for excellency, it will only open chapters in elite universities, and hires only the most ambitious and brightest students. The purpose of this is to ensure smooth operations and maintain a high-level of execution in all of the organisation’s activities. Ultimately, the goal is to have establishments around the world, regrouping all major academic institutions.\n"}

{"id": "54971409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54971409", "title": "Jurassic World Evolution", "text": "Jurassic World Evolution\n\nJurassic World Evolution is a business simulation video game developed and published by Frontier Developments. Based on the 2015 film \"Jurassic World\", the game was released on 12 June 2018, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the game, players construct a dinosaur park on Las Cinco Muertes Archipelago, a group of five islands also known as the \"Five Deaths\". The game features more than 40 types of dinosaurs; their genes can be modified to introduce new features. Players are given contracts to fulfill by three divisions, Science, Security and Entertainment, allowing them to progress. A sandbox mode set on Isla Nublar, the setting of the film, can be unlocked.\n\nThe game was created by a development team of approximately 100 people with a budget of around £8 million. Its development began in 2016, after NBCUniversal approached Frontier Developments about creating a game to accompany the theatrical release of \"\". To do this, Frontier staff inspected different dinosaur models and reference materials sent by Universal, watched the \"Jurassic Park\" films, read the novels and fan theories. The team consulted paleontologist Jack Horner when they designed the dinosaurs. Jeff Goldblum, Bryce Dallas Howard and B. D. Wong reprised their roles from the \"Jurassic Park\" film series, voicing remarks to players and contributing to the game's narrative.\n\nAnnounced at Gamescom 2017, the game received a generally mixed critical reception. Critics praised its dinosaur designs and graphics, but the game's contracts, simulation and management gameplay were less well-received. The game's tutorial and learning curve were also criticized. Five weeks after its initial release, the game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales. The game was supported with free updates and downloadable content upon release.\n\n\"Jurassic World Evolution\" is a business simulation game that allows the player to construct a Jurassic World dinosaur theme park with attractions and research facilities. Players must build an Expedition Center, which sends paleontologists to fossil dig sites to obtain dinosaurs' DNA material. DNA sequencing unlocks new dinosaurs and updates their statistics, such as lifespan and resilience. With enough DNA content, players can use the Hammond Research Center to breed and incubate dinosaurs. Players can also improve the dinosaurs' genes by integrating DNA from modern species with that of the dinosaurs to fill their gaps and allow them to evolve. Modifications to the dinosaurs' DNA change their base statistics, as well as everything from their level of aggressiveness to their appearance. The game features a terrain tool which allows players to modify the environment by planting trees and creating water sources.\n\nDinosaurs are the game's main attraction and income earner. The game features approximately 40 dinosaur species at launch. Players can name each dinosaur after they are incubated. Players need to build enclosures to contain dinosaurs for visitors' viewing. The needs of different dinosaurs, like the type of food they eat and the extent of the social interactions they require, must be met to keep them healthy and satisfied. Dinosaurs, controlled by artificial intelligence, will interact with each other and the environment. For instance, carnivores will attack carnivores of a different species, and they will hunt down herbivores. Players also need to construct various entertainment rides, as well as amenities like restaurants and shops to please the guests. An example of tourist attractions is the Gyrosphere or the monorail from \"Jurassic World\". Players can also use the game's photo mode to take pictures of dinosaurs, which help the park to earn money and publicity. Each entertainment facility and amenity comes with its own management system. Players are able to set and adjust entry fees as well as the number of staff present in each facility. Dinosaurs can be sold to earn additional income. \n\nVarious emergency situations may happen in the park, including power failures, unpredictable weather, and dinosaur breakouts, which must be addressed by players to ensure guests' safety and happiness. Players can build an ACU Center and a Ranger Station, which are responsible for maintaining the park's security. They can sedate escaped dinosaurs, medicate sick dinosaurs, resupply dinosaur feeders, transport dinosaurs, fix fences, and more. Players can also control vehicles from a third-person perspective such as helicopters and 4x4 trucks to complete these tasks. Emergency shelters to protect the guests, as well as other security structures like power network redundancies and storm warning centers, can be built. Many of these security facilities can be upgraded to strengthen their efficiency when dealing with emergencies.\n\nIn the career mode, the player's goal is to develop five-star parks across the fictional islands of the Las Cinco Muertes Archipelago. Dr. Ian Malcolm assists players throughout the game. Players will meet other key figures representing the three branches of the park's development: Entertainment, Security, and Science. Each of these characters tries to convince players to develop the park in accordance with their advice. They give players \"contracts\" to complete which include a series of goals and objectives. These contracts add narrative to the game, as well as provide rewards and reputation in their respective domains. Players are advised to keep a close eye on their reputation within each division. If a player's reputation within a division gets too low, that creates a sabotage in the player's park that will need to be attended to immediately. For instance, the park's power could be shut down allowing dinosaurs to break out, or a disease could be introduced to infect them. These divisions all feed into the parks' ratings. The five islands, each with different characteristics and challenges, will gradually unlock with sufficient positive park ratings. \n\nIsla Nublar — the island featured in \"Jurassic Park\", \"Jurassic World\", and \"\" — is the setting for a sandbox mode that is separate from the game's career mode. The sandbox mode is unlocked once a four-star park rating is achieved on Isla Matanceros, the starting island. Once this is accomplished, everything players have unlocked in career mode, such as building upgrades and dinosaurs, will transfer over to the sandbox; anything locked in career mode remains in the sandbox. In sandbox mode, players have unlimited funds, and they can set the weather and time of day at their parks. Challenge Mode, available in an update after the game's release, involves playing with adjustable levels of difficulty and limited money, in addition to other differences like fees and penalties against players.\n\n\"Jurassic World Evolution\" was developed and published by Frontier Developments, and is based on the 2015 film \"Jurassic World\". NBCUniversal had wanted a game to accompany the theatrical release of its 2018 film \"\" and approached Frontier Developments about creating it two years or so before the film's eventual release. Frontier Developments was also interested in creating a dinosaur game. \n\nThe game was created with a development team of approximately 100 people, on a budget of around £8 million. It was built using Frontier Developments' Cobra game engine. Universal Pictures provided the developers with dinosaur models from the films to allow for a high level of detail, as well as reference materials and audio. To aid in creating the game, the development team closely watched the films and read Michael Crichton's novels, \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Lost World\", and fan theories. In addition, Universal and the team had discussions about various elements in the game. History from each of the films was added to the game. For example, Jeff Goldblum reprised his role as Ian Malcolm from the first two \"Jurassic Park\" films. Bryce Dallas Howard and B. D. Wong also reprised their roles from \"Jurassic World\".\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus rex\" was one of the first dinosaurs the development team began working on. For the \"T. rex\" roars, the game's sound team obtained audio samples from the films and then altered them for originality. The animation team then altered their \"T. rex\" roaring animations to fit the sound effects. To design the dinosaurs the development team primarily referred to the films for consistency, while incorporating some of the latest scientific discoveries to add to their designs. The team also studied birds and other animals to aid in designing the dinosaurs. In addition to their designs, dinosaur behavior was based on a combination of the films and scientific findings. Paleontologist Jack Horner, who served as an advisor on the films, was also consulted for advice on the game's dinosaurs. They were given bright and colorful hides based on new dinosaur research.\n\nIn February 2017, Frontier's CEO David Braben announced the company was working on a new project based on an existing Hollywood property. On 20 August 2017, the game was announced during Gamescom 2017. Later, on 7 October, footage showcasing the in-game engine was revealed during the first annual Frontier Expo. The game was digitally released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 12 June 2018, coinciding with the theatrical release of \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\". A free game update based on \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\", with six dinosaurs from the film, was released on 22 June 2018. Physical copies of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version were distributed by Sold Out on 3 July 2018. In August 2018, Frontier Developments announced an upcoming patch that would alter the sizes of several dinosaurs to match their real-life and film counterparts. The update was released in September 2018, and included additional sandbox and gameplay options, as well as the addition of Challenge Mode. The first paid downloadable content (DLC), \"Secrets of Dr. Wu\", was released on November 20, 2018. The DLC introduced new story missions, research options and new dinosaur and hybrid species. On the same day, Frontier introduced new AI behaviors and a day-night cycle into the game via a free update.\n\nCritics praised the dinosaurs featured in the game. Sam Loveridge of \"GamesRadar+\" liked the variety as well as the cutscene that was displayed when a dinosaur is released from the incubation center. He enjoyed being able to control the jeep and the ACU helicopter from a third-person perspective, a mechanic he applauds for allowing players to relate to the dinosaurs. He added that he \"lost entire evenings to [the game] without even thinking\" due to its relaxing nature. Game Revolutions Paul Tamburro praised the dinosaurs' design, in particular, Frontier's attention to detail and the dinosaurs' animation. James Swinbanks of \"GameSpot\" agreed, praising the dinosaurs. He also enjoyed the need to learn each dinosaur's personality, requirements and behaviors, adding the process is \"surprisingly satisfying\". \"Game Informer\" s Daniel Tack liked that players can experiment with different genes, though he commented that it was not a \"freeform experience\". Dan Stapleton of \"IGN\" disagreed and felt that unlocking genes was tedious, describing the process as a series of \"mandatory robotic actions\". While he liked the dinosaur variety, he lamented the lack of \"pterosaurs\" and aquatic prehistoric reptiles at launch. \"Destructoid\"s Dam Roemer commended the inclusion of lesser- known dinosaurs species, singling out \"Giganotosaurus\" and \"Deinonychus\". \n\nThe simulation aspect of the game received mixed reviews. Loveridge held a positive opinion regarding dinosaur management, as each species has their own needs and niches that players must fulfill. He felt the park management aspect, including the construction of facilities and utilities, was \"minimal\". Tamburro compared the simulation to \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" and \"Zoo Tycoon\". He enjoyed the chaos created when dinosaurs break out, but he was disappointed that dinosaurs did not attack the park's staff carrying out maintenance inside the enclosures. Philippa Warr of \"PC Gamer\" praised the dinosaurs but criticized the lack of attention to missions and individual guests' views and happiness ratings on the park. She also noted the simulation lacked depth, as buildings looked largely the same and the environment soon became stale. Swinbanks felt dealing with natural disasters and dinosaur breakout was exciting initially, but soon became repetitive. He also lamented the lack of new challenges presented in the later stage of the game. Tack criticized the tiresome aspect of simulation and the constant need to wait for objectives to be completed, comparing them to a mobile game. Describing the simulation as \"shallow\", Roemer criticized the lack of time constraints, cleanliness ratings, and a full day-night cycle. He was also disappointed by the small size of each island, which made park building \"unfulfilling\". Stapleton agreed, saying that the small islands limited players' creativity. He noted that players cannot speed up time in the game, a signature feature in many other simulators and builders, and criticized its exclusion as it forced players to wait aimlessly to get enough cash to perform an action.\n\nThe game's contracts garnered mixed opinions. Loveridge believed they helped introduced a structure to the game, though he commented that these missions did not form a cohesive narrative. Tamburro enjoyed the process of progressing from one island to the next, as each island has its own unique layout and landscape prompting players to create a new park that is different from the previous ones. He noted that the contracts helped players to unlock new items, but he felt they were not \"exciting\". Warr criticized the lack of variety featured in the missions, with different scenarios only presenting minor modifications and adjusting the difficult slightly. He also disliked the contracts for occasionally forcing players to complete missions that do not make sense, such as releasing a dinosaur to kill guests. Swinbanks also criticized three contract factions, adding that players' need to satisfy and balance all three parties demands as \"arbitrary\". Roemer praised Goldblum's performance, though he noted the overarching plot \"goes nowhere\". He described the game's progression system as \"awful\" and wished to skip them entirely.\n\nThe game's tutorial and guidance to players was criticized. Loveridge noted that certain missions were confusing with some late game objectives being presented too early, forcing him to dismiss them to progress. He singled out the tutorial section for being incompetent, failing to inform players about key aspects of the game such as power distribution and landscaping tools, which often create obstruction. and terrain errors that prevent players from constructing certain buildings and modifying the landscape. Warr noted pacing errors with the tutorials, saying that some of them showed up way too late.\n\nReviewers had mixed opinions of the game as a whole. Loveridge called it an intricate simulation game that fans of the series would enjoy, and he commended the many references to the film featured in the game. Tamburro agreed and called it the best \"Jurassic Park\"-themed game, though he noted that the game had more constraints than Frontier's previous park builder, \"Planet Coaster\". Initially impressed by the game, Warr was disappointed after extended play time feeling the game was lacking depth. Swinbanks noted that despite its shortcomings, the game was \"faithful\" to the franchise. He felt that it was \"a good park management sim in its own right\". Roemer felt that the game's development was rushed, and the lack of depth was problematic. Stapleton called it a \"bad\" game for being largely boring.\n\nFive weeks after its initial release, the game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales.\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Audio Design\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards.\n"}

She was the oldest child of Edward H. and Mary Adaline Kellogg Carter. Her parents were natives of Vermont, descended from the early New England settlers, of English and Scotch origin. Her early education was chiefly from nature and object study. At the age of eight, she attended private and public schools in Burlington, Vermont, and in Vineland, New Jersey, where her family removed in 1866. The years of country life spent in southern New Jersey during her youth were filled with formative influences that laid a broad and sound basis for her lifework.\n\nCircumstances and environments led Carter to finding occupations for herself, or to having them given her, that promoted inventive and executive powers and stimulated love for science and art. Thirst for larger opportunities and higher education developed, but adversities came, overwork, intense mental strain, then long and severe illness. After health was restored, she was by degrees led to industrial art as her vocation. Though beset by obstacles that would have turned aside one of less resoluteness, her course was progressive and largely successful. With simply the intention of becoming proficient as a teacher of drawing, she entered the Woman's Art School, Cooper Union, New York City.\n\nAfter graduating with highest honors, in 1876, her services were immediately required as a designer for embroidery. While thus engaged, part of her time was still devoted to art study, and throughout her years of working, she was a constant student in art and other educational subjects.\n\nIn the Centennial Exhibition, in 1876, she made a special study of the needlework, art embroideries and textiles of all countries. Not long after, her watercolor studies from nature attracted the notice of John Bennett (1840-1907), the English painter of art-pottery, and she became his pupil and assistant. In 1879, a number of pieces of faience decorated by her were sent by invitation to the exhibition of Howell James & Co., London, England. One of her vases was presented to Sir Frederic Leighton, president of the Royal Academy, and others were sold to art museums in England, to be kept as examples of American art pottery. The same year, some of her work in faience was shown in New York, and won much praise.\n\nWhen the Associated Artists began their united enterprise which did much in revolutionizing and elevating household taste and interior decoration of American home and public buildings, Carter's services were secured by Louis Tiffany, and she was connected with them several years. At first having to do with all the kinds of work undertaken, glass, mosaics, metals, wood, embroideries, hangings, wall and ceiling coverings, painting or anything else decoratively used in buildings, she was the first woman thus employed. Later, having developed marked ability in plastic art, she had special charge of their pottery and modeling department. Her ornamental relief-work, panels and friezes were often used with heads and figures by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and combined with work by Charles Caryl Coleman, Maitland Armstrong and other well known artists in the decoration of public and private buildings in New York and different parts of the country. Her designs for memorial and other windows, for decoration of interiors and for different purposes were used in churches and homes, on both east and west coasts.\n\nFrequently, artists, draughtsmen, teachers and others sought instruction from her in special subjects. At different times, she taught classes of children in drawing, and in the Woman's Art School one in porcelain painting. Since 1886, she was instructor of the free classes in clay-modeling, applied design and normal training in form-study and drawing for the Young Woman's Christian Association of New York. The courses of study in those classes and all accessories were planned and carried out by her.\n\nFrom about 1880, Carter resided with her family in the upper suburban part of New York City. She was a staunch member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.\n"}
{"id": "12281120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12281120", "title": "Mercury beating heart", "text": "Mercury beating heart\n\nThe mercury beating heart is an electrochemical redox reaction between the elements mercury, iron and chromium. The reaction causes a blob of mercury in water to oscillate.\n\nThe observeable reaction demonstrates an effect of a non-homogeneous electrical double layer. It is often used as a classroom demonstration.\n\nIn the experiment a droplet of mercury is placed in a watch glass, immersed in an electrolyte such as sulfuric acid which contains an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, or potassium dichromate. The tip of an iron nail is positioned almost touching the mercury. If the position of the nail tip is just right, the mercury blob begins to oscillate, changing shape.\n\nIn one variation the mechanism is thought to be the following: The dichromate oxidizes the mercury, forming a layer of mercury oxide. In the process the dichromate is reduced to the chromium(III) ion. The oxidized layer on the mercury reduces the surface tension of the blob and the blob flattens out coming in contact with the iron nail. Then the mercury sulfate oxidizes the iron to the iron(II) ion, and in the process is reduced back to metallic mercury. Once there is no oxide coating left on the mercury blob, the surface tension increases and the blob rounds up and loses contact with the nail, to start the process over again.\n\nThe net reaction is that the dichromate oxidizes the iron. This favorable reaction drives the mercury oxidations/reductions and the oscillations in shape. When the dichromate is all reduced, the reaction stops.\n\nThere may be other mechanisms involved, however. Lin et al. appear to report that the oscillations occur without the presence of the oxidizing agent, though the mercury does not appear to get an oxidizing layer on it and the oscillations are much weaker.\n\nAn electrical double layer forms between the surface of the mercury droplet and the electrolyte solution. At rest this layer is uniform. When the iron tip is introduced a redox reaction starts in which iron is oxidized to the ferric ion. At the same time the oxidizing reagent is spent for instance when hydrogen peroxide together with hydronium ions is reduced to water. Because the oxidation only takes place in the vicinity of the tip and the reduction process covers the whole droplet surface the surface tension is no longer homogeneous resulting in oscillations.\n\nAlthough this reaction is mediated by changes in surface tension, it is very similar in mechanism to other chemical oscillators such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, which has several intermediate redox reactions driven by the oxidation of malate by bromine.\n\nThe mercury beating heart was first observed by Carl Adolf Paalzow in 1858. Jöns Jakob Berzelius is reported to have used electrodes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51875172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51875172", "title": "Online learning in higher education", "text": "Online learning in higher education\n\nOnline learning involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). In the domain of higher education there are two distinct methods in which a learner can engage with an academic institution; the traditional method of brick-and-mortar facilities and the virtual method through online learning. This article will focus on the virtual platform of online learning. Today's online learning is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.\n\nThe first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post to reach students who couldn't be on a university campus. By the early 1900s, communication technologies improved and distance education took to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the University of Wisconsin began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station dedicated to educational broadcasting. Soon after, access to higher education was again expanded through the invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. The University of Iowa began to experiment with television for educational purposes in the 1930s. It was not until the 1950s, when the FCC began to reserve television frequencies for educational purposes, that telecourses caught the attention of the public. The value of television for education was furthered by the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in 1967. The CPB mission was \"to encourage the growth and development of public radio and television broadcasting, including the use of such media for instructional, educational, and cultural purposes\" (as cited in, p. 27).\n\nOnline learning emerged in 1982 when the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California opened its School of Management and Strategic Studies. The School employed computer conferencing to deliver a distance education program to business executives. In 1989 the University of Phoenix began offering education programs through the internet. In 1993 with the debut of the first Internet web browser, created by the University of Illinois, online learning began to flourish. In 1998, the first fully online programs were founded: New York University Online, Western Governor's University, the California Virtual University and Trident University International.\n\nIn 2000 only 8% of students were enrolled in an online course, but by 2008 enrollment had increased to 20%. The expansion of online education has not slowed either; by the fall of 2013 nearly 30% of all postsecondary students were enrolled in some kind of distance education course. Although the data on online course and program completion are complex, researchers have noted high rates of attrition (ranging from 20%-50%) among students enrolled in online courses compared to those who take traditional face-to-face courses.\n\nGiven the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings. Online platforms can also offer more diverse representations of student populations as learners prepare for working in the twenty-first century. The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content. Courses offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format.\n\nAsynchronous learning environments are described as online spaces where work is supported through the use of digital platforms in such a way that participants are not required to be online at the same time. Threaded discussions, e-mail, and telephone calls are options of asynchronous delivery. This gives meaning to the anytime-anywhere appeal of online learning. A benefit of asynchronous learning is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements. The additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information. The spelling and grammar within postings of an asynchronous environment are like that found in formal academic writing. On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment. Asynchronous learning is viewed as less social in nature and can cause the learner to feel isolated. Providing the student a feeling of belonging to the university or institution will assist with feelings of isolation; this can be done through ensuring links to university support systems and the library are accessible and operable.\n\nSynchronous learning environments most closely resemble face-to-face learning. Synchronous learning takes place through digital platforms where the learners are utilizing the online media at the same time. When compared to asynchronous learning, synchronous online environments provide a greater sense of feeling supported, as the exchange of text or voice is immediate and feels more like a conversation. If platforms such as web conferencing or video chat are used, learners are able to hear the tone of voice used by others which may allow for greater understanding of content. As in a traditional classroom environment, online learners may feel a need to keep the conversation going, so there is a potential for focusing on the quantity of responses over the quality of content within the response. However the synchronous environment, with real-time responses, can allow for students or instructors to provide clarity to what was said, or alleviate any possible misconceptions.\n\nMost online learning occurs through a college's or university's learning management system (LMS). A LMS is a software application for maintaining, delivering, and tracking educational resources. According to the Educause Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR) use of a LMS is nearly ubiquitous as 99% of colleges and universities report having one in place. Among faculty, 87% report using a LMS and find them useful for \"enhancing teaching (74%) and student learning (71%)\" (p. 10). Similarly, 83% of students use an LMS in their courses, with the majority (56%) using them in most or all courses.\n\nMost institutions utilize LMSs by external vendors (77%), Blackboard currently dominates the LMS environment with an adoption rate of 31.9%, followed by Moodle at 19.1%, and Canvas at 15.3%. However, in the last year Canvas, by Instructure, has gained an increasing amount of the market share (see graphic). Reflecting these changes the ECAR reported that 15% of institutions are in the process of updating and/or replacing their LMS; the main reasons cited were the need to \"upgrade functions (71%), replace legacy systems (44%), and reduce costs (18%)\" (p. 6).\n\nECAR's survey of institutions found that generally, both faculty and students are satisfied with the LMS; with three-quarters satisfied with the LMS for posting content (faculty) and accessing content (students). In contrast, the lowest levels of satisfaction with the LMS reported by faculty were with features that allow for \"meaningful\" interaction between students and their instructor, students and other students, and for study groups or collaborating on projects (p. 12). Similarly, just under half of the students surveyed reported satisfaction of the LMS for \"engaging in meaningful interactions with students\" (p. 12).\n\nWhile LMSs are largely being used as a repository for course materials (e.g. syllabus, learning content, etc.) and platforms for the assessment of learning, recent developments are making them more customizable through LTI standards. According to a report by the Educause Learning Initiative the \"Next Generation Digital Learning Environment\" will be more responsive to students' needs creating a more customizable experience. The functional characteristics of the next generation of digital learning environments include: \"interoperability and integration; personalization; analytics, advising, and learning assessments; collaboration; and, accessibility and universal design\" (p. 4)\n\nThe well-known educational theorist John Dewey argued that learning occurs in collaboration with knowledgeable others. Similarly, psychologist Jean Piaget noted that in order for learning to occur, the content must be meaningful to the student. Piaget's constructivist theory of learning highlighted the importance of engaged learning where meaningful discussions were held between peers. The sociologist Lev Vygotsky also emphasized the importance of social interaction in learning. Traditionally, in formal education this interaction occurs largely between the student and the teacher, but as students and teachers become distanced from each other in the virtual classroom, creative strategies for instruction continue to be developed. While early approaches to online learning were merely an extension of independently-driven correspondence courses, today's approach to online learning focuses on engagement and active learning.\n\nTheories of distance education are relatively new to the scene. These theories can be placed into four main categories: 1) theories of independent study (e.g. Charles Wedemeyer, Michael Moore); 2) theories of the industrialization of teaching (e.g. Otto Peters); 3) theories of interaction and communication (e.g. Borje Holmberg); and 4) a synthesis of existing theories of communication and diffusion and philosophies of education (e.g. Hilary Perraton). However, the equivalency theory of distance education posits that all students should have learning experiences of equal value and that it is the responsibility of the instructional designer to create learning experiences for the distance learner that will be successful in meeting the course objectives. As online education has become the dominant form of distance education, new theories are emerging that combine elements of constructivism and technology. Siemens' \"Connectivism\" \"is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories\".(p. 5) Connectivism places knowledge in \"diversity of opinions\" (p. 5) and that learning is aided through creating and nurturing connections of \"fields, ideas, and concepts\". (p. 5)\n\nTransformative learning or Transformative pedagogy \"encourages students to critically examine their assumptions, grapple with social issues, and engage in social action\" ( p. 219). Five suggestions for preparing the online environment for transformative pedagogy are: \"(a) create a safe and inviting environment; (b) encourage students to think about their experiences, beliefs, and biases; (c) use teaching strategies that promote student engagement and participation; (d) pose real-world problems that address societal inequalities; and (e) help students implement action-oriented solutions\" (p. 220). There are four fundamental characteristics that may assist with the success of online instruction: (1) the learner should be actively engaged throughout the course; (2) group participation can assist with meeting course objectives; (3) frequent student-student and student-teacher interaction can alleviate the feelings of isolation; and (4) the course content should relate to the real world to enhance meaning for participants.\n\nParticipation and interaction between participants and instructors involves significant and continuous preparation. Online educators are often members of a larger team consisting of instructional and graphic designers and information technology specialists; being open to becoming a member of the team will assist in a smooth transition to online teaching. Expectations of learners to be self-motivated, able to manage their time effectively, contribute to course discussions and have a willingness to teach others is not unlike what is expected in a traditional classroom. The instructor's role is to encourage learners to evaluate and analyze information, then connect the information to course content which may assist in learner success. With the potential for learners to feel disconnected from peers within the course, the instructor will need to work to create spaces and encounters which promote socialization. A few recommendations are to create a \"student lounge\" as an informal space for socialization not related to coursework. Also, incorporating team projects can help alleviate feelings of isolation. Online instructors should be cognizant of where participants are physically located; when members of the course span two or more time zones, the timing of the course can become problematic. Initial preparation of an online course is often more time consuming than preparation for the classroom. The material must be prepared and posted, in its entirety, prior to the course start. In addition to preparation, faculty experienced in online instruction spend about 30% more time on courses conducted online. The mentoring of novice online educators from those with experience can assist with the transition from classroom to the virtual environment.\n\nOnline credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of digital badges, electronic passports and massive open online courses (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.\n"}

When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.\n\nIn 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama. The result of the collaboration was \"Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions\" that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.\n\nSince its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008 Nikon International Small World Competition - Fifth Place.\n\n2006 Nikon International Small World Competition - Fourth Place.\n\n2005 Classics Award Winner for Teacher Education.

{"id": "44518495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44518495", "title": "Peggy Feury", "text": "Peggy Feury\n\nPeggy Feury (30 June 1924 — 20 November 1985) (born Margaret Feury) was an actress on Broadway, in films, and on television. She became a highly regarded acting teacher in New York and then in Los Angeles. Throughout her career, she taught many notable students.\n\nFeury was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. Her father was Richard Feury; her mother, born in Ireland, was also Margaret Feury; and her younger sister was Elinor Feury. She graduated from Barnard College, then attended the Yale School of Drama, later studying with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, and with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.\n\nWhile at Yale, Feury met and then married her first husband, playwright Louis S. Peterson. Less than a decade later, following their divorce and Feury's remarriage, Peterson's semi-autobiographical play \"Entertain a Ghost\" was produced, chronicling a deteriorating marriage between a fictional playwright and actress with obvious parallels to Peterson and Feury. The play received from the \"Village Voice\" a positive and detailed review that expressed the feeling that the production should have run longer. It described it as \"a daring and deeply exploratory new play, the best damned failure I've seen in years\".\n\nAs Margaret Feury she appeared on Broadway in \"Me and Molly\"; \"Sunday Breakfast\" (staged by noted acting teacher Stella Adler); \"Enter Laughing\"; \"Peer Gynt\", starring John Garfield, Mildred Dunnock, and Karl Malden, directed by Lee Strasberg; \"The Grass Harp\", directed by Actors Studio co-founder Robert Lewis; \"The Lady of the Camellias\", directed by Franco Zeffirelli, Chekov's \"Three Sisters,\" directed by Strasberg (with Feury eventually replacing Geraldine Page as Olga), and \"The Turn of the Screw\". Off-Broadway she starred in Frank Wedekind's \"Earth Spirit\" at the Provincetown Playhouse.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1969, the Actors Studio undertook a project to record and archive work that was being done there, including performances of scenes from dramatic literature. These recordings have been archived as part of the University of Wisconsin Digital Collections. Feury participated in this project from its inception until her relocation to Los Angeles in December 1968.\n\nFeury appeared in a number of television dramas beginning in the Golden Age of Television, including, in 1961, a significant role she played in “Murder is a Face I Know”, an episode from \"The Naked City\", which can be found on the internet.\n\nIn November 1961, an early draft of the first scene of Edward Albee’s play, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", was presented on the public television program \"Playwright at Work\". The characters George and Martha – which would later be originated on stage by Arthur Hill and Uta Hagen, and on screen by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor – were portrayed by Shepperd Strudwick and Feury.\n\nOn October 2, 1977, Feury appeared in \"Iowa,\" the second season premiere of \"Visions\", PBS's Peabody Award-winning dramatic anthology series; it was also playwright Murray Mednick's television debut. The critical reaction was disappointment, but the actors fared better, Feury in particular. As the unwilling nursing home resident whose disjointed recollections provide her granddaughter an invaluable connection to her Iowa roots, Feury's portrayal was judged \"[b]y far the best acting performance\" by \"The Hartford Courant\". Her performance, as the character veers \"from family feeling to suspicion to self-absorbed recollection\" – was noted by \"The Boston Globe\", with \"The Los Angeles Times\" citing her \"almost effortless grace\" and \"marvelous ferocity.\" Critic James Wolcott writes: \nOne scene teems with unruly life: Eileen visits her grandmother (Peggy Feury) in the nursing home, and the grandma's semi-senile outbursts have a crazy, cawing theatricality. \"This is a cattle yard,\" says Feury's crone as the camera stares down the discarded people. \"Bellowing, constant bellowing.\" Another patient – babbling \"Operator, operator, operator\" – is wheeled across the screen and grandma, like an Alice-in-Wonderland queen, issues a command: \"Choke her!\" This disreputably funny scene is capped when a nurse happens by and – perfect joke – turns out to be a Lily Tomlin lookalike.\n\nIn 1982, Feury appeared as \"Colonel Buckholtz,\" a perfectionist colonel who inspects Margaret Houlihan and the nurses in \"Hey, Look Me Over,\" the opening episode of M*A*S*H Season 11.\n\nFeury's film credits include Matt Cimber's \"The Witch Who Came from the Sea\" (1976), Richard C. Sarafian's \"The Next Man\" (1976) starring Sean Connery, Elia Kazan's film of \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976), starring Robert De Niro, Carl Reiner's \"All of Me\" (1984), starring Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin, Ken Russell's \"Crimes of Passion\" (1984), and Feury's final screen performance, in \"1918\" (1985), written by Horton Foote. A brief appearance in Donald Shebib's \"Heartaches\" (1981) was singled out by New York Times critic Vincent Canby: \"That very fine actress Peggy Feury appears in a tiny but important scene as the doctor who advises Bonnie about a possible abortion.\"\n\nBy far Feury's most substantial film role (in terms of both sheer size and importance to a film's narrative) came in a little seen low-budget psychological horror film – John Ballard's \"Friday the 13th: The Orphan\" (1979), based on the short story \"Sredni Vashtar\" by Saki. In \"Nightmare USA\" (his 2007 study of lesser-known American exploitation filmmakers), Stephen Thrower writes:\nThen there's Peggy Feury, a skilled and thoughtful actress who demonstrates here how she came to be one of the leading lights in her profession. (She taught acting at the Actors Studio, alongside Lee Strasberg.) The role of Aunt Martha is already well-written, but Feury brings her own amazingly subtle shadings to the part. \n\nFeury was a charter member of the Actors Studio and frequently led sessions there when Lee Strasberg was unavailable. She also taught her own classes in the same building where Strasberg taught, behind Carnegie Hall.\n\nIn December 1968, at Strasberg's suggestion, Feury moved to Los Angeles with her husband William Traylor and their two daughters. After a brief stint teaching at Jack Garfein's Actors and Directors Lab, Feury helped establish the west coast branch of the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she would double as instructor and artistic director until 1973, when she and Traylor started their own acting school, the Loft Studio, on LaBrea Avenue.\n\nSean Penn was 18 when he arrived at the Loft; he remained for two years, attending class twenty-five hours a week. Feury's \"very gentle,\" \"very personal\" approach quickly won over the fiercely independent young actor, as did her emphasis on discovering \"how [to] bring yourself to the material rather than the material to you.\" To Anjelica Huston, who began her studies in 1981 at age 30, Feury was \"a revelation,\" with \"a vast knowledge of playwrights\" and \"an extraordinary gift for making one feel understood.\" Huston describes her teacher as \"beautiful,\" \" quite small and delicate,\" with a \"half way to heaven look.\" On the other hand, notes Huston, Feury was \"extremely intelligent and mordant, Irish, with certain very visceral preferences\", and yet had \"a way of commenting on a scene that was never destructive. [Even when] you knew she thought it was pretty terrible, she had a way of translating it positively to actors – her process was very reinforcing, I think.\"\n\nFeury was occasionally called upon to coach an individual actor in a role, as she did Michelle Pfeiffer in Brian De Palma's \"Scarface\" (1983) and Lily Tomlin in her one-woman stage show \"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe\". The evolution of Tomlin's show formed the basis of a 1986 documentary in which Feury appeared posthumously; Tomlin dedicated the film to her memory.\n\nFrom the mid 1970s until her death, Feury and her students frequently showcased the work of playwright Horton Foote, presenting four of his plays in their entirety plus a number of individual scenes from Foote's \"The Orphans' Home Cycle\". In 1984, in her final film role, Feury was cast in the film version of Foote’s \"1918\", the seventh of \"The Orphans' Home Cycle's\" nine plays.\n\nFeury struggled with narcolepsy. When she would come out of one of its spells she could be lucid as though she had been alert during the episode. She died Wednesday, November 20, 1985 in a car accident, a head-on collision, in West Los Angeles.\n\nThese are acting credits except where otherwise indicated.\n\n"}

{"id": "31604324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31604324", "title": "Rankings of universities in the United States", "text": "Rankings of universities in the United States\n\nCollege and university rankings in the United States are rankings of US colleges and universities ordered by contributing factors which vary depending on the organization performing the ranking. Rankings have most often been conducted by magazines, newspapers, websites, or academics. In addition to ranking entire institutions, specific programs, departments, and schools can be ranked. Some rankings consider measures of wealth, research excellence and/or influence, selectivity, student options, eventual success, demographics, and other criteria. There is much debate about rankings' interpretation, accuracy, usefulness, and appropriateness. The expanding diversity in rating methodologies and accompanying criticisms of each indicate the lack of consensus in the field.\n\nThe magazine U.S. News & World Report's rankings are based upon information they collect from educational institutions via an annual survey and school websites. It also considers opinion surveys of university faculty and administrators outside the school. Their college rankings were first published in 1983 and have been published in all years thereafter, except 1984.\n\nThe US News listings have gained such influence that some Universities have made it a specific goal to reach a particular level in the US News rankings. Belmont University president Bob Fisher stated in 2010, \"Rising to the Top 5 in U.S. News represents a key element of Belmont’s Vision 2015 plan.\" Clemson University made it a public goal to rise to the Top 20 in the US News rankings, and made specific changes, including reducing class size and altering the presentation of teacher salaries, so as to perform better in the statistical analysis by US News. At least one university, Arizona State, has actually tied the university president's pay to an increase in the school's placement in the US News rankings.\n\nThe following are elements in the 2017 U.S. News rankings of national universities and liberal arts colleges.\n\n\n\"U.S. News\" determined the relative weights of these factors and changed them over time. The National Opinion Research Center reviewed the methodology and stated that the weights \"lack any defensible empirical or theoretical basis\". The first four of the listed factors account for the great majority of the \"U.S. News\" ranking (80%, according to \"U.S. News's\" 2005 methodology), and the \"reputational measure\" (which surveys high-level administrators at similar institutions about their perceived quality ranking of each college and university) is especially important to the final ranking (accounting by itself for 25% of the ranking according to the 2005 methodology).\n\nA \"New York Times\" article reported that, given the \"U.S. News\" weighting methodology, \"it's easy to guess who's going to end up on top: the Big Three, Harvard, Yale and Princeton round out the first three essentially every year. When asked how he knew his system was sound, Mel Elfin, the rankings' founder, often answered that he knew it because those three schools always landed on top. When a new lead statistician, Amy Graham, changed the formula in 1999 to one she considered more statistically valid, the California Institute of Technology jumped to first place. Ms. Graham soon left, and a modified system pushed Princeton back to No. 1 the next year.\"\n\nA 2010 study by the University of Michigan found that university rankings in the United States significantly affect institutions' applications and admissions.\nThe research analyzed the effects of the U.S. News & World Report rankings, showing a lasting effect on college applications and admissions by students in the top 10% of their class. In addition, they found that rankings influence survey assessments of reputation by college presidents at peer institutions, such that rankings and reputation are becoming much more similar over time.\n\nA 2014 study published in \"Research in Higher Education\" removed the mystique of the \"U.S. News\" ranking process by producing a ranking model that faithfully recreated \"U.S. News\" outcomes and quantified the inherent “noise” in the rankings for all nationally ranked universities. The model developed provided detailed insight into the \"U.S. News\" ranking process. It allowed the impact of changes to \"U.S. News\" subfactors to be studied when variation between universities and within subfactors was present. Numerous simulations were run using this model to understand the amount of change required for a university to improve its rank or move into the top 20. Results show that for a university ranked in the mid-30s it would take a significant amount of additional resources, directed in a very focused way, to become a top-ranked national university, and that rank changes of up to +/- 4 points should be considered “noise”.\n\"Business Insider\" asks professionals which college they believe best prepares its students for success in life. The top three colleges in the 2014 survey were Stanford, MIT, and Caltech. Below is a summary of the analysis, ranking the colleges from 1 to 5.\n\nThe Council for Aid to Education publishes a list of the top universities in terms of annual fundraising. Fundraising ability reflects, among other things, alumni and outside donor's views of the quality of a university, as well as the ability of that university to expend funds on top faculty and facilities. Most recent 2017 rankings put Harvard at the top, ahead of Stanford and Cornell. Notable among universities without medical schools are MIT, Notre Dame, and Berkeley, while UCSF is a research university offering only post-baccalaureate programs in medicine and the health sciences.\n\nThe Daily Beast's college rankings take into account nine factors, with academics, future earnings, and affordability weighted most heavily. The other criteria include graduation rates, diversity, athletics, nightlife, activities, and campus quality. Data comes from The National Center for Education Statistics, as well as private organizations like PayScale, for salary data, and Niche, for student opinions. The Daily Beast's college rankings report the top 250 scoring schools, with Stanford University at the top, followed by Harvard University, Yale University, MIT, and Columbia University.\n\n\"The Economist\"'s college rankings The Economist Magazine's List of America's Best Colleges focuses on comparable economical advantages defined as 'the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere'. Based on set of strict criteria sourced from U.S. Department of Education ('College Scorecard\") with relevant 'expected earnings' and multiple statistics applied in calculation of 'median earnings' conclusive evaluation method has been applied to run the scorecard's earnings data through a multiple regression analysis, a common method of measuring the relationships between variables.\n\nEducate to Career ranks school by improvement in earnings and employment in the labor market, based on percentage of students employed in occupations that use their field of study, weighted against national norms.\n\nThe Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index by Academic Analytics ranks 354 institutions based on faculty publications, citations, research grants and awards.\n\nIn 2008, Forbes.com began publishing an annual list of \"America's Best Colleges\". Post-graduate success (self-reported salaries of alumni from PayScale, and data from the Department of Education) constitutes 35% of the score. Student debt loads constitute 20% of the score. Student experience (retention rates reported by the Department of Education, and data from Niche) constitutes 20% of the score. Graduation rates constitute 12.5% of the score. Academic success (using both the percentage of a school's student body that goes on to obtain doctorate degrees, and those students who have won one of a diverse array of prestigious academic awards) constitutes 12.5%. Public reputation is not considered, which causes some colleges to score lower than in other lists. A three-year moving average is used to smooth out the scoring. The 2018 ranking puts Harvard University at the top, followed by Yale University, Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Princeton University.\n\nReuters ranks the most innovative universities in the world based upon its assessment of the educational institutions \"doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.\" The assessment evaluates 10 different metrics, \"focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries),\" and ranks them based on their performance. For the third year in a row, Stanford University has topped the list as the most innovative university in the world, followed by MIT and Harvard in second and third place.\n\n\"Money\"'s college rankings take into account 21 factors that it categorizes as measures of educational quality, affordability, and alumni earnings. The rankings considered 1500 four-year colleges and reported the top ranking 736. In 2017, according to Money, the top 5 colleges are Princeton, Baruch College, Michigan-Ann Arbor, Berkeley, and UCLA.\n\nNiche provides rankings and reviews of colleges in the U.S. Their Best Colleges ranking focuses on academics, diversity, affordability, and student satisfaction. Their most recent ranking places Stanford at the top, followed by MIT, Yale, Harvard, and Rice University\n\nThe Princeton Review annually asks students and parents what their dream college is, if cost and ability to get in were not factors. Over 10,000 students and parents responded in 2016. The top dream school for students is Stanford, for the fourth year in a row. The top dream school for parents is also Stanford, for the fifth year in a row. Stanford won out over Harvard and NYU among students, and led Harvard and Princeton among parents.\n\nAvery \"et al.\" pioneered the use of choice modelling to rank colleges. Their methodology used a statistical analysis of the decisions of 3,240 students who applied to college in 1999. MyChances.net adopted a similar approach starting in 2009, stating that its method is based on this approach. The study analysed students admitted to multiple colleges. The college they attended became the winner, and the others became the losers. An Elo rating system was used to assign points based on each win or loss, and the colleges were ranked based on their Elo points. A useful consequence of the use of Elo points is that they can be used to estimate the frequency with which students, upon being admitted to two schools, will choose one over the other. The most recent preference ranking by Parchment placed MIT at the top, followed by Williams, Stanford, US Air Force Academy, and Claremont McKenna College.\n\nThe SMI rankings are a collaborative publication from CollegeNet and PayScale. The rankings aim to provide a measure of the extent to which colleges provide upward economic mobility to those that attend. The rankings were created in response to the finding in Science magazine which showed that among developed nations, the United States now provides the least economic opportunity and mobility for its citizens. The rankings were also created to combat the rising costs of tuition, much of which is attributed to the efforts of some colleges to increase their own fame and wealth in ways that increase their rank in media periodicals that put an emphasis on such measures. In 2014, according to the SMI, the top five colleges are Montana Tech, Rowan University, Florida A&M, Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal State Northridge.\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance has ranked American research universities in the Top American Research Universities since 2000. The methodology is based on data such as research publications, citations, recognitions and funding, as well as undergraduate quality such as SAT scores. The information used can be found in publicly accessible materials, reducing possibilities for manipulation. The methodology is generally consistent from year to year and changes are explained in the publication along with references from other studies.\n\nTrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide is an American-college guide based on what it calls \"Internet brand equity\" based on data collected from the Internet and global media sources. It ranks the Top 300 United States colleges and universities. The guide includes specialty and for profit schools including Art, Business, Design, Music, and Online Education. The TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Rankings are produced twice a year by the Global Language Monitor of Austin, Texas.\n\nTime Magazine described internet brand equity as \"a measure of who's talking about you online, based on Internet data, social media, blogs and the top 75,000 print and electronic media outlets.\n\nGLM ranks the schools \"according to their online presence -- or internet brand equity ... By focusing on online presence, the Monitor hopes to avoid the biases that characterize other rankings, which commonly rely on the opinions of university officials and college counselors rather than that of the greater public.\" GLM believes the rankings provide an up-to-date perspective on which schools have the most popular brand. The resulting rankings gauge the relative value of the various institutions and how they change over time.\n\nThe Global Language Monitor publishes other lists relating to the English language including: the TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide rankings of the top 425 U.S. colleges and universities according to their internet brand equity.\n\nTop Universities (January 2016): Rank/University (Previous Ranking)\n\n\nTop Colleges (January 2016): Rank/College (Previous Ranking)\n\n\n\nThe UniversityBenchmarks.com academic rankings focus on published public statistics for standardized scores, grade inflation, population, dropout rate, research funding and faculty recognition. These factors are normalized for the university student undergraduate population using standard statistical practices. From this data the difficulty of the curriculum, intelligence, competitiveness, faculty recognition and research prowess are determined. The universities are ranked by these individual categories. The relative overall rank of the student population and academic quality of the university is derived from the average of the rankings.\n\nThe University Entrepreneur Report lists the top six American universities in terms of venture capital investments in businesses started by a university's alumni. According to a CB Insights study of deals from 2007-2011, Stanford alumni secured 203 venture capital or angel investments, totaling $4.1 billion, more than any other university studied. Harvard was second with 112 deals, totaling $3.8 billion. Excluding the Facebook deal, Harvard alumni secured $1.8 billion, less than half of Stanford's total. UC Berkeley, NYU, UPenn and MIT each brought in over $1.0 billion.\nThe Wall Street Journal and Times Higher Education in late 2016 released their inaugural 2017 ranking of U.S. colleges and universities. It is a ranking of US colleges and universities that puts student success and learning—based on 100,000 current student voices—at its heart. The ranking includes clear performance indicators designed to answer the questions that matter the most to students and their families when making one of the most important decisions of their lives – who to trust with their education: Does the college have sufficient resources to teach me properly? Will I be engaged, and challenged, by my teacher and classmates? Does the college have a good academic reputation? What type of campus community is there? How likely am I to graduate, pay off my loans and get a good job? The ranking includes the results of the US Student Survey, which examines a range of key issues including students’ engagement with their studies, their interaction with their teachers and their satisfaction with their experience. The rankings adopt a balanced scorecard approach, with 15 individual performance indicators combining to create an overall score that reflects the broad strength of the institution.\n\nStanford topped the inaugural 2017 ranking, with MIT and Columbia taking the second and third spot. The 2018 ranking is listed below:\n\n\"The Washington Monthly's \" \"National Universities Rankings\", most recently published in 2016, began as a research report in 2005, with rankings appearing in the September 2006 issue. It ranks colleges on academic quality, faculty, and alumni outcome. It also offers American university and college rankings based upon \"contribution to the public good in numerous categories.\n\nThe following are elements in the Washington Monthly rankings.\nTheir top national universities are: \nIn 2009, the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) began grading colleges and universities based on the strength of their general education requirements. In ACTA's annual What Will They Learn? report, colleges and universities are assigned a letter grade from \"A\" to \"F\" based on how many of seven subjects are required of students. The seven subjects are composition, mathematics, foreign language, science, economics, literature and American government or history. The 2011-2012 edition of What Will They Learn? graded 1,007 institutions. In the 2011-2012 edition, 19 schools received an \"A\" grade for requiring at least six of the subjects the study evaluated. ACTA's rating system has been endorsed by Mel Elfin, founding editor of U.S. News & World Report's rankings. \"New York Times\" higher education blogger Stanley Fish, while agreeing that universities ought to have a strong core curriculum, disagreed with some of the subjects ACTA includes in the core.\n\nOther rankings include the \"Fiske Guide to Colleges\" and \"College Prowler\", now called Niche (see above). Many specialized rankings are available in guidebooks, considering individual student interests, fields of study, geographical location, financial aid and affordability. In addition to best overall colleges ranking shown above, Niche also publishes dozens of specialized rankings such as Best Academics, Best Campus Food, Most Conservative Colleges, and Best Technology.\n\nAmong the rankings dealing with individual fields of study is the Philosophical Gourmet Report or \"Leiter Report\", a ranking of philosophy departments. This report has attracted criticism from different viewpoints. Notably, practitioners of continental philosophy, who perceive the Leiter report as unfair to their field, have compiled alternative rankings.\n\nThe Gourman Report, last published in 1996, ranked the quality of undergraduate majors and graduate programs.\n\nThe Higher Education Rankings, developed and managed by the New York City consulting company IV Research, is a commercial product that provides both general rankings as well as personalized rankings based on a complicated assessment of 6 criteria and 30 indicators.\n\nGallup polls ask American adults, \"All in all, what would you say is the best college or university in the United States?\"\n\nGlobal Language Monitor produces a \"TrendTopper MediaBuzz\" ranking of the Top 300 United States colleges and universities semi-annually. It publishes overall results for both university and college categories. It uses the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s classifications to distinguish between universities and liberal arts colleges. The rankings list 125 universities, 100 colleges, the change in the rankings over time, a \"Predictive Quantities Indicator\" (PQI) Index number (for relative rankings), rankings by Momentum (yearly and 90-day snapshots), and rankings by State. The most recent ranking appeared on November 1, 2009, covering 2008. The PQI index is produced by Global Language Monitor's proprietary PQI algorithm, which has been criticized by some linguists for its use in a counting of the total number of English words. The Global Language Monitor also sells the TrendTopper MediaBuzz Reputation Management solution for higher education for which \"colleges and universities can enhance their standings among peers\". The Global Language Monitor states that it \"does not influence the Higher Education rankings in any way\".\n\nThe Princeton Review, annually publishes a book of Best Colleges. In 2011, this was titled \"The Best 373 Colleges.\" Phi Beta Kappa has also sought to establish chapters at the best schools, lately numbering 280.\n\nIn terms of collegiate sports programs, the annual NACDA Directors' Cup provides a measure of all-around collegiate athletic team achievement. Stanford has won the Division I Directors' cup for the last 22 years in a row.\n\nAmerican college and university ranking systems have drawn criticism from within and outside higher education in Canada and the United States. Institutions that have objected include Reed College, Alma College, Mount Holyoke College, St. John's College, Earlham College, MIT, Stanford University, University of Western Ontario, and Queen's University.\n\nCritics charged that \"U.S. News\" intentionally changed its methodology every year so that the rankings change and they can sell more magazines. A \"San Francisco Chronicle\" article argues that \"almost all of \"US News\" factors are redundant and can be boiled down to one characteristic: the size of the college or university's endowment.\"\n\nSome higher education experts, like Kevin Carey of Education Sector, have argued that \"U.S. News & World Report\"'s college rankings system is merely a list of criteria that mirrors the superficial characteristics of elite colleges and universities. According to Carey, \"[The] \"U.S. News\" ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity.\" He suggested more important characteristics are how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.\n\nOn 19 June 2007, during the annual meeting of the Annapolis Group, members discussed a letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the \"reputation survey\" section of the \"U.S. News\" survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). As a result, \"a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future.\" However, the decision to fill out the reputational survey was left to each individual college. The statement stated that its members \"have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process.\" This database was outlined and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the\"National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities\" and the \"Council of Independent Colleges.\"\n\n\"U.S. News & World Report\" editor Robert Morse issued a response on 22 June 2007, stating:\"in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at \"U.S. News\" firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the \"intangibles\" of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges.\"In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse argued:\"It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] \"U.S. News\" has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality.\"U.S. News\" first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of \"U.S. News\".\"\n\nIn 1996, according to Gerhard Casper, then-president of Stanford University, \"U.S. News & World Report\" changed its formula to calculated financial resources:\n\nKnowing that universities—and, in most cases, the statistics they submit—change little from one year to the next, I can only conclude that what are changing are the formulas the magazine's number massagers employ. And, indeed, there is marked evidence of that this year. In the category \"Faculty resources,\" even though few of us had significant changes in our faculty or student numbers, our class sizes, or our finances, the rankings' producers created a mad scramble in rank order [...data...]. Then there is \"Financial resources,\" where Stanford dropped from #6 to #9, Harvard from #5 to #7. Our resources did not fall; did other institutions' rise so sharply? I infer that, in each case, the formulas were simply changed, with notification to no one, not even your readers, who are left to assume that some schools have suddenly soared, others precipitously plummeted.\n\n\n"}

Known for his Lewis and Clark studies, he is the author of \"In Full View.\" After careful study of the expedition's journals and of the geography of the Columbia River estuary, Ziak discovered the previously unknown fact that from November 7, 1805 to December 6, the Lewis and Clark expedition stayed in what is now Pacific County, along the Long Beach Peninsula. This finding took six years for Ziak to piece together, using the comments in the expedition's journals to find the locations the explorers stopped at on their trip. A controversy arose between Oregon, long considered the end of the expedition, and Washington's historians over Ziak's findings, with many historians in Washington and elsewhere supporting his discovery and many in Oregon opposing it. In 1999, soon after his announcement, Ziak and David Nicandri, director of the Washington State Historical Society, began petitioning to give the newly found ending location, a camping spot called Station Camp, National Landmark Status. In addition, that year, US Representative Brian Baird had an amendment passed that changed the \"federal designation of the Lewis and CLark National Historic Trail as ending not in Oregon but in Oregon and Washington.\"\n\nIn 2004, Ziak testified before Congress in support of the Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks.\nThe next year he published a fold-out map and guide to the route taken by the expedition.\n\nAs a documentarian and cinematographer, his work under assignment from ABC Television received an Emmy in 1993 for cinematography in the documentary \"Tall Ship: High Sea Adventure\". He was also involved in the filming of the 2003 Discovery Channel documentary, \"Marine Corps Survival School\", where Ziak had to film at \"high altitudes and in low temperatures\" in the Sierra Nevada. As a local activist and regional historian, he has served as a consultant to the City of Long Beach and as a board member of the Pacific County Friends of Lewis and Clark.

Some secondary schools can provide both lower secondary education and upper secondary education (levels 2 and 3 of the ISCED scale), but these can also be provided in separate schools, as in the American middle school- high school system.\n\nSecondary schools typically follow on from primary schools and lead into vocational and tertiary education. Attendance is compulsory in most countries for students between the ages of 11 and 16. The organisations, buildings, and terminology are more or less unique in each country.\n\nWithin the English speaking world, there are three widely used systems to describe the age of the child. The first is the 'equivalent ages', then countries that base their education systems on the 'English model' use one of two methods to identify the year group, while countries that base their systems on the 'American K-12 model' refer to their year groups as 'grades'. This terminology extends into research literature. Below is a convenient comparison \n\nSchool building design does not happen in isolation. The building (or school campus) needs to accommodate:\nEach country will have a different education system and priorities.\n\nSchools need to accommodate students, staff, storage, mechanical and electrical systems, storage, support staff, ancillary staff and administration. The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.\n\nAccording to standards used in the United Kingdom, a general classroom for 30 students needs to be 55 m², or more generously 62 m². A general art room for 30 students needs to be 83 m², but 104 m² for 3D textile work. A drama studio or a specialist science laboratory for 30 needs to be 90 m². Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 1,200 place secondary (practical specialism). and 1,850 place secondary school.\n\nThe building providing the education has to fulfil the needs of: The students, the teachers, the non-teaching support staff, the administrators and the community. It has to meet general government building guidelines, health requirements, minimal functional requirements for classrooms, toilets and showers, electricity and services, preparation and storage of textbooks and basic teaching aids.\n\nAn optimum secondary school will meet the minimum conditions and will have:\n\n\nGovernment accountants having read the advice then publish minimum guidelines on schools. These enable environmental modelling and establishing building costs. Future design plans are audited to ensure that these standards are met but not exceeded. Government ministries continue to press for the 'minimum' space and cost standards to be reduced.\n\nThe UK government published this downwardly revised space formula in 2014. It said the floor area should be 1050m² (+ 350m² if there is a sixth form) + 6.3m²/pupil place for 11- to 16-year-olds + 7m²/pupil place for post-16s. The external finishes were to be downgraded to meet a build cost of £1113/m².\n\nA secondary school locally may be called high school or senior high school. In some countries there are two phases to secondary education (ISCED 2) and (ISCED 3), here the junior high school, intermediate school, lower secondary school, or middle school occurs between the primary school (ISCED 1) and high school.\n\n"}

Deutsch is also a theoretical physicist at Oxford University.\n\nTCS begins with the observation that most traditional interactions between adults and youth are based on coercion. The TCS model of parenting and education rejects this coercion as infringing on the will of the child, and also rejects parental or educator \"self-sacrifice\" as infringing on the will of the adult. TCS advocates that parents and children work to find a common preference, a solution all parties genuinely prefer to all other candidate solutions they can think of.\n\nThe TCS philosophy was inspired by the epistemology of Karl Popper. Popper was a professional educator himself before he started to do philosophy. In fact, philosophy was only a second option for him at that time, to be able to emigrate to escape the imminent Anschluss. He was active in the \"Wiener Schulreform\" (Vienna school reform) movement, and there are connections between the psychology of learning, on which he did his doctoral thesis, and his philosophy. However, as a philosopher, he did not advocate any concrete pedagogy, although he had some general views on the issue. TCS views Popper's epistemology, as did Popper, as a universal theory of how knowledge grows, and tries to work out its profound implications for educational theory.\n\n"}

It was commissioned by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1960 and the report was published in February 1962 with an introduction by William Holford, then President of the Institute. Running to more than 250 pages, the report examined architectural education, fees and salaries, and management and technical competence. It was based on extensive fieldwork including a questionnaire survey and visits to nearly 70 architects' offices of various kinds. Funding of slightly more than £11,000 was provided for the study by the Leverhulme Trust. \n\nAccording to Frank Duffy, in his book \"Architectural Knowledge: the Idea of a Profession\", the study stands as one of the best studies of a profession ever carried out anywhere in the world (page 173). Duffy considers that the study did much to reform architectural practices in Britain, particularly by contributing to the development of the RIBA Plan of Work, a set of discrete stages of the architect's work from inception to completion. As well as each stage being precisely described, the stages also had a precise fraction of the total architect's fee associated with them. However, as Duffy also comments, the identification of the usual work pattern as 'normal services' also implied that many activities known as 'other services' (management, surveying, engineering) lay outside the work of the architect, and architects lost market share as a consequence of such exclusivity (page 179).\n"}

The organization is also known as Gardeners of America (TGOA) or Men’s Garden Clubs of America (MGCA). It has its headquarters in Johnston, Iowa, a business suburb of Des Moines. It is a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of Illinois, and registered with the IRS as a 501(c)3 non-profit group. Most clubs include men and women members, and concentrate on gardening education (for members and nonmembers), and community beautification and enhancement. At one time the organization had about 10,000 members.\n\nThe Men's Garden Clubs of America organization was founded in 1932, and grew rapidly as a unique organization of male gardeners. By 1993 the organization had grown greatly, and the bylaws were changed. The organization became The Gardeners of America with two divisions: The Gardeners of America and Men’s Garden Clubs of America. While local clubs may feel more closely affiliated with one division, all are members of TGOA/MGCA. Today many clubs include both men and women, although some all-male clubs still exist.\n\nThe mission statement of TGOA/MGCA as stated on the organization website is\n\nThe mission of TGOA/MGCA is to promote gardening education and related environmental issues to its membership and the gardening public through charitable, educational and scientific means.\n\nIt works towards this objective by providing activities that help member clubs develop and publicize new or improved gardening techniques. People living in a location without local garden clubs can become a member-at-large and participate in TGOA/MGCA programs. TGOA/MGCA operates in partnership with the American Horticultural Society, and optional membership in AHS includes the publication The American Gardener, which cites TGOA/MGCA activities.\n\nTGOA/MGCA is listed as a gardening resource on various websites.\n\nIn addition to the programs and projects of local garden clubs, TGOA/MGCA sponsors the following national programs.\n\n\nBotanist Liberty Hyde Bailey was awarded the first Johnny Appleseed Memorial Medal by Men's Garden Clubs of America in 1948.\n\nAffiliated clubs are located across the United States, with most located in mid-America.

Many garden club websites specifically cite their club's current or past affiliation with TGOA/MGCA.\n\nSometimes affiliation with TGOA/MGCA leads to the formation of a more narrowly focused garden club, as is the case with the Corvallis Rose Society.\n\nClub members engage in a wide range of activities. The table that follows shows conservative estimates of total annual contributions made by all TGOA/MGCA clubs to their communities. This information is based on a 2007 survey where 45% of member clubs responded.\n\nThere are several occasions when members gather into groups on a regular basis: local club meetings, regional meetings, national planning and business meetings, and national conventions.\n\nArrangements for local club meetings vary based on the needs of individual clubs and their communities, but they generally are held monthly, and include an educational program on gardening techniques, community enhancement, or other topics.

The fellowship is intended for students under the age of 23 and offers them a total of $100,000 over two years, as well as guidance and other resources, to drop out of school and pursue other work, which could involve scientific research, creating a startup, or working on a social movement. Selection for the fellowship is through a competitive annual process, with about 20–25 fellows selected annually. It has a selection rate below 1%.\n\nPeter Thiel announced the fellowship at TechCrunch Disrupt in September 2010. The first round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2010, was announced in May 2011. The second round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2011, was announced in June 2012. The third class (announced in May 2013) includes 22 fellows working on projects from garment manufacturing and B2B web products to ARM powered servers and biomedicine. The class includes 7 fellows from outside of the US. In December 2013, Lora Kolodny wrote an article for the \"Wall Street Journal\" reviewing the Thiel Fellowship, where she wrote: \"64 Thiel Fellows have started 67 for-profit ventures, raised $55.4 million in angel and venture funding, published two books, created 30 apps and 135 full-time jobs, and brought clean water and solar power to 6,000 Kenyans who needed it.\" The 2014 Thiel Fellows were announced in June 2014.\n\nNotable recipients include: \n\nThe Thiel Fellowship launched a website called \"20 Under 20 Documentary Series\" that features an online documentary series of four Thiel Fellowship recipients. The students featured in the series are Laura Deming, Chris Rueth, Sujay Tyle, and Alex Kiselev.\n\nThiel's announcement of the Thiel Fellowship met with a diverse array of responses. Some, such as Jacob Weisberg, criticized Thiel's proposal for its utopianism and attack on the importance of education. Others, such as Vivek Wadhwa, expressed skepticism about whether the success or failure of the Thiel Fellowship would carry any broader lessons regarding the value of higher education or the wisdom of dropping out.\n\nIn May 2011, shortly after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, the admissions office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology congratulated two MIT students for receiving the Thiel Fellowship. Both students would need to drop out of MIT to receive the fellowship, but would be able to return to MIT to resume their studies after completing the two-year term of the fellowship if they so desired.\n\nA year after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, opinions on the program ranged from the skeptical and critical to the laudatory and optimistic, as seen in the answers to a Quora question about the achievements of the first batch of Thiel Fellows.\n\nEric Markowitz offered a mixed review of the Thiel Fellowship in \"Inc.\" magazine.\n\nIn April 2013, an article by Richard Nieva for \"PandoDaily\" took a close look at how the first batch of Thiel Fellows had fared.\n\nThe Thiel Fellowship aimed to remove the gender diversity gap.\n\nA Quora question asked in 2013 about the final results for the Thiel fellows had received one response as of September 2013, attempting to trace each of the Thiel Fellows.\n\nIn September 2013, Vivek Wadhwa wrote that the Thiel Fellowship had failed to produce any notable successes to date, and even its limited successes were instances where the Thiel Fellows were working in collaboration with more experienced individuals.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, former Harvard University President Larry Summers was reported as having said at the Nantucket Project conference: \"I think the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade is Peter Thiel's special program to bribe people to drop out of college.\" His remarks were reported on by many media outlets, ranging from \"TechCrunch\" to Valleywag. On October 13, \"TechCrunch\" published a response to Summers co-written by a Thiel Fellow and a mentor for the Thiel Fellowship program.\n\nIn late December 2013, Thiel Fellow Delian Asparouhov published a lengthy article giving advice on how to select a project and present it to maximize one's chances with the Thiel Fellowship application.\n\n"}

His publishing record based on work purportedly made over 20 years consisting of more than 400 research papers came under scrutiny after an Australian geologist, John Talent, researched his claims and work for nearly nine years so as to make a clear case of fraud. The discovery of the fraud began with John Pickett and John Talent who visited a road cut site in Nepal where Gupta had reported prolific numbers of Devonian conodont fossils. They found no fossils at nearly all the twenty sites he had mentioned but they found one site which yielded a fossil of a Silurian age. They subsequently chanced on his use of the same image in two papers and initially considered the possibility of error by adding the wrong photograph. A more detailed examination showed them that Gupta had used illustrations of fossils that were similar to specimens collected near New York by George Hinde in 1879. They interviewed coauthors, talked to Gupta on several occasions and made a detailed accusation on the wilful nature and scale of fraud after nine years of research. Gupta attempted to respond to the claims by noting the credentials of his coworkers.\n\nThe case unravelled with several co-workers realizing that they had been misled and having assumed good faith with a colleague and overlooked obvious contradictions and paradoxical results arising from assuming that Gupta had collected the fossils where he claimed they had been found. A range of other malpractices were also reported including the reuse of specimens which were claimed from various locations, the use of a specimen that was found missing elsewhere and plagiarism of images.\n\nJohn Talent received death threats from Gupta. In an interview to ABC he went on record to note that a technician in Gupta's department who threatened to reveal details of the fraud was reportedly killed in hit-and-run accident. Talent reported that Gupta had offered money to hitmen to inflict injury on his enemies. The aged mother of one of the Indian co-authors of the report by Talent published by the Senckenberg Museum was hit in a road accident and was seriously injured and broke several ribs.\n\nA four-year enquiry was conducted and Gupta was suspended from the post of director of the Institute of Paleontology at the Panjab University in Chandigarh but reinstated subsequently following a court order and retired \"normally\" with super-annuation benefits in 2002.\n\n"}
