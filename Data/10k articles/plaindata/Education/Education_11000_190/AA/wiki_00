This was the first national conference focusing on issues pertaining to black female scholars. It was held 100 years after the National Federation of Negro Women met in Boston to create a national organization focusing on Black women's issues and to protest the popular image of Black womanhood in the press. The outcome of that meeting was the creation of the National Federation of Afro-American Women.\n\nThe 1994 conference was organized by Robin W. Kilson, MIT professor of history and women's studies, and Evelynn M. Hammonds, MIT professor of the history of science. The conference was inspired by Kilson's \"personal frustration through the sense of isolation as a black woman\" in higher education. The conference served as a large public forum of Black women academics to discuss issues of research, success and lack thereof in academia, and the repressive political climate of the 1980s and 1990s. About 1,500 black women scholars attended from across the U.S., ranging from undergraduates to professors to college presidents. It was sponsored by MIT, Wellesley College and Radcliffe College, as well as other foundations.\n\nThe conference featured three keynote speakers: Lani Guinier from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Dr. Johnnetta B. Cole, president of Spelman College; and Professor Angela Davis of the University of California Santa Cruz. Guinier, who had recently been withdrawn from nomination for assistant attorney general by President Bill Clinton, gave an opening speech to three standing ovations, stating that \"what was happening to me was a metaphor for the experiences of many women of color\". Davis gave the closing speech, arguing the importance of standing up for all black women in the public eye. \"While courageous people fought to make the walls of academia less impenetrable, these very victories have spawned new problems and foreshadow new troubles\", she said.\n\nThe conference also featured over 100 panels, talks, and posters on topics ranging from black women in film and literature, to race and gender politics in academic culture, to specialized research in various topics performed by black female scholars. Vinie Burrows, performance artist, presented “Sister, Sister,” her one-woman show.\n\nAt the conference, attendants drafted an appeal to President Clinton, asking him to \"commission a blue-ribbon panel on race relations; to promote black women's research and extend the Glass Ceiling Commission to address the women of color in academia; to extend funding for community-based social service organizations for the poor; to end covert actions against Haiti and restore President Aristide to power, and to continue to support democracy in South and Southern Africa.\"\n"}

{"id": "6172005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6172005", "title": "Computer bridge", "text": "Computer bridge\n\nComputer bridge is the playing of the game contract bridge using computer software. After years of limited progress, since around the end of the 20th century the field of computer bridge has made major advances. In 1996 the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) established an official World Computer-Bridge Championship, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in Albuquerque. Since 1999 the event has been conducted as a joint activity of the American Contract Bridge League and the World Bridge Federation. Alvin Levy, ACBL Board member, initiated this championship and has coordinated the event annually since its inception. The event history, articles and publications, analysis, and playing records can be found at the official website.\n\nThe World Computer-Bridge Championship is typically played as a round robin followed by a knock-out between the top four contestants. Winners of the annual event are:\n\n\nIn Zia Mahmood's book, \"Bridge, My Way\" (1992), Zia offered a £1 million bet that no four-person team of his choosing would be beaten by a computer. A few years later the bridge program \"GIB\", brainchild of American computer scientist Matthew Ginsberg, proved capable of expert declarer plays like winkle squeezes in play tests. In 1996, Zia withdrew his bet. Two years later, \"GIB\" became the world champion in computer bridge, and also had a 12th place score (11210) in declarer play compared to 34 of the top humans in the 1998 Par Contest (including Zia Mahmood). However, such a par contest measures technical bridge analysis skills only, and in 1999 Zia beat various computer programs, including \"GIB\", in an individual round robin match.\n\nFurther progress in the field of computer bridge has resulted in stronger bridge playing programs, including \"Jack\" and \"Wbridge5\". These programs have been ranked highly in national bridge rankings. A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine \"IMP\" describes matches between five-time computer bridge world champion \"Jack\" and seven top Dutch pairs including a Bermuda Bowl winner and two reigning European champions. A total of 196 boards were played. \"Jack\" defeated three out of the seven pairs (including the European champions). Overall, the program lost by a small margin (359 versus 385 IMPs).\n\nBridge poses challenges to its players that are different from board games such as chess and go. Most notably, bridge is a stochastic game of incomplete information. At the start of a deal, the information available to each player is limited to just his/her own cards. During the bidding and the subsequent play, more information becomes available via the bidding of the other three players at the table, the cards of the partner of the declarer (the dummy) being put open on the table, and the cards played at each trick. However, it is only at the end of the play that full information is obtained.\n\nToday's top-level bridge programs deal with this probabilistic nature by generating many samples representing the unknown hands. Each sample is generated at random, but constrained to be compatible with all information available so far from the bidding and the play. Next, the result of different lines of play are tested against optimal defense for each sample. This testing is done using a so-called \"double-dummy solver\" that uses extensive search algorithms to determine the optimum line of play for both parties. The line of play that generates the best score averaged over all samples is selected as the optimal play.\n\nEfficient double-dummy solvers are key to successful bridge-playing programs. Also, as the amount of computation increases with sample size, techniques such as importance sampling are used to generate sets of samples that are of minimum size but still representative.\n\nWhile bridge is a game of incomplete information, a double-dummy solver analyses a simplified version of the game where there is perfect information; the bidding is ignored, the contract (trump suit and declarer) is given, and all players are assumed to know all cards from the very start. The solver can therefore use many of the game tree search techniques typically used in solving two-player perfect-information win/lose/draw games such as chess, go and reversi. However, there are some significant differences.\n\n\n\nIn comparison to computer chess, computer bridge has not reached world-class level, but the top robots have demonstrated a consistently high level of play. (See analysis of the last few years of play at www.computerbridge.com.) However see below the Philippe Pionchon's article (1984). Yet, whereas computer chess has taught programmers little about building machines that offer human-like intelligence, more intuitive and probabilistic games such as bridge might provide a better testing ground.\n\nThe question of whether bridge-playing programs will reach world-class level in the foreseeable future is not easy to answer. Computer bridge has not attracted an amount of interest anywhere near to that of computer chess. On the other hand, much progress has been made in the last decade by researchers working in the field.\n\nRegardless of bridge robots' level of play, computer bridge already has changed the analysis of the game. Commercially available double-dummy programs can solve bridge problems in which all four hands are known, typically within a fraction of a second. These days, few editors of books and magazines will solely rely on humans to analyse bridge problems before publications. Also, more and more bridge players and coaches utilize computer analysis in the \"post-mortem\" of a match.\n\n\n"}

The core activity of the community is conducting examinations of doctoral and habilitation (higher doctorate) theses defended in Russian scientific and educational institutions since the end of the 1990s, and making the results of such examinations known to as many people as possible. The community is composed of professional scientists working in various fields of science both in Russia and abroad, and also journalists, civil activists and volunteers.\n\nLaunched in early 2013, the project had by 2016 identified around 5,600 suspected plagiarists — focusing on officials in government and academia, and other member the country's elite — and released reports on around 1,300 of them. Russian media regularly report on Dissernet's findings, and the site has been credited with raising attention for the issue of academic fraud in the country. In a 2016 exposé, Dissernet showed that 1 in 9 members of the State Duma had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.\n\nThe objective of Dissernet’s examinations is to detect gross and deliberate violations of the legally established rules for certification of scientific workers’, as well as violations of the regulations for awarding academic degrees. Dissernet deems theses containing such violations to be fraudulent, and diplomas certifying the doctoral and higher doctoral degrees conferred after defending such theses to be illegal and subject to cancellation.\n\nThe key elements of the dissertation fraud detected in the course of Dissernet’s analyses are as follows:\n\n\nWithin the active phase of Dissernet’s activity, which started in January 2013, its members have published results of examinations of thesis defended by scores of well-known and powerful Russian politicians and public figures. As of the middle of the year 2014, more than 2000 completed expertises of Doctoral and higher doctoral theses in various directions and branches of science were contained in Dissernet database. Among the people attracting Dissernet’s attention were deputies of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council, governors of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, high-ranking officials of executive authorities, heads of security and military services, etc.\n\nThe work of the Dissernet community has gained much publicity and has been broadly covered in Russian and foreign mass media.\nThe result of the research performed by the Monitoring Center Public.Ru (more than 7500 federal and regional social and political and business printed matters, Internet mass media, news feeds of Press agencies, programs of central TV- and radio-channels have been analysed) showed that at 2013 year-end the word \"Dissernet\" was accepted as third by popularity neologism of the year, after the words \"Euromaidan\" and \"titushky\". Also the magazine \"Russian Reporter\" mentioned Dissernet’s work among the most notable milestones of the year 2013, and the Internet edition \"The Village\" published an article about Dissernet in the dictionary \"Summaries of 2013: main words and phrases of the outgoing year\".\n\nThe magazine \"Kommersant\", while listing in its concluding issue the major cultural and social events of the 2013, devoted a separate article to Dissernet’s struggle with falsifications and plagiarism.\n\nThe \"Dissernet Manifest\", which was developed and agreed upon in June–July 2013, contains the declaration of the organizers and members about the basic objectives, tasks and principles of joint activity of the community members:\n\n“Dissernet” is a networking community of experts, researchers and reporters seeking to unmask swindlers, forgers and liars. With their joint efforts based on the use of modern computer technologies and principles of networking division of labor, the community members oppose abusive practices, machinations and falsifications in the fields of scientific research and education, in particular in the process of defending theses and awarding academic degrees in Russia. The analytical work and disclosures of Dissernet equally cover various categories of Russian citizens:\n\n\nThe Dissernet members act on a voluntary basis, on their own initiative and without any outside pressure.

Patrick Klug, founder of Greenheart Games, knowing that the game was likely to be torrented extensively, purposely released a cracked version of the game and uploaded it himself to torrent sites. Gameplay in this version is identical except for one variation, as players progress through the game they receive the following message:\n\nEventually players of the cracked version will gradually lose money until they do go bankrupt, as a result of pirates. News site Ars Technica reported that some players complained on message forums about this piracy feature, unaware that it only appeared because they themselves pirated the game.\n\nThe player starts out in a garage in the early 1980s during the golden age of arcade video games with no employees, limited money, and limited choices for the first game. As new games are created, new options are unlocked. When the first game engine is built, the player's game development skills improve. New consoles will also be released, and the player will be able to buy licenses for certain consoles, such as the GS, PlaySystem, mBox, and grPad which parody real life consoles and devices with different names due to trademark regulations. As the player progresses through the game further they have the opportunity to move to new offices and hire staff. After that further expansion is available, with players given the opportunity to open an R&D lab when reaching certain requirements that host major projects, allowing the player to unlock things they wouldn't be able to otherwise, such as MMOs and online game shops similar to Steam, Uplay, App Store etc. The player may also open up a Hardware Lab to create consoles and devices.\n\n\"Game Dev Tycoon\" received varied reviews upon release. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the game a score of 68 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Besides the mixed reviews on Metacritic, on the Steam Community, the game received a 95%, based on over 20,000 reviews.

She is the 9th President of Guilford College as of April 15, 2014. \n\nFernandes was raised in Worcester and is the daughter of Richard Paul and Mary Kathleen (nee Cosgrove) Kelleher. Her family chose to raise her in an oral education program, meaning her education focused on teaching her to speak. Her mother was deaf and was raised orally, as well. When Fernandes grew older she made the decision to learn American Sign Language (ASL) and develop her involvement with the deaf community.\n\nFernandes attended Trinity College, earning a B.A. degree in French and comparative literature, and the University of Iowa, where she earned her M.A. and Ph. D., both in comparative literature.\n\nAfter graduating from Iowa, she worked for Northeastern University before coming to Gallaudet as chair of Sign Communication. Her next move was to Hawaii where she established an Interpreter Training Program and served for five years as the director of the Hawaii School for the Deaf and the Blind. On April 15, 2014, Fernandes was named the 9th President of Guilford College. She succeeded Kent Chabotar on July 1, 2014, becoming the first woman to hold this position. On August 26, 2015, Fernandes was formally inaugurated as the first female and the ninth president of Guilford College. \n\nIn 1995 she returned to Gallaudet to become the vice president for the Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center. In 2000, she was named provost of the university by President I. King Jordan, who appointed her without consulting the faculty, a move which Jordan called \"a terrible mistake\".\n\nFernandes in her application for the university presidency wrote:\n\nImmediately after the announcement of the appointment of Fernandes as Gallaudet University president, scores of students protested against her appointment. According to \"The Washington Post\", \"Students objected to the appointment of Jane Fernandes, who is deaf and is currently the university's provost, because she did not grow up using American Sign Language. Some students also criticized Fernandes for not having warm relations with students.\" Opponents of Fernandes claim that the \"Washington Post\" article (and, in general, much of the media coverage), were unable to figure out the real reasons for their opposition, although a frequently published reason was that she was \"not Deaf enough.\" The protesters pointed to her past managerial actions that they felt were questionable and did not reflect qualities of a solid leader. Fernandes also attracted opposition due to a perception that she was insufficiently committed to addressing the problem of audism (discrimination against or persecution of anyone based on hearing status). The student paper took polls a few days before the selection. Of those faculty members who responded, 36% gave Fernandes an \"acceptable\" rating, compared to 53% and 64% for the two other finalists. On October 29, 2006, the Board of Trustees of Gallaudet University rescinded her contract to be the ninth President of Gallaudet and terminated her in her position as President-designate.\n\n"}

An independent, non-denominational day school, it offers modern facilities in a well-maintained traditional setting. The school has ample play and green spaces, as well as an adjacent park, and currently serves some 200 students.\n\nLandakotskóli follows the National Icelandic Curriculum with an emphasis on mathematics, languages, arts and an innovative art curriculum. Its academic record is strong based on a longstanding tradition of outstanding results. The school's International Department follows the Cambridge Curriculum developed by the University of Cambridge. The program covers the key core subject areas of English, mathematics and science. This curriculum provides continuous and flexible assessment to suit each learner's needs, as well as standardized assessment at each milestone in a student's educational career.\n\nThe school's new (established 2015–16) international department was inspired by the increasing diversity of the school's student body and the city's need for an international program to meet the needs of Iceland's expatriate business, diplomatic and academic community; families temporarily resident in Iceland; students returning from abroad who wish to continue their studies in English; and Icelandic families seeking global perspectives in education. The school has a strong academic record, based on a longstanding tradition of outstanding results in national examinations, and an emphasis on foreign languages and an innovative arts curriculum, provide a solid foundation on which to develop an international program.\n\nWhile core subjects are taught in separate classrooms, students in the International Department are fully integrated into Landakotsskóli student life. They study alongside their peers in the Icelandic program in art, dance, drama, gym, swimming, technology and woodworking. This gives international students and their families a unique opportunity to integrate into the life of the local community and deepen their experience of living in the country, at the same time enabling them to seamlessly continue their education using a global, English-language curriculum.\n\nIn addition to core subjects, arts and sports, the Department offers many other activities such as STEM, Lego Robotics, computer programming, Chinese, drama, music and chess.\n\nMAP (Measures of Academic Progress) from the Northweast Evaluation Association is a powerful assessment tool engineered to adapt to each student´s learning level and provide a holistic picture of his/her academic progress and growth.\n\nIn 2006, the United States Embassy presented 110 English language books to the school.

It established the Bengal National College and Bengal Institute which would later merge to form Jadavpur University. Institutions functioning under the Council were considered to be hotbeds of swadeshi activities and the government banned nationalistic activities such as the singing of patriotic songs.\n\nUniversity of Calcutta One of the three universities in modern India, set up by the British in Calcutta in 1861 as a means of spreading western philosophical thought among the elite in India. Towards the end of the 19th century, a strong nationalist movement and identity arose within the Indian subcontinent, which was particularly prominent in Bengal, which by the start of 1900 had seen the beginnings of the \"Swadeshi\" movement, which drew a substantial contribution from the youth of Bengal. Leading nationalists saw the Calcutta University as a predominantly a Western Institution. Its focus on Western Themed philosophy and humanities at the expense of Indian ones, and the large number of ICS and administrative officers from amongst its graduates were seen to form the bulwark of British colonialism, and the Calcutta University came to be termed \"Goldighir Ghulamkhana\" (the slavehouse by the lake, with reference to a lake beside which the university was situated).\n\nSatish Chandra Mukherjee, a Bengali Indianteacher who taught in the South Calcutta suburb of Bhowanipore, set up in 1895 the \"Bhagabat Chatushpati\". This institute promoted history and understandings of Indian religions and philosophy. In 1897 he founded the \"Dawn\" Magazine and in 1902, Mukherjee founded the \"Dawn society\". Through his society and magazine, Mukherjee promulgated Indian philosophies and teachings, and criticised the Calcutta University's syllabus for its lack of emphasis on what he believed to be necessary for nation building. Mukherjee's work, in the nascent nationalist sentiments, found support among leading luminaries of Bengal at the time. Soon, the \"Dawn society\" was calling for nationalist education with emphasis on sciences and focus towards Indian values.\n\nLord Curzon had introduced the Universities act, 1904, much to the chargin of the native populace of Bengal who saw this as a means to limit access to English educational institutions from the native populations. The government also decided to disaffiliate many private Indian colleges, which had come up lately and were regarded by the Government as hot beds of nationalist agitation. The measures stirred the educated middle class to move for alternative systems of education.\nThe real impetus though was provided by the partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-General of India, into East Bengal on the one hand (the area that was eventually to become Bangladesh in 1971) and West Bengal and Odisha on the other. The young men of Bengal were amongst the most active in the \"Swadeshi\" movement, and the participation of university students drew the ire of the Raj. R.W. Carlyle prohibited the participation of students in political meetings on the threat of withdrawal of funding and grants. The decade preceding these decrees had seen Bengali intellectuals increasingly calling for indigenous schools and colleges to replace British institutions.\n\nOn 16 November 1905, the Landholders Society organized a meeting at Park Street, attended by around 1500 delegates, including Rabindranath Tagore, Aurobindo Ghosh, Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick and Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury. The idea of the National Council of Education was mooted here. While in a meeting held on 9 November 1905 at the Field and Academic Club, Subodh Chandra Mullick pledged Rupees one lakh for the foundation of a National University in Bengal. The objective in setting up the institution that was to challenge the British rule over education by offering education to the masses 'on national lines and under national control'. Generous sums of money were also donated by Brojendra Kishore Roy Choudhury, Maharaja Suryya Kanto Acharya Choudhury and Rashbihari Ghosh, who was appointed the first president of the university. Aurobindo served as the first Principal of the college. The organisation in its early days was intricately associated with the nascent revolutionary nationalism in Bengal at the time. It was during his time as Principal that Aurobindo started his nationalist publications \"Jugantar\", \"Karmayogin\" and \"Bande Mataram\". The Student's mess at the College was frequented by students of East Bengal who belonged to the Dhaka branch of the Anushilan Samiti, and was known to be hotbed of revolutionary nationalism, which was uncontrolled or even encouraged by the college.\n"}

The Government's total investment in the NLN totalled £156 million over a five-year period.\n\nAlthough the network itself is no longer operational, the main output of the initiative − the NLN Materials − continue to represent one of the most substantial and wide-ranging collections of e-learning materials in the UK.

This government-funded project resulted in three main developments:\n\n\nFour rounds of interactive learning materials were commissioned and authored under the NLN banner, covering a wide range of academic and vocational topics. The last body of work − Round 4, adding to the 800 hours of materials already available, was aimed at the Adult and Community Learning sector, covering four main topics: \"Family Learning\", \"English for Speakers of Other Languages\", \"Learning to Learn\", and \"Making Learning Work for You\". These materials were made available from winter 2005. Round 1 and 2 of the materials were substantially updated during April to July 2006.\n\nThe materials are designed to be used in a variety of formats and delivery platforms, including within a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). To facilitate this, all NLN materials have been packaged as Scorm Learning Objects, with metadata. Most of the LOs can be disaggregated into multiple Shareable Content Objects, and to varying degrees modified and repurposed by practitioners. In total, the NLN Materials consist of 2251 Learning Objects, 800 hours of learning, and have been used in around a third of UK FE institutions, as well as commercial and offender learning contexts.\n\nXtensis ltd. originally took a consultancy role in the project, gradually increasing their role to hosting the materials to practitioners in the ACL sector, then to all sectors, also introducing a download format that includes a navigational wrapper allowing the materials to be distributed and used on CD/DVD/intranet, while still being valid Scorm Content Packages.\n\nAlthough most of the institutions involved in their creation have since been disbanded, the materials are still well used. Since 2015, authority of the NLN Materials service has passed to the Education and Training Foundation, with the materials hosted within Xtensis' social bookmarking site XtLearn.net which still allows direct access and independent download, but also enables mixing with other content sources from around the web into content collections.\n\n"}

These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons. Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.\n\nA great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions. This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions. Scenarios are something different. They focus the student on the interaction with patrons. In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.\n\nScenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start. Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer. Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand. Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide. This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?\n\n\n"}

The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access \"to books and reading, to information, and to information technology.\" A school library media center \"uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering.\" School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as \"learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school.\"\n\nResearchers have demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist, scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted in Ohio revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale in Australia in 2013.\n\nLibrary services to schools have evolved since the late 1800s from public or state library book wagons to informal classroom collections to what we know today.. The later part of the 19th century marked the beginning of the modern American library movement with the creation of the American Library Association (ALA) in 1876 by a group of librarians led by Melvil Dewey. At these beginning stages of development, the school libraries were primarily made up of small collections with the school librarian playing primarily a clerical role.\n\nDewey wrote that \"a broad conception at the end of the century of the work of the schools is simply this, to teach the children to think accurately, with strength and with speed. If it is in the school that they get their start, then where do they get their education?\"\n\n1920 marked the first effort by the library and education communities to evaluate school libraries with the publication of the \"Certain Report\", which provided the first yardstick for evaluating school libraries.\n\nBy the 1940s, 40% of schools indicated the presence of classroom collections. Around 18% reported having centralized libraries. City schools reported 48% and rural schools reported 12%. School libraries experienced another major push following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, which forced the United States to re-evaluate its priorities for math and science education. NDEA was a response to Sputnik and Title III of NDEA provided financial assistance for strengthening science, mathematics, and modern foreign language . As a result, the 1960s were one of the greatest periods of growth and development for school libraries due to an increased flow of money and support from the private sector and public funding for education. Most notable during this time was the \"Knapp School Libraries Project\" which established model school library media centers across the country. Hundreds of new school libraries were expanded and renovated during this time.\n\nMost recently, school libraries have been defined by two major guidelines documents: \"Information Power\" (1988) and \"Information Power II\" (1998).\n\nGlobally important mission statement is the Unesco School library Manifesto , which states:\n\"The school library provides information and ideas that are fundamental to functioning successfully in today’s information and knowledge-based society. The school library equips students with life-long learning skills and develops the imagination, enabling them to live as responsible citizens\" (para. 1).\n\n\"School library media centers in the 21st century can, and should be, hubs for increased student achievement and positive focused school reform\"--Kathleen D. Smith \n\nThe school library exists to provide a range of learning opportunities for both large and small groups as well as individuals with a focus on intellectual content, information literacy, and the learner. In addition to classroom visits with collaborating teachers, the school library also serves as a learning space for students to do independent work, use computers, equipment and research materials; to host special events such as author visits and book clubs; and for tutoring and testing.\n\nSchool libraries function as a central location for all of the information available, and a school librarian functions as the literary map to the resources and materials found within the library.\n\nA school library functions as an opportunity for educators to work with librarians in support of a resource center for the students to be able to safely access the internet for both school work and interacting with each other. In her article, \"Tag! You're It!\": Playing on the Digital Playground, De las Casas discusses how today's youth is much more comfortable with technology than ever before, and believes that “We need to advocate for regulations and laws that support education of young people rather than simply limiting their access to the Web.”\n\nThe school library media center program is a collaborative venture in which school library media specialists, teachers, and administrators work together to provide opportunities for the social, cultural, and educational growth of students. Activities that are part of the school library media program can take place in the school library media center, the laboratory classroom, through the school, and via the school library's online resources.\n\nIn Australia school libraries have played a major role in the success of Reading Challenge programs initiated and funded by various State Governments.\n\nThe Premier's Reading Challenge in South Australia, launched by Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.\n\nSchool libraries are similar to public libraries in that they contain books, films, recorded sound, periodicals, realia, and digital media. These items are not only for the education, enjoyment, and entertainment of all members of the school community, but also to enhance and expand the school's curriculum.\n\nIn many schools, school libraries are staffed by librarians, teacher-librarians, or school library media specialists or media coordinators who hold a specific library science degree. In some jurisdictions, school librarians are required to have specific certification and/or a teaching certificate.\n\nThe school librarian performs four leadership main roles: teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. In the teacher role, the school librarian develops and implements curricula relating to information literacy and inquiry. School librarians may read to children, assist them in selecting books, and assist with schoolwork. Some school librarians see classes on a \"flexible schedule\". A flexible schedule means that rather than having students come to the library for instruction at a fixed time every week, the classroom teacher schedules library time when library skills or materials are needed as part of the classroom learning experience.\n\nIn the instructional partner role, school librarians collaborate with classroom teachers to create independent learners by fostering students' research, information literacy, technology, and critical thinking skills.\n\nAs information specialists, school librarians develop a resource base for the school by using the curriculum and student interests to identify and obtain library materials, organize and maintain the library collection in order to promote independent reading and lifelong learning. Materials in the library collection can be located using an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). Often these catalogs are web-based from which students can gain access both at school and from home.\n\nThis role also encompasses many activities relating to technology including the integration of resources in a variety of formats: periodical databases; Web sites; digital video segments; podcasts; blog and wiki content; digital images; virtual classrooms, etc. School librarians are often responsible for audio-visual equipment and are sometimes in charge of school computers and computer networks.\n\nMany school librarians also perform clerical duties. They handle the circulating and cataloging of materials, facilitate interlibrary loans, shelve materials, perform inventory, etc.\nNotable school librarians:\n\n\n\nEducational facilities\n"}

The organization's goals were to identify unnecessary barriers to research, craft policy guidelines and legal agreements to lower those barriers, and develop technology to make research data and materials easier to find and use. Its overarching goal was to speed the translation of data into discovery and thereby the value of research.\n\nScience Commons was located at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the Ray and Maria Stata Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nCreative Commons launched the Science Commons project in early 2005. The project sought to achieve for science what Creative Commons had achieved for the world of culture, art and educational material: to ease unnecessary legal and technical barriers to sharing, to promote innovation, and to provide easy, high quality tools that let individuals and organizations specify the terms under which they wished to share their material.\n\nIn 2009, Creative Commons terminated the Science Commons project.\n\nThe Biological Materials Transfer Project, a Material transfer agreement (MTA), developed and deployed standard, modular contracts to lower the costs of transferring biological materials such as DNA, cell lines, model animals and more. The MTA project covered transfer between non-profit institutions, as well as offering transaction solutions to transfers between non-profit entities and for-profit institutions. It integrated existing standard agreements and new Science Commons contracts into a Web-deployed suite, with the goal of developing a transaction system along the lines of Amazon or eBay by using the licensing as a discovery mechanism for materials. \n\nThis metadata driven approach is based on the success of the Creative Commons licensing integration into search engines, further allowing for and facilitating the integration of materials licensing into the research literature itself and databases. The hope being that scientists would eventually be only one click away from accessing and/or ordering the materials referenced in the scholarly literature as they perform their research. Unfortunately, the MTA project's tools were not adopted by more than a very small percentage of the scientific community while Science Commons was active and, for all practical purposes, died out when the Science Commons project folded.\n\nScience Commons’ Neurocommons project set out to create an Open Source knowledge management platform for biological research. The platform combined open access materials (making up the knowledgebase) and open source software (in the form of an analytic platform). The software was still under development when the project ended.\n\nThe Scholar’s Copyright was developed with Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition designed to lower the barriers to Open Access (OA) by reducing transaction costs and eliminating contract proliferation by offering tools and resources catering to both methods of achieving Open Access. The Scholar's Copyright Addendum is still in use by SPARC\n\nThe Science Commons Open Access Data Protocol was a method for ensuring that scientific databases can be legally integrated with one another. The protocol was not a license or legal tool, but instead a methodology and best practices document for creating such legal tools in the future, and marking data in the public domain for machine-assisted discovery.\n\n"}

The goal is to help the client maintain total abstinence or harm reduction from any addiction, and to establish healthy routines at home or after checking out of a residential treatment facility. Regulations do not exist for sober companions. A sober companion may be a part of a whole medical and/or a clinical team of professional(s), may be formally licensed as a mental health professional, or have well-respected experiential experience in the field and may work independently on their own.\n\nProtocols for a sober companion when working with a client, their family, and/or friends are established immediately. These may include a psychotherapeutic approach, 12-step or non-12 step plan, other outside support groups, help establishing nutrition and fitness daily, medication therapy, or holistic practices. \nThe primary duty of a sober coach is to ensure the recovering individual does not relapse. They may be hired to provide round the clock care, be on-call, or to accompany the recovering addict during certain activities.\n\nA companion acts as an advocate for the newly recovering person and provides new ways for the client to act in their own living environment. A sober companion either completely removes the addict from his own environment of hidden stashes, or may search for hidden drugs in that environment, in an effort to prevent a relapse. \n\nAn engagement with a sober companion usually lasts 30 days or longer. The time required to effect a meaningful change varies depending upon the client, co-occurring disorders, and life at home. Ethically, a companion's presence in the client's life will titrate down as the client's ability to connect to newly defined healthy behaviors with family, work, and legal issues without relapse is proven. Some recovery coaches stay with their clients for many months, and some offer only transportation services (for instance, to and from treatment facilities or sober living homes). The sober companion's duties vary from case to case, from simply ensuring the client remains abstinent, to establishing and ushering a specific plan of recovered resources and relationships into their home and community.\n\nSober companions are sometimes hired in cases where an actor or musician will not attend treatment, but must remain abstinent to complete a film or recording project. They are also depicted by some media outlets as \"adult babysitters\". Doctors may also refer to sober companions as \"advocates\" for actors, musicians, and other celebrities.\n\nThere has been controversy among sober companions over the use of drug replacement therapy and prescription drugs to ease withdrawal, cravings or other side effects of long-term narcotic and alcohol use. Sober companions are sometimes used as a replacement for residential addiction treatment or other forms of drug rehabilitation. Doug Caine, founder of Sober Champion, and Dr. Ronald J. Hunsicker, FACATA, National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers' president and chief executive officer, introduced an alternative perspective in mental health and addiction treatment programs. It was recommend that a combined approach be taken, particularly for people at high risk of relapse. Hunsicker's speech on “The Challenges for Implementing Evidence-Based Practices in Addiction Treatment\" suggested that companions can help a patient successfully transition from a heavily structured, secure environment into the world where he previously failed to stay sober. Other experts are skeptical of the companion approach and its dependence on a single individual.\n\nThere is currently no formal sober companion oversight and accountability, and no required formal training or qualification.\n\nThe television series \"Elementary\" depicts Watson as a female sober companion to a modern-day Sherlock Holmes.\n"}

The Dragonfly is designed for: aerial photography, interactive gaming, autonomous patrolling for security and surveillance, etc. It was to be manufactured by TechJect, but as of November 2015 the company did not expect to do so.\n\nDevelopment of the hobbyist version was funded via an Indiegogo campaign which ended on December 31, 2012 and raised $1.14 million. The initial deliveries were estimated to occur in July 2013 but prototypes were still being developed up until 2017. No actual units have been sent to backers.\n\nThe unit was envisioned as a miniaturized four-winged ornithopter which uses a flight model based on that of a dragonfly. It was the first palm sized miniaturized ornithopter to be prototyped to exhibit powerful actuation at small sizes, though other larger versions have been developed. (e.g., the DelFly ), the Dragonfly was the first to make use of multiple models, each customizable with multiple options, such as wifi connectivity.\n\nThe Dragonfly UAV built off the research done at Georgia Institute of Technology's Intelligent Control Systems Laboratory. That research resulted in Patent 9,290,268, filed in 2011 and granted in March 2016. The TectJect company, which spun off from the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, was to develop this technology into a reliable consumer product. After several major design changes and deviations from the original patent, no reliable solution was found.\n\nThe Dragonfly may be equipped with one of three different electronics packages. These could include the Marc-Basic, Marc-2, and Marc-3. Each is more capable than the preceding model, culminating in the Marc-3, which is equipped with approximately twenty different sensors. In addition, all models are planned to be built to have camera capability, including stereoscopic vision through dual cameras (available with the Marc-3). HD vision is optional. Power is planned to be provided from a single-cell Li-Po battery rated at 250mAh. The actuator system for the wings could be based on either magnetic solenoidal actuators (Alpha model - retired for now) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) for the Delta, Gamma, and Omega models. With a final goal weight of ~25g and a length of 6\", the micro UAV is expected to hover for ~8–10 minutes, with a hybrid flight time (hovering and fixed-wing gliding) of ~25–30 minutes. However, these specifications were announced at the beginning of the crowdfunding campaign and do not reflect any actual hardware.\n\nOn the third anniversary of the IndieGoGo campaign, TechJect released an update to backers stating that the company \"in no position to complete the Dragonfly project in our current condition without a helping hand (partners, additional funding or community support).\" TechJect has claimed that the project's failure was the result of a delay in the release of funding by PayPal and IndieGoGo. However, the design was much less mature than what was stated during the crowdfunding campaign, and significant time and money was spent finalizing the mechanical design and selecting appropriate materials. The team apologized to backers for what it termed \"our dismal approach to the finish line\".\n\n\"Crowdfund Insider\" has described the state of the project as \"road kill\" and \"dead in the water\". TechCrunch espoused the view that TechJect's pitch \"always seemed a bit far-fetched\", and cited it as \"the latest example of how consumers need to be more careful with crowdfunding\". Veckans Affärer described the Dragonfly as \"too good to be true\", and described it and Pirate3D's Buccaneer 3D printer as part of a trend of crowdfunding projects that had not delivered on their promises.\n\n"}

It was a popular text in medieval England, and is a very early example of a book intended for reading to children.\n\nHow the author and the addressee knew one another is unknown, though their families both farmed land within reach of Hertford Fair, held annually from 1226. In some manuscripts the text opens with a preface stating that the work is written for \"Madame Dyonise de Mountechensi\". In others the poem is preceded by a letter of dedication, addressed simply \"Chere suer\" (\"Dear sister\"), a phrase that expresses equality in their social relationship and some friendship between them. The letter continues: \"You have asked me to put in writing for your children a phrase book to teach them French.\" \n\nDionisie's name had been \"de Anesty\" until her marriage to Warin de Munchensi in 1234. From that date she had two young stepchildren, John and Joan de Munchensi (who were grandchildren of William Marshal) and she soon bore one child of her own, William. The book was perhaps written for Dionisie's marriage or soon after, and \"John, William and Joan probably learned their French\" from this book. Dionisie \"lacked the requisite fluency\" to make her children confident French-speakers but a knowledge of the language would be essential in the future careers of William, a turbulent politician, and especially Joan: she unexpectedly gained a \"very rich inheritance\" in 1247, and King Henry III chose her in the same year to marry his half-brother William of Valence.\n\nThe author's original intention was probably that the de Munchensi children would be looking at the text while Dionisie read it aloud. The poem, written in rhyming lines of irregular length (usually 7 or 8 syllables), presents a series of topics beginning with birth and childhood, listing plants, animals and animal cries, continuing through household tasks and farm work, including fishing, baking, brewing, house-building, ploughing and carting, and ending with a \"great feast\". An emphasis on learning to manage a household and an estate has been noted. The list of collective nouns for animals and the list of animal cries are the earliest sources for this special vocabulary in any European vernacular.\n\nIn all manuscripts many significant words in the French text are accompanied by English translations, written between the lines or in the margins. These glosses help to show that the book is intended for children whose first language is English and whose second language is to be French. A particular aim, according to the text, was that they should \"be better taught in speech and not made fun of by others\". \"The Treatise\" marks a turning point in the linguistic history of medieval England, showing that by its date English \"had already become the mother tongue of the children of the Anglo-Norman nobility, and that they learnt it before they were taught French.\" It is among the very earliest books in any language explicitly intended \"for children to hear and read\". It remained a popular text for two centuries, as shown both by the number of manuscripts in which it survives independently, and by its re-use as part of the 14th-century collection \"Femina Nova\", compiled for older students at a period when few English children learned French in their early years.\n\n\n"}

During the academic year 2013/2014 Trisakti University planned to implement the program amounted to 416 programs consisting of as many as 341 mono-discipline programs and multi-disciplinary program of 75 courses, or 115.2% of the plan, meaning there is an additional 15.2% as much as 55 activities. Lecturers involved in the implementation of the PKM program with a record number of 1.246 faculty lecturer can carry out more than one activity, while the number of students involved are 274 people.\n\nInstitute for Community Services is very responsive to emergency natural disasters that often occur in Jakarta, especially in Tambora Village, Bambu Utara Village, Tanjung Duren Utara Village, Jembatan Besi Village, Jati Pulo Village, Duri Pulo Village, Wijaya Kusuma Village, Jelambar Baru Village and Petojo Utara Village. In addition to regular PKM, there is also a working visit from Terengganu Malaysia University on 24–29 March 2014, chaired by Prof. Madya, Dr. Nur Azura Bt Sanusi.\n\nThe community service program is performed by students from various faculties / courses that exist in the scope Trisakti University in the form of Independent Business Class program - Science Applied Technology (KUM-ITT). In the academic year 2013/2014 KUM-ITT program has been implemented in six villages locations of three districts in Pandeglang, Banten. KUM-ITT program was attended by 135 students who have passed the selection. The number of programs that have been implemented in KUM- ITT are 144 programs include 10 programs Applicable Technology (TTG) and other programs in the fields of law, health, economic, environmental, social, physical, and others.\n\nOut of 77 multi-disciplinary programs, academic year 2013/2014 that work well and there is a link between the program with one another in terms of its integration in a multi-discipline in accordance with the substance of each well completion and management program implementation refers to the participation of technology.\n\nAt the international level, Community Services Institute cooperated with Colorado State University, especially in the field of Community Development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Muhammad Sapta Murti, Deputy for Legislations, Ministry of State Secretariat of RI\n\n• Rudy Hartono (Badminton)\n\n\nThe Trisakti shootings (Indonesian: Tragedi Trisakti [ˈtraɡədi triˈsaʔti], literally \"Trisakti Tragedy\") occurred at Trisakti University on 12 May 1998. At a demonstration demanding President Suharto's resignation, soldiers opened fire on unarmed protestors. Four students were killed and dozens more were injured. The shootings contributed to widespread student unrest and rioting during the Indonesian Revolution of 1998, which led to the resignation of President Suharto.\n\nThe Trisakti Museum was established in commemoration of the incident.\n\nIn June 1966, Trisakti University began using the symbol of a trident which was decided after holding a contest. The symbol is a refinement by Eko Purwoto, who was assigned to make improvements to the designs that came from the contest.\n\nThe trident logo covers:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "719152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=719152", "title": "University of the Philippines Los Baños", "text": "University of the Philippines Los Baños\n\nThe University of the Philippines Los Baños (also referred to as UPLB, UP Los Baños, or colloquially, Elbi) is a public research university located in the towns of Los Baños and Bay in the province of Laguna, some 64 kilometers southeast of Manila. It traces its roots to the UP College of Agriculture (UPCA), which was founded in 1909 by the American colonial government to promote agricultural education and research in the Philippines. American botanist Edwin Copeland served as its first dean. UPLB was formally established in 1972 following the union of UPCA with four other Los Baños and Diliman-based University of the Philippines (UP) units.\n\nThe university has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology due to its pioneering efforts in plant breeding and bioengineering, particularly in the development of high-yielding and pest-resistant crops. In recognition of its work, it was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding in 1977. Nine research centers are recognized as Centers of Excellence by presidential decree. UPLB hosts a number of local and international research centers, including the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, World Agroforestry Centre, and the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA).\n\nUPLB offers more than 100-degree programs in various disciplines through its nine colleges and two schools. As of Academic Year 2012–2013 the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has accredited nine academic units as Centers of Excellence and two as Centers of Development, giving UPLB the largest number of Centers of Excellence (research and academic units combined) among all universities in the country.\n\nUPLB alumni have been recognized in a wide range of fields. They include 13 scientists awarded the title National Scientist of the Philippines, members of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, the joint winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize), Palanca Award winners, as well as political and business leaders.\n\nUPLB was originally established as the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture (UPCA) on 6 March 1909, by the UP board of regents. Edwin Copeland, an American botanist and Thomasite from the Philippine Normal College in Manila, served as its first dean. Classes began in June 1909 with five professors, and 12 students initially enrolled in the program. The Forestry School was established a year later.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, UPCA was closed and the campus converted into an internment camp for allied nationals and a headquarters of the Japanese army. For three years, the college was home to more than 2,000 civilians, mostly Americans, that were captured by the Japanese. In 1945, as part of the liberation of the Philippines, the US Army sent 130 11th Airborne Division paratroopers to Los Baños to rescue the internees. Only four paratroopers and two Filipino guerrillas were killed in the raid. However, Japanese reinforcements arrived two days later, destroying UPCA facilities and killing some 1,500 Filipino civilians in Los Baños soon afterwards.\n\nUPCA became the first unit of the University of the Philippines to open after the war, with Leopoldo Uichangco as dean. However, only 125 (16 percent) of the original students enrolled. It was even worse for the School of Forestry, which only had nine students. Likewise, only 38 professors returned to teach. UPCA used its ₱470,546 (US$10,800) share in the Philippine-US War Damage Funds (released in 1947) for reconstruction.\n\nFurther financial endowments from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Mutual Security Agency (MSA) allowed the construction of new facilities, while scholarship grants, mainly from the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Cooperation Administration, helped fund training of UPCA faculty. From 1947 to 1958, a total of 146 faculty members had been granted MS and PhD scholarships in US universities.\n\nDioscoro Umali became UPCA dean in 1959. Umali's administration oversaw the creation of IRRI, SEARCA (of which he was the first director), and the Department of Food Science and Technology. New facilities were also constructed under his Five-Year Development Program.\n\nIn 1972, UPCA requested Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to allow the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey found that there was very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units. New colleges and research centers were created over the next few years, while the College of Veterinary Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman.\n\nIn 2010 Chancellor Luis Rey Velasco's administration oversaw the implementation of a policy allowing for larger lecture classes to improve the \"absorptive capacity\" of the university by more than 500 students and to give them better access to some of the more seasoned professors. It increased the class size of 25 to 40 students to a much larger 120 to 175 for general education and foundation courses. The policy has been criticized by various groups in UPLB.\n\nThe UPLB campus consists of spread across the provinces of Laguna, Negros Occidental, and Quezon. UPLB's equipment and facilities are worth some ₱11.3 billion (US$260 million) according to official estimates.\n\nThe Los Baños campus houses UPLB's academic facilities, as well as experimental farms for agriculture and biotechnology research. The more prominent buildings in the Los Baños campus, such as the Dioscoro L. Umali Hall, Main Library, and Student Union were designed by National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin. Other notable landmarks include the iconic \"Oblation\", Alumni Plaza, Freedom Park, and Baker Memorial Hall.\n\nUPLB is designated as caretaker of the Makiling Forest Reserve (often referred to as the \"upper campus,\" in contrast to the \"lower campus\" set at the foot of Makiling). It houses facilities of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources, College of Public Affairs, and the University Health Service, among others. The reserve is home to diverse flora and fauna, and has more tree species than the continental United States (an area 32 times bigger than the Philippines). It serves as an outdoor laboratory for students, mainly from the College of Forestry and Natural Resources.\n\nUPLB has three major land grants: the Laguna-Quezon Land Grant, La Carlota Land Grant, and Laguna Land Grant.\n\nThe Laguna-Quezon Land Grant is located in the towns of Real, Quezon, and Siniloan, Laguna, and was acquired in February 1930. It covers some portions of the Sierra Madre mountain range, and currently hosts the university's \"Citronella\" and lemongrass plantations. The La Carlota Land Grant is situated in Negros Occidental, a province in the Western Visayas region. Acquired in May 1964, it houses the PCARRD-DOST La Granja Agricultural Research Center, which serves as a research center for various upland crops. Meanwhile, the Laguna Land Grant located in Paete, Laguna, also acquired in 1964, is mostly undeveloped. Numerous parties have expressed interest in developing the land grants; however, UPLB has not entertained the potential investors due to the \"lack of a solid development plan.\"\n\nAs part of the University of the Philippines System, UPLB is governed by the 11-person UP Board of Regents, which is jointly chaired by the head of the Commission on Higher Education and the UP president.\n\nThe Board of Regents has the authority to approve the institution, merger, and abolition of degree programs as recommended by the UP president. It also has the power to confer degrees. The UP president, who is appointed by the Board of Regents, is the university's chief executive officer and the head of the faculty.\n\nUPLB is administered by a chancellor who is elected by the UP Board of Regents to a three-year term. The chancellor may only serve for up to two terms. Under him are five vice-chancellors specializing in administration, community affairs, instruction, planning and development, and research and extension.\n\nThe current chancellor is Fernando C. Sanchez, the ninth to hold the office. He assumed the post on 28 October 2014.\n\nUPLB, through the UP System, is a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, a consortium of leading research universities in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nUPLB's endowment totaled some ₱4 billion (US$90 million) in 2010, broken down into cash reserves (₱1.7 billion/US$40 million), investments (₱745 million/US$17 million) and national government subsidy (₱1.19 billion/US$30 million).\n\nThis amount includes research funding from other sources, which was valued at ₱233 million (US$5.37 million) in 2010. The biggest source was Philippine government agencies, at ₱136 million (US$3.13 million), with the PCASTRD-DOST as the largest contributor. This represents a 32 percent decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, contributions from international and local private agencies increased 101 percent and 71 percent respectively. In all, outside sources contributed some ₱98 million (US$2.26 million).\n\nTo prepare for its centennial year, UPLB launched several Centennial Fund campaigns, the largest being the Centennial Building Fund, which aims to raise ₱2 billion (US$46.1 million) for the \"construction, repair and maintenance of academic buildings and dormitories\". Other Centennial Funds include the Centennial Celebration Fund and the Centennial Artists Endowment fund.\n\nThe University Student Council (USC) is the \"highest governing body of all UPLB students.\" Together with college student councils (CSCs), it assembles as the Student Legislative Chamber and acts as the highest policy-making body of the USC. The USC is composed of a chairperson, vice-chairperson, 10 councilors, a representative for each college/school with less than 500 students, and an additional college representative for every 500 students in excess of the first 500. Members are given one-year terms. CSCs have a similar structure, but with a different number of councilors based on the student population.\n\nThe Student Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) is responsible for sanctioning erring students. Common offenses include student misconduct and fraternity rumbles. The SDT is composed of a chairperson, two appointees of the chancellor, a student juror, and a parent juror.\n\nUPLB offers 27 undergraduate and 82 graduate degree programs through its nine colleges and two schools. Majority of the programs award science degrees. It also awards high school diplomas through the University of the Philippines Rural High School (UPRHS), a subunit of the College of Arts and Sciences, which acts as a laboratory for its BS Math and Science Teaching students.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences has the largest student population and the largest number of undergraduate degree programs (11), while the College of Development Communication and College of Veterinary Medicine have the least number of programs (one).\n\nBS Agricultural biotechnology, introduced in 2010, is UPLB's newest undergraduate degree program. Several degree programs that have been proposed include Chancellor Aspiras's BA History, BA Political science and BS Landscape Horticulture, and National Scientist Teodulo M. Topacio Jr.'s comparative medicine program.\n\nUPLB admits more than 2,500 students and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission is determined by the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the \"standard\" cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the \"actual\" cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a \"standard\" UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the \"actual\" cut-off was 2.8 (this \"actual\" cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014–2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.\n\nHigh school freshman admission, on the other hand, is determined by the eight-hour-long UPRHS Entrance Examination. Only the top 125 examinees are admitted. Sophomore transferees take the two-day UPRHS Validation Examination, and are admitted depending on the available slots.\n\nUPLB has a substantial no-show rate, with 42 percent of qualifiers opting not to enroll. The figures are worse for BS Forestry and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine programs, with no-show rates of 65 percent and 62 percent, respectively. Other programs with poor enrollment numbers include BS Agriculture, BS Agricultural engineering, and BS Agricultural chemistry.\n\nNormally, a student who completes the program may graduate with honors if his general weighted average (GWA) is 1.75 or above. The title \"summa cum laude\" is awarded to graduates who obtain a GWA of 1.20 or above, \"magna cum laude\" to graduates with a GWA of 1.45 to 1.20, and \"cum laude\" to graduates with a GWA of between 1.75 and 1.45. As of 2011 there have been 30 \"summa cum laude\"s who have graduated from UPLB.\n\nThe base tuition fee per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23). As with all UP constituents, UPLB implements the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500) are charged the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 are charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit. Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) are charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit; those who have between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) are charged ₱300 (US$7); while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees. Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the Student Loan Board, which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition. Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units, such as the College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe current rates were introduced in 2007. Previously, base tuition was only ₱300 per unit (since 1989). Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007, from ₱400 (US$9) per student to ₱1,100 (US$25) and ₱2,000 (US$46), respectively. New fees, such as internet and energy fees, were introduced. The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition as the reason for the low enrollment rate and high student loan levels, which totaled some ₱14 million (US$326,000) in 2007. Additionally, it criticizes the STFAP for allegedly being ineffective. Upon its introduction in 1989, only 16 percent of students received discounts. The number fell to 12 percent in 2007.\n\nThe Free Tuition Law mandates free tuition and fees for all state university students who are pursuing their degree for the first time. Students who avail of the subsidy will be required to provide return service, although it is possible to opt out and pay the full tuition instead.\n\nUPLB is identified by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence in agricultural engineering, agriculture, biology, chemistry, development communication, forestry, information technology, mathematics, and veterinary medicine. It is a Center of Development in physics, environmental science and statistics. In addition, the Institute of Biological Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, and Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Physics have been recognized since 1983 as National Centers of Excellence in the Basic Sciences via presidential decree. Other Centers of Excellence by virtue of presidential decree are the Farming Systems and Soil Resources Institute, the Institute of Animal Science, the Institute of Food Science and Technology, the Institute of Plant Breeding, the National Crop Protection Center, and the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. In November 5, 2014, the BS Biology program offered by the Institute of Biological Sciences was certified as a standard accredited program by the ASEAN University Network as part of its ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) System.\n\nAs of 2007, UPLB's 12 libraries, collectively referred to as the University Library, hold a total of 346,061 volumes. It periodically receives publications from United Nations agencies (including the UNFAO, UN-HABITAT and UNU) and the World Bank. It is a contributor to the International Information System for Agricultural Services and Technology, contributing nearly 30,000 titles between 1975 and 2010.\n\n195,282 of these volumes are housed at the Main Library, while the rest are in unit libraries. The Main Library also houses theses, digital sources, and 1,215 serial titles, among other materials. It has a total floor area of and a seating capacity of 510, making it the largest library in UPLB.\n\nOne of UPLB's unit libraries is the College of Veterinary Medicine-Animal and Dairy Sciences Cluster Library. It has 17,798 volumes and 198 serial titles, and a total floor area of . It claims to hold the largest collection on veterinary and animal sciences in the country.\n\nUPLB manages the Museum of Natural History, which was established in 1976 at the foothills of Mt. Makiling. It holds over 200,000 biological specimens, including half of the samplings from the Philippine Water Bug Inventory Project. More than half of the specimens belong to the entomological collection. While most of its collections are in its main building, some are housed in other UPLB units.\n\nUPLB hosts a number of international research institutes, including the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture, the ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, the International Rice Research Institute, the World Fish Center, the World Agroforestry Center, and the Asia Rice Foundation. The APEC Center for Technology Exchange and Training for Small and Medium Enterprises (ACTETSME), established in 1996 through the initiative of then President Fidel V. Ramos during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in Seattle, USA, is also located at the university's Science & Technology Park. Local research institutions such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources' Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau, Department of Science and Technology's Forest Products Research and Development Institute, and Department of Agriculture's Philippine Carabao Center are headquartered or have offices at the university. The main office of IRRI's Philippine counterpart, the Philippine Rice Research Institute, used to be located at UPLB but was transferred to the Science City of Muñoz, Nueva Ecija in 1990. It continues to maintain a research office at the university.\n\nTwo UPLB-published journals, the \"Philippine Agricultural Scientist\" and the \"Philippine Journal of Veterinary Medicine\", are listed in the SCImago Journal Rankings. SCImago gave these an h-index (a measure of \"actual scientific productivity\" and \"apparent scientific impact\") of 5 and 1, respectively, for 2009. These journals are also listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge, along with three other UPLB-published journals: the \"Philippine Entomologist\", \"Philippine Journal of Crop Science\", and \"Asia Life Sciences\".\n\nThe following are centers of excellence in research as proclaimed by Presidential Decrees:\n\n\nOther research centers, extension centers and laboratories, and learning museums include:\n\nInterdisciplinary Studies Centers:\n\nUPLB operates a science and technology park. As of February 2010, the park has hosted four companies engaged in biotechnology. The park serves as a location for the commercialization and application of UP technologies.\n\nOne of the earliest innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.\n\nResearch in the 1960s allowed for the efficient mass production of \"macapuno\" (a type of coconut with jelly-like meat), while studies started in 1998 that produced delayed-ripening papaya continue to this day. The research is credited for the increase in Philippine papaya production, with the production of 2000 rising to in 2007. In 1974, UPLB researchers discovered mango flower induction by potassium nitrate, making it possible for the fruit to be available all year round. It is credited for tripling yield and for \"revolutionizing\" the country's mango industry.\n\nIn 2009, UPLB researchers funded by the Department of Agriculture developed an abacá variety that is resistant to the abaca bunchy top virus. The virus, first detected in 1915 at Silang, Cavite, has since spread to various provinces in the country, and damaged more than of abacá plantations in 2002 alone. The university is working further to make it resistant to mosaic and abacá bract mosaic viruses.\n\nIn July 2010, UPLB announced that the \"Leucinodes orbonalis\"-resistant \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" (Bt) eggplant variety that it had been developing with Cornell University and Mahyco was ready for commercialization. On 17 February 2011, Filipino and Indian Greenpeace activists trespassed UPLB's Bay research farm and uprooted two Bt eggplants and more than 100 non-genetically modified eggplants. The National Academy of Science and Technology and ranking UPLB officials condemned the incident, and have taken legal action.\n\nPioneering efforts in biofuel research have been conducted at the university. Studies conducted in the 1930s found that gasoline with 15–20 percent ethanol, dubbed \"gasanol\", was more efficient than pure gasoline. Biofuel research in 2007 under the National Biofuel Program has considered new sources of biofuel, such as coconuts, \"Moringa oleifera\", and sunflower seeds. Efforts have been concentrated on the \"Jatropha curcas\" due to its low maintenance and fast yield. Other fuel, such as coconut biofuel, were found to be too costly. Biofuel from \"Sorghum bicolor\", \"Manihot esculenta crantz\" and \"Chlorella vulgaris\" are also being studied.\n\nIn 2008, 2,170 students were housed in the eight dormitories managed by UPLB. In the academic year 2011–2012, fees for all UPLB dormitories increased by at least 25 percent from the previous rate of ₱350 (US$8) a month. As with the previous dormitory fee increase of 221 percent in 1997, making the dormitories \"financially self-supporting\" was one of the reasons cited by the University Housing Office for the revision. The move was widely criticized by various groups. The University Housing Office projects ₱13,818,000 (US$322,000) in revenue for 2010 with a deficit of ₱586,465.59 (US$13,600). according to official estimates. UPLB is currently building two new dormitories with of floor area. The new dormitories are expected to accommodate 192 persons annually.\n\nAs of December 2012, there are 175 recognized student organizations in UPLB. Of these, 71 are academic, 15 are cultural, 2 are international, 2 are political, 10 are religious, 24 are socio-civic, 5 are sports and recreational, 21 are varsitarian, while 12 and 13 are fraternities and sororities, respectively. Regional organizations were not recognized by UPLB prior to September 2008, when the University of the Philippines board of regents repealed Chapter 72 Article 444 of the 1984 University of the Philippines Code, which states that \"organizations which are provincial, sectional or regional in nature shall not be allowed in the University System.\" Likewise, Section 3 of the code states that \"the University of the Philippines System is a public, \"secular\", non-profit institution of higher learning.\" Due to this, religious organizations have had some difficulty in getting recognized. Only recognized organizations are allowed to use UPLB facilities. The system of student organizations in UPLB is different from that of other UP constituents in that freshmen are not allowed to join any organization until they have earned at least 30 units.\n\nEvery October 10, UPLB celebrates Loyalty Day, which has also become UPLB's alumni homecoming. The celebration commemorates events in 1918, when more than half of students and faculty (193 out of 300 students and 27 out of 32 faculty), including two women, enlisted in the Philippine National Guard for service in France during World War I. The volunteers never saw action, as the Allied Forces signed an armistice with Germany during the same year, essentially ending the war.\n\nThe university holds a major campus fair, known as \"Feb Fair\", during Valentine's week. The fair was initially held to express opposition to martial law under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who abolished student organizations and student councils.\n\nThe militant \"UPLB Perspective\" is the official student publication of UPLB. The university administration has been repeatedly criticized for allegedly interfering in the selection process of its editor-in-chief. Other campus publications include \"UPLB Horizon\" and \"UPLB Link\". Meanwhile, the College of Development Communication (CDC) publishes the experimental community newspaper \"Los Baños Times\".\n\nCDC runs the radio station DZLB 1116, the oldest educational radio station in the Philippines. Founded in August 1964 with a broadcast power of 250 watts at 1210 kHz, the station serves as a distance education tool and training facility. It currently operates through a five-kilowatt transmitter located near the main gate of the campus. The station was the 1994 recipient of the KBP Golden Dove Award for Best AM Radio Station as well as a Catholic Mass Media Award for Best Educational Radio Program in 2010.\n\nPeople associated with the university include alumni, faculty, and honorary degree recipients. Thirteen of them are National Scientists of the Philippines, namely Clare R. Baltazar, Julian Banzon, Gelia T. Castillo, Pedro Escuro, Francisco Fronda, Bienvenido Juliano, Ricardo Lantican, Eduardo Quisumbing, Dolores Ramirez, Francisco O. Santos, Teodulo Topacio, Dioscoro L. Umali, and Jose R. Velasco. All of them held academic posts in the university, while three of them were College of Agriculture deans.\n\nCabinet secretaries affiliated with UPLB include Ricardo Gloria (Science and Technology), William Padolina (Science and Technology), Arsenio Balisacan (Socioeconomic Planning/NEDA), Cielito Habito (Socioeconomic Planning/NEDA), Patricia Santo Tomas (Labor; Development Bank of the Philippines), Domingo Panganiban (Agriculture), and Ramon Paje (Environment and Natural Resources).\n\nMembers of Congress who attended UPLB include Teodoro Casiño, Maria Valentina Plaza, Isidro Ungab, Sergio Osmena III and Juan Miguel Zubiri. Nicanor Perlas, an agriculture graduate from UPLB, ran for the Philippine presidential election, 2010. Both of its honorary degree recipients held influential roles in their respective countries' politics. They are Salim Ahmed Salim, former Prime Minister of Tanzania, and Sirindhorn, Princess of Thailand.\n\nEmil Q.

It raises funds to restore and conserve works of art and architecture in Venice, and to investigate ways to protect them against future risks, particularly rising sea levels. The Fund is also committed to ensuring the sustainability of Venice, acting as a lobby and working to find answers to some of the critical ecological, demographic and socio-economic issues that the city is facing. Its chairman is Jonathan Keates, an author, and was a teacher at the City of London School before retiring in 2013.\n\nThe Venice in Peril Fund was created after the great floods in Florence and Venice in 1966. The disaster led to dozens of private citizens donating large sums of money and Sir Ashley Clarke, former British Ambassador to Rome and chairman of the British Italian Society at that time, was asked to chair a committee to raise further funds to help rescue the two cities. This committee was constituted as the Art & Archives Rescue Fund (IAARF) in 1967 and Sir Ashley was supported in his fundraising efforts by Carla Thorneycroft (Italian-born wife of Conservative MP Peter Thorneycroft, later Lord Thorneycroft), and Nathalie Brooke, wife of Humphrey Brooke, the Secretary to the Royal Academy.\n\nBy the end of July 1967 it was decided that fund-raising activity for Florence should be wound down gradually and that efforts would be redirected to Venice where the serious damage had been to the structure of the city. In 1971 a new statute was drawn up to replace the IAARF with the trust fund Venice in Peril. John Julius, Viscount Norwich, joined as Chairman in 1971.\n\nAnna Somers Cocks who was Chairman from 1999 to 2012 expanded the role of the charity to include research into the environmental and socio-economic threats facing the city.\n\nThe many successful fundraising efforts were helped enormously when, in 1977, Peter Boizot, the founder of Pizza Express, invented the Pizza Veneziana. A percentage of the sale price of every Pizza Veneziana sold is donated to Venice in Peril and by 2014 this initiative had raised £2m. Venice in Peril is extremely proud of this partnership.\n\nBy 2010, the Fund had completed 46 conservation and restoration projects in Venice, including the Gothic Porta della Carta of the Doge's Palace. Three-quarters of its funds have been spent on religious buildings, including the late Gothic church of the Madonna dell'Orto in Cannaregio, the ancient Veneto-Byzantine aisled church of San Nicolò dei Mendicoli, and the 16th century Cappella Emiliani on the cemetery island of San Michele. A new project is the restoration of a hydraulic crane inside the Arsenale, built by Armstrong Mitchell in Newcastle in 1883, one of only two remaining in the world.\n\nThe water level in Venice has risen 23 cm since 1900 due to a combination of subsidence and the level of the Venice lagoon rising. Venice in Peril organised a symposium in London in 1998 to discuss the risk to low-lying cities, including Venice, as a result of rising sea levels; and funded the creation of a research fellowship at Churchill College, Cambridge from 2001 to 2004 to investigate ways to protect Venice from rising sea levels. A conference was held in Cambridge in 2003, and a book \"The Science of Saving Venice\" was published in 2004.\n\nIn 2010, Venice in Peril initiated a campaign in which it solicited the support of the leading museum directors of the world against the vast advertisements on the Doge's Palace and down the Grand Canal.\nA photographic tribute was produced by international artists in 2011 to support the fund.\n\n"}

It has become international with delegates from around 30 different countries and with over 1500 delegates, and has now grown to become the largest permanent Model UN conference in Asia. The conference takes place at the Grand Epoch City Hotel in the outskirts of Beijing annually at the beginning of August. The conference is unique as being the first MUN to unite eleven notable high-school level conferences — WEMUNC, Boston University's BeanMUN (BeanMUN), the Ivy League Model UN Conference (ILMUNC), Model UN of University of Chicago (MUNUC), Berkeley Model UN (BMUN), North American Invitational Model United Nations (NAIMUN), The Hague International Model UN (THIMUN), Cornell Model UN Conference (CMUNC), Yale MUN (YMUN), McGill University's Secondary Schools' United Nations Symposium (SSUNS), and Oxford University's Oxford Global MUN\n\nWEMUN Expo has, since March 2010, collaborated with HMUN to bring a chapter of the Harvard Model UN Conference to China. The 2010 conference was held in Beijing and hosted 1000 delegates and 13 committees, and the 2011 conference was held in Shanghai.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48819867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48819867", "title": "White Student Unions", "text": "White Student Unions\n\nWhite Student Unions are student organizations that aim to represent the interests of white students on university and college campuses. Historically, many of them were white supremacist in nature and associated with the white separatist movement, though some modern ones disavow any connection to it.\n\nIn 2015, a sudden eruption of Facebook pages that said they represented such organizations was sparked by a call from Andrew Anglin of the neo-Nazi blog \"The Daily Stormer\" and by posts on 4chan. Few of the resulting organizations have official status on university and college campuses or an organized membership, with many only existing as unsubstantiated claims in social media; coverage has generally described them as hoaxes, often by people who did not even attend the schools they claimed to represent.\n\nThe first White Student Unions and similar organizations were initially born of the white separatist movement. In the 1960s, a White Student League was formed by white supremacist Tom Metzger and his father, but it dissipated in the 1970s. In 1979, Greg Withrow incorporated Metzger's Aryan Youth Movement into the White Student Union as a \"militant extension of the student struggle.\" Sacramento State University started the first one, and it extended to as many as 20 chapters across the United States.\n\nWhite Student Unions were organized at Temple University in 1988 and at Florida State University in 1989. Temple University \"was forced to recognize it because it already recognized a host of all-minority institutions,\" Dinesh D'Souza wrote in 1991.\n\nIn 1992, a White Student Union, with \"avowedly White supremacist goals,\" was formed at the University of Minnesota. The university banned the group, but after debates about the First Amendment, the ban was lifted and the group was allowed to register as a student organization.\n\nIn November of 2015, a number of White Student Union pages emerged on social media platforms such as Facebook, many apparently in response to a call to action by Neo-Nazi blogger Andrew Anglin of The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, who called for his readers to create pages for many different schools, even for colleges they do not attend. Many of the pages also seem to have been hoaxes coordinated on 4chan; sources have described posts there instructing users to create the pages and take screenshots of the reaction, and compared it to similar hoaxes the website produced in the past. Most coverage has described these as hoaxes, and many universities have responded by contacting Facebook to have the groups removed or have asked that online groups remove any university insignia. The University of California, for instance, later sent a mass email to all then matriculated students over the controversy caused by the pages allegedly representing schools nationwide. The UC system, among other institutions, stated that the pages were not created by or on behalf of any members of the student body they claimed to represent.\n\nFacebook received numerous complaints and reports regarding the pages, and some of them were eventually taken down for violating the site's community standards; many others remained, but remained mostly inactive since shortly after their creation.\n\nThe people behind these Facebook accounts said the organizations were real and that they were the product of students on campus who wanted safe spaces for white students who feel stigmatized and silenced; but their pages and organizations were generally met with skepticism over their nature, purpose, and goals. While the creators of the initial string of pages have yet to be identified, some schools experienced \"copycat\" pages being created by actual members of the student body. One such individual, Matthew Heimbach, who says he is the founder of the White Student Union at Towson University, for example, says that he is not racist; but critics point to his group's patrols against supposed \"black predators\" as evidence of racism. Defending the patrols, Heimbach writes that \"White Southern men,\" he wrote, \"have long been called to defend their communities when law enforcement and the State seem unwilling to protect our people.\"\n\nContacted anonymously, the people behind the Facebook pages have generally denied a connection to The Daily Stormer or to Andrew Anglin's call to action, though they generally declined to identify themselves or provide proof that they were members of the schools they named. While they denied an association with racism or white supremacy, many of them said that they felt that whitehood was stigmatized or under attack; some said that their organizations contained non-white members.\n\n\n"}
