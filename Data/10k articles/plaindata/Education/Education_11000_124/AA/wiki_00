At age 15 he captained his local basketball team to a state championship and was named most valuable player. Aaron was hoping to gain selection in the national basketball team at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. After an injury during training forced his departure from the sport, he then moved to his next passion, music. He continued piano studies with Neta Maughan, the teacher of Michael Kieran Harvey, Simon Tedeschi, and her own daughter Tamara Anna Cislowska. At age 16 he was the youngest Australian pianist to gain a Licentiate Diploma of Music with distinction. He took part in the 1996 Sydney International Piano Competition.\n\nIn addition to performing, he became an entrepreneur. He organised and financed many of his own concerts and recordings, but also set up a company called \"Wayfarer\" to promote other musicians. He organised a concert at the Sydney Town Hall where 20 Australian composers performed their own works - these included Dulcie Holland, Miriam Hyde and Elena Kats-Chernin. \n\nAs an adult his other love was cricket. He coached other players and through the game he met Gavin Robertson and Steve Waugh, and Tim Farriss from INXS, who all became his friends.\n\nIn 2001, McMillan was diagnosed with hemangiopericytoma, a rare brain tumour. It was discovered while he was being photographed for the cover of an album. A small pimple on his eyelid prompted him to see a doctor, who diagnosed the condition. He was operated on by Charlie Teo and the tumor was successfully removed. The first of two \"Australian Story\" programs on ABC television, entitled \"Playing for Time\", followed his surgery at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital. Among his various charity work, he was an ambassador for Charlie Teo's \"Cure for Life Foundation\". The tumour returned in 2003. It did not respond to treatment, and by 2005 he could no longer play the piano. \n\nMcMillan performed solo at the Sydney Opera House on two occasions. Because of his illness, he could not perform at a planned third concert but instead made it an opportunity for him to present other pianists. He released a 9-CD box set of his recordings, which he produced from his bed in the palliative care unit of St Vincent's Hospital in Darlinghurst. The Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, officiated at the release. His story is told in Susan Wyndham's book, \"Life In His Hands\", which deals with both Aaron and Charlie Teo, his neurosurgeon.\n\nHe died on 14 May 2007 at St Vincent's Hospital. Just three days prior to his death, at his hospital bedside, he was awarded a Mo Award for services to the entertainment industry.\n\nHis parents, Brian McMillan, and Gail née Robinson, met on a meditation retreat. Soon after Aaron's birth, his father left to become a Buddhist monk in Thailand, and did not see his son again until he was 15. In the meantime, the marriage was dissolved, and his mother married Giles Puckett, and they had two additional children. Aaron, an only child, gained two siblings. Aaron was influenced by his grandparents' Roman Catholicism, by Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, by his father's Buddhism, and other spiritual ideas.\n\n"}

For instance, students in the Republic of Ireland sit the Junior Certificate and follow it with the Leaving Certificate. Similarly, other countries have awards, for instance, in Australia the Higher School Certificate (HSC) in New South Wales, the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) in Victoria, etc., is the examination taken on completion of secondary education. In parts of the United Kingdom the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is the normal examination taken at age 16 and the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS-level) and Advanced Level (A-levels) are taken at 17 and 18.\n\nIn many other countries, certificates are qualifications in higher education. For example, in the Republic of Ireland, the National Certificate, which is soon to be replaced by the \"Higher Certificate\". These have the titles Certificate (at an undergraduate level), Graduate Certificate (at an undergraduate level, but requiring the completion of a prior undergraduate degree for admission) and Postgraduate Certificate (at a postgraduate level). In Hong Kong, students take the exams to receive Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education. Certificate is below the standard of the associate degree, diploma, higher diploma and advanced diploma, which are below the bachelor's degree. Postgraduate certificates are taken after the bachelor's degree and are sometimes more vocationally oriented than master's degrees.\n\nIn Australia, a certificate is a qualification offered by a university or other higher education provider which is shorter than a degree or diploma. Certificates are generally provided by TAFE colleges or non-academic Registered Training Organizations (often workplaces). There are four ranks of Certificate in Australia, indicated by Roman Numeral, e.g., Cert. IV in Horticulture. The time spent varies, but in general a Certificate I will be granted after a course of only a few weeks, while a Cert. IV may take up to twelve months. A Diploma directly follows Cert. IV and may rightly be considered equivalent to a hypothetical Certificate V.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE) requires successful completion of 120 credits at level four of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (level 7 of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework). This is equivalent to one year of full-time university education at first year level. Each credit is equivalent to a nominal ten hours of study, and as such the CertHE is 1,200 hours of study. This compares with 360 credits (spanning levels 4, 5 and 6/480 credits spanning levels 7 to 10 in Scotland) for an honours bachelor's degree, and 240 credits (spanning level 4 and 5/7 and 8 in Scotland) for a Diploma of Higher Education. A certificate can also be a vocational qualification of between 13 and 36 credits at any of the levels of the Regulated Qualifications Framework, the level being specified in the qualification title.\n\nIn the United States, a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge about a certain vocational or professional subject. Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements. Graduate certificates represent completion of studies beyond the bachelor's degree, yet short of a masters degree.\nIn the State of Maryland, a Certificate of Merit was, until recently, issued to graduating high-school seniors who met certain academic requirements (such as completion of advanced courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.00); the statewide certificate has since been replaced by \"endorsements\" defined by each local school system.\n\nIt also may be awarded as a necessary certification to validate that a student is considered competent in a certain specific networking skill area in information technology. Thus a computer engineer or computer science graduation most likely will have to obtain additional certificates on and pertaining to the specific technologies or equipment used by the hiring corporation; if not, such employer may suffer unwanted penalties like foregoing (voiding the contract) the protections of a certain level of customer service or warranties.\n\nIt is becoming more common for higher education institutions to award certificates to continuing education students. These certificates vary, usually involve rigorous courses, and can be affiliated with many associations. Examples would include CMA or CGA. University certificates are also becoming more common ways for people to engage in areas of interest while working full-time. They can be completed with a minimum grade in a series of university courses, and are sometimes taken as a way to further one's professional career (either by requirement or choice). They are gaining credence and ground in both the academic world and the working world.\n\n"}

ALC aims to achieve a fair global society by improving the dissemination of education so as to equip children with the rights and ability to create their own future. ALC focuses on promoting literatel education and creating a conducive environment to nurture children's ability to learn by themselves.\n\nFounded in 1982 by Chanthasone Inthavong, ALC first started as the \"Association for sending picture books to Lao children\", then expanded their activities to include publishing of books in Laos. Their activities started in Japan and spread into Laos where Laotians took charge. They have currently two offices situated in Laos and Japan.\n\nALC seeks to fulfill its objectives through the implementation of 5 different projects aimed at improving the schooling experience of Lao children. These projects emphasize on the culture of reading and writing.\n\nThe Book Publishing Project facilitated the production of various categories of books written in the Lao language by Lao writers and illustrators. It also introduced picture books which are hard to come by in Laos. As of May 2009, about 690,000 books with 148 titles have been published.\n\nThe Reading Promotion Project was implemented to improve the reading environment of Lao children through increased accessibility to books. It consists of the \"Book Distribution Project\" and \"School Library Project\". As a result of these efforts, books have been distributed to over 3000 primary and secondary schools in Laos since 1992. 190 school libraries have also been opened to encourage children to pick up reading as a habit. People living in the remote areas or villages of ethnic minorities benefit the most from this project since availability of education is lower there.\n\nIn order to fully utilize the books distributed, Reading Promotion Seminars are organized for teachers to teach them the importance and pleasure of reading and the proper management of libraries.\n\nIn 1994, the first Children's Cultural Center (CCC) was established in Vientiane. These centers serve to change the Lao educational environment by creating platforms where the children can perform and express themselves. This is in line with the promotion of children rights stated in the UN Charter of the Rights of the Child. Activities implemented in these centers include drawing, handicraft, traditional dance and music. At present, there are 20 CCCs nationwide.\n\nALC has been successful as proven by the falling failure rates in exams and rates of absentism in class. However, there are limitations to the programmes implemented. Close monitoring of schools has proven that many teachers fail to fully utilize books and motivate children to read. This is attributed to the limited time given to them to fully grasp the contents during the seminar. Skills learnt are also not transferred to the successors upon resignation. Besides, quality improvement of Lao language education is hindered due to the incapabilities of teachers in that aspect. In order to address these issues, ALC needs to do more by looking into the improvement of teaching methods of teachers.\n\nBelow is a table, in chronological order, the events ALC has initiated or participated in.\n\nThe picture below shows a map of Laos with the provinces numbered and defined. Apart from Oudoxmy and Phongsaly, ALC is active in all the other provinces of Laos.\n\nTaken from the Wikipedia Commons.\n"}
{"id": "641060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=641060", "title": "Alois Hába", "text": "Alois Hába\n\nAlois Hába (21 June 1893 – 18 November 1973) was a Czech composer, music theorist and teacher. He belongs to the important discoverers in modern classical music, and major composers of microtonal music, especially using the quarter-tone scale, though he used others such as sixth-tones (e.g., in the 5th, 10th and 11th String Quartets), fifth-tones (Sixteenth String Quartet), and twelfth-tones. From the other mictrotonal conceptions, he discussed a \"three-quarter tone\" system (see three-quarter tone flat and the neutral second) in his theoretical works but he used scales in this tuning in sections of some of his compositions. In his prolific career, Hába composed three operas, an enormous collection of chamber music including 16 string quartets, piano, organ and choral pieces, some orchestral works and songs. He also had special keyboard and woodwind instruments constructed that were capable of playing quarter-tone scales.\n\nAlois Hába was born in the small town of Vizovice in Moravian Wallachia, into a family of 10 children. When he was five years old it was discovered that he had absolute pitch. He and his family often played and sang their native Wallachian folk songs, actively participated in church singing and folk-music performances. In school, Alois became very interested in the musical aspects of the Czech language, above all in pitch, rhythm, accent, dynamics, and timbre of the speech. In 1908 he entered the teacher's training college in Kroměříž, where he began to develop an interest in Czech national music, analyzing the works of Bedřich Smetana. Already at that time he found out from his textbooks that the European system of music was not the only one in the world and that even some European music had in the past used different scales than the ones used in his time. He therefore started to develop his own point of view in this issue. After finishing his studies, he got a job as teacher in Bílovice, a small town near the Hungarian (now Slovak) border. Simultaneously, he continued his own musical studies and in 1913 wrote his first compositions, displaying an unwillingness to \"follow the rules\", which he maintained all his life. Hába was dissatisfied by small-town life, and in 1914, he moved to Prague and became a pupil of neoromantic composer Vítězslav Novák. Here he was interested in analysing the works of Claude Debussy, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin, and Richard Strauss, and in harmonization of Moravian folk music.\n\nDuring World War I, he served in the Austrian Army on the Russian and Italian front from 1915 until early 1918, when he was moved to Vienna, where he worked in the music department of the Austrian-Hungarian Ministry of War. There he almost immediately became a student of Franz Schreker, who brought out his more radical tendencies. At that time, Hába wrote his first quarter-tone piece, Suite, consisting of three fugues in the quarter-tone system, composed for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart. Remaining in Vienna after the war, Hába attended the concerts produced by Arnold Schönberg's Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen, and became particularly influenced by the \"athematic\" style used by Schönberg in his \"Erwartung\". First publications of his compositions included the String Quartet No. 2, his first major quarter-tone work which was composed in 1920. At that time, his lifelong friendship with Hanns Eisler – with whom he shared political beliefs (Hába became an ardent communist at this time) as well as musical opinions – began.\n\nHába found his first success as a composer in Berlin, where he followed his teacher Schreker in late 1920. He published his first theoretical treatise (in Czech), the small booklet \"Harmonické základy čtvrttónové soustavy\" (Harmonic Essentials of the Quarter-tone System). In 1923, he met Ferrucio Busoni, who had advocated the sixth-tone system and encouraged Hába to continue his work in microtonality. The same year, Hába began to attempt the establishment of a school of microtonal music, but as the Nazis started to gain power in Germany, he came under attack and was driven out of Berlin. He returned to Prague and managed to get a job teaching workshops at the Prague Conservatory.\n\nIn July 1923 at the festival of modern music in Donaueschingen, the Amar-Hindemith Quartet played Hába’s quarter-tone String Quartet No. 3. His name began to appear alongside other representatives of his generation’s avant-garde musicians and, thanks to him, Czechoslovakia became one of the first member countries of the International Society for Contemporary Music. Hába wrote several theoretical articles on microtonality, athematicism, and church modes at this time. In 1925 he wrote his major theoretical work \"New Harmony-Textbook of the Diatonic, Chromatic, Quarter-, Third-, Sixth-, and Twelfth-tone Systems\" (if necessary, see: diatonic, chromatic). He designed and had built two quarter-tone pianos by early 1924 and a third in 1925. In 1927, the Czech branch factory of the German piano firm August Förster in the North Bohemian town of Jiříkov built for him a sixth-tone harmonium, patterned mostly after the design by Busoni.\n\nAfter the premiere of his quarter-tone opera \"Matka\" (Mother) in 1931, introducing a practically athematic concept, Hába emerged as a leader of Czech modernist music and became internationally well known as one of the most important avantgarde composers. This opera also uses two quarter-tone clarinets and two quarter-tone trumpets, which were built especially for this work. In 1934, he composed the opera \"Nová země\" (The New Earth) in the twelve-tone system. Athematic constructions characteristic of his work appeared also later in the opera \"Přijď království tvé\" (Thy Kingdom Come) (1940), which is written in the sixth-tone system. In all three operas, Hába expressed his bold socialist viewpoint, that caused controversies already at the time. For instance, the production of Nová Země (the plot of which deals with the Holodomor in Ukraine and how the Holodomor in a Ukrainian village is defeated by socialisation of production and founding the kolkhoz Nová Země (The New Earth) by National Theatre in Prague in 1936 had to be cancelled by intervention from the Ministry of Culture as communist and pro-soviet propaganda.\n\nIn 1933, when Josef Suk became director of the Prague Conservatory, Hába was made a full professor and established the Department of Quarter-tone and Sixth-tone Music. Here he had much influence over his many students. It was also the early 1930s that saw the writing of what is probably Hába’s most important orchestral work, the symphonic fantasy \"Cesta života\" (The Path of Life). The 1930s also shaped Hába’s political stance and philosophy of life. His strong sense of social commitment found an intellectual basis in the anthroposophical teachings of Rudolf Steiner.\n\nIn 1939 the German Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia and banned performance of Hába's work. They closed down the Prague Conservatory in 1941 and prevented him from teaching. During the war Hába wrote a continuation of his \"Theory of Harmony\", completed, as already mentioned, a sixth-tone opera (which was never produced), and considered constructing a twelfth-tone harmonium.\n\nAfter World War II, he resumed teaching and held several administrative positions. At the turn of forties and fifties, the work of Alois Hába was affected by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, becoming transitionally simplified, much more \"thematic\" and tonal, and also setting texts projecting communist ideology. He was nevertheless unable to rid himself of the label of “formalist” stuck onto him by Marxist aesthetics.\n\nIn 1953 he was sent into retirement, but in his own words it was only at that point that he achieved real creative freedom. In 1957 he was named an honorary member of the ISCM. When Hába returned to his style, he continued in his experimental musical studies, which culminated in the 1960s with the use of fifth tones in his Sixteenth String Quartet in 1967. This work was premiered in the same year at the ISCM festival in Prague, performing by Novák Quartet.\nHába was a prolific composer and continued to compose almost to the end of his life. He taught and influenced many musicians. Besides followers in his own country, Hába attracted students from southern Slavic countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria), Lithuania, Turkey, and elsewhere. The Prague Conservatory in general enjoyed an international reputation, and a great deal of credit for that goes to the contacts and pioneering efforts of Alois Hába. Despite these facts, he died in relative obscurity in Prague in 1973.\n\nAlois Hába's works total 103 opuses, the majority of which are various kinds of chamber music. Among the most important are his string quartets, which document and demonstrate the development of his style. In addition to quarter tones, Hába used sixth-tones in his String Quartets nos. in the 5, 10, and 11, as well as in Six Pieces for Sixth-tone Harmonium or String Quartet (1928), Duo for Sixth-tone Violins (1937), \"Thy Kingdom Come\", a Sixth-tone Musical Drama in Seven Scenes (1937–42), Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Violin (1955), and Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Cello (1955).

His father, Bonifacio Cornazzano was a well-known lawyer and his mother, Costanza Bagarotti, belonged to the small nobility from Piacentine territory. Cornazzano studied at the university of Siena between 1444–47, and in 1450 he was in Rome, probably in the service of a high prelate. He then found his way to Milan in 1455, where he served Duke Francesco Sforza, and wrote a long poem in praise of the Duke, his 'De gestis Francisci Sfortiae' or 'Sforziade'. He also wrote a small treatise on the art of dancing, a life of the Virgin Mary and a Latin scurrilous collection of 'novellae' \"De proverbiorum origine\". After attending the Duke's funeral in 1466, he left Milan. He moved to Venetian territory and, for a time, worked with the condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, whose biography Cornazzano wrote in Latin. In Venice, he worked with the printer Nicolas Jenson, and published a \"Life of Christ\". In 1475, he moved to the court of Ferrara, where he wrote important works; a short treatise on government, and one on military art (c. 1476) in prose. He later turned the latter into a terza rima poem. He died in Ferrara in 1484.\n\nThere is a manuscript in the Estense Library in Modena, Italy, written in 15th or 16th century script. It contains four poetic Italian works by Corazzano in \"terza rima\"- a form of stanza that requires a set of three lines that rhyme. \"Terza rima\" was first used by Italian Dante Alighieri. Of the four works, three were published, along with a number of his poems in the same style. The title of \"Opera nova\" were given to these selections published in 1517 and 1518. Of Cornazzano's four works mentioned above, one, the first of the series,\"De mulieribus admirandis\", was never published (but see C. FAHY, \"The 'De mulieribus admirandis' of Antonio Cornazzano\" in LA BIBLIOFILIA, 52 (1960) pp. 144–174). It, in fact, has grown in obscurity over the many years since its creation until it has nearly been wiped from history's rich pages. It has even received little, if any attention from the scholarly men of Italy.\n(The above is rather sketchy) for accurate, reliable and scholarly information,\n\nSee: R.L. BRUNI and D. ZANCANI, Antonio Cornazzano: La tradizione testuale, Florence, Olschki 1992.\n\nThere is another article in English on Cornazzano, apart from Fahy's, by D. ZANCANI, 'Antonio Cornazzano's \"De l'integrita' de la militare arte\"', in \"Chivalry in the Renaissance, ed. by S. Anglo, Woodbridge, Boydell 1990, pp. 13–24.\n\nCornazzano's dancing master was Domenico da Piacenza, who was perhaps better known as Domenico da Ferrara. Cornazzano was a fellow student with Guglielmo Ebreo. He once said this concerning his dancing master, he is the \"king of the art\". Cornazzano published his Libro dell'arte del danzare in 1455 a treatise on dancing in the 15th century.\n\nSee.: R.L. BRUNI and D.

Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the case had become moot and so declined to render a merits decision on it. American student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law in the state of Washington before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to graduate within a few months of the decision being rendered.\n\nThe Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the plaintiff. The case did not constitute \"voluntary cessation\" on the part of the defendant law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review.\n\nDeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's affirmative action policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in \"DeFunis\", the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\".\n\nIn 1970, Marco DeFunis, a white man, applied for entry to the law program at the University of Washington. He was denied even though the year in question would be his final year. DeFunis, believing he had been rejected because of affirmative action, thought the school had taken applicants who were approved because of not their accomplishments but their race.\n\nHe took his case to court and stated that of affirmative action violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was first heard in the Superior Court of Washington, in which the University of Washington moved to have the case dismissed on the grounds that relief could not be granted. The court rejected the proposed dismissal and filed an injunction that forced the school to admit DeFunis. The university argued that it used a complex formula to predict applicants' success, the Predicted First-Year Average (PFYA), but it was not the only thing taken into account during the application process.\n\nApplicants with higher PFYA scores were reviewed and were presented by a committee member before the whole committee. The committee member who represented a student was usually up to chance but not in the case of African American and other minority students. Their files were reviewed by three specific board members: Professor Geoffrey Crooks (director of the school's Council on Legal Education Opportunities program), Vincent Hayes (a second-year black law student), and Associate Dean Robert S. Hunt (the sole evaluator of the files of minorities other than African Americans). The court found that in reviewing the files of minority applicants, the committee attached less weight to the PFYA in making a total judgmental evaluation as to the relative ability of the particular applicant to succeed in law school. Also, the chairman testified that although the same standard was applied to all applicants (the relative probability of the individual succeeding in law school), minority applicants were directly compared to one another, but they were not compared to applicants outside of the minority group. As a result, the committee admitted a group of minority applicants, placed a group of such applicants on a waiting list, and rejected other minority applications. The dean of the law school testified that the law school has no fixed admissions quota for minority students but that the committee sought a reasonable representation of such groups in the law school. He added that the it has accepted no unqualified minority applicants but only those whose records indicated that they were capable of successfully completing the law school program. Because of the judgmental factors in the admissions process, as outlined, the ultimate determination of applicants to whom admission was offered did not follow exactly the relative ranking of PFYAs. Of those invited, 74 had lower PFYAs than plaintiff; 36 of them were minority applicants, 22 were returning from military service, and 16 were applicants judged by the committee as deserving invitations on the basis of other information contained in their files. There were 29 applicants with higher PFYAs than plaintiff's were denied admission. Of the 36 minority group students invited 18 actually enrolled in the first-year class. The law faculty was, as the court observes, motivated by a laudable purpose: to increase the number of minority students studying law and with the avowed purpose of equalizing opportunities among applicants who come from the lower income and economic groups with those who come from the higher. That policy of ethnic minority selection apparently was not to apply to faculty positions, as the record does not show that any qualified white applicant for the teaching staff was refused or that any faculty member ousted to make room for law teachers with questionable credentials from a minority ethnic group.\n\nThe court's reflected heavily on the Supreme Court's ruling on \"Brown v. Board of Education\" when it began ruling and so the injunction was filed. The Supreme Court of Washington had strong opinions on the case, with Justice Hale going as far to say, \"Preferential treatment under the guise of 'affirmative action' is the imposition of one form of racial discrimination in place of another. The questions that must be asked in this regard are: must an individual sacrifice his right to be judged on his own merit by accepting discrimination based solely on the color of his skin? How can we achieve the goal of equal opportunity for all if, in the process, we deny equal opportunity to some?\" Justice Hunter concurred \"The majority supports a laudable purpose — to enable students of certain minority races to enter the University of Washington School of Law in order that ultimately there will be a greater representation of practicing lawyers of those races in the legal profession — with which purpose I do not disagree. This must not be accomplished, however, by clear and willful discrimination against students of other races as the Admissions Committee of the University of Washington School of Law has done in this case by denying admission to the respondent, Marco DeFunis, Jr, to this school, as found by the trial court and amply supported by the record.\"\n\nWhen the case reached the Supreme Court, DeFunis was already in his final year of law school. The court ruled it moot since neither party had anything to gain from the court's ruling.\n\n\n"}

It has also been described as a \"media-assisted simulation game\" series.\n\nWhile Tom Snyder originally created games that would suit the \"one-computer classroom\" model, this series was part of a new gaming focus of \"choice-driven discussion generators\". The software was designed specifically to foster acamedic discussions within the classroom. An online learning extension named \"Decisions, Decisions Online\" was also created.\n\nEach game puts the players (recommended to be a classroom) into a scenario based on actual facts and encourages them to come up with solutions. An example is in the title \"Decisions, Decisions: Prejudice\", in which the players take the role of the mayor of a tourist town, in which a newspaper has editorialised against a business trading racial memorabilia. Students discuss the problem in teams, then enter their strategies into the computer, which advances the story, leading to 300 alternate paths. Members of the team receive booklets from the perspective of an adviser to the decision maker, for instance in \"Decisions, Decisions: The Environment\", they could be a campaign manager, and environmentalist, a scientist, and an economist; players then debate this conflicting information to reach a justifiable compromise.\n\nThe games encourage a five step critical thinking process:\nFollow-up activities include: taking quizzes, drawing political cartoons, writing to state and federal legislators, seeing how others parts of the country voted on the issue, and research Web links.\n\n\n\"Education World\" gave \"Decisions, Decisions Online\" an A+, describing it as an effective online resource to stimulate the critical thinking skills of young people. Laura Cirillo-Boilard of USJ gave \"Decisions, Decisions - The Constitution\" 10/10, praising its ability to develop skills in cooperative learning, reading comprehension, oral communication, problem-solving, and decision-making. \"Teaching TV Production in a Digital World: Integrating Media Literacy\" recommended the use of \"Decisions, Decisions: Violence in the Media\" within the school curriculum. \"Character Education in America's Blue Ribbon Schools\" felt the series effectively allowed students to work together in solving real world problems and analysing the results of their decisions. The website was The New York Times' featured site on January 5, 2000. The Washington Post reported that the series could be ground-breaking in the move from learning distinct subjects to a synergistic approach, using all these skills to complete practical and realistic projects. Macworld noted that \"Decisions, Decisions 5.0: The Constitution\" was not a replacement for a U.S. history textbook.\n\n"}

It is based on the principles of Waldorf education. Located on 11 acres of land, the school is adjacent to Wildcat Canyon, a 2,427-acre regional park with hiking trails and panoramic views of the area.\n\nFounded in Berkeley in 1980, East Bay Waldorf School offers classes from prekindergarten through grade 8, as well as parent-child classes for infants-age 3 years. Curriculum is based upon the principles of Waldorf Education, and accredited by the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA).\n\nThe East Bay Waldorf School’s 11-acre campus includes two large fields, an edible garden, eucalyptus and pine groves, several playgrounds designed to integrate play with nature, and farm animals. The outdoor space is augmented by Wildcat Canyon, a 2,427-acre regional park with hiking trails that lead directly from the school.\n\nThe East Bay Waldorf School offers a balanced, comprehensive curriculum based on the principles of Waldorf Education, conceived by the Austrian educator, scientist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner during the 1920s. The Waldorf movement, represented by over 1000 schools worldwide, pioneered the education of the “whole child” introducing the “head, heart and hands” approach to learning.\n\nWaldorf teachers integrate art, music and movement into every academic subject, which helps students better engage and absorb the academic material. Each year of the curriculum is designed to be developmentally-specific to the growing child.\n\nDuring the kindergarten years, the focus is on creative play, being outdoors in nature, artistic work, storytelling, and meaningful practical work such as baking bread, sweeping, or woodworking. The teachers develop children’s capacity for later academic learning by supporting this free, creative play, encouraging children’s imaginative capacities, modeling behavior and creating a predictable environment of reverence and beauty.\n\nIn the elementary school grades, the day begins with a two-hour class known as “main lesson.” Devoted to a theme in language arts, math, science, or social studies, main lesson blocks last for 3–4 weeks. The latter part of the day is spent in “practical arts” such as handwork, music, Spanish or German language classes, physical education, Eurythmy (a form of movement), as well as language arts and mathematics. Daily chores and significant outdoor time are also essential to the Waldorf approach.\n\nAssessment is formative (careful observation with an ongoing qualitative focus on what needs to be developed), rather than summative (typically grades and testing), and teachers stay with the same class for several years, up to an eight-year period.\n\nWaldorf education emphasizes moral qualities such as beauty, truth and inherent goodness. Teachers strive to surround the children with these elements through aesthetically-pleasing classrooms, meaningful activity, and the content of the curriculum. For example, history is taught through legends and biographies that illuminate human strength and heroism in the face of adversity.\n\nThe use of television, computers and hand-held devices is discouraged for elementary school students at the East Bay Waldorf School. Electronic media is viewed as detrimental to the healthy development of children, and to the cultivation of creativity, perseverance and problem solving. The East Bay Waldorf School considers education to be much more than acquiring information and skills; therefore learning is a human-to-human endeavor that electronic devices do not support.\n\nThe East Bay Waldorf School recognizes the cycles of the year by celebrating a variety of seasonal festivals and events, including Michaelmas, Harvest Faire, Wanderer’s Way, the Spiral of Light, and the May Faire. Several of these events are open to the public.\n\n"}

Its aim is for young people to have the opportunity to achieve their potential, to ensure that the UK’s future workforce is equipped with the skills to succeed.\n\nEdge believes that there are many paths to success. They think that vocational and practical education should be valued just as highly as academic choices. To make this happen, they run campaigns and projects that challenge academic snobbery, stimulate demand for practical learning, and supply innovative learning opportunities.\n\nAs well as a better public perception of practical learning, Edge would like to see fundamental changes in the UK education system, including better careers guidance, more opportunities for practical and work-based learning, more employer engagement and an overhaul of teacher training, especially in practical subjects.\n\nIn 2003 educational services provider Edexcel was partially sold to Pearson PLC. The trustees of Edexcel opted to use the proceeds of the sale to set up an educational foundation: Edge was formed in November 2004. The trustees of the foundation identified the promotion of practical and vocational learning as the new organisation's primary objective. Since its inception Edge has invested millions of pounds in practical learning schemes and initiatives run by other organisations, as well as running its own projects.\n\nIn August 2008 Edge published the Next Step Guide, which was distributed in the Guardian newspaper. The supplement aimed to promote a wide range of education options for young people, particularly practical and vocational routes.\n\nThis is a campaign to encourage employers to get involved in education and help schools and colleges provide work-related learning experiences for young people. It is piloted in Hertfordshire and Yorkshire and the Humber, and it is planned to extend it throughout the country in autumn 2009. The website www.businessinschools.co.uk allows schools and colleges to register their details and select the work-related learning opportunities in which they’re interested. Employers can then visit the site and find nearby schools and colleges in need of their help.\n\nOn 23 July 2008 the inaugural VQ Day took place, celebrating the success of those with vocational qualifications across the UK. Edge led the VQ Day celebrations, with support from many of the leading players in the vocational education community. The next VQ Day will be held on 24 June 2009.\n\nIn 2007 Edge launched its first mainstream advertising campaign. The television ad features a father giving his son a driving lesson, and forcing him to drive the wrong way down a dual carriageway. The captions over the film read: \"Are you pushing your kids in the wrong direction?\", \"An academic route isn't always the right option\".\n\nEdge is funding two new schools under the Government's controversial academy schools scheme; one in Milton Keynes and one in Bulwell, Nottingham. The two schools will be housed in brand new buildings and are due to open in time for the 2009/10 school year.\n\nEdge is a co-sponsor of the University Technical Colleges programme, in conjunction with the Baker Dearing Trust.\n\nEdge invited young people aged 13–17 to invent a device that could be used by in space. Twelve winning teams were taken to the NASA space centre in Houston, USA.\n\nEdge asked young people to come up with a practical idea to combat climate change. Forty-one winners were taken to the Arctic to see climate change at first-hand and carry out experiments with leading scientists.\n\nThe Edge Awards take place annually, and reward companies for giving practical learning opportunities to young people. They also reward individual young people who have used vocational learning as a springboard to successful careers. Previous winners include diamond-setting apprentice Alasdair Craig and Suffolk-based juice bar MyJuice.\n\nhorsesmouth.co.uk is a website billed as \"the first dedicated website for informal e-mentoring\". It brings together the expertise of volunteer online mentors, with young people who need a mentor's help. Its tagline reads: \"Someone needs what you know. Someone knows what you need.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "3037898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3037898", "title": "Education in Norway", "text": "Education in Norway\n\nEducation in Norway is mandatory for all children aged 6–16.\n\nThe school year in Norway runs from mid August to late June the following year. The Christmas holiday from mid December to early January historically divides the Norwegian school year into two terms. Presently, the second term begins in the beginning of January.\n\nOrganized education in Norway dates as far back as medieval times. Shortly after Norway became an archdiocese in 1153, cathedral schools were constructed to educate priests in Trondheim, Oslo, Bergen and Hamar.\n\nAfter the reformation of Norway in 1537, (Norway entered a personal union with Denmark in 1536) the cathedral schools were turned into Latin schools, and it was made mandatory for all market towns to have such a school.\n\nIn 1736 training in reading was made compulsory for all children, but was not effective until some years later, when ambulatory schools (\"omgangsskoler\") were also established. In 1827, Norway introduced the \"folkeskole\" (\"people's school\"), a primary school which became mandatory for 7 years in 1889 and 9 years in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, the \"folkeskole\" was abolished, and the \"grunnskole\" (\"foundation school\") was introduced.\n\nTraditionally poorer counties like Finnmark and Hedmark have the highest shares of inhabitants who only have completed the compulsory primary education, with numbers as high as 38%.\n\nThe Norwegian school system can be divided into three parts: Elementary school (\"Barneskole\", ages 6–13), lower secondary school (\"Ungdomsskole\", ages 13–16), and upper secondary school (\"Videregående skole\", ages 16–19). The Barneskole and Ungdomsskole levels are compulsory, and are commonly referred to as \"Grunnskole\" (literally translates to \"'ground-school\").\n\nElementary and lower secondary school are mandatory for all children aged 6–16. Before 1997, mandatory education in Norway started at the age of 7. Students often have to change school when they enter lower secondary school and almost always have to change school when they enter upper secondary school, as many schools only offer one of the levels.\nIn the first year of primary school, students spend most of their time playing educational games and learning social structures, the alphabet, basic addition and subtraction, and basic English skills. In Grades 2-7, they are introduced to mathematics, English, science, religion (focusing not only on Christianity but also on all other religions, their purpose, and their history), aesthetics, and music, complemented by geography, history, and social studies in the fifth grade. No official grades are given at this level. However, the teacher often writes a comment, analysis, and sometimes an unofficial grade on tests. Tests are to be taken home and shown to parents. There is also an introductory test to let the teacher know if the student is above average or is in need of some assistance at school.\n\nWhen the students enter lower secondary school, at age 12 or 13, they begin getting grades for their work. Their grades together with their location in the country will determine whether they get accepted to their high school of choice or not. From eighth grade, students can choose one elective (\"valgfag\"). Typical offered subjects are German, French, and Spanish as well as additional English and Norwegian studies. Before the educational reform of August 2006, students could choose a practical elective instead of the languages. Teens born in 1999 and later could once again choose a practical elective upon starting lower secondary school, thus getting the option to choose two electives.\n\nA student may take the Grade 10 exam in a particular subject early as long as he or she has been granted an exemption from further instruction in the elementary/middle school curriculum of that subject.\n\nIn 2009, Norwegian fifteen-year-olds performed better in OECDs Programme for International Student Assessment than other Scandinavian countries, with significant improvement since 2006. In mathematics, however, the top scoring 10% were estimated to lag three years behind the top scoring students in Shanghai.\n\nSecondary education in Norway is primarily based on public schools: In 2007, 93% of upper secondary school students attended public schools.\nUntil 2005, Norwegian law held private secondary schools to be illegal unless they offered a \"religious or pedagogic alternative\", so the only private schools in existence were religious (Christian), Steiner/Waldorf, Montessori schools, and . The first \"standard\" private upper secondary schools opened in the fall of 2005.\n\nPrior to 1994 there were three branches of upper secondary schooling: \"General\" (language, history, etc.), \"mercantile\" (accounting, etc.), and \"vocational\" (electronics, carpentry, etc.) studies. The high school reform of 1994 (\"Reform 94\") merged these branches into a single system. Among the goals of the reform was that everybody should have a certain amount of \"general studies\" large enough to make them eligible for higher education later, meaning more theory in vocational studies, and it should be possible to cross over from one education path to another without losing too much credit. In the old system, two years of carpentry would be wasted if you wanted to switch to general studies, but in the new system you could keep credit for at least half of it.\n\nSince the introduction of the reform \"Kunnskapsløftet\" (\"the knowledge promise\" or \"the lifting of knowledge\", the word \"løfte\" having two meanings) in the fall of 2006, a student can apply for a general studies (\"studiespesialisering\") or a vocational studies (\"yrkesfag\") path. Inside these main paths there are many sub-paths to follow. An upper secondary school usually offers general and vocational curriculum. Vocational studies usually follow a typical structure named the \"2+2 model\": After two years of school training (with workshops and short internship in industry), the student goes in apprenticeship for two years in an enterprise or a public institution. The apprenticeship is divided into one year of training and one year of effective work. Some vocational curriculum are nonetheless entirely school-based, and other include 3 years of apprenticeship instead of 2.\n\nThe new reform makes the incorporation of IT into the schooling mandatory, and many counties (responsible for the public high schools) offer laptops to general studies students for free or for a small fee. Kunnskapsløftet also makes it harder to switch between electives that you take in the second and third year in the general studies path.\n\nStudents graduating upper secondary school are called \"Russ\" in Norwegian. Most of them choose to celebrate with lots of parties and festivities, which, impractically, take place a few weeks before the final examinations of the final year.\n\nThe titles of educators in Norwegian schools vary with the degrees they have.\n\n\nHigher education is anything beyond upper secondary school, and normally lasts 3 years or more. To be accepted to most higher education schools you must have attained a general university admissions certificate (\"generell studiekompetanse\"). This can be achieved by taking general studies while in upper secondary school or through the law of 23/5 where a person must be above 23 years of age, have 5 years of combined schooling and work experience and have passed exams in Norwegian, mathematics, natural sciences, English and social studies. Some degrees also require special electives in second and third grade (e.g. maths and physics for engineering studies.)\nWhere there are more applicants than students admitted, applicants are ranked based on their grades from upper secondary school. To gain access to studies commonly requiring a high GPA, like medicine, law and engineering, many students re-sit their upper secondary school examinations to improve their grades.\n\nHigher education is broadly divided into:\n\n\nThere are no formal distinction between vocational and non-vocational higher education.\n\nBefore the 19th century the main source for higher education of Norwegians were the University of Copenhagen.\n\nNorway has multiple different grading systems, both unique ones and ones that have been based on foreign grading systems. The formerly most common system of grades used at university level was based on a scale running from 1.0 (best) through 6.0 (worst) with 4.0 or below being considered passing grades.\n\nThe way the new Bologna system was introduced implies that students who had started their studies while the old system still was in effect will graduate with transcripts containing grades from both systems (i.e. both numbers and letters).\n\nLower levels of education use a scale running from 1 through 6, with 6 being the highest and 2 the lowest passing grade. For non-final tests and mid-term evaluations the grades are often postfixed with + or - (except 6+ and 1-) and it is also common to use grades such as 5/6 or 4/3 indicating borderline grades. However, the grades students get on their final paper are either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. A 6 is the equivalent to an A+, a 5 to an A or A-, 4 in the B range, 3 in the C range and so on.\n\n\n\n\nOfficial authorities\n\nReports from international organizations\n"}

{"id": "30161114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30161114", "title": "European Lifelong Learning Indicators", "text": "European Lifelong Learning Indicators\n\nThe development of the European Lifelong Learning Indicators (ELLI) is an initiative of the non-profit Bertelsmann Stiftung to monitor the state of lifelong learning in Europe. The main focus of the ELLI project is the ELLI Index. The ELLI index is an annually updated composite indicator summarizing the state of lifelong learning for European countries. The ELLI IT platform is an online portal that provides access to regional data related to learning and socio-economic outcomes in Europe.\n\nThe ELLI Index is an annual measure of lifelong learning at national and sub-national levels in Europe. The ELLI Index is a composite index created from several other variables. The variables used to create the ELLI Index describe the different learning environments of school, community, work and home life. The variables cover the range of ages from birth to post-retirement. The ELLI Index measures learning in four different domains taken from the UNESCO framework completed by Jacques Delors that include learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be.\n\nThe ELLI project references the conceptual framework developed by UNESCO's International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century under the leadership of Jacques Delors. Its report identifies four pillars of lifelong learning: \"learning to know\", \"learning to do\", \"learning to live together\" and \"learning to be\".\n\nThe conceptual framework of ELLI is a revised version of the UNESCO framework. The revisions are based on changes that reflect the European context and European policy environment and have been adapted according to existing data. The operationalization of the dimensions defined by UNESCO using data sources was developed by the Canadian Council on Learning for the Canadian Composite Learning Index (CLI).\n\nThe dimension of learning to know predominantly assesses the learning of young people within the formal education system. By including data on the formal system, ELLI measures the input and outcomes of the area in which most ministries of education allocate the majority of their budget and on which policy decision making and policy directions currently place their emphasis. In terms of investment, this dimension contains indicators on total expenditure on education and training. The range of learning opportunities for formal education that are included in ELLI are pre-school, school, higher education and adult education institutions. This pillar also measures learning outcomes from traditional core disciplines such as math, science and reading in secondary schools, as well as completion and attainment rates for post-secondary education. The learning to know pillar covers the majority of the political priorities related to education as stated by European member states.\n\nThis dimension measures the participation rates, learning opportunities and investment (by employers, government and individuals) in job-related skills. These skills can improve economic performance and social inclusion through increasing job prospects and career opportunities for the individual and improve competitiveness of the enterprise, region or country. This dimension predominantly measures adults’ continual professional development at their place of work through formal, non-formal and informal learning opportunities. It also measures students’ participation in the vocational track of the formal education system which, depending on the country/region, can also include young people within compulsory education. The variables used to construct this dimension predominantly reflect investment in learning by employers, government and individuals.\n\nThis dimension measures individual-level attitudes and dispositions that promote social cohesion such as trust, intercultural competence and political and community engagement. Learning and education has long been\nconsidered more than an issue of creating skills for employability and has been part of a social policy tool to sustain democracy, create social mobility and increase levels of health and social inclusion. This dimension tries to capture the learning of the values of democracy, tolerance and trust and the skills and interest to be able to engage other people. Learning to live together starts at home, with learning from parents and siblings, and continues through interactions at school and work and through involvement in civil society organizations. In most European countries there is a specific curriculum subject on citizenship through which many of these competences are developed; however, research has indicated that it is the level of democracy at school that is the key driver for developing these competences. The investment of individuals, families, communities and countries is often much more hidden for the learning to live together dimension as there are fewer exams and qualifications in this field compared to traditional subject-based disciplines.\n\nThis dimension predominantly measures self-directed learning and individuals’ efforts and investment in learning. This learning is facilitated by government provision and information provided on learning opportunities, but these provisions are considerably less than the provisions for compulsory formal education. This dimension captures informal and implicit learning that happens through engagement and participation in the home and through community and cultural activities. The implicit learning measures include activities undertaken in which the individual does not set out with a learning objective in mind and for which there is no certification of learning achievements from participation. Nevertheless, learning is often highly successful through this style of learning because participation is usually motivated by personal interest. Learning in the home often makes use of the internet, incidental access to information, virtual communities and virtual relationships. In addition to implicit learning, there is one indicator in this dimension on explicit participation in lifelong learning. This indicator, which could potentially fit in all dimensions, is placed here because individuals participate in learning for many reasons. Ultimately, participation in lifelong learning is largely voluntary, which means that those who choose to engage in it are more likely to be motivated by the interests of personal growth and development, which is the focus of this dimension.\n\nELLI is a heuristic for understanding lifelong learning across Europe. In this context, lifelong learning is understood as a continual process of personal and social development and is understood to reflect not only the benefits that employability and a competitive economy offer but also the individual and social benefits of health, happiness and citizen empowerment. According to this perspective, the objectives of learning need to reflect a holistic understanding of the individual and combine a variety of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes. From this perspective, the aim of learning is to enhance the qualities of self-esteem, resilience and a positive attitude towards learning and to develop critical thinking and the ability to learn new things. The ELLI index is the first composite index used to describe lifelong learning in Europe.\n\nThe ELLI Index can be used to understand how a country or region is performing in relation to others in the field of lifelong learning. The ELLI Index should be interpreted as the a summary of the context and outcomes of lifelong learning as they relate to the social and economic well-being of regions.\n\nThe ELLI Index does not provide an in-depth evaluation of a country or region's policy and performance on lifelong learning. The assumptions used in the creation of the ELLI Index may not be an appropriate basis for comparison for all contexts. When the results are taken out of their specific context there is the risk that they may be oversimplified or misused to make biased or partisan specific policy claims. The ELLI Index is a starting point for analysis; specific research questions may be more appropriately addressed with more specific data.\n\nThe ELLI Index is created using a statistical algorithm to combine data provided by statistical agencies and commercial providers into five values for each region with sufficient data. This method uses a combination of principal components analysis and linear regression to produce the values for the sub-indices representing the separate learning dimensions. The values for the four learning dimensions are combined to produce the overall ELLI index using inverse-variance weighting. This methodology was developed for the CLI and subsequently validated by an independent review and sensitivity analysis\n\nThe overall ELLI Index results show that the Nordic countries Denmark, Sweden and Finland and, in addition, the Netherlands\nrank highest. Particularly Denmark and Sweden have been the most successful countries in Europe at implementing the idea of\nlifelong and lifewide learning.\n\nThe top performers are followed by a group of countries that consist of mainly Central European and Anglo-Saxon countries.\nThe next group of countries, which are below the EU average, are from Southern and Eastern Europe and range from the Czech\nRepublic to Poland. The lowest performing group of countries is also in Southern and Eastern Europe,\nincluding Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. However, there are many exceptions to these general patterns. Slovenia,\na former communist country and new member of the European Union, performs well, scoring above the EU average and on par\nwith Germany.\n\nFurther details are documented in: Bertelsmann Stiftung, The ELLI Index 2010, Making Lifelong Learning Tangible.\n\nThe ELLI IT platform (www.elli.org) provides access to regional data related to learning and socio-economic outcomes in Europe. Theplatform is a web application interface to a geodatabase. Currently the regional units in the database are the 27 countries of the European Union and subnational administrative units (NUTS levels defined by Eurostat. In the current stage the values for subnational administrative units are only available for Germany. The data populating the databased are provided by Eurostat, regional governments and private data providers.\n\nThe ELLI IT platform has basic database application functions of querying and updating. Users may add new data for existing geographic entities but may not create new geographic entities. All queries and updates to the database are managed by the user interface of the ELLI IT platform.\n\nUsers are provided with tools like scorecards, charting, Google motion charts and mapping that may be used to visualize and communicate the data for a specific region in the platform. All of the data provided by the ELLI IT platform may be displayed on a customizable map.\n\nLearning takes place on the regional level. Local authorities want to know and manage lifelong learning in the regional level. Therefore, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is developing an ELLI-learning report, which allows to display indicators of learning. The selected indicators are selected according to their importance for steering and monitoring resources for learning and monitoring the results of learning. The ELLI Report on learning is developed in cooperation with the SOFI, Göttingen.\n\nDespite representing a small part of the ELLI project, the majority of the media response has been to the ELLI Index. Coverage in media has included national news magazines in several countries in Europe and in Canada.\n\n"}

EMT is a quality label for translation programmes that offer a Master's degree. The DGT awards the label to higher education programmes that meet the EMT quality standards for translator training. Master programmes that meet these standards can become members of the EMT network. The initial project was launched in 2006 and the first network was set up in December 2009, following a rigorous selection in which applicant university programmes were evaluated by academic assessors. This first EMT Network consisted of 34 universities in 16 European countries. In 2011, 20 more programmes were selected, bringing the total number of members to 54 programmes in 20 European countries. In the most recent selection round in 2014, EMT membership increased to 63 member programmes from 22 countries, including two non-EU members (from Switzerland). The project serves as a model in its approach to convergence in higher education in Europe, in the broad context of the Bologna process.\nWhy was the EMT set up?\n\nThere is a growing demand for highly qualified translators who can provide multilingual communication in both the public and the private sector. Due to the quickly evolving translation markets, professional translators need to cope with activities not traditionally regarded as ‘pure' translation, such as localisation, editing, subtitling or project management. Professionally oriented translator training is needed in order to ensure a good match between graduate competences and employer requirements.\n\nWhat do EMT universities offer?\n\nEMT programmes offer a Master's degree, corresponding to a one- or two-year programme in translation (between 60 and 120 points in the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). At the core of each curriculum is a common set of basic skills in translation, regardless of the language combinations. The core of the EMT programmes is defined by the following six professional competences that graduates should acquire: \nThe EMT quality label\n\nOnly members of the EMT Network can use the EMT name and logo as a quality label when referring to their master’s programmes in translation. The logo is protected as a registered EU trademark. Members receive a membership certificate and sign the EMT charter, which sets out the obligations of EMT members.\nActivities of the EMT network\n\nEMT members meet twice a year to foster cooperation and exchange best practices in the training of future translators who should be competent in all aspects of translation service provision, including marketing, customer relations, time and budget management and invoicing, as well as training in new technologies and specialist fields. To this end the member programmes constantly adapt their programmes to the changing professional working environment. The meetings used to take place in Brussels, but it was recently decided to organise meetings in the home countries of EMT universities as well.\n\nAfter each selection round, the EMT members elect the EMT Board, which decides on strategic issues and meets regularly, face-to-face or in videoconference. The next selection round will be launched in the autumn of 2018. How are the activities of the EMT supported by the European Commission? The Directorate-General for Translation supports the EMT by:\n\nThe \"European Master's in Conference Interpreting\" has a similar approach.\n"}

{"id": "40468223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40468223", "title": "Folk high school", "text": "Folk high school\n\nFolk high schools (Danish: \"Folkehøjskole;\" Dutch: \"Volkshogeschool;\" Finnish: \"kansanopisto\" and \"työväenopisto\" or \"kansalaisopisto;\" German: \"Volkshochschule\" and (a few) \"Heimvolkshochschule;\" Norwegian: \"Folkehøgskole;\" Swedish: \"Folkhögskola;\" Hungarian: \"népfőiskola\") are institutions for adult education that generally do not grant academic degrees, though certain courses might exist leading to that goal. They are most commonly found in Nordic countries and in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The concept originally came from the Danish writer, poet, philosopher, and pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig (1783–1872). Grundtvig was inspired by the Marquis de Condorcet's \"Report on the General Organization of Public Instruction\" which was written in 1792 during the French Revolution. The revolution had a direct influence on popular education in France. In the United States, a Danish folk school called Danebod was founded in Tyler, Minnesota.\n\nDespite similar names and somewhat similar goals, the institutions in Germany and Sweden are quite different from those in Denmark and Norway. Folk high schools in Germany and Sweden are in fact much closer to the institutions known as \"folkeuniversitet\" in Norway and Denmark, which provide adult education. However, unlike the \"folkuniversitet,\" folk high schools in Sweden are not connected with a regular university. The Finnish adult education centers called \"työväenopisto\" and \"kansalaisopisto\" (Swedish: \"arbetarinstitut\", literally \"workers' institute\") are also part of the adult education tradition.\n\nOther countries have also been inspired by Grundtvig's concept of popular education. In Nigeria, the United States, and India, a few schools have been built upon Grundtvig's principles for education.\n\nGrundtvig, regarded as the founder of the folk high school, received inspiration for the concept from the English boarding schools, but Grundtvig's focus was not on formal education but on popular education. The idea was to give the peasantry and other people from the lower echelons of society a higher educational level through personal development; what Grundtvig called \"the living word\". The language and history of the fatherland, its constitution and main industries (farming) along with folk songs should be the guiding principles for an education based on a Christian framework.\n\nThe first folk high school was established in 1844 in Rødding, Denmark. The school in Rødding, however, was somewhat aristocratic as chiefly civil servants and rich farmers were enrolled.\n\nAnother pioneer for the folk high school was the teacher Christen Kold. His, for that time, highly unorthodox way of teaching gave the folk high schools a broader democratic basis in comparison to the initial religious focus. The teaching took place from November to March because students did farm work the rest of the year. Kold's goal was for students to return to the school regularly in the winter to continue their education. In the beginning only young men could attend the courses, but in 1861 young women also gained access to folk high schools when teaching began being offered from May to July. The men still only attended during winter.\n\nThe breakthrough for the idea was the Second War of Schleswig in 1864 when Denmark had to surrender a large part of its territory. This incident allowed the growth of a new Danish consciousness and nationalism based on enlightenment of the people. Denmark's loss of territory to Prussia hit the Danish national consciousness hard, but there was a group of young men determined to benefit from the disastrous war, which became a catalyst for a new Danish identity. They established folk high schools all around the country and by 1867 twenty-one folk high schools had opened. Almost everyone working at the folk high schools had been an apprentice of Grundtvig. In 1918 the number of folk high schools in Denmark had reached 68.\n\nThe modern folk high schools vary significantly. Some still have a religious focus but most of them are secular. The schools are still \"Grundtvigian\" folk high schools which means that their focus is on enlightenment, ethics, morality and democracy although they are not taught explicitly. The Grundtvigian philosophy is embedded in the teaching of various subjects, e.g. the arts, gymnastics, and journalism. Most of the schools have an area of expertise, for example sports, music, art or writing. Since no degree or diploma is awarded the teaching is freer and more informal than at ordinary educational institutions. Most Scandinavian folk high schools are boarding schools where the students live for 2–6 months., and some schools offer programs for an entire year.\n\nGrundtvig fought for a school with popular education as the primary focus. The folk high school movement was an act against a conservative ideal of both education and culture. An act against an ideal of literacy and book-learning, a use of language unknown to common people and a learning ideal where the primary relation was between the individual and the book alone.\n\nThe movement therefore started as a row with the old school. Grundtvig fought for a public education as an alternative to the university elite. The folk high schools should be for those wanting to \"learn\" in general and to help people form part of human relations and society.\n\nThe folk high schools have changed naturally – some also radically – through time, but many of Grundtvig's core ideas about the folk high school are still to be found in the way they are run today. The folk high school of today is engaged in a complex modern reality and influenced both by national, international and global questions.\n\nOne of the main concepts still to be found at the folk high schools today is \"lifelong learning\". The schools should educate for life. They should shed light on basic questions surrounding life of people both as individuals and as members of society.\n\nTo Grundtvig the ideal was to give the students a sense of a common best and focusing on life as it really is. Therefore, Grundtvig never set down guidelines for the future schools or a detailed description of how they should be run. He declared that the folk high schools should be arranged and developed according to life as it is and the schools should not hold exams because the education and enlightenment was a sufficient reward.\n\nThe essential element was and is the life at the schools. A folk high school becomes what it is because of the individuals of which it is made. Learning happens across social positions and differences – the teacher learns from the student and vice versa in a living exchange and mutual teaching. For Grundtvig dialogue across differences was essential – the ideal was that people must learn to bear with the differences of each other before enlightenment can be realized.\n\nThe character of folk high schools differ from country to country, but usually institutions have the following common features:\n\n\nEspecially in non-German speaking countries, the folk high schools may be boarding schools or may mainly offer courses for adults age 18–30.\n\nIn addition to the Nordic countries and Germany there are also folk high schools in Switzerland, Austria, and France.\n\nThe first folk high school was founded in Rødding, Denmark, in 1844. It began on the initiative of Christen Kold, who was a follower of Grundtvig. The school was inspired by the need to educate those not fortunate enough to have an education and the poor, or peasantry, who could not spare the time or the money to attend a university. Among the other old folk high schools in Denmark are Testrup Folk High School (founded 1866), Askov Højskole (founded 1865) and Ry Højskole (founded 1892) in Jutland; Vallekilde Folk High School in Zealand (founded 1865), and Rødkilde Højskole on Møn (founded 1866). The International People's College in Helsingør is unique among the Danish folk high schools in that it is the most international one in Denmark, with classes taught in English and teachers and students from countries all around the world attending.\n\nThere are around 70 folk high schools in Denmark. The principal subjects of instruction vary from the creative arts such as music, arts, design, writing, to intellectual courses such as religion, philosophy, literature and psychology. Some schools even have courses that specialize in sports. Tuition varies, but is typically around 1300 Danish kroner per week, including board and lodging.\n\nIn recent history, globalization has exercised an increasingly important influence on Danish schools. Many courses are open to foreigners as well as Danes, and many courses include travelling or voluntary stays in other countries as part of the curriculum.\n\nIn 1889, Sofia Hagman started the first folk high school in Finland in Kangasala. Public, private, secular and religious folk high schools are common in Finland, and there are also worker's high schools, which are governed by the labor movement. There are 184 folk high schools in Finland, with an annual course attendance of 650,000, in 2 million hours of lessons, which are substantial numbers for a country of 5.5 million people. Unlike in Finnish public education, there are tuition fees, per-course and per-lesson fees. The most common subjects are handicraft skills, music, languages, physical education, visual arts, theater and dance.\n\nIn 1866, during the Second Empire, Jean Macé founded the \"Ligue de l'enseignement\" (\"Teaching League\"), which was devoted to popular instruction. Following the split between the Anarchists and the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress, popular education remained an important part of the workers' movement, especially in the anarcho-syndicalist movement which set up, with Fernand Pelloutier, various \"Bourses du travail\" centres, where workers gathered and discussed politics and sciences. The Jules Ferry laws that were passed in the 1880s established free, secular, mandatory public education as one of the founding principles of the Third Republic. In addition, many teachers were strong supporters of Alfred Dreyfus during the Dreyfus Affair of the 1890s. Afterward, some teachers set up free educational lectures on humanist topics in order to struggle against the spread of anti-semitism in France.\nIn more recent times, following the 1981 presidential election Minister of Education Alain Savary supported Jean Lévi's initiative to create a public high school that would deliver the baccalauréat but would be organized on the principles of \"workers' self-management\" (or \"autogestion\"). This high school took the name \"Lycée autogéré de Paris\" (LAP). The LAP was explicitly inspired by the secondary school Vitruve, which opened in 1962 in the 20th arrondissement of Paris (and is still active), Oslo Experimental High School, which opened in 1967 in Norway, and Saint-Nazaire Experimental High School, which opened six months before the LAP. Theoretical influences include the works of Célestin Freinet, Raymond Fonvieille, Fernand Oury, and other theoreticians of the institutional pedagogy, institutional analysis (René Lourau in particular), and institutional psychotherapeutic movements.\n\nFolk high schools in Germany, Switzerland and Austria are usually funded on a local level and provide non-credit courses for adults in:\n\n\nThis type of folk high school is currently most widespread in Germany. Because they offer preparatory classes for school exams, in Germany these schools also function as the equivalent of adult high schools in other countries. Germany also has folk high schools that are boarding schools, called \"Heimvolkshochschulen\".\n\nThe first folk high school in Norway, Sagatun, was founded in 1864. As of 2012, there were 77 folk high schools spread across the country, thirty of which were Christian schools. Folk high schools provide opportunities in general education, primarily for young adults. These schools are different from lower secondary schools, upper secondary schools, and higher education. All students are eligible for normal financial aid. Some folk high schools are connected to some sort of organization, but a large number of them are owned by a foundation and some are owned by the county. Most courses last for one year, but a few schools give a second year course. Common course options include outdoor skills, land use skills, the arts such as photography or painting, music such as jazz or rock, Norwegian language & culture, and travel skills.\n\nThe first folk high schools in Sweden were established in 1868. The first school was open only to men, but already in 1870, the first folk high school for females was founded by Fredrique Paijkull.\n\nAs of 2008, there are about 150 folk high schools throughout the country, most of which are situated in the countryside, often in remote areas. Tuition is free, and the students are eligible for normal financial aid for expenses such as accommodation and other school costs. After graduating, the students are eligible to study at a university.\n\nSome schools, for example Södra Vätterbygdens Folkhögskola near Jönköping, cooperate with schools in other countries and have an exchange student program.\n\nIn 1998, the Grundtvig Movement of Nigeria led by Dr. Kachi Ozumba Snr. established Grundtvig International Secondary School, an independent co-educational secondary school built upon Grundtvig's principles for education.\n\nAmericans John C. Campbell and Olive Dame helped create a folk high school in rural Appalachia based on observations of European folk high schools. The John C. Campbell Folk School opened in 1925 in Brasstown, North Carolina, and it is still offering classes today. Students can learn American traditional arts and crafts, including blacksmithing, ceramics, cooking, jewelry, dance and music.\n\nMyles Horton, who co-founded the civil rights-focused Highlander Folk School in New Market, Tennessee in 1932, was also inspired by the Danish folk high school movement, as can be read in his autobiography \"The Long Haul\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "255232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255232", "title": "Graduate Management Admission Test", "text": "Graduate Management Admission Test\n\nThe Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT ( ())) is a computer adaptive test (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as an MBA. It requires knowledge of certain specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success. It can be taken up to five times a year. Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.\n\nGMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. Business schools use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate management programs, including MBA, Master of Accountancy, Master of Finance programs and others. The GMAT is administered in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world. According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing acceptability of GRE scores. According to GMAC, it has continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that the exam predicts success in business school programs.\n\nIn 1953, the organization now called the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) began as an association of nine business schools, whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years, it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually. Initially used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world. On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources.\n\nThe intended purpose of the GMAT is to predict student success in graduate business programs. According to GMAC, there is a .459 correlation (21% variance) between total GMAT scores and mid-program student grades based on data it collected between 1997 and 2004. Independent research has shown significantly different results. Independent research has shown that the GMAT can explain only 4.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA (Grade Point Average) while undergraduate GPA can explain 17.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA. Additionally, more recent independent research has shown that the GMAT does not add predictive validity after undergraduate GPA and work experience have been considered and that even undergraduate GPA alone can be used in lieu of considering the GMAT.\n\nThe GMAT exam consists of four sections: an analytical writing assessment, an integrated reasoning section, a quantitative section, and a verbal section. Total testing time is three hours and seven minutes. Test takers have 30 minutes for the analytical writing assessment and another 30 minutes to work through 12 questions, which often have multiple parts, on the integrated reasoning section and are given 62 minutes to work through 31 questions in the quantitative section and another 65 minutes to get through 36 questions in the verbal section.\n\nThe quantitative and verbal sections of the GMAT exam are both multiple-choice and are administered in the computer-adaptive format, adjusting to a test taker’s level of ability. At the start of the quantitative and verbal sections, test takers are presented with a question of average difficulty. As questions are answered correctly, the computer presents the test taker with increasingly difficult questions and as questions are answered incorrectly the computer presents the test taker with questions of decreasing difficulty. This process continues until test takers complete each section, at which point the computer will have an accurate assessment of their ability level in that subject area and come up with a raw score for each section.\n\nOn July 11, 2017, the GMAC announced that from now on the order in which the different parts of the GMAT are taken can be chosen at the beginning of the exam.\n\nThree options will be available at the test center:\n\nIn April 2018, the GMAC officially shortened the test by half an hour, shortening the verbal and quant sections from 75 minutes each to 65 and 62 minutes, respectively, and shortening some of the instruction screens.\n\nThe AWA consists of one 30-minute writing task—analysis of an argument. It is important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay will be given two independent ratings and these ratings are averaged together to determine the test taker's AWA score. One rating is given by a computerized reading evaluation and another is given by a person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without knowledge of what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring engine is an electronic system that evaluates more than 50 structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas, syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differ by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader is required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.\n\nThe analytical writing assessment is graded on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) in half-point intervals (a score of zero means the answer was gibberish or obviously not written on the assigned topic or the test taker failed to write anything at all on the AWA).\n\nIntegrated Reasoning (IR) is a section introduced in June 2012 and is designed to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills being tested by the integrated reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for today’s incoming students. The integrated reasoning section consists of 12 questions (which often consist of multiple parts themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Integrated reasoning scores range from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), this section is scored separately from the quantitative and verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA sections do not contribute to the total GMAT score.\n\nThe integrated reasoning section includes four question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part analysis. In the table analysis section, test takers are presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column.\n\nThe quantitative section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, interpret graphic data, and analyze and use information given in a problem. Questions require knowledge of certain algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. There are two types of quantitative questions: problem solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph paper which are given to them at the testing center. Scores range from 0 to 60, although GMAC only reports scores between 6 and 51.\n\nProblem solving questions are designed to test the ability to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems. Data sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and determine at what point there is enough information to solve a problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information given to solve a particular problem.\n\nThe verbal section of the GMAT exam includes the following question types: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. Each question type gives five answer options from which to select. Verbal scores range from 0 to 60; however, scores below 9 or above 44 are rare.\n\nAccording to GMAC, the reading comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long. According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills. According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests grammar and effective communication skills. From the available answer options, the test taker should select the most effective construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence.\n\nThe total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.).\n\nThe score distribution conforms to a bell curve with a standard deviation of approximately 120 points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and 670. More precisely, over the three-year period 2014--2017 the mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45 points.\n\nThe final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question his score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range.\n\nAfter previewing his/her unofficial GMAT score, a GMAT test taker has two minutes to decide whether to keep or cancel a GMAT score at the test center. A test taker can also cancel a score online within the 72 hours after the scheduled exam start time. A cancelled score can be reinstated for 4 years and 11 months after the date of the test for a fee of $50.\n\nTest takers may register for the GMAT either online at mba.com or by calling one of the test centers. To schedule an exam, an appointment must be made at one of the designated test centers. The GMAT may not be taken more than once within 16 days but no more than five times in a rolling 12-month period and no more than eight times total, even if the scores are canceled. Official GMAT exam study materials are available on the mba.com online store and through third-party vendors. The cost of the exam is $250. All applicants are required to present valid ID when taking the test. Upon completion of the test, test takers have the option of canceling or reporting their scores. As of July 2014, test takers were allowed to view their score before making this decision.\n\nThere are test preparation companies that offer GMAT courses. Other available test preparation resources include university text books, GMAT preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources.\n\nIn order to effectively evaluate all candidates, some graduate schools offer GMAT Waivers. A GMAT waiver is designed for working professionals who have multiple years of experience and would like to forego taking the GMAT. If requesting a GMAT waiver, you must include a letter with your professional experience. The programs evaluate GMAT waivers on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n"}

Since inception, foundation has been supporting orphaned and vulnerable children in Africa through education and material support. Education support has been provided through the Capernaum Scholarship for orphaned and vulnerable children and the Joshua Nkomo Scholarship for highly gifted children. Other than Education support, the foundation also supports beneficiaries with Guardianship and Pastoral Care. In the communities it serves, the foundation partners with healthcare and crisis response institutions.\n\nFounded in 1996 by Strive and Tsitsi Masiyiwa the foundation operates as a Capernaum Trust, offering primary, secondary and University scholarships to orphaned and vulnerable children.\n\nIn 2005 the Joshua Nkomo Scholarship fund for the talented and gifted was launched for highly gifted students that did not fall into the orphaned and vulnerable category. In 2006 the Christian Community Partnership Trust was launched to offer pastoral support to the vulnerable.\n\nIn 2008 the foundation launched the Waterford Kamhlaba scholarship to take Joshua Nkomo Scholarship beneficiaries to Waterford Kamhlaba College in Swaziland.\n\nIn 2008 the foundation ventured into health and crisis relief through the National Health Care Trust which participated in the fight against the 2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak Tokwe Mukosi disaster in Zimbabwe as well as the fight against Ebola in Africa.\n\nIn 2010 the foundation spread its footprint to Lesotho and Burundi.\n\nIn the period 2010- 2015 the foundation achieved the following:\n\n\nIn 2015 the Higherlife Foundation merged all four Trusts into one foundation, focused on education. It also partnered with Yale University in the Yale Young African Scholars Programme.\n\nThe Higherlife Foundation Basic Education programme is delivered through the Capernaum Scholarship, a scholarship targeted at orphaned and vulnerable children between the ages of 5 and 18 years. The scholarship includes fees and tuition from early childhood to high school and has been running for the past 19 years. Higherlife foundations biggest programmes are currently running in Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Burundi. In Zimbabwe the scholarship supports eligible children in Grade 1 to Form 4. In Lesotho it offers scholarships to eligible children in Form A to Form D, while in Burundi the scholarship covers eligible children from Grade 1 to Grade 10. Along with the academic education, the Basic Education programme incorporates mentorship, life skills training and specialized psychosocial support led by the Foundation’s Guardianship and Pastoral Care unit, in collaboration with expert partners. The scholarship program covers tuition, management levies, examination fees and other support materials. Capernaum Scholars in dire need of food are supplied with food hampers. In addition, scholars with Chronic diseases and those who fall sick/ill receive supplies of medication and visit Hospitals/Clinics.\n\nThe foundation's talent development programme is delivered through the merit-based Joshua Nkomo Scholarship. The programme, now in its 10th year, focuses on identifying young African talent through a rigorous selection process and creating the opportunity for them to get the best and most relevant education at world-class local and overseas tertiary learning institutions. The programme includes leadership training and mentorship through internships, community involvement and lifelong engagement through an active alumni network. The Joshua Nkomo scholarships are offered to the best students in the final 2 to 3 years of high school, and top university and college students in their first and straight Master's degrees. The Higherlife Foundation Talent Development programme currently offers merit scholarships to gifted students in several African countries, including Zimbabwe, Burundi, Lesotho, Rwanda and Ghana.\n\nThe foundation's Health and Crisis support programme works with partners in health to address health issues that would negatively affect beneficiaries’ health and their ability to access quality education.\nIt works to alleviate and prevent epidemics and disease outbreaks that affect children. It partners with relevant public and private partners to mitigate the impact of health crises and natural disasters on communities in which Higherlife Foundation's beneficiaries live.\n\nThe Higherlife Foundation Guardianship and Pastoral Care programme addresses the social issues that affect its beneficiaries’ ability to learn, excel and lead normal lives. It focuses on empowering the children served by the foundation with psychosocial support and essential life skills needed to overcome the stigma and emotional and psychological challenges of growing up as an orphaned child. The Guardianship and Pastoral Care programme also works in collaboration with expert partners, governments and policy makers to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of children in general, and the rights of girl children in particular.\n"}

Following demands from Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur and others, Viceroy Lord Hardinge proposed on 2 February 1912, that a new university should be established in this partition of Bengal.\n\nThe University was established as compensation for the annulment of the 1905 Partition of Bengal. The partition had established East Bengal and Assam as a separate province, with Dhaka as its capital. However, the partition was abolished in 1911. In 1913, public opinion was solicited before the university scheme was given its final shape, and the Secretary of State approved it in December 1913. The first vice-chancellor of the university was Philip Joseph Hartog, who had been academic registrar of the University of London for 17 years.\n\nEstablished in 1921, under the Dacca University Act 1920 of the Indian Legislative Council, the university is modelled after British universities. Academic activities started on 1 July 1921, with three faculties: Arts, Science, and Law. Classes were taught in 12 Departments: Sanskrit and Bengali, English, Education, History, Arabic and Islamic Studies, Persian and Urdu, Philosophy, Economics and Politics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Law. Initially there were three dormitories for students: Salimullah Muslim Hall, Dacca Hall and Jagannath Hall.\n\nThe university continued to grow under the direction of leaders including Harry Langley, A. F. Rahman, R. C. Majumdar, and Mahmud Hussain. Under Vice-Chancellor Hussain, the University consolidated its fundamental focus on academics. It also made national headlines when he extended an invitation to then-President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, who declined citing 'security reasons'. This was the first of many subsequent refusals from high-ranking officials to visit East Pakistan.\n\nThere were few students in the early years of the University of Dhaka. Enrollment in the first few years is shown in the table below:\n\nIn 1926, the University of Dhaka invited Rabindranath Tagore to attend a conference called \"The Meaning of Art\". He came to Dhaka and visited Curzon Hall on 10 February 1926. Tagore is often accused of opposing the establishment of the university at Dhaka even though no evidence of such opposition has ever been found. He was awarded D.Litt by Dhaka University in 1936.\n\nStudents and teachers of the University of Dhaka played a vital role in the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh. The Ordinance of 1961 was annulled and substituted by the Dacca University Order of 1973., The new Order restored autonomy, and provided a democratic atmosphere for the teachers and students where they could engage freely in academic and intellectual pursuits.\n\nTeachers at the University of Dhaka who were killed during the liberation war include:\n\n"}

Attendance consists of both newly commissioned USAF officers (i.e., second lieutenants) and more senior commissioned USAF officers (e.g., first lieutenants or captains and, in very rare instances, majors) who previously served in non-rated non-flying assignments.\n\nIFT replaced three earlier programs at separate locations, known as:\n\nAll three programs were originally for pilot candidates only, versus the current pilots and navigators-\"cum\"-CSOs, and only applied to pilot candidates who did not already hold at least an FAA Private Pilot Certificate. These programs were consolidated into the single current program, a civilian contractor operation under direct USAF auspices and oversight of the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas, and its subordinate 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG) at the USAF Academy, Colorado. IFT is conducted at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado and has the greatest similarity to the former FSPOT employed for OTS graduates, since it is conducted at a single site and all students are already commissioned USAF officers.\n\nIFT students must be undergraduate flying training (UFT) candidates and be medically qualified with a Federal Aviation Administration Class III airman medical certificate and a USAF Flying Class 1 or 1A flight physical, as appropriate. The IFT curriculum is highly structured and very fast-paced.\n\nThe IFT program is under the direct cognizance of U.S. Air Force's 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and began operations on 1 October 2006. Doss Aviation, under contract with United States Air Force (USAF), conducts flight screening for 1,300 to 1,700 USAF officers annually. As the gateway to USAF aviation, IFT provides initial flying training allowing students to successfully transition to the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program (ENJJPT), Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT), Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Training (UHT), and Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) at one of several air force bases, naval air stations, and one army air field throughout the United States. The IFT campus is located immediately adjacent to the Pueblo Memorial Airport, Pueblo, Colorado.\n\nStudents are paired up into hotel-style rooms. They share a bathroom, and are provided a desk and dresser for their personal belongings. A single building encompasses all the facilities the students need; students never need to step outside the facility except to access their aircraft. The large building houses the gym, which includes a workout gym with volleyball and basketball courts, weightlifting equipment and treadmills, as well as a cafeteria and a small communal room known as the Tiger Den. A large auditorium is used during the first week of training to teach students the basics of aviation. A second floor houses all the classrooms where students study and meet with their instructor pilots before performing their graded flights.\n\n"}

The sketch pokes fun at the numerous degrees awarded by universities and folk high schools, which grant their recipients social status without providing any meaningful qualifications for the labor market.\n\nThe term has since gained currency in German to refer to superfluous, useless, vanity-driven, or purchased academic qualifications (such as from a diploma mill), similar to the English terms underwater basket weaving or Mickey Mouse degree.\n\nThe sketch \"Yodeling School\" was produced by Radio Bremen as part of the episode \"Loriot VI\" and first broadcast on Das Erste on 7 December 1978. The sketch takes place in the \"Institute for Modern Yodeling\", where the adult students are practicing yodeling texts (for example: \"Holleri du dödl di, diri diri dudl dö\"). The yodeling instructor, Dr. Vogler is meticulously dictating the correct pronunciation to his students, who repeat his dictation in unison. In response to an incorrect answer (\"Dö dudl dö\") by Mrs. Hoppenstedt (Evelyn Hamann), Dr. Vogler corrects her and says that \"Dö dudl dö is future perfect tense used at sunrise.\"\n\nMrs. Hoppenstedt is interviewed after the course by a reporter Viktor Schmoller (Loriot) for the \"Women's Journal of Radio Bremen\". In the interview, Mrs. Hoppenstedt explains her participation in the course that as a housewife and mother, when the children are out of the house, she wants to have the feeling that she is standing on her own feet, and wants to have \"something of her own\", a \"\"Jodeldiplom\".\"\n\nA serious \"yodeling diploma\", the so-called \"Jodlar-Prob\" exists in the Allgäu Alps.

Miller\n\nKenneth Raymond Miller (born July 14, 1948) is an American cell biologist and molecular biologist who is currently Professor of Biology and Royce Family Professor for Teaching Excellence at Brown University. Miller's primary research focus is the structure and function of cell membranes, especially chloroplast thylakoid membranes. Miller is a co-author of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by Prentice Hall since 1990. Miller, who is Roman Catholic, is opposed to creationism, including the intelligent design (ID) movement. He has written two books on the subject: \"Finding Darwin's God\", which argues that acceptance of evolution is compatible with a belief in God; and \"Only a Theory\", which explores ID and the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" case as well as its implications in science across America.\n\nMiller graduated from Rahway High School in Rahway, New Jersey before attending Brown University. At Brown, he received his Sc.B. in biology in 1970. He earned his Ph.D. in biology from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1974. From 1974 to 1980, he taught at Harvard University. His research involves problems of structure and function in biological membranes, often involving electron microscopy. In May 2014, Miller received the Laetare Medal at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nMiller is the co-author (with Boston College neurobiologist and marine biologist Joseph Levine) of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by Prentice Hall since 1990. The current edition was published in 2010 by Pearson (which now owns Prentice Hall). Initially, Prentice Hall approached Joseph Levine to write the textbook after reading an article he wrote in Smithsonian magazine; Levine, who is a former student of Miller's, then recruited Miller as a co-author. Miller and Levine have also co-written a college-level textbook published by the former D.C. Heath and Company, first edition in 1991, entitled \"Biology: Discovering Life\".\n\nMiller has voiced his support for what he calls \"pro-science\" candidates in politics. He has campaigned for school board and education candidates who support the teaching of evolution in Kansas and Ohio. In the science community, he has sought to elevate the understanding of scientists of the roots of the creationist movement, and to encourage the popularization of scientific concepts.\n\nMiller has appeared in court as a witness, and on panels debating the teaching of intelligent design in schools. In 2002, the Ohio State Board of Education held a public debate between two scientists, including Miller, and two proponents of intelligent design. He testified for the plaintiffs, but only as a fact witness (not as an expert), in \"Selman v. Cobb County\", testing the legality of stickers calling evolution a \"theory, not a fact\" that were placed on the biology textbook Miller authored. In 2005, the judge ruled that the stickers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This decision was vacated on appeal because of missing records of the previous trial. The case was remanded for additional evidentiary inquiry and new findings, and a list of factual issues that the court would probably want to address included as item 15 a reference to Miller's testimony regarding “the colloquial or popular understanding of the term [theory]” and the suggested question as to whether he has any qualifications to testify as an expert on the popular meaning of the word \"theory\". The case was remanded back to the lower court and was eventually settled out of court. Miller was also the plaintiff's lead expert witness in the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", challenging the school board's mandate to incorporate intelligent design into the curriculum. The judge in that case also ruled decisively in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nIn 2006 the American Society for Cell Biology gave him a Public Service Award. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) also recognized Miller for his contribution to the public education of evolution in the United States. Miller also appeared at the 2006 Dwight H. Terry Lectureship at Yale University, delivering his lecture \"Darwin, God, and Dover: What the Collapse of 'Intelligent Design' Means for Science and for Faith in America.\" He won the 2008 AAAS Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.\n\nHe also speaks at conferences, notably the Skeptics Society's Origins Conference in October 2008 with Nancey Murphy, Hugh Ross, Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Paul Davies, Christof Koch, Donald Prothero, and Victor J. Stenger. Miller has also spoken at the Veritas Forum on topics such as the relationship between science and religion and the existence of God.\n\nMiller has appearaned on the Comedy Central television show \"The Colbert Report\". Miller has also made many appearances on C-SPAN debating proponents of creationism and intelligent design. He has debated several supporters of intelligent design including biochemist Michael J. Behe.\n\nHe gave a Faraday Institute lecture in April 2009 on \"God, Darwin and Design\" and appeared on the \"Today Programme\" arguing, \"The issue of God is an issue on which reasonable people may differ, but I certainly think that it's an over-statement of our scientific knowledge and understanding to argue that science in general, or evolutionary biology in particular, proves in any way that there is no God.\"\n\nIn January 2010 Miller was elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nSince 2016, Miller has been listed on the Board of Directors of the National Center for Science Education.\n\n\n\n"}

She has also been Juneau's mayor and a member of Juneau's school board.\n\nMary Becker earned a bachelor's degree from Albertson College of Idaho. She moved to Juneau around 1966.\n\nBecker worked as a school teacher from 1967 to 1997. \n\nBecker ran for one of two open seats on the Juneau School Board in 1998. Board members Incumbents Sally Rue and Tom Wagner had decided not to run for reelection. Robert Starbard, Edith McHenry, Jan Marie Ferrell, and Stan Ridgeway were also candidates. Becker said that Juneau needed a new high school, and she advocated for reducing class sizes. She was in favor of a ballot measure to approve sale of $55.5 million in bonds in order to build a high school at Dimond Park for 1,500 students. Becker supported high-school proficiency tests as a way to the academic progress of students. The editorial board of the \"Juneau Empire\" endorsed her candidacy. Becker and Ridgeway won the election for three-year terms on the Juneau School Board. \n\nDuring Becker's first term in office, she voted against adding a program to teach life skills to students with disabilities, a program to teach infant care to teenage parents, and a program to help emotionally disturbed students in a new high school being built in Dimond Park. Becker said that having those programs in just one school was sufficient.\n\nBecker voted in favor of a new school policy making it optional for students to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Becker said that being seated for the Pledge of Allegiance is not respectful, although a policy requiring standing is not worth fighting in court. \n\nIn 2001, Becker voted in favor of a teacher's contract that gave current teachers a 4.5 percent raise. \n\nBecker ran for reelection in 2001. Beck said she wanted to stay on the school board in order to be involved in the remodeling of Juneau-Douglas High School, the building of a new high school, and attaining academic standards. Becker won the election. \n\nIn January 2002, a teenager held a banner reading \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" across the street from the 2002 Winter Olympics torch relay. The teenager was a student of Juneau-Douglas High School and was across the street from the school while holding the banner. The high school suspended the student for ten days because of the banner. The teenager wanted the suspension expunged from his record, but Becker and the rest of the school board voted to uphold the suspension. The teenager filed a civil-rights lawsuit against the school principal and the school board, claiming his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech had been violated. The case, Morse v. Frederick, ended up going to the United States Supreme Court, and the Court held, 5–4, that the First Amendment does not prevent educators from suppressing, at or across the street from a school-supervised event, student speech that is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.\n\nIn 2002, Becker voted against a proposal to buy $25,000 of new equipment for Juneau-Douglas High School's auto mechanics program and to provide $10,000 to the Juneau Community Charter School to help it cover its budget shortfall.\n\nIn 2003, Becker voted for a new teachers' contract, giving a two-percent raise to teachers and eliminating 40 teachers' positions during the following two years.\n\nAfter Juneau residents voted against building a new high school for 1,080 students in Dimond Park in a special election, Becker supported building a school with a 840-student capacity instead. A majority of voters approved the alternative proposal in a subsequent election. \n\nBecker supported a new dress code for students, saying it would improve race relations and improve parental involvement in education. \n\nBecker ran for reelection to the school board in 2004. Becker said she was running for reelection because she wanted to be involved in the building of a second high school in Juneau. She was one of three candidates for two available seats on the school board. The editorial board of the \"Juneau Empire\" endorsed the other candidates in the race.

Founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as \"Naz\" for short. \n\nAt the request of Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey of Rochester, five Sisters of St. Joseph founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in Rochester, New York. The original mansion that housed the college was known as \"the Glass House.\" At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a liberal arts core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at 402 Augustine Street.\n\nIn January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of Pittsford. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work. Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nNazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres. As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.\n\nIn 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from \"The Official Catholic Directory,\" having been declared no longer a Catholic institution by Rochester Bishop Matthew H. Clark.

Named in memory of the Dutch designer Piet Zwart, it was inaugurated in 2001. The current postgraduate study program structure had been introduced earlier in 1999.\n\nThe Piet Zwart Institute is the center for postgraduate study and research of the Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam's art school. The de Kooning Academy is a part of Hogeschool Rotterdam, a university of applied sciences. \n\nThe Piet Zwart Institute currently includes five Master study programs and one research program: Masters in Fine Art, Retail Design, Interior Architecture, Media (with the specializations \"Networked Media\" and \"Lens-Based Media\") and Education in Art, and a research program \"Communication in a Digital Age\". The Fine Art and Networked Media programs are housed in a\nbuilding separate from the main Academy building on the Karel Doormanhof 45 in central Rotterdam. It is also the main location for in-house public lectures.\nThe main academy building houses the study programs in Interior Architecture, Retail Design, Education in Art and Lens-Based Digital Media, and the research programs.\n\nAll Master study programs are two year full-time courses. They are based on the premise that contemporary art, design and media only exist in a wider social and cultural context, and connect artistic production and research with the public realm of discourse and display. With the exception of the Master of Education in Art which is jointly organized with the CodArts conservatory and whose degree is specific to the Dutch education system, all programs are held in English and have a highly international and multidisciplinary body of students and teachers. The programs are regarded as rigorous. The institute is highly selective with each of the programs only admitting up to 12 students annually. \n\nSince 2000, the study and research programs of the Piet Zwart Institute have published books on contemporary art, media and design in collaboration with publishing houses like Revolver Books, The MIT Press and OpenMUTE. The institute also collaborates with local organizations such as TENT/Centrum voor Beeldende Kunst, Witte de With, V2 Institute for the Unstable Media, Boijmans van Beuningen Museum, WORM, Duende, Het Wilde Weten and Goethe-Institut Rotterdam. The academic degree of Masters is validated by the NVAO, the joint accreditation organization of the Dutch and Flemish ministries of education.\n\nSince 2002, the Piet Zwart Institute initiated three research programs, \"Media Design Research\" (2002-2006, led by Matthew Fuller) and \"Communication in a Digital Age\" (since 2008, led by Florian Cramer) and \"Cultural Diversity\" (since 2010, led by Hugo Bongers). Research fellows included Lev Manovich, Bureau of Inverse Technology, jodi, Simon Yuill and Alessandro Ludovico. Among the publications were an early handbook on open content licenses written by Lawrence Liang and the anthology \"Software Studies\" (ed. by Matthew Fuller, The MIT Press, 2008).\n\nThe Piet Zwart Institute is spread over two locations in the center of the port town of Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the Karel Doormanhof 45 and the main building of the Willem de Kooning Academy, Blaak 10.\n\nThe Institute is regarded as selective with rigorously intensive and highly international study programs. Students get the chance to develop, present and exhibit their work and research nationally and internationally during their time of study, and are exposed to meetings and opportunities with prominent international practitioners and theoreticians in their respective field of study. Students also get the opportunity to visit international events relevant to their study and work, such as art biennials, media and design festivals and cultural studies conferences. \n\nThe Fine Art and Networked Media programs also hold annual graduation shows at major art venues in Rotterdam; in the past, they included the Boijmans van Beuningen museum, TENT, Centrum voor Beeldende Kunst Rotterdam and WORM. Recent exhibition titles include: \"Never Odd or Even\" and \"Global/Positions/Systems\", 2009, \"My Travels with Barry\" and \"YOU ARE PWNED\", 2008.\n\nAll study and research programs are based on a small core staff and a great number of visiting tutors. Course directors have been Anke Bangma (1999-2007) and Vanessa Ohlraun (since 2007) for Fine Art, Raphael van Amerongen (2001-2007) and Margaret Wijnands (since 2008) for Retail Design, Alex Suarez (since 2010) for Interior Architecture, Matthew Fuller (2002-2006), Florian Cramer (2006-2010) and Renee Turner (since 2010) for Networked Media, Simon Pummell (since 2009) for Lens-Based Digital Media, Robin Punt (2006-2010), Mirjam van Tilburg (since 2010) and Jojanneke Gijsen for Education in Art. \n\nSome notable staffers and regular tutors include: \n\n\nSome notable guest tutors and lecturers include: \n\n"}

The case deals with two university students, Keith and Steven Pridgen, who were found guilty and punished by the University of Calgary in 2008, on grounds of \"non-academic misconduct\".\n\nThe University of Calgary defines \"non-academic misconduct\" as:\n\n(a) conduct which causes injury to a person and/or damage to University property and/or the property of any member of the University community;\n\n(b) unauthorized removal and/or unauthorized possession of University property;\n\n(c) conduct which seriously disrupts the lawful educational and related activities of other students and/or University staff.\n\nThe Court of the Queen's Bench of Alberta found the University of Calgary to be wrong in prosecuting ten students, including the Pridgen brothers, in regards to comments made about a professor on Facebook. The key ruling in this case was that the universities are not exempt from, and that these students were in fact protected under, section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This case is notable as it highlights the jurisdiction of the Charter in terms of both new media technologies and university institutions in Canada.\n\nKeith and Steven Pridgen were undergraduate students at the University of Calgary in 2008. The twin brothers shared a Law and Society class being taught by Aruna Mitra. Professor Mitra was teaching this class for the first time in her career and many of the students were very critical of her knowledge of the course. A Facebook page entitled “I NO Longer Fear Hell, I Took a Course with Aruna Mitra” was created and many students began posting comments.\n\nIn particular Steven Pridgen's comment on November 13, 2007 read:\n\n“Some how I think she just got lazy and gave everybody a 65...that's what I got. Does anybody know how to apply to have it remarked?”\n\nMany students had similar concerns to Pridgen's and after having their work re-marked, a number of them did in fact receive higher grades.\n\nKeith Pridgen also commented on August 26, 2008:\n\n“Hey fellow LWSO. Homees.. So I am quite sure Mitra is NO LONGER TEACHING ANY COURSES WITH THE U OF C !!!!! Remember when she told us she was a long-term professor? Well Actually she was only sessional and picked up our class at the last moment because another prof wasn't able to do it ...lucky us. Well anyways I think we should all congratulate ourselves for leaving a Mitra-free legacy for future students!”\n\nOn September 4, 2008, Aruna Mitra complained about the Facebook page to the Interim Dean of the Faculty of Communication and Culture at the University of Calgary. Dean Tettey called a meeting for the ten students who posted material about Mitra on the Facebook page. The meeting took place on September 18, 2008 and included four professors from the department as well as the Dean. At this meeting all ten students, including the Pridgen brothers, were found guilty of non-academic misconduct.\n\nOn November 20, 2008, the Appellant's received a letter from Dean Tettey advising them that their comments “clearly caused unwarranted professional and personal injury to Prof. Mitra and clearly meets the criteria for non-academic misconduct as outlined in the University of Calgary Calendar”.\n\nKeith Pridgen was put on probation for 24 months and both brothers were required to write a letter of apology to Prof. Mitra and refrain from posting or circulating defamatory material regarding any faculty members of the University of Calgary.\n\nThe Pridgen brothers appealed the decision to the University of Calgary Review Committee and later to the Board of Governors of the University of Calgary however neither of these attempts succeeded in having the decision overturned.\n\nEight main issues to be determined were laid out by the Honourable Madam Justice J. Strekaf:\n\n(a) Does the Charter apply to the disciplinary proceedings taken by the Respondent;\n\n(b) If, so were the Applicants' Charter rights infringed;\n\n(c) Were the actions taken by the University ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Province of Alberta;\n\n(d) Did the Board of Governors err in refusing to hear the Applicants appeals;\n\n(e) Were the Applicants' denied a fair hearing;\n\n(f) Did the Review Committee provide adequate reasons for its decisions;\n\n(g) Did the Review Committee err in concluding that the activities of the Applicants constituted non-academic misconduct; and\n\n(h) What, if any, remedy should be granted to the Applicants.\n\nThe Court determined from previous cases that \"a non-government entity may still be subject to the Charter of Rights and freedoms when implementing a specific government policy or program\". Justice Strekaf distinguished that the University was acting as agent of the provincial government in providing accessible post-secondary education services to students in Alberta pursuant to the provisions of the PSL Act. Justice Strekaf felt there was sufficient evidence to show that universities in Alberta have some level of reliance on government funds and therefore they are not a \"Charter free zone\". Justice Strekaf concluded that comments made by Keith and Steven Pridgen, regarding Professor Mitra, on Facebook did not constitute academic misconduct and the Pridgen brothers' right to freedom of expression, under section 2(b) of the Charter, was infringed by the University of Calgary Review Committee.\n"}

In 2006, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award.\n\nRuth Manorama was born on 30 May 1952 to Dorothy & Paul Dhanraj, the eldest daughter of five girls and three boys. To escape the worst of caste oppression, her parents converted to Christianity. Ruth grew up seeing her parents consistently involved in social work. Her mother Dorothy fought for the right to be educated against her conservative family and eventually became a teacher and campaigned for women's education rights. Heavily influenced by Pandita Ramabai, Dorothy named her daughter Manorama after Pandita Ramabai's second daughter, who was named Mano.\n\nHer father Paul successfully mobilised economically disadvantaged people in neighbouring villages to fight for their rights to land that they'd been living on for generations. Ruth's parents strongly encouraged her and her sisters to be educated and self-reliant.\n\nIn 1975 Manorama completed a master's degree in social work from the University of Madras. In 2001, Manorama was awarded an honorary doctorate degree “for the distinguished contribution made to church and society” by the Academy of Ecumenical Indian Theology and Church Administration.\n\nRuth is married to N. P. Samy, a trade unionist who is the General Secretary of the National Centre for Labour. They have two daughters together.\n\nRuth Manorama has dedicated her life to battling a host of interconnected issues related to oppressions arising from caste, gender and class hierarchies. Among the issues she has fought for are the rights of domestic workers and the unorganised labour sector, slum dwellers, Dalits, and for the empowerment of marginalised women. She works at both the grassroots level as well as focuses on mass mobilisation and advocacy at the international level.\n\nRuth is an integral part of many organisations working for the rights of Dalits, women, slum dwellers, and the unorganised sector. Some of these are:\nShe is also a part of several international collectives and organisations such as:\nWithin India, she is also a member of the Karnataka State Planning Board, the State Commission for Women, the Task Force on Women’s Empowerment of the Government of India and a number of other state and national bodies.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Manorama led processions of over 150,000 people to protest against ‘Operation Demolition’ by the State Government of Karnataka, which was a forced eviction campaign. She and other activists demanded protection for those to be evicted and the right to live legally and with dignity. On behalf of the slum dwellers, Ruth fought court cases at the High Court and the Supreme Court of India against this move by the Karnataka administration.\n\nRuth also established the first trade union in the country in 1987 for domestic workers in Bengaluru and strove for inclusion in the Minimum Wages.\n\nRuth has worked to mobilise the underprivileged from a grass-root levels since the 1980s. In more than 120 slums, she has been responsible for the mobilisation, training and empowerment of women to deal with the discrimination and violence that they face and to take leadership within their communities. Ruth is also committed to the cause of emancipation of Dalits. She has participated in several struggles against human rights violations, for land rights and for the cause of Dalit women and contributed immensely to the mainstreaming of Dalit issues.\n\n\"“Dalit women in India are the Dalits among Dalits and suffer from three-fold oppression — on account of gender as a result of patriarchy, caste ‘the untouchable', and class — as they hail from the poorest and most marginalised communities. Eighty per cent of Scheduled Castes live in rural areas, are dependent on wage employment and have to contend with high rates of under employment which results in greater incidence of poverty,”\" said Ruth forcefully in an interview with The Hindu.\n\nShe was named as the Janata Dal (Secular) candidate from Bangalore South (Lok Sabha constituency) for 2014 General Elections.\n\nIn 2006, Ruth Manorama was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \"her commitment over decades to achieving equality for Dalit women, building effective and committed women’s organizations and working for their rights at national and international levels.” The Right Livelihood Award is considered the alternative Nobel Prize and the world's premier award for personal courage and social transformation.\n\nRuth was also one among the thousand nominees for the 1,000 Peace Women for Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.\n\n"}

Founded in 1908 as the Fredericksburg Teachers College, the institution was named Mary Washington College in 1938 after Mary Ball Washington, mother of the first president of the United States, George Washington. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the college's name to the University of Mary Washington in 2004 to reflect the addition of graduate and professional programs to the central undergraduate curriculum, as well as the establishment of more than one campus.\n\nEach year, students pursue more than 60 majors and programs of graduate and undergraduate study through the university's three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education. One third of UMW's undergraduate students study abroad before graduation, taking advantage of 121 study abroad programs in 56 countries. UMW Athletics' 23 teams compete in the NCAA Division III Capital Athletic Conference. Known as the UMW Eagles, 308 of these student-athletes have been named to All-American teams.\n\nUMW has been consistently ranked a top college in the U.S. and in the southern region of the U.S. by \"The Princeton Review\", \"Forbes\", and \"U.S. News & World Report\". In 2018, UMW was named a top producer of Peace Corps volunteers for the tenth year in a row, placing fourth among small schools.\n\nThe earliest incarnation of the college operated from about 1899 in the former Norfolk College for Young Ladies, a finishing school in Downtown Norfolk, Virginia. On March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State Normal and Industrial School for Women. It was called Fredericksburg Teachers College. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after Mary Ball Washington, mother of the first president of the United States of America, George Washington, and longtime resident of Fredericksburg.\n\nIn 1944 the college became associated with the University of Virginia as its women's college. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates, except in its education and nursing programs, although its postgraduate programs were coeducational. Following UVA's transition to coeducational status in 1970, the Virginia General Assembly reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution.\n\nThe General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college's name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004, to reflect the addition of master's degree programs and the establishment of more than one campus.\n\nThe university's first LEED-certified building, CGPS North Building, was built in 2007. The university houses stops along the route of the Fredericksburg Regional Transit System (FRED). The school signed an Energy Performance Contact with the energy service company NORESCO from 2005–2007, enabling the campus to install water saving devices which reduced campus water consumption by 50%. NORESCO also installed low energy light fixtures, occupant sensors, HVAC controls, and completed replacement of leaking condensate piping.\n\nThe University of Mary Washington is a public liberal arts university accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. It is not a research university, but instead focuses on undergraduate education.\n\nMuch of UMW's Fredericksburg campus is located on Marye's Heights, a steep hill which, like Sunken Road (the campus' northeastern boundary), played an important role in the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg. The campus is within walking distance to the historic downtown with shops, restaurants and the Rappahannock River. Other campuses are Stafford Campus, seven miles north of Fredericksburg, and Dahlgren Campus, near the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division.\n\nUMW has five pre-professional programs: pre-dental, pre-law, pre-med, pre-pharmacy, and pre-veterinary. Bachelor's degrees include a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in addition to two degree completion programs – a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS). Master's degrees include a Master of Business Administration (MBA, Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Education for Professional Development or Added Endorsement (M.Ed.), Master of Science in Elementary Education (M.S.) and a Master of Geospatial Analysis (MSGA). UMW also offers a Geographic Information Science certificate.\n\nFirst-year seminar courses allow students to explore nontraditional topics in nontraditional ways. While topics vary, classes are all capped at 15 students, focus on the development of writing and speaking skills and use active, discussion-based formats. Previous first-year seminars have included \"Beyond the Selfie: Exploring Digital Identities,\" \"Cold Case: Theatre Mysteries,\" \"The Art of Mathematics,\" \"Race & Revolution,\" and \"Science and Technology – Because We Can, Should We?\"\n\nMany UMW students study abroad before graduation. The university offers 121 approved programs in 56 countries, five exchange programs, and more than 15 programs led by UMW faculty during spring breaks and summer sessions.\n\nBy statute of the Code of Virginia, the University of Mary Washington is governed by a Board of Visitors, one member of which is elected every two years to serve as Rector. The UMW Board of Visitors is composed of twelve members appointed by the Governor of Virginia and confirmed by the General Assembly. At least six members of the Board must be alumni of the university, and no more than three may be nonresidents of Virginia. Each member serves a term of four years and may be eligible for reappointment to one successive term.\n\nTroy Paino arrived at UMW July 1, 2016 as its 10th and current President. Prior to coming to UMW, Paino served for six years as president of Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri.\n\n\nHonor Convocation is held at the start of each academic year. Eagle Gathering is a candlelit celebration on Ball Circle that marks the start of the year and officially welcomes the newest class to UMW. During Family Weekend, typically held in the fall semester, families visit the campus to get a taste of student life through events, performances and tours. Spirit Week is a series of student events that lead up to Homecoming and the return of UMW alumni to the university for athletic contests and tailgating. Senior Countdown is an event that celebrates 100 days until graduation for the undergraduate class. Spring Formal gives students an element of surprise – students learn the location of the formal (unique each year) only once they're on the buses heading over. Mr. UMW is a one-of-a-kind talent show in which contestants perform to be named \"Mr. UMW\" by the end of the night.\n\nIn 2018, Peace Corps named UMW was a Top Volunteer-Producing Colleges and Universities for the tenth year in a row, ranking it fourth among small schools. A total of 261 UMW alumni have served in the Peace Corps since the agency's founding in 1961. UMW became a Peace Corps Prep Program partner in 2017.\n\nUMW was ranked among the top 382 colleges in the nation by The Princeton Review, which featured UMW in its 2018 issue of \"The Best 382 Colleges.\"\n\nUMW was unranked nationally for US News and World Report's 2018 college rankings, but ranked 17th in the South region.\n\nForbes included UMW in its 2018 \"America's Top Colleges,\" ranking the university 276th of 660 undergraduate institutions.\n\nIn 2017, the school's debate team was ranked 43rd by the Cross Examination Debate Association. In 2009, the team ranked 3rd overall in the National Debate Tournament.\n\nThe university's women's rugby team became champions for Division II in May 2014. UMW's men's rugby team won the USA Rugby's D1AA Fall Championship in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "399324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=399324", "title": "Victorian Certificate of Education", "text": "Victorian Certificate of Education\n\nThe Victorian Certificate of Education or VCE is one credential available to secondary school students who successfully complete year 11 and 12 in the Australian state of Victoria. The VCE is the predominant choice for students wishing to pursue tertiary education. An alternative to VCE is the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learnings (VCAL), a vocational based senior secondary school qualification. \n\nStudy for the VCE is usually completed over two years but can be spread over a longer period of time in some cases. It is possible to pass Year 12 without without completing the end of year exams although the VCE is not awarded by doing so. The VCE was established as a pilot project in 1987. The earlier Higher School Certificate (HSC) was abolished in 1992.\n\nThe Victorian Certificate of Education is generally taught in years 11 and 12 of secondary education in Victoria, however some students are able to commence their VCE studies in year 10 or earlier if the school or institution allows it.\n\nAll VCE studies are organised into units. VCE subjects typically consist of four units with each unit covering one semester of study. Each unit comprises a set number of outcomes (usually two or three); an outcome describes the knowledge and skills that a student should demonstrate by the time the student has completed the unit. Subject choice depends on each individual school. Units 3/4 of a subject must be studied in sequential order, whereas units 1/2 can be mixed and matched. Students are not required to complete all the units of a subject as part of the VCE course, meaning they are able to change subject choice between years 11 and 12.\n\nOn completing a unit, a student receives either a 'satisfactory' (S) or 'non-satisfactory' (N) result. If a student does not intend to proceed to tertiary education, a 'satisfactory' result is all that is required to graduate with the VCE. If a student does wish to study at a tertiary level then they will require an ATAR. In order to gain an ATAR a student must satisfactorily complete three units of any subject in the English field (at least one English field subject is compulsory) and twelve units in any other subjects.\n\nVCE studies are assessed both internally (in school) and externally (through the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA). During units 1/2 all assessment is internal, while in units 3/4 assessment is conducted both internally and externally.\n\nInternal assessment is conducted via \"school assessed coursework\" (SACs) and \"school assessed tasks\" (SATs).\n\n\"School assessed coursework\" (SACs) are the primary avenue of internal assessment, with assessment in every VCE study consisting of at least one SAC. SACs are tasks that are written by the school and must be done primarily in class time; they can include essays, reports, tests, and case studies. Some studies in the visual arts and technology areas are also assessed via \"school assessed tasks\" (SATs). SATs are generally practical tasks that are examined in school. Both SACs and SATs are scaled by VCAA against external assessment; this is to eliminate any cheating or variances in task difficulty.\n\nExternal assessment is conducted in the form of examinations set by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority for units 3/4 studies. As of 2013, only the General Achievement Test (GAT) will be examined in June, with all subjects now only having one external assessment with the exceptions of mathematics subjects, and LOTE studies, which consist of both a written and oral external test. All examinations excepting the GAT are held in late October and most of November.\n\nSubjects in the LOTE field (languages other than English) are also assessed in the form of oral examinations. Subjects in the Music field are assessed by a performance for a VCAA panel of examiners as part of their external assessment. All performance based external assessment (Oral Examinations and Music Performances) are typically held in early October.\n\nThe GAT is an essential part of VCE external assessment. It provides the basis of a quality assurance check on the marking of examinations. Any student who is enrolled in a VCE units 3/4 study is required to sit the GAT.\n\nA student who satisfactorily completes units 3/4 of a VCE study is eligible for a study score of between 0 and 50. Study scores are calculated by VCAA, and indicate a student's performance in relation to all other students who undertook that study.\n\nStudy scores are calculated according to a normal distribution, where the mean is 30 and the standard deviation is 7, with most study scores falling in the range 23 to 37. For studies with many enrolments (1000 or more), a study score of 40 or more places a student in the top 9% of all students in that subject.\n\nScaling is the process that adjusts VCE study scores into ATAR subject scores. The Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) adjusts all VCE study scores to equalise results between studies with stronger cohorts, and those with weaker ones. Contrary to common perception, scaling is not based on the difficulty of the subject, as each study score is in fact a ranking. The score adjustment ensures that in those subjects where it is easier to overtake the cohort, the score is adjusted downwards, while in those subjects where it is difficult to rank highly, it is moved upwards.\n\nVCE studies refer to the various subjects available to students to contribute to their successful completion of the qualification. There are currently 128 VCE studies, ranging from diverse fields such as the humanities, science, technology and mathematics. Studies are also permitted to study one or more VCE VET programs, vocational education-based subjects which contribute to the completion of the VCE, whilst also resulting in a nationally-recognised VET qualification. \n\nAlthough a student may choose to study any VCE subject in theory, this is dependent on availability of the specified study at the student's school. Certain schools do not offer certain studies, and as a result, students may pick alternate ones, or choose to study a particular subject through an external institution such as Distance Education Victoria. \n\nTo be awarded the VCE, a student must successfully complete at least:\n\nThis therefore means that a student must study at least four subjects to be awarded the VCE. Selection of studies depends on other factors as well, such as prerequisites for university courses. \n\nThe following is a list of all VCE studies available:\n\nThere are also University Extension studies available for high-achieving students. These subjects are carried out through multiple universities, including Monash University, The University of Melbourne, Swinburne University and Deakin University.\n\nThe 2011 English exam contained a column about tattoos attributed to \"part-time journalist and blogger Helen Day\", who wrote for the fictional \"Street Beat\" blog. \"The Age\" newspaper accused VCAA of plagiarism and breach of copyright as the column was very similar to an opinion piece featured in the newspaper's 23 September 2010 edition, written by Melbourne writer Helen Razer. The newspaper called the exam's column \"clumsily edited\".\n\nIn 2012, the \"History: Revolutions\" exam was meant to include a picture of Nikolai Kochergin's artwork \"Storming the Winter Palace on 25th October 1917\", depicting the events of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. Instead, a doctored picture was used in the exam, in which a large robot had been edited in to the background of the scene. A VCAA spokesperson admitted that the image was \"sourced and acknowledged by the VCAA as coming from the Internet\", and new internal guidelines were issued for using internet-sourced content in exams. Of the 5,738 students that sat the exam, 2,379 chose the Russia section, of which 130 received an adjusted score.\n\nThe 2018 English exam included an article in which fictional writer Jonty Jenkins scathingly attacks a cafe franchise named \"Calmer Coffee\" opening in his local town, criticising its unfriendly staff and unwelcoming ambience that he describes as \"an assault on the senses\". After the exam completed, students discovered that a Calmer Cafe existed in Aberfeldie, a suburb just north-west of Melbourne, managed by Elise Jenkins, sharing the same surname as the exam question's fictional writer. Within hours, the cafe received over 100 negative reviews on Google Maps from Year 12 students, bringing down its rating from nearly 5 stars to as low as 3.3. Google Maps temporarily removed the cafe from search results, and later reinstated it but kept reviews inaccessible. At the time, the cafe had 405 reviews. The next day, Tara Conron, owner of the cafe, told \"The Age\" she had hired a lawyer and would be pursuing legal action against VCAA for \"uncanny\" similarities between the exam and the actual cafe. Conron noted the identical surnames of Jenkins, stated that she employs someone with a \"man bun\", as does an employee in the exam article, and both the fictional and actual cafe \"stand out\" in their respective suburbs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4912886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4912886", "title": "Voluntary student unionism", "text": "Voluntary student unionism\n\nVoluntary student unionism (VSU), as it is known in Australia, or voluntary student membership (VSM), as it is known in New Zealand, is a policy under which membership of – and payment of membership fees to – university student organisations is voluntary.\n\nAustralia passed legislation enacting VSU in 2005, which came into force on July 1, 2006. Forms of VSU in Australia had been law in the state of Western Australia from 1994 until 2002, and in Victoria from 1994 to 2000.\n\nNew Zealand passed legislation enacting VSM in 2011, rules which came into force on January 1, 2012.\n\nArguments for and against VSU typically fall into three broad categories: civil rights impacts, social impacts, and economic impacts.\n\nRequiring membership of student organisations is seen by some as a form of forced unionisation, contrary to freedom of association. Alternatively it may be seen as being required to belong to a professional organisation, in which case it would merely be a means of ensuring standards.\n\nOpponents of VSU argue that it silences students' voices by removing universal membership of a student organisation. \n\nA common thread in the argument against VSU is the notion of a campus culture, or the university experience. University has traditionally been a time of broadening horizons, socialising, and political activism. Opponents argue that VSU makes it more difficult for students to have high quality sports grounds, lively music and social venues, and the resources necessary to mount protests and political campaigns, leading to moribund campuses. This was a view expressed by Senator Barnaby Joyce. Proponents counter that the free-market system rewards venues and establishments which students enjoy and value, and that it lets students choose their own level of contribution to a political cause.\n\nStudent Unions charge anywhere between $0 and $300 per year for membership. Levying of fees is criticised by some on the grounds that it is financially onerous, particularly to students who may already be struggling with the associated costs of university study. Others cite that the associated financial benefits of robust representation provided by students' associations result in lower fees and higher quality of educational experience for students.\n\nAlthough universities and student unions each had their own rules, students generally were required to become a member of their campus student organisation automatically upon enrolment. A fee for student services or amenities was charged to students, typically once a semester, once a year, or in a lump sum upon enrolment. This fee was typically collected by the university, which usually took a portion in collection fees and passed the rest to campus student organisation(s). These organisations then distributed the money according to their own rules.\n\nOn 9 December 2005, the \"Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill\" 2005 was passed in the Senate, and received the Royal Assent on 19 December 2005. Since 1 July 2006, Australian universities have faced fines of A$100 per student for compelling payment for any non-academic good or service.\n\nMany student organisations opposed VSU, expressing concern about their ability to provide social, academic, and political services under VSU as well as meet long-term financial commitments without guaranteed revenue streams.\n\nAustralian universities, as represented by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC), were generally in support of membership and compulsory fees for student organisations for three broad reasons. First, they prefer to leave service provision in the hands of students; second, the activities associated with campus organisations help to market the universities to prospective students; and third, they view student unions as valid representative bodies.\n\nThe Australian National University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the University of Queensland, the University of Newcastle and the University of Adelaide have provided funding to their respective student unions, subject to various conditions.\n\nCompulsory student organisation membership was initially accepted as uncontentious by all political persuasions. By the 1970s, the overtly political nature of the Australian Union of Students, which ran a number of overtly progressive campaigns (for example, in support of the Palestine Liberation Organization), led to a conservative minority within that organisation to call for voluntary student organisation membership.\n\nFollowing its election in 1996, the Howard Government signalled its intention to introduce VSU. It tried to pass legislation to this effect several times in the late 1990s. Student organisations responded with strong campaigns in opposition to VSU throughout that time. The legislation was persistently rejected in the Australian Senate, where the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, and the Greens have voted against it. Following its 2001 election victory, aware that attempts to introduce VSU would not pass the Senate, the Government moved away from the VSU agenda. Advocates of VSU received a boost, however, when the Howard government gained control of the Senate at the 2004 Federal election. Nationwide implementation of VSU had been listed among the government's legislative agenda to be placed before the Senate.\n\nOn 16 March 2005, Brendan Nelson introduced the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 before the Parliament. Initially expected to be passed due to the government's majority in the Senate from July, it was opposed in its original form by Senator Barnaby Joyce, who threatened to cross the floor if sporting facilities and collegial spirit were not protected. Despite such opposition, Education Minister Nelson insisted that the legislation would pass unamended and come into force as of 1 January 2006. By October 2005, however, it became apparent that it would not be possible to implement VSU in time for the new academic year.\n\nOn 9 December 2005, the legislation was reintroduced. Due to the decision of Joyce to cross the floor and vote against the legislation, Howard was forced to obtain the vote of Family First Senator Steve Fielding, who had maintained for several months that he was opposed to the bill in its current form. However, after being courted by Howard, Fielding did an abrupt about-face and voted for the legislation, calling compulsory student unionism \"crazy\" and allowing the bill to pass; though both Fielding and Brendan Nelson insisted no behind-the-scenes deal had secured his vote. The legislation was essentially identical to the government's original proposal.\n\nIn September 2010 the Gillard Labor government introduced legislation to allow universities to charge students a compulsory service fee of up to $250 a year to fund amenities such as sporting facilities, childcare and counselling. The legislation passed after the Greens took the balance of power in the senate.\n\nUnder legislation passed in 1999, but subsequently superseded, VSM could be enacted at any New Zealand university by a referendum of students. Only students at the University of Auckland voted to enact VSM, affecting membership of the Auckland University Students' Association. Consequently, students enrolled since that vote go without membership in the student association unless they become aware of it, find out how to join, and afford the fees without the option of having it included in their student loan. Students at the University of Waikato enacted VSM, but later returned to universal student membership, when a referendum was held during study week.\n\nIn October 2009, Heather Roy's Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill was drawn from the ballot. The bill was greatly delayed due to a large number of public submissions (4837 in total, including 132 oral submissions), necessitating the Select Committee stage to be extended from the normal six months to a full year. It was later delayed due to filibustering by the Labour Party and of particular note, Trevor Mallard, of a bill ahead of it on the Order Paper - the aim was to push the debate out so the third reading could not occur before the 2011 election, causing the bill to die as Roy was not seeking re-election. However, the bill eventually passed its third reading on 28 September 2011, 63 votes in favour to 58 opposed. All student associations in New Zealand are now voluntary.\n\nThere are several terms being used to describe voluntary student unionism and its opposite, each with its own frequency, accuracy, impartiality, and favourability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
