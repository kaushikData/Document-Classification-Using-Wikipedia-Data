Working with football and the footballing community, 1GOAL raises public awareness and involvement in achieving education for all the 67 million children out of school worldwide. It is supported by over 200 international footballers; over 70 football clubs including Manchester United, Corinthians, Los Angeles Galaxy, Chelsea FC, FC Barcelona, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Liverpool F.C., FC Porto, Sporting Lisbon and Arsenal; and national and international footballing organisations including the Confederation of African Football, FIFPro, the Professional Footballers' Association and FIFA.\n\nIt was launched by Queen Rania of Jordan in August 2009. Alongside Queen Rania, it is co-chaired by FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Nobel prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nIt campaigns to secure schooling for some 67 million children worldwide in accordance with the Millennium Goal Promise of education for all by 2015. There are several barriers to achieving universal primary education: lack of funds to pay for infrastructure and ongoing costs (buildings, teachers' salaries, learning materials); lack of qualified teachers; conflict and the practice of charging school fees in some developing countries.\n\nAs of July 2010, \"Twelve million people have signed up to support 1Goal - that makes this the biggest campaign for education in history. Football is helping make something very special happen,\" says ambassador Anthony Baffoe of Ghana.\n\nBy September 2010, 18 million people had joined 1GOAL. During the UN Millennium Development Goals Review Summit, held in New York, 20–22 September 2010, Queen Rania delivered this petition directly to UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon. At a 1GOAL event during the same summit, the World Bank announced an increase of $750 million to education and the Australian Government announced an increase of about $5 billion, of which 70% is ringfenced for primary education.\n\nMany world leaders, footballers and celebrities have supported the initiative including Shakira, Cristiano Ronaldo, Pele, Mick Jagger, Jessica Alba, Matt Damon, Patrick Vieira, Michael Essien, Samuel Eto'o, Aaron Mokoena, Quinton Fortune, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Ballack, Sir Bobby Charlton and Marcel Desailly.\n\n"}

As such, the phrase is used today as a sort of pithy retort implying that \"it doesn't matter what you believe; these are the facts.\"\n\nAccording to Stephen Hawking, some historians believe this episode might have happened upon Galileo's transfer from house arrest under the watch of Archbishop Ascanio Piccolomini to \"another home, in the hills above Florence\". This other home was also his own, the \"Villa Il Gioiello\", in Arcetri.\n\nThe earliest biography of Galileo, written by his disciple Vincenzo Viviani in 1655–1656, does not mention this phrase, and records of his trial do not cite it. Some authors say it would have been imprudent for Galileo to have said such a thing before the Inquisition.\n\nIn 1911, the words \"E pur si muove\" were found on a Spanish painting which had just been acquired by an art collector, Jules van Belle, of Roeselare, Belgium. This painting was completed within a year or two of Galileo's death, as it is dated 1643 or 1645 (the last digit is partially obscured). The painting is not historically correct, because it depicts Galileo in a dungeon, but nonetheless shows that some variant of the \"Eppur si muove\"\" anecdote was in circulation immediately after his death, when many who had known him were still alive to attest to it, and that it had been circulating for over a century before it was published.\n\nThe event was first reported in English print in 1757 by Giuseppe Baretti in his book \"The Italian Library\": \nThe book was written 124 years after the supposed utterance and became widely published in \"Querelles Littéraires\" in 1761.\n"}

The book, excerpts from which were published in the \"Daily Mail\" prior to publication, received significant media attention, particularly relating to allegations made about Cameron. It is published by Biteback, a company in which Ashcroft has a majority share, run by political blogger Iain Dale.\n\nThe book contains an uncorroborated allegation that, during his university years, Cameron put a \"private part of his anatomy\" into a dead pig's mouth as part of an initiation ceremony for the Piers Gaveston Society. The allegation was attributed to a Member of Parliament who was a \"distinguished Oxford contemporary\" of Cameron's. Ashcroft and Oakeshott failed to receive a response from the purported owner of an alleged photograph of the incident, and since the extract's publication no corroborating evidence has been produced to support the allegation. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said that they did not \"need to dignify the book by offering any comment\", while friends reported him saying that the claim was \"utter nonsense\". Cameron appeared to refer to Ashcroft and the book with a joke that he had had an injection that day and had been told to expect \"a little prick, a little stab in the back\".\n\nThe book is an analysis of Cameron's life, education, early career and political career. Ashcroft hired Oakeshott in 2013 to co-author the book, paying a reported £500,000.\nFollowing the publicity given to the advance serialisation of the book in the \"Daily Mail\", the initial print run was increased from 6,000 to 35,000 copies, according to Dale. Reception to the book was mixed, with some criticising the story as \"salacious\". In \"The Guardian\" Michael White wrote that the book was a \"Jacobean revenge biography\" and described Ashcroft as \"one of the more bizarre figures on the fringes of British public life\".\n\nAlthough Ashcroft's introduction to the book claimed it was \"not about settling scores\", and that he had sought Oakeshott's involvement to ensure the book was objective, the book was widely viewed as an act of revenge on Cameron for declining to offer Ashcroft, a major Conservative Party donor, a significant position in government. Allison Pearson, writing for the \"Daily Telegraph\", argued that the nature of the book suggested that Cameron's decision not to promote Ashcroft had been \"entirely justified\". Oakeshott argued that they had held back publication until after the 2015 UK General Election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives in the polls. Roy Greenslade, writing for the \"Guardian\", acknowledged the book might have had more impact in the run up to the election, but argued that \"most of the negative stuff is historical, unsurprising and of little real consequence\".\n\nFollowing publication of the book, book reviews by British newspapers highlighted the persistent use of unsupported innuendo, and identified the motive for publication as revenge.\n"}

The legislation aimed to abolish church-run schooling in New Brunswick and replace it with a system of government-run \"common schools.\" The case of Maher v. Town Council of Portland was initiated as a result, and in the end, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld the Act. The act was stridently opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and its adherents, and a series of clashes between New Brunswick Catholics and the provincial government culminated in the shooting of two people following riots at Caraquet in 1875, after which the act was substantially amended to implement a joint religious/secular schooling system.\n\nSince 1858, education in New Brunswick had been governed by the Parish Schools Act of 1858. It organized all New Brunswick schools under a provincial Board of Education but made no provision for the government to own or establish schools. As a result, the impetus to found new schools was required to originate at a local level, and in practice, most schools were established and operated by churches (particularly, Roman Catholic and Anglican), with the church then receiving a share of the province's education budget in return. In the diocese of Saint John, for example, there were some 160 Catholic schools operating by 1871, many staffed by professed religious, with a significant minority of them offering instruction in French. There were no standardized texts, and teachers had complete freedom in their choice of curriculum. Of those priests and professed religious acting as teachers, the majority had no formal teaching credentials. Attendance at schools was enforced by teachers and parents, with no government intervention.\n\nBy 1871, the New Brunswick government had begun to have substantial doubts about the system of education. It was skeptical about the quality of education begin delivered, and it was also concerned about attendance rates, with school attendance in the area of Gloucester falling as low as 55%.\n\nBy 1871, several Canadian provinces had already implemented provincially run public schooling systems, and others were considering it. In Ontario, Egerton Ryerson had fought for secularization as a means of keeping power out of the hands of any church, and from 1844 as Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, he had instituted significant reforms l, leading to the creation of a strong state-run education system. In Nova Scotia, Premier Charles Tupper had successfully introduced public schooling through his Free School Act of 1864. Lemuel Allan Wilmot, a former New Brunswick Attorney-General and in 1871, its lieutenant governor, had been an outspoken advocate for the creation of a unified taxation-funded public school system in New Brunswick for many years.\n\nDuring the years leading up to 1871, a key conflict within the Roman Catholic Church concerned the authority of the Pope over secular governments. The doctrine of ultramontanism asserted that the Pope held supreme authority over all matters spiritual and secular, and it was vigorously pursued by key members of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada, most notably Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal from 1840 to 1876.\n\nIn 1864, Pope Pius IX published the \"Syllabus of Errors\", a document collecting several past papal reasonings and presented as a list of \"condemned propositions\" such as modern liberalism, the supreme power of human reason, the teaching of philosophy and natural science as fields distinct from religion, and, at some considerable length, the separation of church and state. The syllabus specifically reaffirmed the right of priests to interfere in and direct the course of temporal affairs as well as the supremacy of religious law over civil law. Proposition 45 of the Syllabus rejected the right of civil governments to exercise sole dominion over the teaching of children.\n\nAt the same time, reform-minded governments gaining power throughout Canada were becoming frustrated by church conservativism, and they were keen to lessen their dependence on church infrastructure and mitigate the power wielded by the Vatican in Canadian political affairs.\n\nDuring the closing sittings of the 21st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in 1870, a key issue was reform of the New Brunswick school system. George Edwin King, then an MLA on behalf of the electorate of Saint John County and City, had been, since 1868, developing a bill to create a state-run school system to provide free education to all New Brunswick children. King's bill was tabled in 1870 but failed to receive support and eventually, King withdrew it.\n\nHowever, in June 1870, New Brunswick's Premier Andrew Rainsford Wetmore retired from politics to accept a position on the Supreme Court, and King was able to seek and receive appointments as the new Premier and Attorney-General. He revived his Common Schools Bill and campaigned on it at the 1870 election. He was successfully returned to office and took leadership of the 22nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly.\n\nHowever the new government proved unstable, and in February 1871, King lost the confidence of parliament and was forced to resign. George Luther Hatheway took up the mantle of Premier, with King as his Attorney-General. While Hatheway and King were opposed on many political issues, they were united in their support of public schooling, and on April 12, 1871, King reintroduced his Common Schools Bill to parliament on behalf of Hatheway's government.\n\nKing's bill prompted a long and bitter debate in the New Brunswick parliament. Members opposed to the bill included most of the parliament's Catholics, some Anglicans, and also some members against compulsory assessment. On May 5, 1871, free school supporters proposed an amendment to the bill making schools under the act be non-sectarian. The amendment was passed by a 25-10 vote. The bill, as a whole, was passed on May 17, 1871 and it was signed into law as the Common Schools Act of 1871.\n\nThe act came into effect on January 1, 1872. It contained various provisions that had the effect of shutting down religious schooling in New Brunswick. While teachers were permitted to open and close school with Bible reading and the Lord's Prayer, they were prohibited from the teaching of catechism courses and from wearing religious garb, and schools were forbidden from displaying religious symbols. Control of the school system was given to the Executive Council, exercising its power through the New Brunswick Board of Education. The Board of Education held powers under the act to dictate curriculum and textbook content, require teachers to meet certain standards of qualification, and set the work conditions and employment terms of educators.\n\nThe government claimed that non-denominational, mandatory schooling would improve access to education for New Brunswick's children. However, opponents of the legislation claimed that sole responsibility for the education of children lay with parents, and they resented government interference in what they saw as a parental duty through the imposition of mandatory schooling. Opponents of the legislation were primarily religious organisations including the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHatheway died in June 1872, and King regained the position of Premier of New Brunswick. King found himself facing strong Roman Catholic opposition to the Common Schools Act, led by Bishop John Sweeny.\n\nThe Catholics, under Sweeny, made an appeal to the Canadian federal government in Ottawa, seeking disallowance of the act. They claimed that Catholic schools had existed under the Parish Schools Act of 1858 and so Catholics had constitutional rights to sectarian schools under the British North America Act. The appeal did not find any support in the federal cabinet and was unsuccessful. The Catholics then attempted to fight the bill in the federal House of Commons in the spring of 1872. Roman Catholic member for New Brunswick John Costigan presented a motion calling on the government to disallow the New Brunswick Common Schools Act, with the support of fellow New Brunswicker Timothy Warren Anglin, but the motion was defeated on the floor of the House. Similarly, a proposal by Quebec Premier Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau to ask the Queen to amend the British North America Act to protect sectarian schooling failed to win majority support.\n\nIn the final result, the only action taken by the federal government was to seek a constitutional opinion from crown lawyers in London and to call on the New Brunswick government to reconsider its position. King responded to this call some five months later with a 12-page memorandum in which he argued that Catholic public schools had never been legally recognised in New Brunswick and so had not lost any rights or privileges as a result of the legislative change to the schooling system.\n\nObjectors to the Common Schools Act launched a challenge to the act in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. In 1873, the court dismissed the objectors' suit and found in favour of the government, but in the course of the case, it levelled several criticisms at the act's assessment clauses, which King's government addressed by passing supplementary retroactive assessment legislation.\n\nFollowing the failure of the court challenge, New Brunswick Bishop John Sweeny attended the provincial council of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec on May 18, 1873, and he invited the bishops of Quebec to intervene in the New Brunswick school question. The following day, Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal, and Louis-François Laflèche, of Trois-Rivières, accepted Sweeny's invitation by issuing a prepared statement opposing the Common Schools Act in the name of the Roman Catholic Church. The statement had the effect of inciting several federal Catholic MPs to break ranks from the government over the issue. At roughly the same time, New Brunswick MP John Costigan moved a motion on the floor of the House of Commons requesting for the governor-general to disallow the New Brunswick acts relating to assessment for local schools. The motion was successful, but Prime Minister John Alexander Macdonald refused to disallow the legislation. Facing revolt in his own ranks over the issue, Macdonald agreed to pay $5,000 towards the costs of an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then Canada's highest court) by the New Brunswick Catholics. In 1874, the Judicial Committee gave its decision in Maher v. Town of Portland, ruling that the Common Schools Act was constitutional and did not infringe the guarantees for denominational schools set out in section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\nDuring the legislative and parliamentary challenges, Catholics, organized by their bishops, resisted the implementation of the Common Schools Act at a grassroots level by refusing to pay school taxes. The provincial government responded by imprisoning priests and seizing the property of tax evaders. In late 1873, King held meetings with Sweeney] to seek a compromise. Sweeny offered to bring an end to the Catholic opposition in return for the government under conditions, but the Executive Council refused his offer. By 1874, the debate was still continuing in the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly and growing more bitter. At the last sitting of the before the 1874 election, the Assembly debated both a proposed amendment to the Common Schools Act and a motion abjuring federal interference in the province's schools. King accused the Catholic opposition of opposing the act for ultramontanist reasons as part of a long-term Roman Catholic plan for domination of Europe and Canada. King went on to say, \"If we once abandon the strong line of defence that is along the heights of equality [...] the end will be the overthrow of our rights and independence of action.\"\n\nThe amendment was defeated 24-12, and the non-interference motion carried by the same margin.\n\nThe 1874 New Brunswick election was fought solely over the issue of common schools, with King's government achieving an overwhelming victory, claiming 36 of the 41 seats.\n\nIn 1872, Robert Young was appointed as President of New Brunswick's Executive Council, which had ultimate control of the New Brunswick school system under the terms of the Common Schools Act. A particular priority for Young was implementing the Common Schools Act in Gloucester County. Gloucester County, which included Young's home town of Caraquet, had mainly Acadians (descendants of French colonists) and was strongly Roman Catholic.\n\nYoung faced deeply entrenched opposition to the act in Gloucester. In 1873, Gloucester magistrates refused to enforce the provisions of the act. Young responded by having them replaced. At the 1874 elections, although only 5 of the 41 members elected to the Legislative Assembly were not supporters of the Common Schools Act, both of the members elected in Gloucester were in the opposition. Gloucester elected Théotime Blanchard and Kennedy Francis Burns, both Catholics who were firm opponents of the act.\n\nThe town of Caraquet was opposed to the Common Schools Act and most of its residents had for some time refused to pay the schools tax in protest. In 1874 a meeting was held by the townspeople of Caraquet at which public officials were appointed. Caraquet's small Protestant minority questioned the legality of the appointments, and on January 4, 1875 Young held his own, secret, meeting at which he appointed Protestants to the same positions.\n\nOn January 14, 1875, a public meeting was convened with the aim of imposing the school tax on Caraquet. The meeting ended in a scuffle. On January 15, a group of Caraquet Acadians held a public protest against further attempts to apply the act. During the protest, drunken demonstrators caused property damage to several premises including a store owned by Young. The demonstrators threatened Young's wife and employees.\n\nOn January 25, ten police constables bearing arrest warrants arrived in Caraquet to identity and arrest the demonstrators who had damaged Young's store. They were still in Caraquet on January 26, when 20 English-speaking \"volunteers,\" recruited by Young, arrived in the town to assist in the arrests. The \"volunteers\" gained entry to the house of one André Albert, at which Acadians were gathered, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. One Acadian (Louis Mailloux) and one militiaman (John Gifford) were shot and killed during the exchange. Nine Acadians were tried as accessories to the death of Gifford but were acquitted. Public sentiment in Gloucester held Young responsible for both deaths.\n\nThe Caraquet deaths brought a realisation to both sides of the school debate that compromise was required on the issue. In the spring of 1875, the Catholic opposition, headed by Kennedy Francis Burns, met with the government to work out what would eventually become substantial amendments to the workings of the act. The changes, based on proposals originally drafted by Sweeney, were carried out by amendments to the act's subordinate regulations, and they were kept secret for fear of inviting controversy.\n\nThe amendments allowed for a less arduous method of certification for religious teachers in which they would still have to complete examinations but would not have to attend Normal School classes. The determination of textbook content would be made in consultation with the churches, with passages offensive to the church excised. Church-owned school buildings would be permitted to be used, pending the decision by local school trustees to lease them from the church, and religious instruction could occur in such buildings if the regular school day was not shortened for the purpose. The effect of the arrangements regarding church buildings and religious schooling was to limit Catholic education to urban centres and to move further argument back down to the level of the local school boards.\n\nThe Common Schools Act of 1871 has been suggested as \"the most significant piece of social legislation in 19th-century New Brunswick.\" By 1878 the number of students enrolled in the public school system had more than doubled, and the number of public school teachers had increased by half.\n\n\n"}

His findings challenged the common-sense assumption that kinship in Anglo-American cultures is primarily about recognizing biological relatedness. While a rhetoric of \"blood\" ties is an important conceptual structuring device in US and British kinship systems, cultural and social considerations are more important. The discoveries he demonstrated through a series of books, most famously \"American Kinship: a cultural account\", revolutionized and revitalized the study of kinship within anthropology, on the one hand, and contributed to the theoretical basis of feminist anthropology, gender studies, and lesbian and gay studies, on the other.\n\nSchneider critiqued the so-called Western theories of kinship by accusing its supporters of being ethnocentric.\n\nAs a teacher, Schneider was also known for taking on and encouraging students studying nontraditional topics, and as a mentor to women and lesbian or gay graduate students, who often otherwise had difficulty finding mentors.\n\nAfter retiring from Chicago in 1986, he joined the anthropology department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he remained until his death in 1995.\n\n\n\n"}

It may be in the form of individual television programs or dedicated specialty channels that is often associated with cable television in the United States as Public, educational, and government access (PEG) channel providers.\n\nThere are also adult education programs for an older audience; many of these are instructional television or \"telecourse\" services that can be taken for college credit. Examples of these include Open University programs on BBC television in the UK.\n\nMany children's television series are educational, ranging from dedicated learning programs to those that indirectly teach the viewers. Some series are written to have a specific moral behind every episode, often explained at the end by the character that learned the lesson.\n\nIn the social aspects of television, several studies have found that educational television has many advantages, like WeTv Arabia world education television channel no.336 in UAE. The Media Awareness Network, explains in its article, The Good Things about Television, that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. The article states that television can help young people discover where they fit into society, develop closer relationships with peers and family, and teach them to understand complex social aspects of communication.\n\nMexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s the use of telenovela to disseminate the government's policy views to mass audiences. The \"Sabido Method\" has been adopted by a number of countries, including India, Kenya, Peru, and China.\n\n\nThe television medium can and has been used for a multitude of educational purposes. Some television programs are explicitly educational, while others only incidentally so. Some formats blend the two in the attempt to amuse but also retain some educational value.\n\nIn the time of TV vs. Radio, the early 1960s were an era of change. Historian Michael Curtin recounted that then-FCC-chair, Jon Doerfor and TV network heads, had come to an agreement that most of TV was based on commercialism and emphasized entertainment too much. To help counterbalance this, there was a plan organized to produce more serious news and documentary programs. This policy was placed just in time for networks to expand their news coverage on the Kennedy-Nixon campaigns and debates. This increase in coverage stirred up the polls as those who \"saw\" the debates, with Kennedy's good looks and camera confidence, decided he had won, whereas those who \"listened\" were more impressed with Nixon.\n\nBy 1962, TV reform was in full swing, and 400 prime-time documentaries had been produced, as opposed to a total of zero back in 1957. Curtin noted that news programs were extended to full half-hour segments,and foreign and domestic issues were receiving heightened degrees of attention.\n\nSome television programs are designed with primarily educational purposes in mind, although they might rely heavily on entertainment to communicate their educational messages. In children's programing, edutainment becomes fun and interesting for the child but can still be educational.\n\nOther television programs are designed to raise social awareness. One form of edutainment popular in Latin America is the educational telenovela. Miguel Sabido, a producer of telenovelas from the 1970s on, has combined communication theory with pro-health/education messages to educate audiences throughout Latin America about family planning, literacy, and other topics. He developed a model which incorporated the work of Albert Bandura and other theorists, as well as research to determine whether programs impacted audience behavior.\n\nThe first ever television series produced in the Pacific Island country of Vanuatu, entitled \"Love Patrol\" and launched in 2007, was praised as an edutainment series, as it aimed to educate viewers on the issue of AIDS, while simultaneously providing an entertaining story.\n\nThe Hulu Original TV series East Los High, is backed by a health initiative to teach healthy sexual behaviors (e.g. using protection during sexual intercourse, getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases).\n\nSome television shows incorporate a considerable degree of historical or factual information while attempting to make the presentation or framing of such content entertaining or exciting. By making learning seem \"exciting\" they can be said to stimulate curiosity. The presence of edutainment is especially evident in children's television series, such as \"Sesame Street\", \"Teletubbies\", and \"Dora The Explorer\". Discovery Channel is also known for its various shows that follow that theme, including \"MythBusters\". Sometimes these programs may be more entertaining than educational, and may replace educational shows in the televisions program lineup. The History Channel has transitioned from producing primarily factual and historical documentaries, to more sensational, dramatic, and supposedly entertaining programs, with educational content a secondary concern.\n\nTelevision series notable for negative reception, from around the world, either by published critics, by network executives or by audience response, can be judged based on poor quality, the lack of a budget, rapid cancellation, very low viewership, offensive content, and/or negative impact on other series on the same channel. In some cases, a show that is acceptable on its own merits can be put in a position where it does not belong and be judged \"worst ever.\" In many cases, \"worst television series ever\" lists are slanted toward more contemporary shows, in recent memory.\n\nThe Children's Television Act of 1990, which was first fully enforced in 1996, requires broadcast television stations in the United States to carry a minimum of three hours of \"educational/informational\" programming geared directly at children. The move prompted an exodus of non-educational children's programming to cable television and largely failed in its efforts to expand the amount of educational television on the airwaves (in fact, children's television in general has declined significantly on broadcast television since the act was imposed, although it can be argued that the E/I regulations could very well be the \"only\" thing keeping children's television on broadcast airwaves in the 2010s).\n\nSome programs are primarily aimed at entertainment, but may contain an incidental amount of educational content. Educational content may be inherent to the design of the show, such as with medical dramas where the plot invariably explores anatomical and biological issues. The Sentinel Award, which is administered by the University of Southern California's Annenberg Center for Communication, the CDC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is given each year to programs that address health and medical issues in their storylines. 2006's nominees/winners include:\n\nWhile some programs are typically \"pure\" entertainment, they may foray into educational content at select times. For older viewers, individual situation comedy episodes also occasionally serve as educational entertainment vehicles. These episodes are sometimes described in United States television commercial parlance as very special episodes. As early as the 1950s, children-aimed shows like \"Watch Mr Wizard\" were made which could be considered edutainment.\n\nOn the other hand, some programs may seem for the lay public to contain educational content, but are actually completely fictional. It is up to experts to figure out if a specific TV program uses realistic or fictional plots. One example for only seemingly real programs are mockumentaries.\n\n"}

ESPOL has five University Faculties or Schools fifteen Research centers and several associated centers providing twenty-six Undergraduate degrees and ten master's degree and research in multiple areas of knowledge.\n\nOn October 24, 1958, through Executive Decree 1664 by President Camilo Ponce Enriquez, the Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral was created as a higher education institution due to increasing demands for a scientific and technological education for the Littoral Region.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 19, 1959, ESPOL was inaugurated, and the following Monday,May 25, 1959, classes began. Its first location, due to the lack of its own campus, was the old \"Casona\" building on \"Chile\" Street of the Universidad de Guayaquil. The area around the historical Peñas area provided a central location in the city, and the buildings in that area were bought by ESPOL with an initial payment of 12 million sucres.\n\nOn 1969, The Quinto Guayas Battalion, gave to ESPOL the area between the Simón Bolívar embankment and Loja Street, where the four departments that existed at that time (Engineering in Geology, Mining engineering and Petroleum engineering; Electrical engineering; Naval engineering and Mechanical engineering) were co-located.\n\nOn 1973, The Naval Infantry Corps of Ecuador moved from their base in Guayaquil, and in their place, the new installations for the Facultad de Ingenieria Maritima y Ciencias del Mar were constructed.\n\nIn 1995 ESPOL began to move from its historical Campus to the new campus that was being built in the outskirts of the city. The new campus included over and included a protected forest which the university took over.\n\nESPOL is involved in multiple changes and projects. Some of the changes are new buildings and facilities.\n\nOn the facilities side ESPOL, in 2009, started the construction of PARCON short for Parque del Conocimiento (Trans: Knowledge Park), where all the research centers of ESPOL will be located in new buildings. In 2009, ESPOL built a set of buildings to host the prepolitenico (first year general studies). In 2010, ESPOL started the construction of the new EDCON building.\n\nNew research centers such as CIDIS begun their work as new entities based on the old VLIR-ESPOL program.\n\nWith 2.5 ha and located near the historical center of Guayaquil, Las Peñas campus was the center of the academic life of ESPOL. However it is impossible for the campus to grow to accommodate the needs of a modern university, therefore, almost everything has moved into the Gustavo Galindo campus for the 2011-2012 Academic year.\n\nWith an extension of 724 ha, the Gustavo Galindo Campus is the biggest and main campus of ESPOL. Its location in the Via Perimetral (Highway) allowing easy access to commuting students. The central administration of the university, the schools administration and research centers are located in this campus. Its infrastructure is the result of the developing plan (Plan de Desarrollo 1983–1992) as well as the creation of the new PARCON\n\nThe Campus Via de la Costa, located on the coast of the Santa Elena Province hosts the CENAIM-ESPOL Foundation and the Sea related degrees and research.\n\nThe Polytechnic High School (Spanish: Colegio Politecnico) is the secondary educational institution linked and colocated to the university. Created in 1995 to answer the need of a high-level secondary education institution, it is located in the Campus Gustavo Galindo.\n\nEscuela de Postgrado de Administracion de Empresas\n\nEscuela de Diseño y Comunicación\n\nSchool of design and communication\n\nThe undergraduate academic offer of the School of Design and Visual Communication of ESPOL is associated with the broad field of Arts and Humanities of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).\n\nEDCOM prepares professionals in the following careers:\n\nUndergraduate degrees\n\n\n\n\nGraduate degrees\n\n\n\nhttp://www.edcom.espol.edu.ec/es\n\nThe Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (Spanish:Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Humanísticas) offers the following degrees:\n\n\n\nStaff\n\nThe School of Engineering in Earth Sciences (Spanish: Facultad de Ingenieria en Ciencias de la Tierra)\n\nOffers the following degrees:\n\nThe School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (Spanish: Facultad de Ingenieria Electrica y Computacion).\n\nAccording to the new university plan and the Schools information, it holds six departments and offers multiple degrees as follows:\n\nFIEC offers Graduate education in its facilities with four Master's programs:\n\nFacultad de Ingenieria Maritima y Ciencias del Mar\n\nFacultad de Ingenieria Mecanica y Ciencias de la Produccion.\n\nNatural Sciences and Mathematics Faculty - FCNM (in Spanish Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Matemáticas)\n\nThe College of the Life Science (Spanish: Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida) is expected to be composed of the current EDCOM, CELEX, Facultad de Tecnologias\n\nAmong the academic resources offered by ESPOL students can choose to follow certification programs through several vendor recogniced academies such as :\n\nThere are several research centers at ESPOL.

{"id": "620809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=620809", "title": "Gap year", "text": "Gap year\n\nA gap year, also known as a sabbatical year, is typically a year-long break between high school and college/university. During the gap year a student normally travels or maintains some type of regular work. Students who take gap years typically undergo a growth in maturity and are better prepared to benefit from higher education or decide the form of education they wish to pursue. Students can also take gap years after graduating from undergraduate study and before entry into graduate school. These students might take advanced courses in math or language studies, learn a trade, study art, volunteer, travel, take internships, play sports, or get involved in cultural exchanges. Studies indicate that students who take a gap year perform better academically than those who do not. Many parents worry their students will deter continuation of their education.\n\nGap years first became common in the 1960's where the young, baby-boom generation wanted to get away from the severity of war from their parents generation. At first, the primary purpose of the gap year was for countries to exchange cultural ideals in the hope to deter future wars from occurring. The outcome of this exchange was the growth of the gap year industry.\n\nThe introduction of gap year companies in the 1960's and 1970's started the gap year industry. With the long term success of organizations like Topdeck, Flight Centre, and Raleigh International, the gap year industry developed rapidly. In 1967, Nicholas Maclean-Bristol created Project Trust, which sent three volunteers to Ethiopia from the UK. The goal of this was to help the nation develop, but also build their own skills. In 1973, Graham Turner innovated the new gap year industry by purchasing a bus and selling tickets to Kathmandu. This lead to Turner creating Topdeck and Flight Centre, which are successful gap year companies today. In 1978, the Prince of Wales and Colonel John Blashford-Snell began Operation Drake which what is now known as Raleigh International, an expedition voyage around the world following Sir Francis Drake's route. \nIn 1969, the first gap year organization was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts. The organization called Dynamy was founded with the intentions of teaching young people self confidence and the role they play in a large community. In the 1980s, the gap year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull in the United States to allow students more time for individual growth. Cornelius saw that students needed a bridge between high school and college that would help develop more hands-on skills. To do this, he founded the Center for Interim Programs in 1980 which had goals of increasing self-awareness and developing new cultural perspectives.\n\nAustralians and New Zealanders have a tradition of travelling overseas independently at a young age. In New Zealand this is known as \"doing an OE\" (Overseas experience). Sometimes this is limited to one year, but at times Australians and New Zealanders will remain overseas for longer, many working short-term in service industry jobs to fund their travels. Europe and Asia are popular destinations for Gap Year travels. In Australia, exchange programs and youth benefits provide many opportunities for young people to gain experience through travel in a gap year. The Gap Year Association provided approximately four million dollars in 2016 in the form of scholarships and need based grants.\n\nThe Time Credit system in Belgium entitles employees of one year per lifetime of absence from their job, in order to prevent burn-out and to provide an opportunity to pursue other important things in life.\n\nIn Denmark during the late 1990s the percentage of students continuing their education directly after high school was down to 25%. Along with this drop there was a rise in the number of students enrolling and graduating within ten years of finishing high school. Data also shows that women in Denmark take more gap years than men.\n\nDenmark has sought to limit the number of students who take a year out, penalizing students who delay their education to travel abroad or work full-time. In 2006, it was announced that fewer students than before had taken a year out. In April 2009, the Danish government proposed a new law which gives a bonus to students who refrain from a year out.\n\nIn Ghana, most senior high school leavers have a year out from August to the August of the following year, although this is not mandatory. \n\nIn Israel, it is customary for young adults who have completed their mandatory military service to go backpacking abroad in groups before starting university or full-time work.\n\nIsrael has also become a popular gap year travel destination for thousands of young Jewish adults from abroad each year. There are over 10,000 participants in the Masa Israel Journey gap year annually.\n\nThe employment practice known as simultaneous recruiting of new graduates matches students with jobs before graduation, meaning sabbaticals are highly unusual in Japan. \n\nWhile unusual, gap years in Japan are not completely unheard of. Some students will take a gap year or two to readjust or reassess their career path or school of choice if not accepted into the school they had originally hoped for.\n\nWhile waiting for their JAMB result after secondary school, Nigerian youths usually learn a trade or skill, or enrol for another academic program (remedial, pre-degree, JUPEB, A-levels, IJMB, etc.) to increase their chances of getting into a university.\n\nIn Romania, after finishing high school, for some universities an admission exam is required . People who do not succeed in passing sometimes take a gap year to study, usually passing in their second attempt. This is common in medicine and engineering.\n\nSimilar to the way that some students travel during a gap year, many Romanian students instead study abroad and in recent years the number of students who choose to do this has been growing.\n\nIn the Republic of South Africa, taking a year off is common for those in more affluent classes. School leavers often travel abroad to gain life experience. It is not uncommon for gap year students to travel to Cape Town for life experience. Common volunteer opportunities include working in animal welfare or tree planting.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the practice of taking a gap year – seen as an interim period of 7 or 8 months between completing secondary education and starting university – began to develop in the 1970s. The period was seen as a time for gaining life experience through travel or volunteering. Universities appear to welcome post-gap-year applicants on the same basis as those going straight to university from previous education.\n\nThe number of students aged 18 opting to defer their university place in order to take a gap year reached a peak of 21,020 in 2008. This figure crashed to 7,320 in 2011 – a year before the introduction of greatly increased tuition fees by the Conservative/Lib Dem (Cameron/Clegg) coalition government. Deferrals in 2016 were near their peak again although Year Out Group states its members now take more bookings from students outside the UK. Shorter gap style experiences (volunteering, expeditions, courses and work placements) are gaining in popularity, as they can be taken without the need to take a full year out of study or work.\n\nIn the United States, the practice of taking a \"year off\" remains the exception, but is gaining in popularity. Parents are starting to encourage their high school graduates to take a gap year to focus on service opportunities. Schools are also beginning to support gap years more; most notably Harvard University and Princeton University, are now encouraging students to take time off, and some have even built gap year-like programs into the curriculum, and many high schools now have counsellors specifically for students interested in taking a gap year.\n\nTaking a year off has recently become slightly more common for Americans, the main reasons are that students are feeling burnt out with schooling and want to take time to make sure their lives are headed in a direction that suits them. Some 40,000 Americans participated in 2013 in sabbatical programs, an increase of almost 20% since 2006, according to statistics compiled by the American Gap Association. Universities such as Georgetown University, New York University, Amherst College, Princeton University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Middlebury College, Davidson College, Yeshiva University, and Reed College have formal policies allowing students to defer admission.\n\nTufts University offers a program called 1+4 which allows students from lower income families to volunteer abroad or within America for a period of one year before starting their bachelor's degree. Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, is the first U.S. university to fully integrate the gap year into a four-year undergraduate degree, which makes financial aid directly available to any student considering a gap year.\n\nSome formal gap year programs can cost as much as $30,000, but cheaper alternatives are becoming more widely available; some reduce costs by offering room and board. For example, the National Civilian Community Corps, an AmeriCorps program, offers 18-24 year olds (no age limit for Team Leaders) an all expense paid gap year (room & board, meals, transportation, etc.) in exchange for a 10-month commitment to National and Community service. AmeriCorps NCCC members travel the country in diverse teams and perform a variety of tasks such as rebuilding trails in national parks, responding to natural disasters or working as mentors for disadvantaged youths. As with most AmeriCorps programs, service members receive an education award of approximately $6,000 upon completion of their service that can be used toward qualified educational expenses or student loans. The zero cost to the member model AmeriCorps offers makes it an attractive alternative to costly gap year programs while leveraging taxpayer dollars to strengthen American communities.\n\nAdditionally, new federal partnerships such as FEMA Corps offer traditional gap year seekers an immersive professional and team building experience that can serve as a launch pad for their careers. Some government programs designed to help students afford college prohibit students from taking a gap year. For example, the Tennessee Promise program requires that students must \"Attend full-time and continuously at an eligible postsecondary institution as defined in T.C.A. § 49-4-708 in the fall term immediately following graduation or attainment of a GED or HiSET diploma; except that a student enrolling in a Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) may enroll in the summer prior to the fall term.\" Malia Obama, daughter of President Barack Obama, took a gap year before attending Harvard university in the fall of 2017. Universities such as Harvard and Princeton are encouraging students to take a Gap year. This time that is taken off can be beneficial so students don't \"burn out\" or partake in indulging behaviors that promote unhealthy stress.\n\nIn Venezuela, students from elite schools generally do their undergraduate studies outside of Venezuela. Gap years were unknown in Venezuela until educational consultant Nelson Agelvis, then counselor of the \"Moral y Luces Herzl-Bialik Jewish school\" in Caracas, insisted on having applicants to US colleges do them. The students went to leadership courses in Israel, PG years at elite US schools, tutorial colleges in the UK, work internships, language centers across the globe, and exploration gap years in remote countries. Today, the practice has become more widespread and Venezuela is a major economic contributor to the gap year. They are also major contributors in the college studies and English studies industries, especially in countries such as Ireland.\n\nIn Yemen, a defer year is mandatory between secondary school (high school) and university. Unless one attends a private university, they must wait one year after secondary school before applying to university. Until the nineties it was mandatory for male graduates to go to the army for one year, and to teach in a school or work in a hospital for female graduates (and for men who cannot attend the army for health reasons).\n\n"}

The goal of the workshop was to lay down the foundations of a prototype semantic representation language for the GDML. The workshop's organizers recognized that the extremely wide scope of mathematics as a whole made it unrealistic to map out the detailed concepts, structures, and operations needed and used in individual mathematical subjects. The workshop therefore limited itself to surveys of the status quo in mathematical representation languages including representation of prominent and fundamental theorems in certain areas that could serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results, and to discussing ways to best identify and design semantic components for individual disciplines of mathematics.\n\nThe workshop organizers are presently preparing a report summarizing the workshop's conclusions and making recommendations for further progress towards a GDML.\n"}

In North America, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Ireland (including Northern Ireland), the position holder is usually known as the \"school principal\", but some schools, primarily independent schools, use the term \"headmaster\" or \"head master\". As in Scotland, the term \"rector\" is still in use in the United States in independent religious schools, as by tradition the Head of School was also a priest. Some American state schools, such as Boston Latin School, Brooklyn Latin School, and Milpitas High School, also use the term \"headmaster\", either because of its history or historical connections.\n\nIn Britain, the terms \"headmaster\" and \"headmistress\" used to be the formal titles in most state schools as well as private schools, with \"head teacher\" only being used as a term to refer to them collectively. In recent years, however, most state schools have switched to the gender-neutral \"head teacher\" as the official title. Nevertheless, the gender-specific terms are still in common use and are still the official titles at some of the remaining state grammar schools and most private schools. Some use other terms, such as \"high master\". In South Africa, independent schools and, the majority of, state schools use the gender-specific terms \"headmaster\" and \"headmistress\" when addressing their head teachers. \n\n\"Principal\" or \"Head of School\" is often used as the title of the head administrator of an elementary school, middle school, or high school or boarding school in some English-speaking countries, including the United States, India, Australia and New Zealand. Public schools in the United States generally use the title \"principal\" whereas private schools in the United States sometimes use the title Head of School.\n\nWhile some head teachers still do some teaching themselves, in most larger schools most of their duties are managerial and pastoral. They are often used to discipline misbehaving students, help organize school sponsored activities, and all teachers in a school report to the head teacher. \n\nIn Australia, the Head teacher is sometimes in charge of one (in the case of a major subject) or multiple (often in smaller schools) specific departments, such as English, History, Maths, Science, Writing, Technology, etc., but maintains full teaching duties and status. They are considered part of the school executive, and often a head teacher position is a stepping-stone into administration.\n\nIn larger schools, the principal is assisted by one or more \"vice-principals\", \"assistant principals\", \"associate principals\", or \"deputy principals\". Their position is secondary to the principal with regard to school governance. Assistant principals generally perform specific duties such as handling student discipline, curriculum, student council or student activities whereas the principal has the ultimate responsibility for the school as a whole (including faculty and staff, physical plant, etc.).\n\nIn many Australian and New Zealand schools, a headmaster/principal is the head administrator of a school who has been appointed to her/his position by the school board, superintendent, or other body. The principal, often in conjunction with the school board, makes the executive decisions that govern the school, as well as having the authority over the employment (and in some cases firing) of teachers. The principal is often the chief disciplinarian of the students.\n\nIn 1999, there were about 133,000 principals and assistant principals in the United States. In the early decades of public education, the full title was \"principal teacher\", which accounts for the present day title having an adjectival form, essentially being a foreshortened version of the original full title. Yet the term Headmaster and Head of School is still used in some older schools. School principals in the United States are expected to have school administrator licensure, and, often, a master's degree in educational administration.\n\nWhile there has been considerable anecdotal discussion about the importance of school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into their impact on student outcomes. Recent analysis in the United States has examined how the gains in student achievement at a school change after the principal changes. This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. Such research in the state of Texas found that principals have a very large impact on student achievement. Effective school leaders have been shown to significantly improve the performance of all students at the school, at least in part through their impacts on selection and retention of good teachers. Ineffective principals have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important for school administrators as they are for teachers. The impact of principals has also been measured in non-traditional ways. Some principals have focused their efforts on creating more inclusive schools for students with disabilities.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "495143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=495143", "title": "Imperial Rescript on Education", "text": "Imperial Rescript on Education\n\nThe was signed by Emperor Meiji of Japan on 30 October 1890 to articulate government policy on the guiding principles of education on the Empire of Japan. The 315 character document was read aloud at all important school events, and students were required to study and memorize the text.\n\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration, the leadership of the Meiji government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centered on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality; however, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an \"emperor-centered\" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others.\n\nAfter it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Emperor Meiji.\n\nThe Rescript requested of the people that they \"furthermore advance public good and promote common interests; always respect the Constitution and observe the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth\".\n\nThe basis of the Rescript was that Japan's unique \"kokutai\" (system of government) was based on a historic bond between benevolent rulers and loyal subjects, and that the fundamental purpose of education was to cultivate virtues, especially loyalty and filial piety.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in Asia following the surrender of Japan, the American occupation authorities forbade the formal reading of the Imperial Rescript in schools, and the National Diet officially abolished it on 19 June 1948.\n\nIn 1907, Kikuchi Dairoku was invited by the University of London to give lectures on education from the middle of February for about five months. The central focus of his lectures was the Imperial Rescript on Education. The request for the lectures was initially communicated to Hayashi Tadasu, then ambassador in London (from December 1905). At first Sawayanagi Matsutaro was to give the lectures, but he was recalled when in Rome on the way to London and Kikuchi gave the lectures instead. As a preparation for the lectures he translated the Imperial Rescript into English.\n\n\n\n"}

Established August 25, 1875 in Nancy, France, the scholars' forum has met regularly since its inception, presently in three year increments, with the exception of during the conflict of World War II. Its meeting location alternates between Europe and the Americas. Congress members come from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, art, education, economy, geography, history, human rights, law, philosophy, linguistics, sociology, and urban studies.\n\nA wide variety of subjects have been presented at the various conferences. Father Émile Petitot spoke at the 1875 Congress on the matter of the Asiatic origin of Inuit and North American Indians. Precipitated by a comment from Franz Boas, a \"lively controversy\" occurred at the 1902 conference in New York City over the coined word \"Amerind\". At the 1910 session in Mexico City, Marcos E. Becerra presented a paper on Hernán Cortés's 1524–25 expedition to Las Hibueras. The International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, a co-operative of academic anthropologist researchers and human rights activists, was first proposed at the Munich/Stuttgart conference in August 1968. The 1982 congress in Manchester included the largest conference ever convened on the Amazon basin. At the 1988 congress in Amsterdam, researchers organized a symposium agreeing to create a European network for the interchange of information about Latin America produced in Europe which was the precursor for REDIAL.\n\nThe president of the 53rd Congress was the Mexican anthropologist Elio Masferrer Kan. The event took place July 19–24, 2009, in Mexico City. The 54th Congress took place July 15–20, 2012 in Vienna (Austria), and was organized by the University of Vienna, the Austrian Latin America Institute and the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna.

Penick is an American professor of science education who has taught in high schools, community college, and at several universities in the United States and abroad. Author of more than 200 articles in professional journals and 40 books and monographs, Penick is best known for promoting innovative programs and processes for enhancing undergraduate teacher education. Many of his innovations were based on his studies of exemplary teachers in the United States, studies that focused on determining the roles of effective teachers.\n\nIn addition to his work with undergraduates, Penick has conducted workshops and presentations for teachers in almost every state of the U.S., speaking about and demonstrating how research can inform teacher practice and conditions. Widening his scope, Penick has worked extensively with a variety of international universities, ministries of education, and organizations in 35 countries.\n\nPenick received his B.S. in zoology and chemistry (1966) and his M.A. in biology education (1969) from the University of Miami. He received his Ph.D. in Science Education from The Florida State University in 1973. At Florida State he was mentored by Professor Dorothy M. Schlitt, known for her innovative ideas related to science teacher education. At Florida State, Penick was also significantly influenced by Professors Charles Matthews and Ron Good. While at Florida State Penick met fellow student James A. Shymansky, with whom he would continue to work for many years.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1973, Penick became assistant professor at Loyola University of Chicago, where he taught and was Director of Teacher Education in his second year. In 1975 Penick left Loyola for the University of Iowa, where his classmate, James A. Shymansky, had been for two years. At Iowa, Penick was promoted to Associate Professor (1977) and Professor (1982) and eventually was named Department Chair (1982). While at Iowa, Penick worked closely with Vincent Lunetta in developing and expanding a preservice science teacher education program, initially funded by the National Science Foundation, called Iowa UPSTEP. During Penick’s years at the University of Iowa, the department of science education was noted as being large, dynamic, and highly productive of scholarly publications and outstanding students at every level. In 1985 he was a senior Fulbright Scholar at the University of Lisbon (Portugal) and The Technion (Haifa, Israel).\n\nAfter more than 22 years at the University of Iowa, Penick was named Head of the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education at North Carolina State University. As Department Head, Penick emphasized research productivity and hired a number of new faculty members. During his more than 10 years as Head, the value of grants obtained by his department grew significantly and his department grew in research productivity.\n\nFollowing his retirement from NC State in 2009, Penick accepted a position as Director for Research and Development at Sangari do Brasil, in Sao Paulo Brazil. With the creation of Sangari USA, Penick became vice president for research and development of the American subsidiary. He retired from Sangari in 2011 and currently resides in Miami Florida.\n\nActive academically, Penick has been or is on the editorial boards of a number of journals. Penick has received formal recognition from a number of groups, including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE), which has presented him with its Outstanding Research award (1976, with James A. Shymansky), Outstanding Mentor award (1997), and named him Outstanding Science Educator in 1987. Penick was elected president of ASTE in 2002-2003. The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), of which he was president in 2003-2004, awarded him with several awards before naming him to receive the Robert H. Carleton award, its highest honor, in 2013. President of the National Association of Biology Teachers in 1989, he has also received its highest award, Honorary Membership. Epsilon Pi Tau, the national honorary for technology education presented Penick with a Distinguished Service Citation in 2003 for his contributions to technology education.

{"id": "335390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335390", "title": "Josef Albers", "text": "Josef Albers\n\nJosef Albers (; ; March 19, 1888March 25, 1976) was a German-born American artist and educator whose work, both in Europe and in the United States, formed the basis of modern art education programs of the twentieth century.\n\nAlbers was born into a Roman Catholic family of craftsmen in Bottrop, Westphalia, Germany. He worked from 1908 to 1913 as a schoolteacher in his home town; he also trained as an art teacher at Königliche Kunstschule in Berlin, Germany, from 1913 to 1915. From 1916 to 1919 he began his work as a printmaker at the Kunstgewerbschule in Essen. In 1918 he received his first public commission, \"Rosa mystica ora pro nobis\", a stained-glass window for a church in Essen. In 1919 he went to Munich, Germany, to study at the Königliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst, where he was a pupil of Max Doerner and Franz Stuck.\n\nAlbers enrolled as a student in the preliminary course (Vorkurs) of Johannes Itten at the Weimar Bauhaus in 1920. Although Albers had studied painting, it was as a maker of stained glass that he joined the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1922, approaching his chosen medium as a component of architecture and as a stand-alone art form. The director and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, asked him in 1923 to teach in the preliminary course 'Werklehre' of the department of design to introduce newcomers to the principles of handicrafts, because Albers came from that background and had appropriate practice and knowledge.\n\nIn 1925, Albers was promoted to professor, the year the Bauhaus moved to Dessau. At this time, he married Anni Albers (née Fleischmann) who was a student there. His work in Dessau included designing furniture and working with glass. As a younger art teacher, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among artists who included Oskar Schlemmer, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee. The so-called form master, Klee taught the formal aspects in the glass workshops where Albers was the crafts master; they cooperated for several years.\n\nWith the closure of the Bauhaus under Nazi pressure in 1933 the artists dispersed, most leaving the country. Albers emigrated to the United States. The architect Philip Johnson, then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, arranged for Albers to be offered a job as head of a new art school, Black Mountain College, in North Carolina. In November 1933, he joined the faculty of the college where he was the head of the painting program until 1949.\n\nAt Black Mountain, his students included Ruth Asawa, Ray Johnson, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, and Susan Weil. He also invited important American artists such as Willem de Kooning, to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was \"his own academy\". She said that Albers claimed that \"when you're in school, you're not an artist, you're a student\", although he was very supportive of self-expression when one became an artist and began on her or his journey. Albers produced many woodcuts and leaf studies at this time.\nIn 1950, Albers left Black Mountain to head the department of design at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. While at Yale, Albers worked to expand the nascent graphic design program (then called \"graphic arts\"), hiring designers Alvin Eisenman, Herbert Matter, and Alvin Lustig. Albers worked at Yale until he retired from teaching in 1958. At Yale, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Eva Hesse, Neil Welliver, and Jane Davis Doggett were notable students.\n\nIn 1962, as a fellow at Yale, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for the Advanced Studies of Fine Arts for an exhibit and lecture on his work. Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect King-lui Wu in creating decorative designs for some of Wu's projects. Among these were distinctive geometric fireplaces for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the façade of Manuscript Society, one of Yale's secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces.\n\nIn 1963, he published \"Interaction of Color\" which presented his theory that colors were governed by an internal and deceptive logic. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 silk screen plates. This work has been republished since and is now even available as a cell phone app. Also during this time, he created the abstract album covers of band leader Enoch Light's Command LP records. His album cover for Terry Snyder and the All Stars 1959 album, \"Persuasive Percussion\", shows a tightly packed grid or lattice of small black disks from which a few wander up and out as if stray molecules of some light gas. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. Albers continued to paint and write, staying in New Haven with his wife, textile artist, Anni Albers, until his death in 1976.\n\nAccomplished as a designer, photographer, typographer, printmaker, and poet, Albers is best remembered for his work as an abstract painter and theorist. He favored a very disciplined approach to composition. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series, \"Homage to the Square\". In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with nested squares. Usually painting on Masonite, he used a palette knife with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406×406 mm to 1.22×1.22 m.\n\nIn 1959, a gold-leaf mural by Albers, \"Two Structural Constellations\" was engraved in the lobby of the Corning Glass Building in Manhattan. For the entrance of the Time & Life Building lobby, he created \"Two Portals\" (1961), a 42-feet by 14-feet mural of alternating glass bands in white and brown that recede into two bronze centers to create an illusion of depth. In the 1960s Walter Gropius, who was designing the Pan Am Building with Emery Roth & Sons and Pietro Belluschi, commissioned Albers to make a mural. The artist reworked \"City\", a sandblasted glass construction that he had designed in 1929 at the Bauhaus, and renamed it \"Manhattan\". The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign in c. 2000. Before his death in 1976 Albers left exact specifications of the work so it could easily be replicated. In 1967, his painted mural \"Growth\" (1965) as well as \"Loggia Wall\" (1965), a brick relief, were installed on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology. Other architectural works include \"Gemini\" (1972), a stainless steel relief for the Grand Avenue National Bank lobby in Kansas City, Missouri, and \"Reclining Figure\" (1972), a mosaic mural for the Celanese Building in Manhattan destroyed in 1980. At the invitation of a former student, the architect Harry Seidler, Albers designed the mural \"Wrestling\" (1976) for Seidler's Mutual Life Center in Sydney, Australia.\n\nHe was known to meticulously list the specific manufacturer's colours and varnishes he used on the back of his works, as if the colours were catalogued components of an optical experiment. His work represents a transition between traditional European art and the new American art. It incorporated European influences from the Constructivists and the Bauhaus movement, and its intensity and smallness of scale were typically European, but his influence fell heavily on American artists of the late 1950s and the 1960s. \"Hard-edge\" abstract painters drew on his use of patterns and intense colors, while Op artists and conceptual artists further explored his interest in perception.\n\nIn an article about the artist, published in 1950, Elaine de Kooning concluded that however impersonal his paintings might at first appear, not one of them \"could have been painted by any one but Josef Albers himself.\" Although their relationship was often tense, and sometimes, even combative, Robert Rauschenberg later identified Albers as his most important teacher.\n\nIn 1936, Albers was given his first solo show in Manhattan at J. B. Neumann's New Art Circle. He participated in documenta I (1955) and documenta IV (1968) in Kassel. A major Albers exhibition, organized by the Museum of Modern Art, traveled in South America, Mexico, and the United States from 1965 to 1967. In 1971 he was the first living artist to be given a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. In 2010, a show of 80 oil works on paper, many never exhibited before, was mounted by the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, later travelling to other venues, including Centre Pompidou in Paris, and The Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan. In 2014, an exhibition at the Elliott Museum in Stuart, FL called \"Albers and Heirs\" featured the work of Albers, Neil Welliver, and Jane Davis Doggett.\n\nThe Josef Albers papers, documents from 1929 to 1970, were donated by the artist to the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art in 1969 and 1970. In 1971 (nearly five years before his death), Albers founded the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, a nonprofit organization he hoped would further \"the revelation and evocation of vision through art.\" Today, this organization not only serves as the office for the estates of both Josef Albers and his wife Anni Albers, but also supports exhibitions and publications focused on the works of both Albers. The official foundation building is located in Bethany, Connecticut, and \"includes a central research and archival storage center to accommodate the Foundation's art collections, library and archives, and offices, as well as residence studios for visiting artists.\"\n\nThe executive director of the foundation is Nicholas Fox Weber. Later the foundation was instrumental in having four fakes from Italy, represented as the work of Albers and on sale in auction houses and galleries in France and Germany, seized by the police.\n\nIn 1997, one year after the auction house, Sotheby's, had bought the Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the estates of both artists, did not renew its three-year contract with the gallery. Currently, the foundation is represented by David Zwirner in New York, Waddington Custot Galleries in London, and the Alan Cristea Gallery in London, and now, a large part of his estate is held by the Josef Albers Museum in Bottrop, Germany, where he was born.\n\nJoseph Albers' book \"Interaction of Color\" is widely influential but, according to Alan Lee, has not received close critical attention. Lee undertakes to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the Weber-Fechner Law and simultaneous contrast. In each case Albers is shown to have made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. It is suggested that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). It is suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, there are implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.\n\nSeveral paintings in his series \"Homage to the Square\" have outsold their estimates. \"Homage to the Square: Joy\" (1964) sold for $1.5 million, nearly double its estimate, during a 2007 sale at Sotheby's. More recently, \"Study for Homage to the Square,R-III E.B.\" also sold for around twice the estimated $545,000–$700,000, eventually reaching $1.22 million at auction.\n\n\n\n\nArchives of American Art collection:\n\nWorks by Josef Albers\n"}

{"id": "1583393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1583393", "title": "Lewis Terman", "text": "Lewis Terman\n\nLewis Madison Terman (January 15, 1877 – December 21, 1956) was an American psychologist and author. He was noted as a pioneer in educational psychology in the early 20th century at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. He is best known for his revision of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales and for initiating the longitudinal study of children with high IQs called the Genetic Studies of Genius. He was a prominent eugenicist and was a member of the Human Betterment Foundation. He also served as president of the American Psychological Association. A \"Review of General Psychology\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Terman as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with G. Stanley Hall.\n\nTerman was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of Martha P. (Cutsinger) and James William Terman. He received a BS, BPd (Bachelor of Pedagogy), and BA from Central Normal College in 1894 and 1898, and a BA and MA from the Indiana University Bloomington in 1903. He received his PhD from Clark University in 1905.\n\nHe worked as a school principal in San Bernardino, California in 1905, and as a professor at Los Angeles Normal School in 1907. In 1910, he joined the faculty of Stanford University as a professor of educational psychology at the invitation of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley and remained associated with the university until his death. He served as chairman of the psychology department from 1922 to 1945.\n\nHis son, Frederick Terman, is widely credited (together with William Shockley) with being the father of Silicon Valley.\n\nTerman published the \"Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Scale\" in 1916 and revisions were released in 1937 and 1960. Original work on the test had been completed by Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon of France. Terman promoted his test – the \"Stanford-Binet\" – as an aid for the classification of developmentally disabled children. Early on, Terman adopted William Stern's suggestion that \"mental age/chronological age times 100\" be made the \"intelligence quotient\" or \"IQ\". Later revisions adopted the Wechsler cohort-norming of IQ.\n\nRevisions (mostly recently the fifth) of the Stanford-Binet remain in widespread use as a measure of general intelligence for both adults and for children.\n\nThe first mass administration of IQ testing was done with 1.7 million soldiers during World War I, when Terman served in a psychological testing role with the United States military. Terman was able to work with other applied psychologists to categorize army recruits. The recruits were given group intelligence tests which took about an hour to administer. Testing options included Army Alpha, a text-based test, and Army Beta, a picture-based test for nonreaders. 25% could not complete the Alpha test. The examiners scored the tests on a scale ranging from \"A\" through \"E\".\n\nRecruits who earned scores of \"A\" would be trained as officers while those who earned scores of \"D\" and \"E\" would never receive officer training. The work of psychologists during the war proved to Americans that intelligence tests could have broader utility. After the war Terman and his colleagues pressed for intelligence tests to be used in schools to improve the efficiency of growing American schools.\n\nTerman followed J. McKeen Cattell's work which combined the ideas of Wilhelm Wundt and Francis Galton saying that those who are intellectually superior will have better \"sensory acuity, strength of grip, sensitivity to pain, and memory for dictated consonants\". At Clark University, Terman wrote his doctoral dissertation entitled \"Genius and stupidity: a study of some of the intellectual processes of seven \"bright\" and seven \"stupid\" boys\". He administered Cattell's tests on boys who were considered intelligent versus boys who were considered unintelligent.\n\nUnlike Binet and Simon, whose goal was to identify less able school children in order to aid them with the needed care required, Terman proposed using IQ tests to classify children and put them on the appropriate job-track. He believed IQ was inherited and was the strongest predictor of one's ultimate success in life. \n\nTerman's study of genius and gifted children was a lifelong interest. His fascination with the intelligence of children began early in his career since he was familiar with Alfred Binet's research in this area.\n\nThrough his studies on gifted children, Terman hoped first, to discover the best educational settings for gifted children and, second, to test and dispel the negative stereotypes that gifted children were \"conceited, freakish, socially eccentric, and [insane]\".\n\nPreviously, the research had looked at genius adults had been retrospective, examining their early years for clues to the development of talent. With Binet's development of IQ tests, it became possible to quickly identify gifted children and study them from their early childhood into adulthood. In his 1922 paper called \"A New Approach to the Study of Genius\", Terman noted that this advancement in testing marked a change in research on geniuses and giftedness. Throughout his life Terman developed several methods for examining individuals with high ability, such as the longitudinal method and above-level testing. Some of these procedures would be adopted by other social scientists studying very different populations.\n\nTerman found his answers in his longitudinal study on gifted children: Genetic Studies of Genius. Initiated in 1921, the Genetic Studies of Genius was from the outset a long-term study of gifted children. Published in five volumes, Terman followed children with extremely high IQ in childhood throughout their lives. The fifth volume examined the children in a 35-year follow-up, and looked at the gifted group during mid-life.\n\nGenetic Studies of Genius revealed that gifted and genius children were in at least as good as average health and had normal personalities. Few of them demonstrated the previously-held negative stereotypes of gifted children. He found that gifted children did not fit the existing stereotypes often associated with them: they were not weak and sickly social misfits, but in fact were generally taller, in better health, better developed physically, and better adapted socially than other children. The children included in his studies were colloquially referred to as \"Termites\". The gifted children thrived both socially and academically. In relationships, they were less likely to divorce. Additionally, those in the gifted group were generally successful in their careers: Many received awards recognizing their achievements. Though many of the children reached exceptional heights in adulthood, not all did. Terman explored the causes of obvious talent not being realized, exploring personal obstacles, education, and lack of opportunity as causes.\n\nTerman died before he completed the fifth volume of \"Genetic Studies of Genius,\" but Melita Oden, a colleague, completed the volume and published it. Terman wished for the study to continue on after his death, so he selected Robert Richardson Sears, one of the many successful participants in the study as well as a colleague of his, to continue with the work. The study is still supported by Stanford University and will continue until the last of the \"Termites\" withdraws from the study or dies.\n\nIn 1915, he wrote a paper called \"The mental hygiene of exceptional children\". He pointed out that though he believed the capacity for intelligence is inherited, those with exceptional intelligence also need exceptional schooling. Terman wrote that \"[bright children] are rarely given tasks which call forth their best ability, and as a result they run the risk of falling into lifelong habits of submaximum efficiency\". In other words, nature (heredity) plays a large role in determining intelligence, but nurture (the environment) is also important in fostering the innate intellectual ability. By his own admission, there was nothing in his own ancestry that would have led anyone to predict him to have an intellectual career.\n\nTerman found too that while exceptional childhood IQ was associated with many great adult achievements, participants as a whole did not greatly exceed the socio-economic outcomes of others from similar social class backgrounds. Non-IQ factors may include hard work, luck, social contacts, good health, and other skills.\n\nFrom 1957 until 2018, Terman and his son had a middle school name after them. In 2018, the school board of the Palo Alto Unified School District unanimously decided to rename the school in honor of Ellen Fletcher after Terman's involvement with the eugenics movement came to the notice of parents and the school board.\n\nHis son Frederick Terman, as provost of Stanford University, greatly expanded the science, statistics and engineering departments that helped catapult Stanford into the ranks of the world's first class educational institutions, as well as spurring the growth of Silicon Valley. Stanford University has an endowed professorship in his honor.\n\nTerman came to believe that IQ was, in addition to dependent on education, highly heritable.\n\nHis innovative wide-scale IQ testing exposed him to diverse groups of test-takers. Administering the tests to Spanish-speakers and unschooled African-Americans from the Southwest, he concluded:\n\nHigh-grade or border-line deficiency... is very, very common among Spanish-Indian and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial, or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they come... Children of this group should be segregated into separate classes... They cannot master abstractions but they can often be made into efficient workers... from a eugenic point of view they constitute a grave problem because of their unusually prolific breeding (\"The Measurement of Intelligence\", 1916, p. 91-92).\n\nTesting other groups in California, he observed:\n\nPerhaps a median IQ of 80 for Italian, Portuguese, and Mexican school children in the cities of California would be a liberal estimate. How much of this inferiority is due to the language handicap and to other environmental factors it is impossible to say, but the relatively good showing made by certain other immigrant groups similarly handicapped would suggest that the true causes lie deeper than environment. (\"Mental and Physical Traits of a Thousand Gifted Children, Volume 1\", 1925, p. 57)\n\nThe suggestions of a significant role for genetics in IQ led Terman to later join the Human Betterment Foundation, a Pasadena-based eugenics group founded by E. S. Gosney in 1928 which had as part of its agenda the promotion and enforcement of compulsory sterilization laws in California.\n\nA modern-day assessment of Terman's contributions concluded:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5172349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5172349", "title": "Library and information science", "text": "Library and information science\n\nLibrary and information science (LIS) (sometimes given as the plural library and information sciences) or as \"library and information studies\" is a merging of library science and information science. The joint term is associated with schools of library and information science (abbreviated to \"SLIS\"). In the last part of the 1960s, schools of librarianship, which generally developed from professional training programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during the second half of the 20th century, began to add the term \"information science\" to their names. The first school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964. More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to their names.\nWeaver Press:\nAlthough there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world. In Denmark, for example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' changed its English name to The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 1997. Exceptions include Tromsø, Norway, where the term documentation science is the preferred name of the field, France, where information science and communication studies form one interdiscipline, and Sweden, where the fields of Archival science, Library science and Museology have been integrated as Archival, Library and Museum studies.\n\nIn spite of various trends to merge the two fields, some consider the two original disciplines, library science and information science, to be separate. However, the tendency today is to use the terms as synonyms or to drop the term \"library\" and to speak about \"information departments\" or \"I-schools\". There have also been attempts to revive the concept of documentation and to speak of Library, information and documentation studies (or science).\n\nTefko Saracevic (1992, p. 13) argued that library science and information science are separate fields:\n\nAnother indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in UMI's Dissertations Abstracts. In \"Dissertations Abstracts Online\" on November 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor LIBRARY SCIENCE and 9053 with the descriptor INFORMATION SCIENCE. For the year 2009 the numbers were 104 LIBRARY SCIENCE and 514 INFORMATION SCIENCE. 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms (36 in 2009).\n\nIt should be considered that information science grew out of documentation science and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication, bibliographic databases, subject knowledge and terminology etc. Library science, on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices. It is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists, while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries. Library schools have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation. When information scientists from 1964 entered library schools, they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases, including concepts such as recall and precision, boolean search techniques, query formulation and related issues. Subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination - and also in the curriculum at library schools.\n\nJulian Warner (2010) suggests that the information and computer science tradition in information retrieval may broadly be characterized as query transformation, with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records. From librarianship and indexing, on the other hand, has been an implicit stress on selection power enabling the user to make relevant selections.\n\n\"The question, 'What is library and information science?' does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields, e.g., 'What is chemistry?', 'What is economics?', 'What is medicine?' Each of those fields, though broad in scope, has clear ties to basic concerns of their field. [...] Neither LIS theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills. Occasionally, LIS scholars (many of whom do not self-identify as members of an interreading LIS community, or prefer names other than LIS), attempt, but are unable, to find core concepts in common. Some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of LIS, indeed see LIS as a sub-field of computer science! [Footnote III.1] Others claim that LIS is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing. Historically, traditions of public service, bibliography, documentalism, and information science have viewed their mission, their philosophical toolsets, and their domain of research differently. Still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan LIS, viewing LIS instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared (and fought-over) use of the descriptor information. Indeed, claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own.\" (Konrad, 2007, p. 652-653).\n\nThe Swedish researcher Emin Tengström (1993) described cross-disciplinary research as a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:\n\nWhat is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. Library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an academic discipline in its own right. However, the following quote seems to indicate that LIS is actually developing in the opposite direction:\n\nChua & Yang (2008) studied papers published in \"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology\" in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: \"Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary\ncoauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords’ occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science.\"\n\nA more recent study revealed that 31% of the papers published in 31 LIS journals from 2007 through 2012 were by authors in academic departments of library and information science (i.e., those offering degree programs accredited by the American Library Association or similar professional organizations in other countries). Faculty in departments of computer science (10%), management (10%), communication (3%), the other social sciences (9%), and the other natural sciences (7%) were also represented. Nearly one-quarter of the papers in the 31 journals were by practicing librarians, and 6% were by others in non-academic (e.g., corporate) positions.\n\nAs a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, LIS is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods LIS is just as clearly an interdiscipline, drawing on many adjacent fields (see below).\n\nRichard Whitley (1984, 2000) classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a ‘fragmented adhocracy’, a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non-specialized terminology; but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector. Åström (2006) applied this conception to the description of LIS.\n\nMeho & Spurgin (2005) found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science, only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. Even when the nine most comprehensive databases in LIS was searched and combined, 27.0% (or 710 of 2,635) of the publications remain not found.\n\"Concern for people becoming informed is not unique to LIS, and thus is insufficient to differentiate LIS from other fields. LIS are a part of a larger enterprise.\" (Konrad, 2007, p. 655).\n\n\"The unique concern of LIS is recognized as: Statement of the core concern of LIS:\nHumans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records. No other field has this as its concern. \" (Konrad, 2007, p. 660)\n\n\"Note that the promiscuous term \"information\" does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field's central concerns: The detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above (Part III). Furner [Furner 2004, 427] has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i-word for specific senses of that term.\" (Konrad, 2007, p. 661).\n\nMichael Buckland wrote: \"Educational programs in library, information and documentation are concerned with what people know, are not limited to technology, and require wide-ranging expertise. They differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools.\".\n\nBawden and Robinson argue that while Information Science has overlaps with numerous other disciplines with interest in studying communication, it is unique in that it is concerned with all aspects of the communication chain. For example Computer Science may be interested in the indexing and retrieval, sociology with user studies, and publishing (business) with dissemination, whereas information science is interested in the study of all of these individual areas and the interactions between them.\n\nThe organization of information and information resources is one of the fundamental aspects of LIS. and is an example of both LIS's uniqueness and its multidisciplinary origins. Some of the main tools used by LIS toward this end to provide access to the digital resources of modern times (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) originated in 19th century to assist humanity's effort to make its intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge. . The origin for some of these tools were even earlier. For example, in the 17th century, during the 'golden age of libraries', publishers and sellers seeking to take advantage of the burgeoning book trade developed descriptive catalogs of their wares for distribution – a practice was adopted and further extrapolated by many libraries of the time to cover areas like philosophy, sciences, linguistics, medicine, etc. In this way, a business concern of publishers – keeping track of and advertising inventory – was developed into a system for organizing and preserving information by the library.\n\nThe development of Metadata is another area that exemplifies the aim of LIS to be something more than an mishmash of several disciplines – that uniqueness Bawden and Robinson describe. Pre-Internet classification systems and cataloging systems were mainly concerned with two objectives: 1. to provide rich bibliographic descriptions and relations between information objects and 2. to facilitate sharing of this bibliographic information across library boundaries. The development of the Internet and the information explosion that followed found many communities needing mechanisms for the description, authentication and management of their information. These communities developed taxonomies and controlled vocabularies to describe their knowledge as well as unique information architectures to communicate these classifications and libraries found themselves as liaison or translator between these metadata systems. Of course the concerns of cataloging in the Internet era have gone beyond simple bibliographic descriptions. The need for descriptive information about the ownership and copyright of a digital product – a publishing concern – and description for the different formats and accessibility features of a resource – a sociological concern – show the continued development and cross discipline necessity of resource description.\n\nJulian Warner (2010, p. 4-5) suggests that\n\nThe domain analytic approach (e.g., Hjørland 2010) suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria. In some fields (e.g. evidence-based medicine) the relevant distinctions are very explicit. In other cases they are implicit or unclear. At the basic level, the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge.\n\nAmong other approaches, Evidence Based Library and Information Practice should also be mentioned.\n\nSome core journals in LIS are:\n\n\nImportant bibliographical databases in LIS are, among others, Social Sciences Citation Index and Library and Information Science Abstracts\n\nThis is a list of some of the major conferences in the field.\n\n\nAn advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011, provides one view of which subdisciplines are well-established: \"The research and teaching/supervision must be within some (and at least one) of these well-established information science areas\n\nThere are other ways to identify subfields within LIS, for example bibliometric mapping and comparative studies of curricula.\nBibliometric maps of LIS have been produced by, among others, Vickery & Vickery (1987, frontispiece), White & McCain (1998), Åström (2002, 2006) and Hassan-Montero & Herrero-Solana (2007). \nAn example of a curriculum study is Kajberg & Lørring, 2005. In this publication are the following data reported (p 234):\n\"Degree of overlap of the ten curricular themes with subject areas in the current curricula of responding LIS schools\n\nThere is often an overlap between these subfields of LIS and other fields of study. Most information retrieval research, for example, belongs to computer science. Knowledge management is considered a subfield of management or organizational studies.\n\n\n"}

The game was released in German-speaking countries on 31 January 2013. The international German download version for Windows was released through the Steam-service as well. The English version was released just a day after in the rest of Europe whereas the version for the US market was released on 12 February. A version for Mac OS X was published on 2 August 2013.\n\nThe title covers the time of the 1920s - the Roaring Twenties - at the time of the Prohibition in the United States. The game's story takes place in Atlantic City, Atlantic County where, due to the ban of any alcohol in this era, Mafia organizations were able to become powerful off the back of the illegal speakeasys.\n\nIn a time where criminal gangs rule the city and a handful of morally-questionable men were able to succeed through illegal gambling, high-strength spirits and shady machinations, the player's storyline takes place as the main character creates his empire in this melting pot of illegality. Boss D'Angelo is an immigrant who was born in a small village in Sicily and has just arrived in Atlantic City. He has to work his way up the ladder through the -like world. Working his way up from nothing, He must establish himself in the criminal underworld by buying and raiding businesses and attacking rivals, all the while simultaneously fulfilling his version of the American dream.\n\nArriving at Atlantic City, Boss D'Angelo begins his foothold on the criminal empire as he makes money off the prohibition and gambling trade. Sending money back to his brother, he keeps his status as a mob boss secret from him as he works for Louie, a Capo under the eye of Danny Corsini, the leader of the Mafia in Atlantic City. His enemies ranges from independent gangsters to the Ku Klux Klan, which is at bitter odds with the growing immigration problem. Eventually tired of working for Louie, he was sent to perform one last job which was revealed to be a trap, as Danny Corsini was the intended target. The Boss thwarts the assassination and becomes a Capo under Corsini.\n\nExpanding his criminal empire eventually allows his brother to come to Atlantic City but not as a brother in crime an FBI Agent in New York. When the Boss' attempts to set up a source of income through the gambling/nightclub trade draw suspicion to him, Danny Corsini attempts to defend him killing his brother. Forced to turn on Corsini, the Boss emerges victorious. Knowing that his position is fragile, he attempts to unite the Jewish Gangs and Irish Mob in an alliance only for it to be attacked by the KKK. With the D'Angelo mob as the sole survivor of the struggle, the Boss is named Capo de Tutti. He later earns money through real estate and by supporting Mr. Smith as mayor which gives him great influence in the city, upon reaching Michigan Ave his brother offers one last chance for the Boss to come clean, the Boss rejects the idea of selling his men out and eliminates the witnesses who planned to rat out the boss. The Boss came out clean and triumphant and made amends with his brother and owns a private island which he calls Nova Sicilia and his brother left the agency to pursue his dream of being a shipwright and vowed to never speak of their days in the prohibition again.\n\nThe Japanese Incentive\n\nSomewhere in between the meeting of his brother and the death of Louie Castaneda, Boss D'Angelo receives a lucrative offer from a Japanese Yakuza Hikaro Eda and Fritz, a backer who wanted to help Eda exert his influence into America as laws back then prohibited Asians from owning property. There he meets the beautiful Mikoto Mori, the trophy wife of the Yakuza boss. Little did the boss know, she has a personal vendetta against Hikaro and the Boss now is caught in between love for the woman and the wrath of a powerful man.\n\nThe story begins with Karl Fritz who approaches the Boss with a deal from Hikaro Eda, an influential Japanese man who had him muscle into McGyure Clan's turf and quickly proves his worth to Hikaro and was tasked with a smuggling job from him. Upon preventing the McGyure Clan from destroying the cargo did he realize what was he smuggling, his wife Kumiko Mori. Angered by the McGyure's attempt at murdering her he personally wipes out the clan and earns a promising alliance with the Yakuza. When Hikaro and his men were attacked at a Cherry Blossom festival by members of the Ku Klux Klan did Hikaro sent him to find who tried to kill him and the Boss learned that Hikaro's own wife was the culprit. Sickened by this senseless conflict he tries to run off with her in an attempt to escape from the criminal underworld only to be dragged down by Hikaro when he tries to kill them both. Then she reveals her past, her family's lands was taken away by Eda and her sister was killed by Hikaro and she was forced to become the bride and assassin of Hikaro. They both work together to take down Eda and eventually have feelings for one another but the heist on Eda's personal assets goes awry when Mikoto goes off to try and kill Eda only to die in the process, in a fit of rage the Boss personally attacks Eda and gets his revenge for Mikoto as he bitterly says that she was the first and last woman he had ever truly loved.\n\nOmerta, the game's title, refers to the infamous honor code called \"Omertà\", a \"Code of silence\" which binds members of the Mafia or similar criminal organizations to professional discretion against any third parties.\n\nUpon the official retail-release of the boxed- and digital distributed version, the game was also simultaneously released on GOG.com without any copy-protection, nor other digital rights management restrictions.\n\nBeginning with small deals, the player gradually expands his criminal career, eventually advancing highly enough to establish his own business. The player can purchase untenanted shops, buildings and structures to establish his own bar, brewery or distillery. The player can also buy out an opposing \"speakeasy\". A more legal way for generating income is buying apartments to obtain leasing. Warehouses can be acquired to extend storage.\n\nAs the game progresses, the character can recruit companions, create his own gang, and conquer the territories of rival gangsters. Characters provide specific role-playing elements based on their individual characteristics and equipment. In these turn-based confrontations, the player expands his influence by using henchmen to drive other godfathers out of business, to ultimately reign supreme as the unchallenged patron of Atlantic City.\n\nIn addition to co-operative and competitive multiplayer game-play, the game offers a sandbox mode to freely explore the game world – six district maps covering \"Atlantic City\".\n\nThe game provides an explorable three-dimensional world which is displayed through a Top-down perspective. The in-game world represents, according to the publisher Kalypso Media, an almost accurate and historical correct reproduction of the American city \"Atlantic City\" of this period.\n\nReal vintage buildings and places are present like the Traymore Hotel, the Absecon Lighthouse, the \"Atlantic City Jail-house\" or the board-walk \"Eastern Promenade\" as well as streets like \"Illinois Avenue\" or the \"North Carolina Avenue\" which ends at the beach. Beside those real buildings the remaining ones - which are shown in Art Deco - are very similar to each other and seems to consist only of a few types.\n\nKalypso Media licensed the name 'Omerta' from the MMORPG browser based game of the same name, Omerta.\n\nMetacritic aggregated a score of 54 from 100 points for the Windows version.\n\n\"PCGamer\" gave the PC-version a rating of 78 out of 100 points, praising the game's mechanics as well as the AI while comparing its combat style elements to X-COM or Jagged Alliance. The story is described as too superficial and simple, just depth-less. The atmospheric music, on the other hand, was lauded as a brilliant melange of the Jazz, Ragtime and Klezmer music of the period.\n\nRating the game at just 30 percent, \"Metro GameCentral\" tested the PC-version as well. Initially intrigued by the promise of a new kind of \"made-men\" game, the turn-based combat system was ultimately deemed ungainly.\n\n\"Hooked Gamer\" gave the PC-version a rating of 8.4 out of 10. It describes the game as \"different\", and the turn-based combats as short but satisfying.\n\n"}

{"id": "3012034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3012034", "title": "Railroad Tycoon II", "text": "Railroad Tycoon II\n\nRailroad Tycoon II is a train and business simulation video game for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, PlayStation and Dreamcast in the \"Railroad Tycoon\" series. The Dreamcast version is a Gold Edition with improved graphics and gameplay. \"Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition\" was ported to Linux by Loki Software.\n\nGameplay is displayed in dimetric view, unlike the top-down view of \"Railroad Tycoon\".\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" is a railroad simulation that covers the entire history of railroads from inception to the present day and beyond. The player chooses a map and assumes the role of chairman of a railroad company. The player tries to make profits for investors and completes various other objectives while being hindered by rivals, random events such as train breakdowns, train robbers, economic swings, and scripted events particular to the scenario.\n\nMost of the gameplay consists of building tracks, stations and trains, which are used for hauling passengers and freight from one station to another. Delivery revenue can vary by time, distance, demand, cargo type, economic state, station improvements and difficulty level. Companies can connect to and use each other's track and stations, so revenue can be split. Expenses include the fuel, track and engine maintenance and management fee. The fuel cost depends on the cargo weight and the distance each engine runs. Engine maintenance depends on engine age and the engine's type (some locomotives cost more to maintain than others). The elder engines cost more to keep them on the line. The track maintenance is solely calculated from track mileage.\n\nThe player will determine what kind of cargo(es) to put on/off at each station that the player adds to its routing. Way-points may also be inserted to override default track selection where multiple paths are possible.\n\nThere are many industries in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a steel mill can convert 1 load of iron plus 1 load of coal into 2 loads of steel. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to each step of the industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, \"create\" manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products back the other way.\n\nOne of the key elements of game play relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, and the ability to traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as bakeries, textile mills, and tool and die factories, earns less profit than advanced factories such as canneries, steel mills and automobile plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and overhead.\n\nThe following locomotives are available for game play. Locomotives are only seen in specific time periods and scenarios. In addition to the attributes described above, locomotives are subject to \"mechanical reliability\", which is a randomly generated factor influencing how often a locomotive will break down. All locomotives begin their operational lives with a set chance of mechanical failure, with some types more prone to breakdowns than others. Breakdown percentage chance increases the older a locomotive becomes. A train may also suffer a wreck, which completely destroys the locomotive and all hauled cargo.\n\nThe game also features one futuristic train, the \"Mag-Lev TBX-1\" which is portrayed as released in the (then) future date of 2008. The train operates using Maglev technology which, as of 2015, has been prototyped in both Europe and Japan. The first successful Maglev train to be operated was the SCMaglev with speeds approaching 400 miles per hour.\n\nGameplay also includes financial manipulation of companies, issuing bonds, share repurchases, stock issues, manipulating dividends, merging with other companies and declaring bankruptcy. These features are required in some scenarios and may be used for either great financial gain or total fiscal disaster.\n\nIn normal financial mode, the player may buy or sell any companies' stocks at various prices depending upon the economy. On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player to buy on margin or short sell stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt.\n\nThe economy may fluctuate during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, Recession and Depression. When the economy is good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond interest rates will also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds.\n\nThe original game features eighteen missions, divided between North America, Europe and the rest of the world. The missions can be played on three difficulty levels, and each also includes three listed objectives. Completing only the first objective awards the player a bronze medal, the first two a silver medal, and all three a gold medal. The player may play any mission in each set as many times as they wish; they may also continue even though a mission has been failed. The final score for the whole 18 mission campaign is calculated by the difficulty level and the number of each type of medal achieved.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, \"Railroad Tycoon II\" features many single scenarios. As with the campaign, each scenario is based on a geographical location, which may be fictional. Most scenarios also have a medal system similar to that of the campaign, although any scenario may be played in sandbox mode as well. Many scenarios constrain the player to some specific point on the timeline and feature scripted events: for example, the Korean map presents an alternative history as the player is informed about the averted Korean civil war.\n\nAdditional single scenarios may be created using the map editor included. Maps may be imported, drawn from scratch, or edited from existing maps and saved under new names. Many fan creations have been shared on various fan sites.\n\nIn late 1997, Bruce Shelley said of his chance of developing \"Railroad Tycoon II\", \"I would be happy to work on such a game but there are real doubts about its ability to generate sufficient sales in this blockbuster market where a few of the games make most of the money.\"\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Railroad Tycoon II\" consist mostly of classical \"railroad\" blues and bluegrass genre from the era the game revolves around. These pieces were not, unlike most contemporary games, midi files, but rather high quality studio recordings; some even with vocals. This fact has contributed to the solid ratings this game has received.\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon 2: Gold\" is a collection of \"Railroad Tycoon 2\" and \"Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century\", in one package. \"Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum\" is equivalent to the \"Gold Edition\" plus over 50 community-made maps added and enhanced mouse-wheel support. Maps (scenarios) developed specifically for the platinum edition may not function in some earlier versions. The last official patch to \"Railroad Tycoon 2\" was platinum v1.56 on February 19, 2003.\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" was a commercial success. Its sales surpassed 500,000 copies globally by February 1999, and its computer version alone sold more than 1.5 million copies by August 2001. In the United States, the game and its \"Gold\" edition together sold 351,000 copies by October 2001. According to Franz J. Felsl of PopTop, much of \"Railroad Tycoon II\"s success came from European markets; he explained that it \"did better in Europe than it did in the US, which is not the way things usually end up.\"\n\nBy August 2000, \"Railroad Tycoon II\" had been released in 39 unique SKUs worldwide, including eight Windows versions in English alone. PopTop's Phil Steinmeyer wrote that roughly 33% of the game's sales derived from the \"Gold\" edition and \"Second Century\" expansion, and that the port for Macintosh \"sold respectably\", while the PlayStation version was unsuccessful. He accredited the game's number of versions with its commercial success, and wrote in August 2000, \"Overall, had we only released the original game, in English, for Windows only, our sales would be less than a quarter of what they are now.\" In 2003, Steinmeyer remarked that \"Railroad Tycoon II\" continued to sell \"pretty well\".\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" won \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\"s and CNET Gamecenter's 1998 \"Strategy Game of the Year\" awards; the former magazine's editors wrote that it \"capture[d] almost all of the things gamers had come to love about the original.\" It also received IGN's \"Best Soundtrack\" award.\n\nThe game was a finalist for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1998 \"Best Strategy\", GameSpot's \"Strategy Game of the Year\", IGN's \"Best Strategy Game of the Year\" and \"PC Gamer US\"s \"The Best Real-Time Strategy Game\" awards, all of which ultimately went to \"StarCraft\". \"Computer Gaming World\"s editors lauded \"Railroad Tycoon II\" as \"a brilliant update of a gaming classic\", and the staff of \"PC Gamer US\" wrote that the game \"did a terrific job of immersing the player in a richly detailed world of empire-building, commerce and micro-management.\"\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" became the first game published by Gathering of Developers to sell 1 million copies, and Geoff Keighley of \"Computer Gaming World\" declared it one of the publisher's few \"certified hits.\" In the United States, the publisher's combined lifetime sales reached 1.3 million copies by October 2001, including the sales of \"Railroad Tycoon II\". Gathering of Developers president Mike Wilson believed that the game put his company on the map, at a time when others in the computer game industry doubted that an independent publisher could succeed.\n\nIt was featured in G4 Icons' episode 12 Sid Meier as part of Sid's history with games and computers.\n"}

Like its sister-program the SIT Graduate Institute, the program is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges through its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.\n\nSIT Study Abroad offers semester and summer-long thematic programs in over 40 countries around the world. More than 25,000 students have studied abroad with SIT. All programs are run by Academic Directors who are residents of the host country and experts in the specific academic subject area of the program. Programs incorporate classroom-based and field-based learning as well as an independent study project component. Students live in homestays, are involved in host community cultural activities and participate in excursions. All programs study a particular global issue such as health, ecology, conflict transformation, or development.\n\nSIT Study Abroad’s academic programs use a field-based, experimental approach. Students complete undergraduate research through an Independent Study Project, the content of which is supervised by their advisors. The students have access to SIT’s local resources and networks during their stay, including a small group of their peers that participate in each program. The foundation of SIT’s educational philosophy holds a strong commitment to reciprocity that is fostered through the students experience abroad.\n\nStudents may elect to participate in an International Honors Program (IHP). This type of program involves studying in multiple destinations while exploring social justice and sustainability which can offer a more cross-cultural educational experience. IHP and SIT Study Abroad have long shared a profound and defining commitment to intercultural communication, social justice, and experiential learning. IHP’s partnership with SIT Study Abroad and World Learning dates back to 2007, when SIT became IHP’s official school of record. The integration between the two partners deepened in the 2011-2012 academic year, when IHP was first included in SIT Study Abroad’s portfolio of programs. Building on a distinguished 50-plus-year history, IHP comparative programs continue to challenge students to ask new and better questions about their lifelong roles in a global community. Comparative programs offer students the opportunity to investigate significant global issues in at least three countries. Some topics include: Cities in the 21st Century, Climate Change, The Politics of Food, Health and Community, and Human Rights.\n\nSIT has many programs in countries all over the world with a particular focus in developing nations. Each program is designed around a different theme that is relative to the country the student will study in.

This model, as popularized by David Kolb, guides students through an intentional approach to structured and unstructured experiences and a facilitated and mentored process of translating experience into learning in order to prepare them for more independent inquiry. Most SIT programs have 20–25 students led by one academic director plus a number of local staff. Semester programs last 15–16 weeks and summer programs are 4–9 weeks. All programs begin with a thorough orientation that incorporates health and safety information and tools for cross-cultural adaptation. Every program is framed around a critical global issue, which provides a lens through which students explore the issue through theory and its local manifestation. Student learning happens through multiple formats — lectures, field visits, language study, homestays, and day-to-day interactions with local communities — in classroom and field-based settings.\n\nSIT students learn to put into practice appropriate field research methods such as participant observation, cultural analysis, interviews, transects, oral histories, and quantitative data collection. They apply tools of investigation and analysis and develop greater curiosity, confidence, and self-awareness.Every program concludes with a guided reflection and discussion period that examines the impact of the experience. Through this reentry preparation, students are encouraged to consider how they can incorporate their experience in the future. During this time, students also have the opportunity to provide feedback on their program.\n\nEven prior to the explosion of the popularity of study abroad SIT was generating effective leaders, professionals, and citizens. SIT has a worldwide network of individuals and organizations committed to responsible global citizenship. Those who have completed SIT programs have an understanding of global issues, such as globalization and development.

It would open up some training programs to teachers pursuing their Master's degrees, not just teachers who had already earned one.\n\nIt was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.\n\n\"STEM\" is an acronym referring to the academic disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The term is typically used in the USA when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools from k-12 through college to improve competitiveness in technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy. In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum. Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the public education agenda of the United States.\n\nThere are three major components of the bill.\n\nFirst, the bill would expand the definition of \"STEM education\" to include education in the field of computer science. This definition is used by NASA, the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Energy in their programs. This would \"ensure federal grants and programs related to STEM education include computer science education.\"\n\nSecond, the bill would confirm the importance of STEM education outside of school.\n\nA final provision of the bill would make \"classroom teachers with bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields who are pursuing master’s degrees eligible for NSF-administered Master Teaching Fellowships in exchange for a four-year commitment to teach in high-need school districts.\"\n\nThe STEM Education Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 8, 2014 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R, TX-21). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. On July 14, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote.\n\nThe IEEE-USA supported the bill, with President Gary Blank saying that \"IEEE-USA strongly supports federal, state and local efforts to improve K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education, particularly programs that increase student interest and engagement in engineering and computer science.\"\n\nRep. Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), who co-sponsored the bill, said that \"STEM education is critical to preparing our students for high-demand careers in engineering, manufacturing, and information technology.\" According to Esty, she frequently hears from \"manufactures and small business owners that it's increasingly difficult to find workers with the right skill sets to fill the jobs in demand.\"\n\nRep. Smith, who introduced the bill, said that \"we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation's youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A health and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America.\"\n\n\n"}

The standards set the criteria for the successful demonstration of the understanding of a concept or skill.\n\nIn the standards-based paradigm, students have the freedom to demonstrate understanding in diverse ways, including (but not limited to) selected response (e.g. multiple choice tests), physical constructions, written responses, and performances. Of course, these are not new types of assessments, nor is the concept of differentiated assessment. The teacher uses all available observations and quantitative information to summarize learning with reference to a specific standard. With these data, a teacher can formulate the steps or actions that can be taken to gain mastery of a particular concept. That is, it aids in assessment for learning.\n\nOne of the key aspects of standards-based assessment is post-assessment feedback. The feedback a student receives from this type of assessment does not emphasizes a score, percentage, or statistical average, but information about the expectations of performance as compared to the standard. A standards-based approach does not necessarily dismiss a summative grade, percentage, or a measure of central tendency (such as a mean, or median). However, an assessment that does not reference or give feedback with respect to a standard would not be standards-based. There is a large body of evidence that points to the effectiveness of appropriate feedback.\n\nThe purpose of standards-based assessment is to connect evidence of learning to learning outcomes (the standards). When standards are explicit and clear, the learner becomes aware of his/her achievement with reference to the standards, and the teacher may use assessment data to give meaningful feedback to students about this progress. The awareness of one's own learning allows students to point to a specific standard of achievement and so strengthens self-regulation and meta-cognition, two skills generally understood to be effective learning strategies.\n\nA common approach to standards-based assessment (SBA) is:\n\n\n\n\nA standards-based test is an assessment based on the outcome-based education or performance-based education philosophy. Assessment is a key part of the standards reform movement. The first part is to set new, higher standards to be expected of every student. Then the curriculum must be aligned to the new standards. Finally, the student must be assessed if they meet these standards of what every student \"must know and be able to do\". In the United States, a high school diploma which is given on passing a high school graduation examination or Certificate of Initial Mastery is awarded only when these standards are achieved. It is fully expected that every child will become proficient in all areas of academic skills by the end of a period, typically 10 years in the United States, but sometimes longer, after the passing of education reform bill by a state legislature. The United States federal government, under No Child Left Behind can further require that all schools must demonstrate improvement among all students, even if they are already all over proficient.\n\nRather than using computers to log responses to multiple choice tests, rubrics for state assessments such as in North Carolina ask scorers to look at the entire paper and make judgments. Scorers are not allowed to count errors, and rubrics do not contain numeric measurements of how many spelling or grammar error constitute a \"1\" or \"2\". The Analytical Writing section of the GRE test is scored using a six-point holistic scale in half-point increments. Holistic grading is one of the main reason for disagreement between scorers, but for this reason some tests are scored more than once to check for agreement.\n\n\nCompared to a multiple-choice, norm-referenced test, a standards-based test can be recognized by:\n\n\n\n"}

He studied first at Dartmouth College, where he was valedictorian of his 1903 or 1905 graduating class, and then at Harvard Divinity School, earning an A.M. in philosophy and comparative religion 1910. His thesis work, \"Communistic Experimental Settlements in the USA\" observed that every such settlement had failed within a generation because of an inability of communism to get people to subordinate their own desires for the good of the group. In 1919 he married Ida Nayan Whitlam. Cobb was a member of several literary associations and of the Cosmos Club of Washington, D.C..\n\nCobb lived internationally for some years before settling in Chevy Chase, Maryland, where he died.\n\nIn 1907–1910, Cobb taught history and Latin at Robert College in Constantinople (now Istanbul), followed by several years teaching in the US and Europe. He later headed the English department at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland (1914–15), taught at Asheville School in Asheville, North Carolina (1915–16), and was instructor of history and English at the United States Naval Academy (1916–19). Frustrated by the teaching experience at the Academy, Cobb heard a lecture by Marietta Johnson who helped marshal and crystallize his thoughts on education practice and curriculum theory. As a result, in 1919, Cobb founded the Chevy Chase Country Day School, of which he was the principal until his retirement, and, active in the progressive education movement in the United States, became a founder and motivating force, first secretary, and eventually president (1927–1930) of The Association for the Advancement of Progressive Education, later renamed in 1931 as Progressive Education Association (PEA) and then American Education Fellowship. The first president was Arthur E. Morgan. Later the influential John Dewey served as president. Cobb resigned the Presidency in 1930 following the influx of supporters of George Counts who moved the focus of the Association from a student-centred learning approach to one of a social policy oriented approach to education theory. However, between the enormous impact of World War II on all thought and the involvement of many members of the PEA in communism and the general atmosphere of Anti-communism in the United States the achievements of the PEA both before Cobb's resignation and after were largely lost and ended the efforts of the Association shortly after the Carnegie Foundation and Rockefeller Foundations withdrew their support.\n\nAfter looking at Theosophy and Reform Judaism and other themes in religion Cobb investigated the Bahá'í Faith after a series of articles in the Boston Transcript on the religion attracted his attention. He pursued the interest to Green Acre conference center in Eliot, Maine in 1906 during his studies at Harvard Divinity School seeking to be a Unitarian minister. Sarah Farmer much affected Cobb and Thornton Chase was giving a series of talks. It was on that occasion that he became a Bahá'í.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1913 he met with `Abdu'l-Bahá five times (twice in Akka and several times during the latter's travel to Europe and the US). In 1911 Cobb and a number of others gave talks in honor of the personal invitation by `Abdu'l-Bahá to pilgrimage of Louis Gregory.\n\nCobb was a founding member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Washington D. C. in 1933, and served on various committees (for example Cobb was Chairman of the Teaching Committee in 1935) and edited two Baha'i journals: Star of the West in 1924, and World Order from 1935-39.\n\nCobb was a prolific writer.

It complements Voice over IP (VoIP) and Video over IP.\n\nReal-time text is streaming text that is transmitted as it is produced, allowing text to be used conversationally. Real-time text is defined in ITU-T Multimedia Recommendation F.700 2.1.2.1 . Real-time text is designed for conversational use where people interactively converse with each other. To achieve this, particular user requirements have been specified for the delay of each character and the character loss rate (see F.700 Annex A.3).\n\nReal-time Text over IP can be used:\n\nToIP is designed around the ITU-T T.140 real-time text presentation layer protocol (defined for H.32x multimedia services). T.140 allows real-time editing of text e.g. by using 'backspace' and retyping. T.140 is based on the ISO 10646-1 character set that is used by most IP text specifications and uses the UTF-8 format. \n\nTransport of ToIP uses the same Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) as VoIP and Video-over-IP. The text is encoded according to IETF RFC 4103 \"RTP Payload for Text Conversation\". \n\nRFC 4103 supports an optional forward error correction scheme based on redundant transmission (using RFC 2198). This results in a very low end-to-end packet loss across IP transmission links that have moderately high packet loss. To improve efficiency, text can be buffered for 0.3 – 0.5 seconds before it is sent whilst still meeting the delay requirements. \n\nRTP is usually transported over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). However, because 2.5G mobile networks supported the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) but did not consistently support UDP, some implementations of ToIP over mobile networks use TCP internally. 3G mobile networks can support UDP. \n\nThe protocol stack for a ToIP medium is: \n\nVery fast typing (30 characters per second) results in a two kilobit per second traffic load (including overheads for RFC4103 with the maximum level of redundancy, RTP, UDP and IP).\n\nControl of ToIP sessions has been defined using the standard Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC 3261) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 4566) protocols. \n\nSee IETF RFC 5194 \"Framework for real-time text over IP using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\" and IETF RFC 4504 \"SIP Telephony Device Requirements and Configuration\" Section 2.9 for more information.\n\nNext Generation Networking (NGNs) is a concept developed by telecommunication service providers and their suppliers. It aims to create a true multi-service network based in IP technology. \n\nToIP has been specified for inclusion in the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) (in 3GPP TS 26.114 v2.0.0 \"IMS, Multimedia Telephony, Media handling and interaction\"). IMS is being used to implement NGNs in many fixed and mobile networks. \n\nSupport of ToIP is being considered in multimedia Emergency Public-safety answering point (PSAPs) in Europe and USA. The ECRIT IETF working group defines ToIP as one form of access to Emergency Services. \n\nToIP can provide a 'low impact' solution to meeting national regulatory requirements to provide 'equivalent service' to the telephone service for people who have hearing or speech impairments. \n\nA typical terminal on a fixed line access is a home computer that supports multimedia communications - Voice and Video and real-time Text over IP. See External links for information about ToIP equipment and software.\n\nTelecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) or TTYs (also called Textphone or minicoms) were designed to transport real-time text over the PSTN. TDDs use a range of modem technologies.\nText-over-IP has been designed as a replacement for TDDs when using the IP-based networks but also to be of use to mainstream voice call users. It has less service restrictions compared with TDDs, is designed to be used as a mainstream service and can be used on standard computers or mobile terminals. Proper alerting systems for incoming calls need to be included as well as user interfaces, both hardware and software, that meet the needs of Deaf people, and people with hearing or speech impairments. This can best be achieved with input from end-users in the development stages.\n\nInterworking between TDDs and ToIP has been implemented using gateways by T-Meeting, Omnitor, Trace R& D, RNID, Center, Voiceriver, and AnnieS. RFC 5194 \"Framework for real-time text over IP using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\" provides an overview of interworking issues. Work is being proposed in the IETF SIPPING work group on more detailed interworking based on a range of call scenarios.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26056724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26056724", "title": "The Ordeal of Richard Feverel", "text": "The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\n\nThe Ordeal of Richard Feverel: A History of Father and Son (1859) is the earliest full-length novel by George Meredith; its subject is the inability of systems of education to control human passions. It is one of a select group of standard texts that have been included in all four of Everyman's Library (1935), the New American Library of World Literature (1961), Oxford World's Classics (1984), and Penguin Classics (1998). With its rigorous psychological analysis and criticism of contemporary attitudes to sexuality, it has been seen by some critics as the first modern novel in English literature.\n\nSir Austin Feverel's wife deserts him to run away with a poet, leaving her husband to bring up their boy Richard. Believing schools to be corrupt, Sir Austin, a scientific humanist, educates the boy at home with a plan of his own devising known as \"the System\". This involves strict authoritarian supervision of every aspect of the boy's life, and in particular the prevention of any meeting between Richard and girls of his own age. Richard nevertheless meets and falls in love with Lucy Desborough, the niece of a neighboring farmer. Sir Austin finds out and, disapproving of her humble birth, forbids them to meet again, but they secretly marry. Sir Austin now tries to retrieve the situation by sending Richard to London. Here, however, Sir Austin's friend Lord Mountfalcon successfully sets a courtesan to seduce Richard, hoping that this will leave Lucy open to seduction by himself. Ashamed of his own conduct, Richard flees abroad where he at length hears that Lucy has given birth to a baby and has been reconciled to Sir Austin. He returns to England and, hearing about Lord Mountfalcon's villainy, challenges him to a duel. But this goes badly: Richard is seriously wounded. Lucy is so overcome by this turn of events that she loses her mind and dies.\n\nIn 1856 George Meredith's wife Mary began an affair with the artist Henry Wallis. In the following year, pregnant by Wallis, she ran away to join him, leaving her son Arthur behind. Meredith undertook to bring the child up. The parallels with the opening chapters of the novel are obvious, though Sir Austin is certainly not intended as a self-portrait. Meredith was equivocal in his attitude to Sir Austin's favourite educational theories, which, it has been shown, derived largely from the medical writer William Acton's \"Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social & Sanitary Aspects\" (1857) and \"The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs\" (1857), from Herbert Spencer's essay \"Moral Education\" (\"Quarterly Review\", April 1858), and from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel \"\".\n\n\"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\" was first published in 1859 by Chapman & Hall in three volumes. The book received generally respectful reviews, though critics were often puzzled by Meredith's rather dense style, and did not all agree in their reading of the book's message, or their estimation of the author's success in presenting it. The book's commercial success, as with all Victorian novels, depended in large measure on the number of copies bought by the various commercial lending libraries, but the largest of them all, Mudie's, took fright at the sexual frankness of the novel and refused to stock it, casting a taint of unrespectability over Meredith's name that lasted for many years. \"I am tabooed from all decent drawing-room tables\", Meredith wrote, but he refused to tone down the offending passages. Chapman & Hall left the book unreprinted for nearly twenty years, and when in 1878 Meredith produced a revised (but not bowdlerized) version it was published by another firm, Kegan Paul. From the mid-1880s onward Meredith's reputation as a serious novelist reached such a level as to ensure a stream of reprints. For the past hundred years \"Richard Feverel\", with all its faults, has been considered one of Meredith's finest works, its status as a forerunner of many later developments in the novel being widely recognized. Arnold Bennett wrote, \"In \"Richard Feverel\", what a loosening of the bonds! What a renaissance!…It was the announcer of a sort of dawn\", while acknowledging that \"It is a weak book, full of episodic power and overloaded with wit.\" J. B. Priestley wrote that \"So far as English fiction is concerned...there can be no doubt that the modern novel began with the publication of \"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\".\" Virginia Woolf's assessment was that:\nHe makes no attempt to preserve the sober reality of Trollope and Jane Austen; he has destroyed all the usual staircases by which we have learnt to climb. And what is done so deliberately is done with a purpose. This defiance of the ordinary, these airs and graces, the formality of the dialogue with its Sirs and Madams are all there to create an atmosphere that is unlike that of daily life, to prepare the way for a new and an original sense of the human scene.\nAnd again:\nThe book is cracked through and through with those fissures which come when the author seems to be of twenty minds at the same time. Yet it succeeds in holding miraculously together, not certainly by the depths and originality of its character drawing but by the vigour of its intellectual power and by its lyrical intensity.\n\n\"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel\" is referenced in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel \"Howards End\". The aspirational character Leonard Bast mentions that it inspired him to leave London and take an all night walk into the countryside, because he \"wanted to get back to the earth...like Richard does in the end.\" It was referenced again in the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of \"Howards End\", in which Leonard discreetly reads a passage from \"Richard Feverel\" at his work and dreams of walking in a bluebell wood. Helen later reads the passage out loud when Leonard mentions it as his inspiration for his all-night walk.\n\n\n"}

Likewise, Maharishi colleges and universities have been established including Maharishi European Research University (Netherlands), Maharishi Institute of Management (India), Maharishi University of Management and Technology (India), Maharishi Institute (South Africa) and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic University (India). In the USA, critics have called Transcendental Meditation a revised form of Eastern, religious philosophy and opposed its use in public schools while a member of the Pacific Justice Institute says practicing Transcendental Meditation in public schools with private funding is constitutional.\n\nThe Students' International Meditation Society (SIMS) incorporated in 1965/1966 and focused on offering the TM technique to students and faculty at schools and universities. The UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) chapter had 1,000 members and was co-founded by researcher and physiologist, Robert Keith Wallace, the first president of Maharishi International University. By 1974, 14 states had encouraged local schools to teach TM in the classroom, and it was taught at 50 universities. Among the public school systems where TM was taught were Shawnee Mission, Kansas, Maplewood, Paterson, Union Hill and West New York, New Jersey, Eastchester, New York and North York, Ontario. The organization was described as a \"phenomenal success\" and continues to function in some countries including the U.S.A. A 33-lesson video course called the Science of Creative Intelligence was offered at universities such as Stanford, Yale, the University of Colorado, the University of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University.\n\nIn 1979, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the 1977 decision of the US District Court of New Jersey that a course in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) was religious activity within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and that the government funded teaching of SCI/TM in the New Jersey public high schools was prohibited. The court ruled that, although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions. The court found that the religious nature of the course was clear from careful examination of the textbook, the expert testimony elicited, and the uncontested facts concerning the puja ceremony, which it found involved \"offerings to deities as part of a regularly scheduled course in the schools' educational programs\". State action was involved because the SCI/TM course and activities involved the teaching of a religion, without an objective secular purpose. According to religious scholar Cynthia Ann Humes the \"Malnak\" decision \"dismantled\" the TM program's use of government funding to incorporate Transcendental Meditation into public schools. However, according to religious scholars Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley this \"judicial rebuff\" of the New Jersey school project did not render \"a negative evaluation of the program itself\" and those who oppose the practice in public schools are said to be mainly conservative Christians and civil libertarians who seek to preserve church-state separation.\n\nSince 1979, schools and universities in the U.S. and abroad have introduced the Transcendental Meditation technique using private, non-governmental funding. The technique has been introduced on a voluntary basis, with parental consent, and teachers and parents are taught the meditation before the students learn. Often referred to as the Quiet Time Program, the students and teachers meditate for 10 to 20 minutes twice per day. The program consists of TM instruction and follow-up, as well as training of school faculty and staff to supervise the TM sessions offered at the school.\n\nThe Fletcher Johnson Educational Center, a charter school with 1,500 students in Washington, D.C., introduced the TM program for schools in 1994. Its principal, George H. Rutherford, is a member of the DLF's Board of Advisors. The Ideal Academy Public Charter School began its program with the approval of the Washington, D.C. Board of Education in 1997. The 2005–2006 pilot project at Ideal Academy was conducted along with research to document the effects of the program. The Nataki Talibah Schoolhouse] in Detroit began using the program for students in the fifth through eighth grade in 1996 and was featured on the Today Show in 2003. The school has since been classified by the Skillman Foundation as a \"High-Performing Middle School\". Over the years, the program at Nitaki Talibah has been funded by various foundations including General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, the Liebler Foundation and the DLF. The program at the school has been researched by Rita Benn of the University of Michigan's Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Center.\n\nThe Chelsea School, a private school in of Silver Spring, Maryland, offers the program to its fifth through twelfth graders who have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). The program was part of a three-month pilot study conducted by William R. Stixrud, a clinical neuropsychologist and health advisor for the TM's Committee for Stress-Free Schools. The New York Times reported in 2005 that American University, in Washington D.C., was set to begin offering Transcendental Meditation classes as part of a research project to measure its potential effect on \"grades, IQ's and mental health\". Later, the practice of the technique by 250 students at American University, Georgetown University and Howard University in the Washington D.C. area was monitored as part of a research study conducted by American University and Maharishi University of Management.\n\nIn 2004, the New York Committee for Stress-Free Schools held a press conference in New York City. The conference included testimony from students, educators and scientists who support the use of TM in the school setting. The following year the TM technique was taught to \"more than 100 administrators, teachers and students\" and over the next five years, 300 additional high school students learned the technique. According to the DLF web site, the TM program was introduced to the Arts and Technology Academy at Weaver High School in Hartford CT in 2006. Four hundred and fifty students as well as principals and administrators are reported to have been instructed in the technique. A voluntary program at the Kingsbury School, a Washington D.C. private school \"for students with learning disorders\" in grades K-12, was featured on the PBS program, \"To The Contrary\" in 2007. According to the school director, about 10 percent of the teachers, parents and students declined to participate because they found it be religious and cult-ish. Conferences sponsored by the New England Committee for Stress-Free Schools were held in Providence, Rhode Island; Fairfield, Connecticut; and Boston, Massachusetts in 2005. The Boston conference was attended by 100 teachers and featured testimony from school principals who have experience with the TM program in schools. In the mid-2000s the TM technique was incorporated into the educational program at the Daburiya High School in Israel.\n\nThe David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace (DLF) was founded in 2004 and has provided funding for Transcendental Meditation instruction in many educational settings. According to the DLF, it has funded school programs in New York City, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Vietnam, Nepal, Northern Ireland, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa and Israel.\n\nIn 2006, six public schools were each awarded $25,000 to begin a TM program and a total of twenty five public, private, and charter schools in the United States had offered Transcendental Meditation to their students. In 2006, the Terra Linda High School in San Rafael, California canceled plans for Transcendental Meditation classes due to concerns of parents that it would be promoting religion. In the San Francisco area there are three schools that offer the technique as part of their school program, funded primarily by the David Lynch Foundation. The Visitacion Valley Middle School began the program in 2007 and the Everett Middle School and John O’Connell High School began the program sometime after that. The Maharishi Institute, an African university, was founded in 2007 and uses the Transcendental Meditation technique in its programs.\n\nAs of 2008, the David Lynch Foundation had funded TM instruction for \"more than 2,000 students, teachers and parents\" at \"21 U.S. schools and universities\", in addition to substantially higher numbers of instruction at schools outside the U.S. Programs have been conducted in Washington D.C., Hartford CT, San Francisco CA, Detroit MI, Steamboat Springs CO, Tucson AZ, Los Angeles CA and Chicago IL. One of those programs was the Lowell Whiteman Primary School in Steamboat Springs, Colorado which implemented a two-year trial program using Transcendental Meditation in their classrooms. The program was used with fifth through eighth graders. After instruction, the TM teachers visit the school once per month to assess the students' progress and their meditation technique. The following year, about 160 students and teachers at Tucson Magnet High School in Tucson AZ, took the training in Transcendental Meditation and meditate daily for 15 minutes before or after school.\n\nIn 2010, the women's squash team at Trinity College in Hartford, CT began practicing the TM technique together after every practice. In 2011 music mogul Russell Simmons announced plans to provide financial support to the David Lynch Foundation to teach TM at Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Connecticut. The TM technique was taught to students at Norwich University, a private military academy, as part of a long-term study on meditation and military performance.\n\nConsciousness-Based Education (CBE) refers to the educational approach that is utilized at schools and universities founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\n\nMaharishi University of Management (MUM), formerly known as Maharishi International University, was founded in 1973. The campus is located in Fairfield, Iowa, United States. The university is not-for-profit, is accredited through the Ph.D. level by The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, and offers a Consciousness-Based Education approach that includes the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. Degree programs are offered in the arts, sciences, business, and the humanities.\n\nMaharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment (MSAE), located on the MUM campus, is an independent, non-denominational, college preparatory school located in Fairfield, Iowa. The school has an open admissions policy and its curriculum includes the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. The Ideal Girls School was a single-gender college preparatory boarding school in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa. According to its website, the school was originally chartered in New York in 1996, then set up its campus in North Carolina in 1998, before finally moving to Iowa in 2001 where it received state accreditation in 2003.\n\nMaharishi International University College of Natural Law was located in Washington D.C. five blocks from the White House. From 1981 to 1987 this was also the location of the TM movement's \"administrative headquarters\" for North America as well as a national organization of 6,000 American medical doctors who practiced TM, a private school, a clinic, and a TM meditation center. In 1991, the Washington Post reported that the Maharishi, referring to Washington DC, had advised TM practitioners: \"save yourself from the criminal atmosphere\". As a result, 20 to 40 TM practitioners put their homes up for sale in an effort to move away from the city.\n\nIn 2007 the GCWP announced a plan to build a Maharishi Central University campus at \"the geographical center of the Lower 48 states\" in Kansas. The facility was under construction until early 2008, when, according to founding president John Hagelin, the necessary $100 million in construction funds was not readily available during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. As of April 2010 one building was near completion while the other 10 buildings were still under construction. In 2009 an all boys, boarding school, called the Maharishi Academy of Total Knowledge, was founded in Antrim, New Hampshire with \"just a handful of students\".\n\nUniversity of South Carolina sociologist Barry Markovsky described the TM technique in schools as \"stealth religion\", and Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, says Transcendental Meditation is rooted in Hinduism and crosses the same constitutional line as in the \"Malnak\" case and decision of 1979. Since then, however, \"TM has made a comeback of sorts with some governmental sponsorship\" according to authors Forsthoefel and Humes. In May 2008, Lynn said that the Americans United for Separation of Church and State was keeping \"a close legal eye on the TM movement\" and \"there are no imminent cases\" against the movement. At the same time, Brad Dacus of the Pacific Justice Institute says doing Transcendental Meditation during a school's \"quiet time\" (a short period of school time for private prayer or relaxation) \"is constitutional.\"\n\nAccording to a 2008 \"Newsweek\" article, there is a \"growing movement to bring Transcendental Meditation... into more U.S. schools as a stress-buster for America's overwhelmed kids\". At the same time, critics say that Transcendental Meditation is a revised form of Eastern, religious philosophy, and they oppose its use in public schools. Some parents and critics view it as an overstepping of boundaries that could lead to \"lifelong personal and financial servitude to a corporation run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\". At the same time, many parents feel the meditation has created \"profound results\" for their children, and that they \"hardly view TM as exclusively, or even overtly, religious,\" and advocates describe it is a physiological technique that calms the mind, improves grades and attention span, while reducing disruptive behavior. A 2011 research review said their \"findings provide good support for the use of TM to enhance several forms of information processing in students\".\n\nMaharishi European Research University (MERU) was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Seelisberg, Switzerland in 1975. The university's purpose is to conduct research into the effects of Transcendental Meditation and higher states of consciousness. The original campus was located in a Victorian-era hotel above Lake Lucerne. The first chancellor was physicist Larry Domash. David Orme Johnson was the vice-chancellor. Institutions bearing the MERU name have also operated at Mentmore Towers, an estate in Buckinghamshire, England, and at Vlodrop, Netherlands. Notable alumni include Bevan Morris, Ashley Deans, Mike Tompkins, and a few sources say John Gray was a MERU graduate. The Maharishi Foundation purchased the Kolleg St. Ludwig campus in 1984 for USD 900,000 and it became the MERU university campus.\n\nThe Maharishi School in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, England is the only specialist TM school in the country and has 100 pupils aged between four and 16. At Limeside Primary in Oldham, half of the teaching staff now regularly meditate. In September 2011, the Maharishi School became one of 24 independent schools in the country to be awarded full state funding as part of the government Free Schools initiative. In 1982 the Maharishi University of Natural Law for England was established. Another Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment is located in Wheaton, Maryland, USA, and a single gender, secondary school called Maharishi International School is located in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nMaharishi Shiksha Sansthan (MSS) is a registered society that oversees Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools (MVMS) and Maharishi Ideal Girls Schools located across India. MSS also administrates the five campuses of the Maharishi Institute of Management and the Maharishi University of Management and Technology campus.\n\nThe Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools were founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1995. MVMS is affiliated with the New Delhi Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and/or their respective state-school, education boards. Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools include 148 branches in 118 cities with a total of 90,000 to 100,000 students and 5,500 teaching and support staff.\nThe Maharishi Institute of Management has campuses in Bangalore, Bhopal, Hyderabad, Indore, Chennai and Maharishi Nagar (Delhi). The Institute was established in India in 1995 and offers several degrees including MBA, PGDBA, MCA, BCA and BBA. The Institute describes its purpose as the elimination of \"existing problems in the field of management in all areas of human concern by establishing automation in administration – management supported by the total intelligence of Natural Law.” The Bangalore campus is reported to be an \"important centre for computer training and hi-tech learning\" in India.\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic University, also known as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic Vishwavidyalaya (MMYVV), is a public university located in Katni, Madhya Pradesh. Maharishi University of Management and Technology, with campuses in Bilaspur and Chhattisgarh, is a private University recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The Maharishi Center for Educational Excellence (MCEE) was established in 1999 by its chairman, Girish Chandra Verma.\n\nThe Maharishi College of Natural Law was established in Orissa India in 1982 and was supported by donations from Maharishi Institute of Creative Intelligence (MICI). In addition to the standard curriculum, the College offers courses in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative intelligence. The College began as a school for boys with 384 students and 17 teachers. The College is recognised by the Government of Orissa and is affiliated with the Council of Higher Secondary Education since 1983.\n\nThe Cosmic Business School was founded in 2004, \"based on the principles of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\"and according to the school, many of its graduates are placed with a company within the \"Maharishi Group of Industries\".\n\nThe Maharishi Institute, founded in 2007, under South Africa's Community & Individual Development Association, provides tertiary education utilizing Transcendental Meditation and the Consciousness-Based educational approach. It aims at creating economically self-sufficient institutions that provide large scale, affordable education for students from Grades 11 through the master's degree level. It was visited by Russell Simmons a year later and is located in the business district of Johannesburg. Its goal is to provide disadvantaged students with an \"accelerated holistic education\" that includes employment at \"an in-house call centre\" and other university positions during their course of study. The goal of the work/study program is to allow the institution to become self funded. Initial funding and grants for the institute were provided by Educating Africa foundation. It was established by the founders of CIDA City Campus with the goal of further addressing the issue of \"accessible tertiary education\" by utilizing Consciousness-Based education methods. The Maharishi Institute's goal is to set a precedent for the field of higher education that could be replicated in other African cities.\n\nAccording to a press release, in 2010, at a global educational summit in Bahrain, the Institute was granted an award that recognized it as an innovative institution with the potential to significantly improve educational outcomes through adaptable and replicable business models. The web site for Consciousness-Based Education, South Africa lists 12 partner schools in the USA, Netherlands, Australia, India, Ecuador, Thailand, China, and Great Britain and says that \"Consciousness-Based Education has been introduced into more than 230 schools and more than 25 universities or other tertiary institutions worldwide\". A Maharishi Secondary School for Girls is located in Mbale, Uganda.\n\nThere is a Maharishi School near Melbourne, Australia and a Maharishi Research Institute in Japan.\n\n"}
