It operates under the Architects Act 1997 as , a consolidating Act. It began under the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 which gave it the name the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). It prescribes architectural qualifications, maintains the Register of Architects and for registered persons has certain responsibilities for standards of professional conduct and competence. Its main source of income is fees payable under Part II of the Act by persons on their becoming registered or for their retention on the Register. The Board is required to pay into the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom any sum paid under a penalty order which its Professional Conduct Committee has made under Part III of the Act (in conduct cases). Fines imposed by Magistrates' Court (England and Wales) (or similar in Scotland or Northern Ireland) under Part IV of the Act (in misuse of title cases) are not payable to the Board.\n\nIn the Board's Annual Report for the year 2011 Reserves were stated as Surplus for the year £186,621 and Balance (net assets) at 31 December 2011 as £1,757,901.\n\nSurpluses are not distributable to the Board members or to registered persons by way of dividend or otherwise.\n\nA Registrar, who may be an employee of the Board or its contractor, is appointed for the purpose of admitting persons to the Register or placing them on the list of visiting EU architects and, in some instances, causing matters concerning conduct and competence to be investigated.\n\nAs the UK \"competent authority\" for the purpose of Article 46 of the Mutual\nRecognition of Professional Qualifications Directive (2005/36/EC), the ARB has published its procedures for the prescription of qualifications for persons applying for registration under section 4 of the Architects Act 1997.\n\nThe primary meaning of \"discipline\" traditionally refers to education, with the meaning of a branch of knowledge (as: \"in what discipline is his doctorate?\"; \"teachers should be well trained in their subject\"; \"anthropology is the study of ...).\n\nIn the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) education is referred to in Part II which is headed \"Registration etc.\", not in Part III which is headed \"Discipline\". References in Part II are:\n\nIn Part III of the Architects Act 1997 \"Discipline\" is being used in one of the secondary meanings, such as:\n\nThe legislation requires there to be a Professional Conduct Committee of the Board (whose remuneration or expenses are decided and paid by the Board as the corporate body). The function of this Committee is to hear and determine allegations against registered persons which have been formally reported or referred to it in accordance with the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) and the Rules which the Board is authorised to make. In practice the allegations are usually presented to the Committee by a solicitor appointed and paid by the Board; and the Committee usually has a legally qualified chairman chosen from those who (male or female) are required by the legislation to have been appointed to membership of the Committee on the nomination of the President of the Law Society.\n\nThe Act states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code of professional conduct issued by the Board shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. The Act also provides for the publication of a statement exonerating an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained.\n\nOn an appeal to the Divisional Court in 1957 concerning a pure breach of the Code of Professional Conduct under the legislation then in force (the architect was practising an estate agent's business as well as his own), when the registration body was constituted under the name the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom, Mr Justice Devlin ruled: \"It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful\". In the course of giving judgment in this appeal Lord Chief Justice Goddard had mentioned a letter which had been sent in 1937 by \"the president of the council\" [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognising the fact that there was nothing in a Bill, which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938), to interfere with the activities of registered architects.\n\nRecords held by the British Architectural Library show that from the 1890s the motivations for promoting and opposing a registration act had been mixed. But the content of the originating act of 1931 as amended by the act of 1938 shows that the decisive issue at that time was the importance attached to giving to architects the responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities (for housing and other projects), rather than to persons professionally qualified only as municipal or other engineers. A significant indicator for this inference is in section 1 (1) of the 1938 act.\n\nBy the 1970s that issue had had its day, to be replaced by another which has resulted in the current legislation: the Architects Act 1997 as amended. The issue which emerged in the 1970s developed into the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning the designation of \"competent authorities\" in connection with the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the single market policy.\n\nIn connection with the protection of title and the enforcement provisions, the originating and later legislation imposed on the registration body (now the ARB) a requirement to provide copies of the Register annually. Formerly, hard bound copies of all volumes in the annual series, from volume 1 for 1933, were available for inspection by members of the public at the British Architectural Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects, London. Latterly, some hiatus on the part of the Board in producing printed copies of the Register in accordance with the legislation and the Board's previous practice has impeded the continuation of the series for retention (on the part of the British Architectural Library or others) as annual volumes for reference. The current website offers only a downloadable pdf format.\n\nFor other more limited purposes and for commercial and similar purposes names of persons currently registered can be searched online at a website maintained by the registration body. The information held on this version of the Register could help members of the public, who wish to find an architect to meet their needs, to locate a practitioner who has registered status and is conveniently situated.\n\nThe Board's published Income and Expenditure Statement for the year ended 31 December 2011 showed a Total operating income of £2,962,329 as the sum of Registration and retention fees £2,733,178 + Prescribed examinations £171,312 + (reinstatement) Penalties and sundry receipts £22,564 + Sales of the register of architects (\"actually, copies of\") £1,480 + Investment income £33,795. Of those figures, Registration fees were £59,492; Retention fees £2,673,686; Penalties (imposed under the Board's General Rules) on reinstatement to the Register £19,180. The Board's scale of fees with effect from January 2012 included a fee for Prescribed Examination of £1,390 per part (under section 4 of the Act).\n\nBoard members may claim an allowance of £250 per day or part of a day spent on Board business, and additionally for travel and certain other expenses. The total for the year ending 31 December 2011 was £100,805, which included £52,775 for Attending and £27,604 for Reading.\n\n\n"}

In the US, ten percent of adults older than 65 years use canes, and 4.6 percent use walkers.\n\nIn contrast to crutches, canes are generally lighter, but, because they transfer the load through the user's unsupported wrist, are unable to offload equal loads from the legs.\n\nAnother type of crutch is the walker, a frame held in front of the user and which the user leans on during movement. Walkers are more stable due to their increased area of ground contact, but are larger and less wieldy and, like canes, pass the full load through the user's wrists in most cases.\n\nThe basic cane has four parts. These parts vary depending on the design of the cane and the needs of the user.\n\nModern canes may differ from the traditional fixed structure. For instance, a quad cane has a base attached to the shaft that provides increased stability by having four ferrules, and an adjustable cane may have two shaft segments telescoping one inside the other to allow adjustment for multiple sizes.\n\nAll cane users who need a walking cane for medical reasons should consult a medical professional before choosing the style that best suits them. It is particularly important that the cane is the proper height for the individual user.\n\n\n\nCanes are generally held in the hand that is opposite to the side of the injury or weakness. It allows the cane to be used for stability in a way that lets the user focus much of their weight away from their weaker side and onto the cane. This prevents the person's center of balance from swaying from side to side as they walk. It also allows for fluid movement that better matches walking, as the hand on the opposite side of the leg generally sways forward in normal human locomotion . Personal preference, or a need to hold the cane in the dominant hand means some cane users choose to hold the cane on the same side as the affected leg.\n\n\n"}

Primarily active as an opera conductor, he served on the conducting staff of the New York City Opera from 1969-1974 and was the music administrator and conductor of the Houston Grand Opera from 1974-1977. Thereafter he worked as a freelance conductor with opera companies throughout the world. He became particularly associated with George Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" for which he was frequently hired to conduct at opera houses both in the United States and abroad.\n\nBorn in Charlottesville, Virginia, Nance earned a bachelor of music degree from the University of Southern California in 1963 where he was a conducting pupil of Ingolf Dahl. He then joined the music faculty at Louisiana State University where he taught from 1963–1969. He left that position to pursue summer graduate studies in conducting under Walter Ducloux at the University of Texas at Austin where he earned a master's degree in 1972.\n\nWhile a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Nance began his conducting career as the chorus master at the New York City Opera from 1969-1974. In 1970 he began taking on conducting assignments at the NYCO, beginning with \"Rigoletto\". Over the next four years he led performances of \"Carmen\", \"Cavalleria Rusticana\", \"La Traviata\", \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", \"Madama Butterfly\", and \"Pagliacci\". In 1974 he left the NYCO to become the music administrator and conductor of the Houston Grand Opera.

He writes \"Savage Love,\" an internationally syndicated relationship and sex advice column. In 2010, Savage and his husband, Terry Miller, began the It Gets Better Project to help prevent suicide among LGBT youth. He has also worked as a theater director, sometimes credited as Keenan Hollahan.\n\nBorn in Chicago to Roman Catholic parents, Savage attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in acting. He lived in West Berlin briefly from 1988 to 1990, and later moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of \"The Onion\". When Keck moved to Seattle, Washington, Savage moved as well to become an advice columnist for The Stranger, which Keck founded; he had offered Savage the position after Savage wrote a sample column which impressed him. Savage has since become a sex columnist and a vocal proponent of LGBT rights in the United States, voicing his advocacy through \"The Stranger\" and his podcast \"Savage Love\". \n\nOutside of his writings and podcasts, Savage has advocated for progressive politics and advancing the rights of LGBT youth to prevent suicide in the community. He has opposed laws restricting pornography and the sale of sex toys, and founded the It Gets Better Project with his husband Terry Miller, who he married in 2010 and had their marriage recognized in Washington in 2012. Savage has been featured on numerous television programs and news outlets, including \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" and \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" He supported the concept of the Iraq War in 2002 but changed his stance following the invasion.\n\nSavage has attracted controversy over his comments and actions related to LGBT issues. He coined the term \"santorum\" to define a sex act after former Senator Rick Santorum made anti-LGBT comments in 2003, and condemned The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its support of California Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. His activism and public speaking has brought praise from celebrities and politicians, including former President Barack Obama.\n\nDan Savage was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Judith \"Judy\" (née Schneider), who worked at Loyola University, and William Savage, Sr. He has German and Irish ancestry. The third of four children, he has two brothers and one sister. Savage was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Quigley Preparatory Seminary North, which he has described as \"a Catholic high school in Chicago for boys thinking of becoming priests.\" Though Savage has stated that he considers himself \"a wishy-washy agnostic\" and an atheist, he continues to identify as \"culturally Catholic.\"\n\nSavage attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he received a BFA in Acting. He lived abroad in West Berlin from late 1988 to 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Savage was living in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a night manager at Four Star Fiction and Video (now Four Star Video Cooperative), a local video store that specialized in independent film titles. He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of \"The Onion,\" who announced that he was moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled \"The Stranger.\" Savage \"made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'.\" Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job.\n\nSavage stated in a February 2006 interview in \"The Onion\"s \"A.V. Club\" (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were \"clueless\" when responding to letters from gay people. Savage wanted to call the column \"Hey, Faggot!\" in an effort to reclaim a hate word. His editors at the time refused his choice of column name, but for the first several years of the column, he attached \"Hey, Faggot!\" at the beginning of each printed letter as a salutation.\" In his February 25, 1999, column, Savage announced that he was retiring the phrase, claiming that the reclamation had been successful.\n\nHe has written in a number of columns about \"straight rights\" concerns, such as the HPV vaccine and the morning-after pill. In his November 9, 2005, column he wrote that \"[t]he right-wingers and the fundies and the sex-phobes don't just have it in for the queers. They're coming for your asses too.\"\n\nAs a theater director, Savage (under the name Keenan Hollohan, combining his middle name and his paternal grandmother's maiden name) was a founder of Seattle's Greek Active Theater. Much of the group's work were queer interpretations of classic works, such as a tragicomic \"Macbeth\" with both the title character and Lady Macbeth played by performers of the opposite sex. In March 2001, he directed his own \"Egguus\" at Consolidated Works, a parody of Peter Shaffer's 1973 play \"Equus\" which exchanged a fixation on horses for a fixation on chickens.\n\n\"Letters from the Earth\" (2003), also at Consolidated Works, was Savage's most recent production. \"Letters\" was a trimmed version of Mark Twain's \"The Diary of Adam and Eve.\" It received scathing reviews, including one from \"The Stranger\" - \"My Boss's Show Stinks.\"\n\nIn addition to writing a weekly column and four books, Savage has been involved in several other projects.\n\nFrom 1994 until 1997, he had a weekly three-hour call-in show called \"Savage Love Live\" on Seattle's KCMU (now KEXP-FM). From 1998 to 2000, he ran the biweekly advice column \"Dear Dan\" on the news website abcnews.com.\n\nHe is now the editorial director of the weekly Seattle newspaper \"The Stranger\", a promotion from his former position as \"The Stranger\"s editor-in-chief. Savage stars in \"Savage U\" on MTV, contributes frequently to \"This American Life\" and \"Out\" magazine, and acts as a \"Real Time Real Reporter\" on HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\" He has also made multiple appearances on MSNBC's \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" and CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\", to discuss LGBT political issues, such as same-sex marriage and Don't Ask Don't Tell.\n\nIn 2014, he participated in \"Do I Sound Gay?\", a documentary film by David Thorpe about stereotypes of gay men's speech patterns.\n\nIn 2016, he was the first guest of Twice Removed, a family history podcast hosted by AJ Jacobs. In the episode, Savage's lineage was traced to Nan Britton, Paul Popham, and others.\n\nThe \"Savage Lovecast\" is a weekly audio podcast based on the column \"Savage Love,\" available via iTunes and at the \"Stranger\"s website for free download. It features Savage answering anonymous questions left by callers on a voice recorder (answering machine). He often returns calls to questioners who give their phone numbers, and such phone calls are part of the podcast. He also consults with doctors, sex therapists, and other experts for answers to questions he calls \"above my pay grade\". There are frequent guest co-hosts, all of them sex-positive. It is routinely rated as the top podcast in the iTunes \"Health\" category and in the top 20 of all podcasts overall. A.V. Club has ranked it in the top 10 among all podcasts.\n\nBased on an idea by Savage (who also served as executive producer), the ABC-TV series, \"The Real O'Neals\" starring Noah Galvin debuted in 2016. The series chronicles the lives of a close-knit, Irish-American Chicago Catholic family whose matriarch takes their reputation in the community very seriously. In the pilot episode, their perfect image is shattered when each family member has a secret revealed to the community: middle child Kenny is gay, oldest child Jimmy is anorexic, youngest child Shannon is running a money scam and might be an atheist, and parents Eileen and Pat are no longer in love and wish to divorce. The series lasted for two seasons before its cancellation.\n\nSavage and his husband, Terry Miller, have one son named D.J., now in his 20s, whom they adopted as an infant. They were married in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 2005. Following the 2012 legalization of same-sex marriage in Washington state, he and Miller were part of the first group of 11 couples to receive Washington state marriage licenses. Savage and Miller were married on December 9, 2012, at Seattle City Hall, opened on Sunday especially for the purpose of hosting the first same-sex weddings in Washington state, with Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and others in attendance.\n\nOn September 21, 2010, Savage founded the It Gets Better Project following the suicide of 15-year-old Billy Lucas, who was bullied for his perceived sexual orientation. The project encourages adults, both LGBT and otherwise, to submit videos assuring gay teenagers that life can improve after bullying in early life. As of November 2013, the project had more than 50,000 user-created testimonials and had been viewed over 50 million times.\n\nSavage has always been pro-pornography, especially Internet pornography. He often remarks that the Internet was invented \"for\" pornography.\n\nSavage coordinates the annual Hump pornography festival, which is made up of clips of up to five minutes on any pornographic topic, submitted by viewers. Winning submissions are shown in theaters around the United States, providing a unique experience as straight, gay male, bi, lesbian, and fetish porn are all shown together, one after another. Savage publicly destroys the submissions after conclusion of the festival.\n\nSavage tends to liberal political views, with pronounced contrarian and libertarian streaks.\nFor example, he wrote that in 2000, suffering from the flu while on an assignment for salon.com to cover the Iowa caucuses, he was so angered by televised remarks in opposition to same-sex marriage by conservative Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer that he abandoned his original plan \"to follow one of the loopy conservative Christian candidates around—Bauer or Alan Keyes—and write something insightful and humanizing about him, his campaign, and his supporters\". Instead, he volunteered for the Bauer campaign with the intent to infect the candidate with his flu. He wrote that he licked doorknobs and other objects in the campaign office, and handed Bauer a saliva-coated pen, hoping to pass the virus on to Bauer and his supporters. (Later he said much of his article had been fictitious). He also registered and participated in the caucus, which was illegal, as Savage was not an Iowa resident. He was charged and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent voting in a caucus, and was sentenced to a year's probation, 50 hours of community service, and a $750 fine.\n\nSavage frequently mentions political issues in his column, particularly issues that affect family planning, birth control, and sexuality. He often encourages readers to get involved and/or voice a positive or negative opinion about a politician or public official.\n\nAfter Rick Santorum, then a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, made comments in 2003 to a reporter comparing homosexual sex to bestiality and incest, Savage assailed Santorum in his column. Later, he sponsored a contest that led to the term \"santorum\" being used to refer to \"the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex\". (See Campaign for the neologism santorum.) Savage set up a website to publicize this application of the term. In 2010, Savage offered to take down his website if Rick Santorum would agree to donate US$5 million to a gay rights group. The organization, Freedom to Marry, advocates on behalf of same-sex marriage in the United States. Savage told \"Mother Jones\" in 2010, \"If Rick Santorum wants to make a $5 million donation to [the gay marriage group] Freedom to Marry, I will take it down. Interest starts accruing now.\" Evan Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry, responded in a statement to \"Metro Weekly\", \"Support for Freedom to Marry's national campaign would be welcome—and a good way for Rick Santorum to start cleaning up the discriminatory mess he and his companions have made.\" Santorum condemned the campaign and accused Savage of defaming him. Savage responded by further denouncing Santorum and accused him of propagating discrimination against the LGBT community through his viewpoints.\n\nIn 2009 Savage invited his readers to vote to define \"saddlebacking\" as \"the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex to preserve their virginities.\" He was protesting the vocal support given to California Proposition 8 by Rick Warren (pastor of Saddleback Church), and President Barack Obama's invitation to Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration. When Savage vowed to boycott Utah due to strong Mormon support for Proposition 8 (\"Fuck you, Utah—we’re going to big, blue Colorado\"), the \"Salt Lake City Weekly\" dropped Savage's column: \"all Utahns aren’t to blame.\"\n\nSavage strongly supported the War in Iraq in October 2002, stating \"Free your people, reform your societies, liberalize, and democratize... or we're going to come over there, remove you from power, free your people, and reform your societies for ourselves.\" By the time of the U.S. invasion in March 2003, however, he opposed the war.\n\nSavage has also opposed state legislation proscribing the sale of sex toys. After an exposé by Kandiss Crone from WLBT \nin Jackson, Mississippi precipitated the arrest and fining of an adult video store owner, Savage suggested that readers send any sex toys that they needed to dispose of to Crone.\n\nSavage's editorship of \"The Stranger\" has established him as a voice in local Seattle politics. His most high-profile commentary has been as an outspoken critic of the Teen Dance Ordinance and other crackdowns on all-ages events.\n\nSavage argues that closing down supervised all-ages dance venues drives teens to boredom and reckless activities: \"Places like Ground Zero and the Kirkland Teen Center are invaluable from a law enforcement point of view. They keep kids out of, say, 7-Eleven parking lots or the homes of friends whose parents are away.\"\n\nSavage initially supported the Iraq War and advocated military action against other Middle Eastern states, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, saying, \"Islamo-fascism is a regional problem, like European fascism—and the Middle East [has] to be remade just as Europe was remade.\" One week before the war began, Savage spoke against it, citing the inability of President George W. Bush to form a convincing case and sway the UN and NATO allies. By 2005 he deemed the situation \"hopeless\" and advocated an immediate troop withdrawal.\n\nSavage describes his view toward family as \"conservative.\" His husband, Terry Miller, is a \"stay-at-home dad\" for the couple's adopted son. He has, however, expressed skepticism of \"simplistic\" views of monogamy. In response to a letter asking \"Is the AIDS crisis over?\" Savage, in his October 22, 1997 column, answered simply, \"Yes.\" Several weeks of columns were devoted in whole or in part to discussion of the issue. Savage also opposes the tactics of the War on Drugs, and opposes the prohibition of certain controlled substances.\n\nSavage stated in a column that he favors outing in some cases, specifically mentioning anti-gay activist Tyler Whitney. However, in the same column he noted that \"I recently talked someone \"out\" of outing a public figure. A \"Savage Love\" reader was contemplating outing an innocuous celebrity back in April. I advised him against it because, as I wrote to him privately, outing is brutal and it should be reserved for brutes.\"\n\nOn the topic of child sexuality, Savage has said:\n\nSavage has taken strong positions on sexual abuse of children. After being accused of attacking then-14 year old Anthony Rapp while drunk, actor Kevin Spacey issued a statement on Twitter which included coming out as gay. Savage responded that there is \"no amount of drunk or closeted that excuses or explains away assaulting a 14-year-old child.\"\n\nIn a 2006 interview with the \"Daily Pennsylvanian\", Savage stated that then-Green Party Senate candidate Carl Romanelli, who Savage claimed was partially funded by state Republicans for a spoiler effect against Democrat Bob Casey, \"should be dragged behind a pickup truck until there's nothing left but the rope\". In the same interview, he stated, \"Mr. Romanelli should go fuck himself.\" Immediately after the interview, Savage wrote, \"I regret using that truck metaphor, and didn't mean it literally, and it was in poor taste, and I regret it.\"\n\nOn HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" July 15, 2011, during a panel discussion of the debt limit increase negotiations between the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama, Savage said in a stand-alone remark, \"I wish the Republicans were all fucking dead.\" He apologized for his remarks on his blog later the same night saying in part, \"I don't feel that way. My dad is a Republican. (Well, he says he's an independent, but he hasn't voted for a Democrat since JFK. My dad is a Republican.)\"\n\nSavage also came under scrutiny for an April 13, 2012, anti-bullying speech in which he encouraged high school students to \"learn to ignore the bullshit in the Bible about gay people\", prompting some students to leave the auditorium. Savage apologized on April 29 for calling the walkout \"a pansy-assed move\", saying, \"I wasn't calling the handful of students who left pansies (2,800+ students, most of them Christian, stayed and listened), just the walkout itself.\" Savage stood by the central point of his speech.\n\nJ. Bryan Lowder of \"Slate\" stated that Savage \"often takes heat for his less-than-refined statements on issues like the existence of male bisexuality, the responsibility of asexuals to 'come out' before dating, and, indeed, certain issues surrounding transgenderism.\" Savage has repeatedly been the focus of controversy for his use of slurs regarding the transgender community, other remarks regarding trans issues, and for joking that the then Attorney General of Washington was trans (who was not, in fact, trans). He has been glitter bombed three times, twice in 2011 and once in 2012, by protesters who alleged that he is transphobic, among other accusations. In June 2014, during a seminar at the University of Chicago on social media, Savage discussed his past use of the word \"tranny\". He objected to a student's request that he use the phrase \"T-slur\" instead, and gave examples of other slurs. Some students criticized him, claiming that he tried to make the student feel threatened and uncomfortable. A University representative said, \"A guest used language that provoked a spirited debate. The speaker was discussing how hurtful words can be repurposed and used to empower; at no point did he direct any slurs at anyone.\" Savage later thanked the University for standing up for him and demanded an apology from those who had accused him of hatred towards trans people.\n\nIn addition to his advice column, Savage has written four books, edited one book, and authored various op-ed pieces in \"The New York Times\".\n\nSavage coordinates the annual Hump! film festival, which is made up of clips of up to five minutes on any pornographic topic, submitted by viewers. Winning submissions are shown in Seattle and Portland theaters, providing an unusual experience as straight, gay male, bi, lesbian, and fetish porn are all shown together, one after another. Savage publicly destroys the submissions after the festival is over.\n\n"}

She has a particular focus on the Aboriginal people of Australia, Indigenous land rights, human rights, Indigenous religions, violence against women, and on environmental issues. She is Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and Writer and Editor in Residence at Flinders University, South Australia. Bell was born in and grew up in Melbourne. In 2005, after 17 years in the United States, she returned to Australia and worked on a number of projects in South Australia. Bell lives and writes in Canberra.\n\nHer books include \"Daughters of the Dreaming\" (1983/93); \"Generations: Grandmothers, mothers, and daughters\" (1987); \"Law: The old and the new\" (1980); \"Religion in Aboriginal Australia\" (co-edited 1984); and \"Radically Speaking: Feminism reclaimed\" (co-edited 1996). \"Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin: A world that is, was, and will be\" (1998) won a NSW Premier's Literary Award and was shortlisted for the Age Book of the Year Award, the Queensland Premier's History Award and the Australian Literary Society Gold Medallion. \"Evil: A novel\" (2005) was made into a play and performed in DC and Adelaide. She also wrote \"Kungun Ngarrindjeri Miminar Yunnan: Listen to Ngarrindjeri Women Speaking\" (2008).\n\nBell trained as a primary teacher in the 1960s in Victoria, Australia. She returned to study in the 1970s but first had to complete high school which she did by attending night school at Box Hill High School, Victoria. Bell continued onto university and received her BA (Hons) in Anthropology at Monash University in 1975, and a Ph.D. from Australian National University (ANU) in 1981 which was based on field work with Aboriginal women in central Australia.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Bell held a range of positions in Australia. She worked for the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority in the early 1980s, before establishing her own anthropological consultancy in Canberra. She consulted for the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council, Aboriginal Legal Aid Services, the Australian Law Reform Commission, and the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. She subsequently held academic posts, first as a Research Fellow at the ANU, and then as the Chair of Australian Studies at Deakin University in Geelong where she was the first female professor on staff. In 1989, Bell moved to the United States to take up the Chair of Religion, Economic Development and Social Justice endowed by the Henry R. Luce Foundation, at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1999 she moved to Washington, D.C. where she was Director of Women's Studies and Professor of Anthropology at the George Washington University (GWU). As the recipient of a fellowship in 2003-4, awarded by the peak educational body, the American Council on Education (ACE), Bell also worked closely with the senior administration of Virginia Tech as they revised their curriculum. Bell served on the Board of Trustees for Hampshire College for eight years. On her retirement from GWU in 2005 she was awarded the title \"Professor Emerita of Anthropology\" by The George Washington University. On her return to Australia she was appointed Writer and Editor in Residence at Flinders University (South Australia) and Visiting Professor, School of Social Sciences at the University of Adelaide (South Australia).\n\nBell is the author/editor of 10 books, including several significant monographs on Australian Aboriginal culture and numerous articles and book chapters dealing with religion, land rights, law reform, art, history and social change. She has served on the editorial boards of several journals (\"Aboriginal History\" 1979–1988; \"Women's Studies International Forum\" 1990-) and was a contributing member of the Editorial Board for the \"Longmans Encyclopedia\" (1989) Macmillan, \"Encyclopedia of World Religions\" (2005) and the \"Encyclopedia of Religion in Australia\" (2009).\n\nBell was a contributing consultant to \"National Geographic\" on their \"Taboo\" TV series (2002-4).\n\nBell's first full-length anthropological monograph was \"Daughters of the Dreaming\", which focused on the religious, spiritual and ceremonial lives of Aboriginal women in central Australia. The book has been in continuous print since its first publication in 1983 and subsequent editions in 1993 and 2002 engage with the debates the work stimulated. It is now well-established practice to have women's councils as part of the decision-making and consultative structures in Aboriginal affairs. Through her research and in giving expert evidence, Bell has been able to demonstrate that Aboriginal women are owners and managers of land in their own right. Bell worked on some 10 land claims for the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council and the then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey.\n\nIn 1986, Melbourne publishers McPhee Gribble, with Bell as author, won the competitive tender from the Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA) to write a book about women in Australia for the 1988 Bicentenary. The book, \"Generations: Grandmothers, Mothers and Daughters\" (with photos by Ponch Hawkes) explored generations of Australian women and \"the way the significant objects in their lives have been passed from hand to hand, generation to generation\". It focused on ordinary people through the stories they had been told by and were passing onto their female kin. Bell used an ethnographic approach to explore the commonalities of Australian women's cultures across age, time, race and region. Shortly after it was published, the book reached number one on the \"Age\" best seller list for works of non-fiction.\n\nThroughout the latter part of the 1970s, and through most of the 1980s, Bell was involved in issues about Aboriginal land rights and law reform. With lawyer, Pam Ditton, she authored \"Law: the old and the new. Aboriginal Women in Central Australia Speak Out\" (Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, 1980) which addressed issues of law reform in Central Australia, in the wake of the passage of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act (1976). Bell worked on a number of land claim cases in the Northern Territory, particularly in central Australia, but also in and around the Top End.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Bell became a key player in the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. In 1994 a group of Ngarrindjeri women, traditional owners of the Lower River Murray, Lakes Alexandrina and Albert and the Coorong (South Australia) had objected that a proposal to build a bridge from Goolwa to Kumarangk (Hindmarsh Island) near the Murray Mouth would desecrate sites sacred to them as women. The gender restricted knowledge that underwrote their claim became known as 'secret women's business' and was contested in the media, courts and academy. In 1996 a South Australian Royal Commission found that the women had deliberately fabricated their beliefs to thwart the development. However, the women who claimed knowledge of the sacred tradition did not give evidence at the Royal Commission because they considered it to be a violation of their religious freedoms. Five years later these women and those experts who had testified on their behalf were vindicated. In 2001, federal court judge, Mr John von Doussa, heard from all parties to the dispute and found the women had not lied. Nonetheless the notion that the women lied persists in some quarters and 'secret women's business' is used as a term of derision and disrespect. Bell became involved in this matter of gender-restricted knowledge after the Royal Commission. On the basis of her research in the SA archives and fieldwork with the women in 1996-8, Bell was convinced there was sufficient evidence to support the women's claims that there was gender-restricted knowledge in Ngarrindjeri society and that the women had told the truth.\n\nBell's subsequent monograph, \"Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin\" (1998), won the NSW Premier's Gleebook Award for cultural and literary criticism in 1999. The judges wrote: \"An erudite capacious book on the politically contentious and culturally sensitive subject of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, in which the author allows diverse voices to be heard and refuses to simplify an inherently complicated and pressing set of issues. This is an outstanding book of cultural criticism, which brings together feminist anthropology, oral and archival history, political and legal narrative.\" The book was also short listed for The Age Book of the Year and the Queensland Premier's History Award in 1999 and the Gold Medal of the Australian Literary Society in 2000. \"Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin\" is often cited as an important example of alternate ethnographic prose. Bell's most recent writing with Ngarrindjeri women, \"Kungun Ngarrindjeri Miminar Yunnan\" (2008) is a further contribution to collaborative research and writing and documents the impact of the contesting of cultural knowledge on the Ngarrindjeri. Bell continued to work with the Ngarrindjeri and from 2005–2012 lives on their traditional lands as she researched and wrote the Connection Report for their Native Title Claim.\n\nBell has also delved into the writing of fiction and plays. Her first book, titled \"Evil\", addresses secrets within the churches and is set on the campus of an American college. Performed as a play adapted by Leslie Jacobson for the \"From Page to Stage\" season on new plays at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., USA, 3 September 2006 and presented as a staged reading in Adelaide, 16 May 2008. Her play \"Weaving and Whispers\" was performed at the TarraWarra Museum of Arts Biennial in 2014. Her short story \"Blenders\" appeared in \"Island\" magazine 2010.\n\nBell ran as an independent candidate in the 2008 Mayo by-election, caused by the resignation of former foreign minister and Liberal leader Alexander Downer. Her campaign was called Vote4Di and was supported by a campaign website. South Australian independent Senator Nick Xenophon gave support to Bell's campaign. In a field of eleven candidates and the absence of a Labor candidate, Bell finished third on a 16.3 percent primary vote, behind the Greens on 21.4 (+10.4) percent and the Liberals on 41.3 (–9.8) percent. The seat became marginal for the Liberals on a 53.0 (–4.0) two-candidate vote.\n\nBell campaigned for fresh water flows for the River Murray, Lakes Alexandrina and Albert and the Coorong. In 2007, she was a co-founder of the 'StoptheWeir' website and worked with the River, Lakes and Coorong Action Group Inc to stop the construction of a weir across the River Murray at Pomanda Island (at the point where the river enters Lake Alexandrina). She administered the \"Hurry Save The Murray\" website and has been a frequent speaker and commentator on environmental matters on line, in the media and in preparing submissions and giving evidence to various environmental inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He commanded \"Sonderkommando\" 7a and \"Einsatzkommando\" 4a of the \"Einsatzgruppen\", both of which were responsible for mass killings in the Soviet Union. Steimle was found guilty in 1947 in the Einsatzgruppen Trial and sentenced to death in 1948. His sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison.\n\nSteimle was the son of a pastor and came from a strict pietistic family and studied history, German and French at the University of Tübingen and University of Berlin. In May 1935, he passed his teaching exams. He joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB), where he devoted himself to teaching \"Volksdeutsche\" students of the Sudetenland. He joined the SS (no. 272,575) as well in 1932, and then joined the SD in 1935 at the instigation of NSDStB chief Gustav Adolf Scheel. In September 1936, Steimle directed the SD office in Stuttgart. First, he headed the SD subsection Württemberg, and from 1939 until 1943, the SD-Leitabschnitt Stuttgart.\n\nFrom 7 September to 10 December 1941, he succeeded Walter Blume as the commanding officer of \"Sonderkommando\" 7a in \"Einsatzgruppe\" B, which was led by Arthur Nebe. Under Steimle's command, his unit murdered 500 Jews within two months.

She left a range of recordings representative of her repertoire.\n\nFreda Betti was born at 52 rue des Ponchettes in the district of \"Vieux-Nice\" in a modest family : her father was a house painter and her mother a fishmonger. His paternal family originates from the region of Emilia-Romagna in Italy : his grandfather was born in Parma and he immigrated to Nice with his wife and children in 1893.\n\nShe studied music and especially singing at the Conservatory of Nice with Édouard Rouard, where she obtained a \"Premier Prix de Chant\" in 1943. She made her debut at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo in 1947 as Siébel in \"Faust\" by Charles Gounod. She appeared frequently with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France of the RTF in the early 1950s, before entering the troupe of the Opéra-Comique in the 1960s. She sang the title role in particular of \"Carmen\" by Georges Bizet which she sang more than 150 times, and her repertoire also included Fricka, Brangaene, Dulcinée in \"Don Quichotte\" and Suzuki.\n\nBetti sang on major national stages (Nantes, Nice, Strasbourg, Toulouse) and European (Monte-Carlo, La Scala), as well as in numerous opera festivals, including Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Bayreuth.\n\nBetti recorded for Philips and EMI. Among published recordings she took part in were \"The Snow Maiden\" (Bobilicka), \"Démophon\", \"Tosca\" (shepherd boy) and \"Philippine\" (Isabelle). In 1958 she recorded excerpts from \"Carmen\" with Ken Neate, Gabriel Bacquier and Andréa Guiot on Philips P 77118 L.\n\nShe also participated in the original production of \"L'Opéra d'Aran\" by Gilbert Bécaud, in 1962, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.\n\nIn the 1970s she was a vocal teacher at the Conservatory of Monaco.\n\nFreda Betti died at her home in Nice in 1979, at the age of 55, and is buried in the family vault \"Famille Betti\" with her husband and his parents in the Cimetière du Château (\"Carré de l'O.N.U\").\n\nFreda Betti was married on 29 October 1949 in Levallois-Perret to René Clermont (1919–1976). The couple had two children.\n\nFreda Betti was the sister of Henri Betti and the great grandaunt of Alexy Bosetti but she has no family relationship with Laura Betti and Priscilla Betti.\n\nHer list of roles include:\n\n\nIn 1948, Freda Betti sang two songs composed by her brother Henri Betti in two radio programs broadcast on Paris Inter : \"Le Bonheur du Monde\" (lyrics by Maurice Vandair) and \"Je Cherche une Étoile\" (lyrics by René Rouzaud).\n\nIn 2018, Benoît Duteurtre hosts the radio show \"Étonnez-moi Benoît\" devoted to the career of his brother Henri Betti with the participation of his nephew and grand-nephew : François and Olivier Betti. During this radio show which is broadcast on France Musique on April 28, the host passes a sample of the opera-bouffe \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" composed in 1881 by Charles Lecocq with lyrics of Eugène Leterrier and Albert Vanloo that Freda Betti had played in 1956 as Sanchette.\n\n"}
{"id": "213383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213383", "title": "Good governance", "text": "Good governance\n\nGood governance is an indeterminate term used in the international development literature to describe how public institutions conduct public affairs and manage public resources. Governance is \"the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented)\". The term \"governance\" can apply to corporate, international, national, local governance or to the interactions between other sectors of society.\n\nThe concept of \"good governance\" of ten emerges as a model to compare ineffective economies or political bodies with viable economies and political bodies. The concept centers on the responsibility of governments and governing bodies to meet the needs of the masses as opposed to select groups in society. Because countries often described as \"most successful\" are Western liberal democratic states, concentrated in Europe and the Americas, good governance standards often measure other state institutions against these states. Aid organizations and the authorities of developed countries often will focus the meaning of \"good governance\" to a set of requirements that conform to the organization's agenda, making \"good governance\" imply many different things in many different contexts.\n\nIt is important to distinguish good governance from other concepts that look similar, such as development and economic growth. Instead of considering them as equal, many scholars refer to them as features that are likely to be related in different ways. In fact, the importance that authors give to good governance, is due to the impact it may have on development and economic growth.\n\nAccording to Grindle (2004), the relevance of getting good governance comes precisely from its relationship with the development of a country and the reduction of poverty. Setting an agenda for reaching good governance is of the huge interest but also a complex task, which makes this author to propose rather a “good enough governance” agenda as a starting point. In the construction of this \"simpler\" agenda, the idea is to revisit policies that have worked in the past, set priorities in a strategically way, consider policies with greater impact in alleviating poverty and reaching development, and look for innovative ways of implementing such policies.\n\nIn terms of economic growth, there are several authors relating that variable with good governance, but in the sense of “being related to” instead of “being part of”. In other words, scholars have been intrigued by the relationship between good governance and economic or political development. Grindle (2007) mentions there are many relations to be found between indicators of good governance and economic growth, however those associations are difficult to measure and even harder to be attributed as causal. Nevertheless, she mentions the work of Kauffman (2002), who found a causal and positive relationship between different dimensions of good governance and the GDP per capita in the long run, i.e. good governance makes development possible.\n\nThese dimensions are how the government is elected and oversighted, the accountability power of citizens, the credibility in the government, the respect for institutions, both from government and citizens, and the effective delivery of public goods. He found that the relation between these two variables does not hold in the reverse direction, meaning that higher levels of economic growth do not lead to better governance. For example, Quain (2003) points out that China and Vietnam are frequent examples of countries that have made remarkable leaps in economic development and poverty reduction, but nevertheless retain many characteristics of poor governance.\n\nIn international affairs, analysis of good governance can look at any of the following relationships:\n\n\nThe varying types of comparisons comprising the analysis of governance in scholastic and practical discussion can cause the meaning of \"good governance\" to vary greatly from practitioner to practitioner.\n\nIn corporate affairs, good governance can be observed in any of the following relationships:\n\n\nThe meaning of good governance in regards to corporate sectors varies between actors. Legislation has been enacted in an attempt to influence good governance in corporate affairs. In the United States, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 set up requirements for businesses to follow. Whistleblowing has also been widely used by corporations to expose corruption and fraudulent activity.\n\nGood governance in the context of countries is a broad term, and in that regards, it is difficult to find a unique definition. According to Fukuyama (2013), there are two dimensions to qualify governance as good or bad: the capacity of the state and the bureaucracy's autonomy. They both complement, in the sense that when the state is more capable, for instance through the collection of taxes, there should be more autonomy because the bureaucrats are able to conduct things well without being instructed with a lot of details. In less capable states, however, less discretion and more rules setting are desirable.\n\nAnother way to think about good governance is through outcomes. Since governments carry out with goals like the provision of public goods to its citizens, there is no better way to think about good governance other than through deliverables, which are precisely the one demanded by citizens, like security, health, education, water, the enforcement of contracts, protection to property, protection to the environment and their ability to vote and get paid fair wages.\n\nSimilarly, good governance might be approximated with provision of public services in an efficient manner, higher participation given to certain groups in the population like the poor and the minorities, the guarantee that citizens have the opportunity of checks and balances on the government, the establishment and enforcement of norms for the protection of the citizens and their property and the existence of independent judiciary systems.\n\nLawson (2011) in his review of Rothstein's book “The quality of government: corruption, social trust, and inequality in international perspective” mentions that the author relates good governance to the concept of impartiality, which is basically when the bureaucrats perform their tasks following the public interest rather than their self-interest. Lawson differs with him in that this impartial application of law ignores important factors like the economic liberalism, which matters due to its relation with economic growth.\n\nGood governance is argued to be the most important in local governments. It tries to promote more relationships between government and\n\n\nGood governance with local government aims to increase civil engagement with more members of the community in order to get the best options that serves the people.\n\nBefore there can be scientific experimentation, organizations must be compliant with good governance, meaning that testing must be moral and practical. Many research organizations such as SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering), a geoengineering research project that was formed in the U.K., was required to go through stages of evaluation before testing could be conducted if they were to be funded by stakeholders. In 2011 SPICE made plans to experiment with solar radiation. The method for this experiment included injecting stratospheric sulfur aerosols into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe criteria or \"stage-gate\" that they must pass before performing their experiment included the following; identify safe and principle risks, test must be compliant with relevant regulations, future applications and impacts, and mechanisms put in place to review these in the light of new information, and that the stakeholders must be regarded and taken into account. Before research can be conducted in the field of geoengineering it must be scrutinized using good governance to ensure testing isn't harmful to the environment and to detail all the possible risks that may occur.\n\nThree institutions can be reformed to promote good governance: the state, the private sector and civil society. However, among different cultures, the need and demand for reform can vary depending on the priorities of that country's society. A variety of country level initiatives and international movements put emphasis on various types of governance reform. Each movement for reform establishes criteria for what they consider good governance based on their own needs and agendas. The following are examples of good governance standards for prominent organizations in the international community.\n\nThe United Nations is playing an increasing role in good governance. According to former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \"Good governance is ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law; strengthening democracy; promoting transparency and capacity in public administration.\" To implement this, the UN follows eight principles:\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created at a United Nations (UN) conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. In 1996, the IMF declared \"promoting good governance in all its aspects, including by ensuring the rule of law, improving the efficiency and accountability of the public sector, and tackling corruption, as essential elements of a framework within which economies can prosper\". The IMF feels that corruption within economies is caused by the ineffective governance of the economy, either too much regulation or too little regulation. To receive loans from the IMF, countries must have certain good governance policies, as determined by the IMF, in place.\n\nThe World Bank is concerned with the reform of economic and social resource control. In 1992, it underlined three aspects of society that they feel affect the nature of a country's governance:\n\n\nThe Worldwide Governance Indicators is a program funded by the World Bank to measure the quality of governance of over 200 countries. It uses six dimensions of governance for their measurements, Voice & Accountability, Political Stability and Lack of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. They have been studying countries since 1996.\n\nGood governance defines an ideal that is difficult to achieve in full, though it is something development supporters consider donating to causes. Major donors and international financial institutions, like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank, are basing their aid and loans on the condition that the recipient undertake reforms ensuring good governance. This is mostly due to the close link between poor governance and corruption.\n\nBecause concepts such as civil society, decentralisation, peaceful conflict management and accountability are often used when defining the concept of good governance, the definition of good governance promotes many ideas that closely align with effective democratic governance. Not surprisingly, emphasis on good governance can sometimes be equated with promoting democratic government. However, a 2011 literature review analyzing the link between democracy and development by Alina Rocha Menocal of the Overseas Development Institute stresses the inconclusiveness of evidence on this relationship.\n\nA good example of this close association, for some actors, between western democratic governance and the concept of good governance is the following statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Nigeria on August 12, 2009:\n\nResearchers at the Overseas Development Institute have criticised past studies of good governance to place too little importance on developing political parties, their capacity and their ties to their grassroots supporters. While political parties play a key role in well-functioning democracies, elsewhere political parties are disconnected from voters and dominated by elites, with few incentives or capabilities to increase the representation of other voters. Political parties can play a key role in pivotal moments of a state's development, either negatively (e.g. organising and instigating violence) or positively (e.g. by leading dialogue in a fractured society). While differences in the electoral system play their role in defining the number of parties and their influence once in power (proportional, first past the post, etc.), the funding and expertise available to parties also plays an important role not only in their existence, but their ability to connect to a broad base of support. While the United Nations Development Program and the European Commission have been providing funds to political parties since the 1990s, there are still calls to increase the support for capacity development activities including the development of party manifestos, party constitutions and campaigning skills.\n\nNayef Al-Rodhan, in his 2009 book \"Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph\", proposed eight minimum criteria for ensuring good national governance. Al-Rodhan's eight minimum criteria are: 1) participation, equity, and inclusiveness, 2) rule of law, 3) separation of powers, 4) free, independent, and responsible media, 5) government legitimacy, 6) accountability, 7) transparency, and 8) limiting the distorting effect of money in politics. In the book, he argues that good national governance is an important component in creating a history of sustainability for the human race. For Al-Rodhan, the eight minimal criteria of good governance are expressions of the fundamental values of democracy and more liberal constitutionalism.\n\nThe Tuskegee Study from 1932 to 1972 led to the signing of the National Research Act. This law outlined basic ethical ways in which research is to be carried out. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) made regulations that required voluntary agreements for anyone who was to take part in their studies. Governance is used in scientific studies to ensure that policies are safe and ethical when studies are being done on human subjects. After the National Research Act there have been other organization put in place such as the Ethics Advisory Board, which reviews biomedical research. Many federal agencies adopted the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Rights in 1991. In 1995 President Bill Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Commission led by the Department of Health and Human Services with the task of reviewing regulations and policies to ensure the safety of research volunteers.\n\nAccording to Sam Agere, \"The discretionary space left by the lack of a clear well-defined scope for what governance encompasses allows users to choose and set their own parameters.\"\n\nIn the book \"Contesting 'good' governance\", Eva Poluha and Mona Rosendahl contest standards that are common to western democracy as measures of \"goodness\" in government. By applying political anthropological methods, they conclude that while governments believe they apply concepts of good governance while making decisions, cultural differences can cause conflict with the heterogeneous standards of the international community.\n\nAn additional source of good governance criticism is \"The Intelligent Person's Guide to Good Governance\", written by Surendra Munshi. Munshi's work was created in order to \"revive\" good governance. Many individuals tend to either wave away and be bored with the idea of governance, or not have a clue to what it has at all. This book is a generalized discussion on what the purpose of good governance is and how it serves that purpose throughout our society. Munshi targets the book toward anyone doing research or just simply \"those concerned with the issue of governance\".\n\n\"Rethinking Systems: Configurations of Politics and Policy in Contemporary Governance\", written by Michael P. Crozier, is another work analyzing good governance. Crozier's article discusses the different dynamics of changes that occur throughout communication systems and the effect it has on governance. The idea of various perspectives is presented throughout the article. This allows the reader to be able to see what contemporary governance is like from different viewpoints. Crozier's motive was to also create an open mindset when referring to how governance and policy within society operate, especially with the constant changes occurring day to day.\n\n\n\n"}

He was executed by the Nazis.\n\nScholl was born in Ingersheim (now a part of Crailsheim, Baden-Württemberg). His father, Robert, later became the mayor of Forchtenberg am Kocher. Hans was the second of six children:\n\n\nScholl was raised as a Lutheran, although he did at one point consider converting to Catholicism. \n\nScholl joined the Hitler Youth in 1933, but quickly became disillusioned with the group when he realised its true principles. He later studied medicine at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München Medizin.\n\nIn the early summer of 1942, Scholl, his sister Sophie, Willi Graf, Kurt Huber, Christoph Probst and Alexander Schmorell co-authored six anti-Nazi Third Reich political resistance leaflets. Calling themselves the White Rose, they instructed Germans to practice nonviolent resistance against the Nazis. The group had been horrified by the behavior of some German soldiers on the Eastern Front, where they had witnessed cruelty towards Jews in Poland and Soviet Union.\n\nThe leaflets were distributed around the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, where the group's members studied, and at the University of Hamburg. Leaflets were also mailed to doctors, scholars, and pub owners throughout Germany.\n\nOn 18 February 1943, Hans and Sophie were spotted by a custodian while throwing leaflets from the atrium at Ludwig Maximilians University. They were arrested by the Gestapo and, with Probst, tried for treason by Judge Roland Freisler. They were found guilty and condemned to death on 22 February.\n\nOnly a few hours after the judgment, Hans and Sophie Scholl and Christopher Probst were beheaded by Johann Reichhart in Munich's Stadelheim Prison. The execution was supervised by Dr. Walter Roemer, the enforcement chief of the Munich district court. Scholl's last words were \"Es lebe die Freiheit!\" (\"Long live freedom!\").\n\nShortly thereafter, most of the other students involved with the group were arrested and executed as well.\n\nFollowing the deaths, a copy of the sixth leaflet was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to the UK by German jurist Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, where it was used by the Allied Forces. In mid-1943, they dropped millions of copies of the tract, retitled The Manifesto of the Students of Munich, over Germany.\n\nThe White Rose's legacy has been considered significance by many historical commentators, both as a demonstration of exemplary spiritual courage, and as a well-documented case of social dissent in a time of violent repression, censorship and pressure to conform.\n\nPlaywright Lillian Garrett-Groag stated in \"Newsday\" (22 February 1993):\nIt is possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance that I can think of in the twentieth century... The fact that five little kids, in the mouth of the wolf, where it really counted, had the tremendous courage to do what they did, is spectacular to me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why.\n\nIn the same issue of \"Newsday\", Holocaust historian Jud Newborn noted:\nYou cannot really measure the effect of this kind of resistance in whether or not X number of bridges were blown up or a regime fell... The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but that's a very important value.\n\nHans was portrayed by Fabian Hinrichs in the film \"\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13398680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13398680", "title": "Higher Education Price Index", "text": "Higher Education Price Index\n\nThe Higher Education Price Index (HEPI) is a measure of the inflation rate applicable to United States higher education. HEPI measures the average relative level in the prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services typically purchased by colleges and universities through current-fund educational and general expenditures, excluding expenditures for research. Educational and general expenditures include the functions of instruction and departmental research, extension and public services, educational programs such as workshops and instructional institutes supported by sponsors outside the institution, student services, general administration and expenses, staff benefits, libraries, and operation and maintenance of the physical plant. Sponsored research, sales and services of education departments, and auxiliary enterprises are not priced by HEPI. The index is calculated on a fiscal year basis ending each June 30, by the Commonfund Institute, a branch of Commonfund, a non-profit organization devoted to the management of college and university endowments.\n\n“Dr. D. Kent Halstead is credited with first developing the HEPI for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (the precursor to the Department of Education) in 1975. Halstead argued that colleges and universities needed a new price index which more closely matched their expenditure patterns, going so far as to declare such an index to be “far superior to substitute proxy indexes such as the Consumer Price Index or the gross national product (GNP) explicit deflator which are intended for entirely different purposes.” Throughout the years, Halstead continued to update the HEPI.\n\nSince 2005, HEPI has been maintained by the Commonfund Institute, and it relies upon eight separate “cost factors” to construct the overall index. These factors are: faculty salaries, administrative salaries, clerical salaries, service employee salaries, fringe benefits, miscellaneous services, supplies and materials, and utilities.\n\n“In 2005, Commonfund Institute assumed responsibility for the index and the proprietary model used to calculate HEPI’s values from Research Associates of Washington, D.C. In 2007, in keeping with its commitment to improving and expanding the index, Commonfund Institute inaugurated two additional HEPI services: HEPI calculated by type of institution for six different categories of public and private colleges and universities, and the monthly release, beginning in January of each year, of a forecast of HEPI for the coming fiscal year end.\n\nIn 2009, two further improvements were introduced, aligning the estimates and the final HEPI calculation with the July–June academic fiscal year and making available HEPI calculated by region. HEPI forecasts are provided monthly from January through June of each year. The HEPI report is published using the July HEPI figure, which may be subject to a further small adjustment when the last of the underlying data items are finalized in November.\n\nHEPI has five critical characteristics that should be kept in mind when using it:\n\nHow is HEPI calculated?\nFrom 1961-2001, HEPI was based on the price data for 25 budget components organized into eight categories – more than 100 items in all. From fiscal year 2002 on, HEPI has been calculated using a regression formula.\n\nThe weighting of each expenditure category is determined by regression analysis (though it appears as though a sample of just 41 colleges is used) that essentially reports the share of total spending for each category. The heaviest weights accompany faculty and clerical salaries and fringe benefits, reflecting their relatively large share in college and university budgets.”\n\nThe regression-based index values are essentially equal to those resulting from complete data. The R-squared value for the regression is .999997809. Regression-calculated HEPI values are not likely to vary from fully compiled values by more than 0.1 parts out of 200.0 or ± 0.05%.\n\nEnhanced Methodology\nBeginning in 2009, the estimates and the final HEPI calculation were calculated using data series that were entirely aligned with the July–June academic fiscal year. Prior to that, the index had been calculated using data drawn from data series with various monthly endpoints. The resulting timing differences in the underlying data had sometimes led HEPI to seem too high or too low relative to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Adoption of the improved methodology led to a restatement of HEPI for the period 2002-2008.\n\nHEPI has useful tools for measuring inflation – but they have to be used appropriately:\n\n\n"}

It was launched amid a growth in the number of students in grades 10 to 12.\n\nThe first departments were \"The High House of Teachers\" and \"The Statistics Center\".

However, the curricula and educational content were consolidated among all branches.

Her childhood was spent in Alexandria, Egypt, where she first began to dance. She was trained in classical ballet (in the Preobrajenska method) in Vienna. In Vienna, she subsequently became a pupil of Gertrud Bodenwieser at the State Academy. She later studied choreography from Kurt Jooss and, in the style of German Expressionism, under Mary Wigman. By the beginning of the 1930s, she had performed to critical acclaim in the major artistic centres of continental Europe. She wrote choreographic compositions for a soloist to works by Scriabin, Prokofiev, Karl Orff, Hindemith, Bartók, and Mompou. The Wiener Zeitung described her as an \"artist of genius and soul\"; the as \"a very remarkable talent\" with \"perfect technical mastery\"; and the stated that she possessed \"perfect domination in the art of movement\". In her twenties, she received critical acclaim on the continent, including Paris, Florence, Rome, Milan, Turin, Budapest, Nice, Warsaw, Bratislava, Amsterdam, Venice, Prague, Saltzburg, Geneva and Zurich. The Nuovo Gionale wrote of \"this refined and elegant dancer\", while stated: \"Lilian Harmel is a true artist, who expresses with her perfect technique the pictures of her fantasy, the sentiments of her soul and the spirit of ballet.\" La Nazione wrote: \"the technique of this dancer is perfect, there is true precision of form, absolute ability of means, sureness in balance, the gifts of musicality and a complete power of expression.\" She moved to Paris in 1936, where she was filmed for an early French television broadcast. She subsequently moved to England with her fiancé in 1938. On her arrival in England, \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote \"she has a very personable appearance and possesses imagination and intelligence... she is both interesting and striking\", while the \"Daily Mail\" described her as \"an original and gifted exponent of pure dancing both in technique and interpretation\", and \"The Sketch\" welcomed her as \"a brilliant young dancer\".\n\nAfter the war, she opened a dance studio inside her house in Hampstead. By 1957, her classes had over 25 young children and 25 teenage and adult students. She had originally intended to teach children temporarily, but was persuaded to continue after Hampstead parents had told her \"they think it is most necessary in Hampstead.\" \"Many Moons\", her children's ballet, was performed on ITV on Christmas Day 1967. Harmel was an early pioneer in the setting of electronic and contemporary music to dance, choreographing performances to Edgard Varèse, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, and Cesar Bresgen. In her teaching, she came to conceive of dance as a process of personal discovery, rather than mere performance. To this end, in the tradition of the Tanztheater, her Hampstead classes accepted students of all abilities, both amateurs and professionals, so long as they shared her passion for individual development. To celebrate her forty years of teaching, in 1978, at the age of 70, she performed a final solo dance at the Hampstead Theatre. On her death, \"The Times\" wrote: \"she enriched generations of children and dance students through her concern for the artistic development of the individual... she and her work were a beacon\".\n\nFriends and collaborators included Rudolf Laban, Cesar Bresgen, Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, Mary Wigman, Charles Philips Trevelyan, Georges-Emmanuel Clancier, , Adrian Stokes, Hilde Holger.\n\n"}

{"id": "16271099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16271099", "title": "Mémoire", "text": "Mémoire\n\nIn French culture, the word mémoire, as in un mémoire (\"a memory\" – indefinite article), reflects the writer's own experiences and memories. The word has no direct English translation.\n\nThe word appeared in the course of the 12th century. In this era, it simply meant an explanatory text written to show an idea. Little by little, and above all in the modern era, the term became synonymous with an argumentative piece of writing, serving and asserting an idea. Vauban also wrote mémoires to Louis XIV on fortifications, such as \"Mémoire pour servir d'instruction dans la conduite des sièges et dans la défense des places, par M. le maréchal de Vauban, présenté au Roi en 1704\", and the religious quarrels of the time also produced several mémoires.\n\nIn the course of the 19th century, \"mémoire\" took on a sense that approaches the sense it holds today. It lost its polemical character and became a scientific text (or one that wanted to be scientific), for showing a fact, principal or idea. The mémoire thus became shorter and shorter, serving to enlighten the reader on a precise point such as a subject that had to be treated by the administration or politicians. All university writings in this era, however, were still called theses – \"mémoire\" did not yet have a university sense.\n\nThe development of using \"mémoire\" to mean a piece of university writing occurred in the course of the 20th century. In effect, the organisation of university studies made it necessary to have a more precise definition, which create the level of \"maîtrise\".\n\nA \"maîtrise\" (now called Master 1) student's work, if it was original research, could not be called a thesis, for the student generally did not invent a concept or a new theory at this level. The term \"mémoire\" thus often came to be used, as it fitted this subject well - showing a fact, research, in a relatively boiled-down format.\n\nThe pursuit of apprenticeships in research work involved students in editing a \"second mémoire\", at Master 2 (formerly DEA) level, often as a feasibility study for a full thesis. This too was of quite a boiled-down format and showed the tools which would eventually allow the student to set out on a thesis. For a Master 2 in social sciences or literature, a \"mémoire\" comprises a description of the sources which would allow future work on a thesis, the necessary bibliography, an exposé of the problems involved as defined by the student, and one or two attempts at edited-down chapters, showing that the problems, sources and bibliography could lead to a real work of original research.\n\nOn the other hand, one rarely speaks of a \"mémoire de thèse\", as this is too voluminous, and its usage is only to qualify that the thesis is all the student's own work.\n"}

He has won over 150 major awards including 12 Clios, and he has contributed to nearly 15,000 commercials. His work includes the MGM release \"Two Weeks\".\n\nThe book is published by Focal Press, a media and technology publishing company.

In the 40-some years I've been at this, I've worked on tracks ranging from sales videos to theatrical features...and seen my projects win Clios, an Emmy, and hundreds of other awards...This book is an attempt to share as much as I can.\n\"Producing Great Sound for Film and Video\" is broken into four main sections, ordered to reflect real-world filming situations: \n\nSubjects covered include analog versus digital audio, recording and using sound effects, microphone techniques, ADR, mixing, and mastering.\n\nOne section highlighted as unique by \"Videomaker Magazine\" was that on \"editing voices.\" Rose breaks down how human speech works, and how that translates to film and video productions. Tips include stealing unvoiced sounds from other characters or people speaking in a scene, and using them to replace problematic recordings of others. The \"editing voices\" section also discusses sounds with \"hard attacks\" and training the ear to hear phonemes, which helps in isolating and correcting speech recording issues.\n\nNumerous \"recipes\" for dealing with common sound issues, such as reducing or eliminating echo on sets, and removing line hum and buzz from recorded audio, are also provided.\n\nEliva Silva writing for \"San Antonio Express-News\" said of the book:\n[It is] the whole theory -- and beautiful theory -- on the science of audio and the way that audio is recorded through voltage, converted into digital information, back to voltage into sound.\n\nAuthor Rose states in the book that he wishes to appeal to technical and non-technical people alike, adding he hopes to keep the book approachable and conversational in tone, dispelling the idea that audio needs to be difficult to understand. He states that audio is not \"rocket science.\" While the book does contain math and science, Rose points out the math is elementary school level and the physics is \"common sense.\"\n\nThe current version of the book provides downloadable files including sample sounds and music, diagnostic tools and additional tutorials allowing the reader to practice with the principles explained. Earlier versions of the book included a CD-ROM of similar assets.\n\nIn 2003, \"Millimeter Magazine\" felt the style was right for the time:\nDigital artists are very much hands-on, and Rose is the right man to write audio books for this new generation of filmmakers. Rose operates his own boutique sound studio and bridges the analog and digital eras - he's made the discoveries and mistakes that no one should have to learn on the job. This direct experience with DV equipment and projects is apparent throughout the book.\n\nMajor universities and film schools that have used the book as a textbook include: \nA 33-page instructor guide is also provided by the publisher.\n\nCovering the first edition of the book, \"Videomaker Magazine\" noted the high price tag of the book, but said:\nWith PBS and Turner Network Television production experience under his belt, author Jay Rose brings a wealth of experience to \"Producing Great Sound for Digital Video\"...the book is replete with facts and useful information.\n\nOf the second edition, \"Millimeter Magazine\" said:\nShortchanging film sound is typical of new filmmakers, and the emphasis on picture over sound is a bias running through film schools and film publications - articles, books, and courses on visual subjects far outnumber those on film sound. Author Jay Rose is single-handedly addressing the problem.\n\nJohn Hartney writing for \"Creative COW\" said of the second edition, \n...it offers such a wide range of usable information about hands-on digital audio production, that by reading it, the reader is empowered with production skills and enlightened by an appreciation of how the experience of audio enriches video.\n\nIn 2008, covering the third edition of the book, \"Videomaker Magazine\" awarded it \"five out of five stars\" and said:\nI have been looking for this book for 20 years - no exaggeration...The chapter on Editing Voices alone is worth the price tag.\n\nAcademy Award winner Randy Thom (director of Sound Design at Skywalker Sound, Oscar winner for \"The Right Stuff\" and \"The Incredibles\") wrote praise of the author and book:\nJay Rose is one of the leaders in spreading the gospel of using sound creatively. He presents cutting-edge ideas about the collaboration of sound and image, and also covers the basics… all in an easy to read, easy to understand style.\n\nAcademy Award nominated sound mixer Jeff Wexler (\"Independence Day, The Last Samurai, Fight Club\") wrote a blurb for the book stating:\n\"This is the definitive book. It should be mandatory reading for anyone who is seriously considering a career making movies.\"\n"}

{"id": "31692117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31692117", "title": "Raspberry Pi", "text": "Raspberry Pi\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. The original model became far more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It does not include peripherals (such as keyboards and mice) and cases. However, some accessories have been included in several official and unofficial bundles.\n\nThe organisation behind the Raspberry Pi consists of two arms. The first two models were developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. After the Pi Model B was released, the Foundation set up Raspberry Pi Trading, with Eben Upton as CEO, to develop the third model, the B+. Raspberry Pi Trading is responsible for developing the technology while the Foundation is an educational charity to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, more than 5 million Raspberry Pis were sold by February 2015, making it the best-selling British computer. By November 2016 they had sold 11 million units, and 12.5m by March 2017, making it the third best-selling \"general purpose computer\". In July 2017, sales reached nearly 15 million. In March 2018, sales reached 19 million.\n\nMost Pis are made in a Sony factory in Pencoed, Wales; some are made in China or Japan.\n\nSeveral generations of Raspberry Pis have been released. All models feature a Broadcom system on a chip (SoC) with an integrated ARM-compatible central processing unit (CPU) and on-chip graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nProcessor speed ranges from 700 MHz to 1.4 GHz for the Pi 3 Model B+; on-board memory ranges from 256 MB to 1 GB RAM. Secure Digital (SD) cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either SDHC (early Raspberry Pi's) or MicroSDHC (Later Raspberry Pi's) sizes. The boards have one to four USB ports. For video output, HDMI and composite video are supported, with a standard 3.5 mm tip-ring-sleeve jack for audio output. Lower-level output is provided by a number of GPIO pins, which support common protocols like I²C. The B-models have an 8P8C Ethernet port and the Pi 3 and Pi Zero W have on-board Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth. Prices range from US$5 to $35.\n\nThe first generation (Raspberry Pi 1 Model B) was released in February 2012, followed by the simpler and cheaper Model A. In 2014, the Foundation released a board with an improved design, Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+. These boards are approximately credit-card sized and represent the standard \"mainline\" form-factor. Improved A+ and B+ models were released a year later. A \"Compute Module\" was released in April 2014 for embedded applications. The Raspberry Pi 2, which added more random-access memory, was released in February 2015.\n\nA Raspberry Pi Zero with smaller size and reduced input/output (I/O) and general-purpose input/output (GPIO) capabilities was released in November 2015 for US$5. By 2017, it became the newest mainline Raspberry Pi. On 28 February 2017, the Raspberry Pi Zero W was launched, a version of the Zero with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, for US$10. On 12 January 2018, the Raspberry Pi Zero WH was launched, the same version as the Zero W with pre-soldered GPIO headers.\n\nRaspberry Pi 3 Model B was released in February 2016 with a 64-bit quad core processor, on-board WiFi, Bluetooth and USB boot capabilities. On Pi Day 2018 model 3B+ appeared with a faster 1.4 GHz processor and a three times faster network based on gigabit Ethernet (throughput limited to ca. 300 Mbit/s by the internal USB 2.0 connection) or 2.4 / 5 GHz dual-band Wi-Fi (100 Mbit / s). Other options are: Power over Ethernet (PoE), USB boot and network boot (an SD card is no longer required).\n\nThe Raspberry Pi hardware has evolved through several versions that feature variations in memory capacity and peripheral-device support.\n\nThis block diagram describes Model B and B+; Model A, A+, and the Pi Zero are similar, but lack the Ethernet and USB hub components. The Ethernet adapter is internally connected to an additional USB port. In Model A, A+, and the Pi Zero, the USB port is connected directly to the system on a chip (SoC). On the Pi 1 Model B+ and later models the USB/Ethernet chip contains a five-port USB hub, of which four ports are available, while the Pi 1 Model B only provides two. On the Pi Zero, the USB port is also connected directly to the SoC, but it uses a micro USB (OTG) port.\n\nThe Broadcom BCM2835 SoC used in the first generation Raspberry Pi includes a 700 MHz ARM11 76JZF-S processor, VideoCore IV graphics processing unit (GPU), and RAM. It has a level 1 (L1) cache of 16 KB and a level 2 (L2) cache of 128 KB. The level 2 cache is used primarily by the GPU. The SoC is stacked underneath the RAM chip, so only its edge is visible. The 1176JZ(F)-S is the same CPU used in the original iPhone, although at a higher clock rate, and mated with a much faster GPU.\n\nThe earlier V1.1 model of the Raspberry Pi 2 used a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC with a 900 MHz 32-bit, quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor, with 256 KB shared L2 cache. The Raspberry Pi 2 V1.2 was upgraded to a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, the same SoC which is used on the Raspberry Pi 3, but underclocked (by default) to the same 900 MHz CPU clock speed as the V1.1. The BCM2836 SoC is no longer in production as of late 2016.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 3+ uses a Broadcom BCM2837B0 SoC with a 1.4 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, with 512 KB shared L2 cache.\n\nWhile operating at 700 MHz by default, the first generation Raspberry Pi provided a real-world performance roughly equivalent to 0.041 GFLOPS. On the CPU level the performance is similar to a 300 MHz Pentium II of 1997–99. The GPU provides 1 Gpixel/s or 1.5 Gtexel/s of graphics processing or 24 GFLOPS of general purpose computing performance. The graphical capabilities of the Raspberry Pi are roughly equivalent to the performance of the Xbox of 2001.\n\nRaspberry Pi 2 V1.1 included a quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU running at 900 MHz and 1 GB RAM. It was described as 4–6 times more powerful than its predecessor. The GPU was identical to the original. In parallelised benchmarks, the Raspberry Pi 2 V1.1 could be up to 14 times faster than a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 3, with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, is described as having ten times the performance of a Raspberry Pi 1. This was suggested to be highly dependent upon task threading and instruction set use. Benchmarks showed the Raspberry Pi 3 to be approximately 80% faster than the Raspberry Pi 2 in parallelised tasks.\n\nMost Raspberry Pi systems-on-chip could be overclocked to 800 MHz, and some to 1000 MHz. There are reports the Raspberry Pi 2 can be similarly overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500 MHz (discarding all safety features and over-voltage limitations). In the Raspbian Linux distro the overclocking options on boot can be done by a software command running \"sudo raspi-config\" without voiding the warranty. In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the overclocking down if the chip temperature reaches , but it is possible to override automatic over-voltage and overclocking settings (voiding the warranty); an appropriately sized heat sink is needed to protect the chip from serious overheating.\n\nNewer versions of the firmware contain the option to choose between five overclock (\"turbo\") presets that when used, attempt to maximise the performance of the SoC without impairing the lifetime of the board. This is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip and the CPU load, and dynamically adjusting clock speeds and the core voltage. When the demand is low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is throttled, but if the CPU has much to do and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1 GHz, depending on the individual board and on which of the turbo settings is used.\n\nThe seven overclock presets are:\n\n\nIn the highest (\"turbo\") preset the SDRAM clock was originally 500 MHz, but this was later changed to 600 MHz because 500 MHz sometimes causes SD card corruption. Simultaneously in \"high\" mode the core clock speed was lowered from 450 to 250 MHz, and in \"medium\" mode from 333 to 250 MHz.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Zero runs at 1 GHz.\n\nThe CPU on the first and second generation Raspberry Pi board did not require cooling, such as a heat sink or fan, even when overclocked, but the Raspberry Pi 3 may generate more heat when overclocked.\n\nOn the older beta Model B boards, 128 MB was allocated by default to the GPU, leaving 128 MB for the CPU. On the first 256 MB release Model B (and Model A), three different splits were possible. The default split was 192 MB (RAM for CPU), which should be sufficient for standalone 1080p video decoding, or for simple 3D, but probably not for both together. 224 MB was for Linux only, with only a 1080p framebuffer, and was likely to fail for any video or 3D. 128 MB was for heavy 3D, possibly also with video decoding (e.g. XBMC). Comparatively the Nokia 701 uses 128 MB for the Broadcom VideoCore IV.\n\nFor the later Model B with 512 MB RAM new standard memory split files (arm256_start.elf, arm384_start.elf, arm496_start.elf) were initially released for 256 MB, 384 MB and 496 MB CPU RAM (and 256 MB, 128 MB and 16 MB video RAM) respectively. But a week or so later the RPF released a new version of start.elf that could read a new entry in config.txt (gpu_mem=\"xx\") and could dynamically assign an amount of RAM (from 16 to 256 MB in 8 MB steps) to the GPU, so the older method of memory splits became obsolete, and a single start.elf worked the same for 256 MB and 512 MB Raspberry Pis.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 2 and the Raspberry Pi 3 have 1 GB of RAM. The Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W have 512 MB of RAM.\n\nThe Model A, A+ and Pi Zero have no Ethernet circuitry and are commonly connected to a network using an external user-supplied USB Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter. On the the Ethernet port is provided by a built-in USB Ethernet adapter using the SMSC LAN9514 chip. The Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi Zero W (wireless) are equipped with 2.4 GHz WiFi 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.1 based on the Broadcom BCM43438 FullMAC chip with no official support for monitor mode but implemented through unofficial firmware patching and the Pi 3 also has a 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet port. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ features dual-band IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, and Gigabit Ethernet (limited to approximately 300 Mbit/s by the USB 2.0 bus between it and the SoC).\n\nThe Pi Zero can be used as a USB device or \"USB gadget\", plugged into another computer via a USB port on each machine. It can be configured in multiple ways, for example to show up as a serial device or an ethernet device. Although originally requiring software patches, this was added into the mainline Raspbian distribution in May 2016.\n\nThe Pi 3 can boot from USB, such as from a flash drive. Because of firmware limitations in other models, the Pi 3 is the only board that can do this.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi may be operated with any generic USB computer keyboard and mouse. It may also be used with USB storage, USB to MIDI converters, and \"virtually\" any other device/component with USB capabilities.\n\nOther peripherals can be attached through the various pins and connectors on the surface of the Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe video controller can generate standard modern TV resolutions, such as HD and Full HD, and higher or lower monitor resolutions as well as older NTSC or PAL standard CRT TV resolutions. As shipped (i.e., without custom overclocking) it can support the following resolutions: 640×350 EGA; 640×480 VGA; 800×600 SVGA; 1024×768 XGA; 1280×720 720p HDTV; 1280×768 WXGA variant; 1280×800 WXGA variant; 1280×1024 SXGA; 1366×768 WXGA variant; 1400×1050 SXGA+; 1600×1200 UXGA; 1680×1050 WXGA+; 1920×1080 1080p HDTV; 1920×1200 WUXGA.\n\nHigher resolutions, up to 2048×1152, may work or even 3840×2160 at 15 Hz (too low a frame rate for convincing video). Note also that allowing the highest resolutions does not imply that the GPU can decode video formats at these resolutions; in fact, the Pis are known to not work reliably for H.265 (at those high resolutions), commonly used for very high resolutions (however, most common formats up to Full HD do work).\n\nAlthough the Raspberry Pi 3 does not have H.265 decoding hardware, the CPU is more powerful than its predecessors, potentially fast enough to allow the decoding of H.265-encoded videos in software. The GPU in the Raspberry Pi 3 runs at higher clock frequencies of 300 MHz or 400 MHz, compared to previous versions which ran at 250 MHz.\n\nThe Raspberry Pis can also generate 576i and 480i composite video signals, as used on old-style (CRT) TV screens and less-expensive monitors through standard connectorseither RCA or 3.5 mm phono connector depending on models. The television signal standards supported are PAL-BGHID, PAL-M, PAL-N, NTSC and NTSC-J.\n\nNone of the current Raspberry Pi models have a built-in real-time clock, so they are unable to keep track of the time of day independently. As a workaround, a program running on the Pi can retrieve the time from a network time server or from user input at boot time, thus knowing the time while powered on. To provide consistency of time for the file system, the Pi automatically saves the current system time on shutdown, and re-loads that time at boot.\n\nA real-time hardware clock with battery backup, such as the DS1307, may be added (often via the I²C interface). Note however that this conflicts with the camera's CSI interface, effectively disabling the camera.\n\n\"* all interfaces are via 200-pin DDR2 SO-DIMM connector.\"\n\nRaspberry Pi 1 Models A+ and B+, Pi 2 Model B, Pi 3 Model B and B+, and Pi Zero and Zero W GPIO J8 have a 40-pin pinout. Raspberry Pi 1 Models A and B have only the first 26 pins.\n\nModel B rev. 2 also has a pad (called P5 on the board and P6 on the schematics) of 8 pins offering access to an additional 4 GPIO connections.\n\nModels A and B provide GPIO access to the ACT status LED using GPIO 16. Models A+ and B+ provide GPIO access to the ACT status LED using GPIO 47, and the power status LED using GPIO 35.\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Foundation provides Raspbian, a Debian-based Linux distribution for download, as well as third-party Ubuntu, Windows 10 IoT Core, RISC OS, and specialised media centre distributions. It promotes Python and Scratch as the main programming languages, with support for many other languages. The default firmware is closed source, while an unofficial open source is available. Many other operating systems can also run on the Raspberry Pi, including the formally verified microkernel, . Other third-party operating systems available via the official website include Ubuntu MATE, Windows 10 IoT Core, RISC OS and specialised distributions for the Kodi media centre and classroom management.\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi can use a VideoCore IV GPU via a binary blob, which is loaded into the GPU at boot time from the SD-card, and additional software, that initially was closed source. This part of the driver code was later released. However, much of the actual driver work is done using the closed source GPU code. Application software makes calls to closed source run-time libraries (OpenMax, OpenGL ES or OpenVG), which in turn call an open source driver inside the Linux kernel, which then calls the closed source VideoCore IV GPU driver code. The API of the kernel driver is specific for these closed libraries. Video applications use OpenMAX, use OpenGL ES and use OpenVG, which both in turn use EGL. OpenMAX and EGL use the open source kernel driver in turn.\n\nThe official firmware is a freely redistributable binary blob, that is closed-source. A minimal proof-of-concept open source firmware is also available, mainly aimed at initializing and starting the ARM cores as well as performing minimal startup that is required on the ARM side. It is also capable of booting a very minimal Linux kernel, with patches to remove the dependency on the mailbox interface being responsive. It is known to work on Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3, as well as some variants of Raspberry Pi Zero. While it is in a working state, it is not actively developed, with last significant commits made around mid-2017.\n\n\n\nTechnology writer Glyn Moody described the project in May 2011 as a \"potential \", not by replacing machines but by supplementing them. In March 2012 Stephen Pritchard echoed the BBC Micro successor sentiment in \"ITPRO\". Alex Hope, co-author of the Next Gen report, is hopeful that the computer will engage children with the excitement of programming. Co-author Ian Livingstone suggested that the BBC could be involved in building support for the device, possibly branding it as the BBC Nano. Chris Williams, writing in The Register sees the inclusion of programming languages such as Kids Ruby, Scratch and BASIC as a \"good start\" to equip children with the skills needed in the future – although it remains to be seen how effective their use will be. The Centre for Computing History strongly supports the Raspberry Pi project, feeling that it could \"usher in a new era\". Before release, the board was showcased by ARM's CEO Warren East at an event in Cambridge outlining Google's ideas to improve UK science and technology education.\n\nHarry Fairhead, however, suggests that more emphasis should be put on improving the educational software available on existing hardware, using tools such as Google App Inventor to return programming to schools, rather than adding new hardware choices. Simon Rockman, writing in a ZDNet blog, was of the opinion that teens will have \"better things to do\", despite what happened in the 1980s.\n\nIn October 2012, the Raspberry Pi won T3's Innovation of the Year award, and futurist Mark Pesce cited a (borrowed) Raspberry Pi as the inspiration for his ambient device project MooresCloud. In October 2012, the British Computer Society reacted to the announcement of enhanced specifications by stating, \"it's definitely something we'll want to sink our teeth into.\"\n\nIn February 2015, a switched-mode power supply chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B version 1.1 (the initially released version) was found to be vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi 2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at the other side of the Raspberry Pi 2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi 2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi 2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.\n\nIn June 2017, Raspberry Pi won the Royal Academy of Engineering MacRobert Award. The citation for the award to the Raspberry Pi said it was \"for its inexpensive credit card-sized microcomputers, which are redefining how people engage with computing, inspiring students to learn coding and computer science and providing innovative control solutions for industry.\"\n\nThe Raspberry Pi community was described by Jamie Ayre of FLOSS software company AdaCore as one of the most exciting parts of the project. Community blogger Russell Davis said that the community strength allows the Foundation to concentrate on documentation and teaching. The community developed a fanzine around the platform called \"The MagPi\" which in 2015, was handed over to the Raspberry Pi Foundation by its volunteers to be continued in-house. A series of community \"Raspberry Jam\" events have been held across the UK and around the world.\n\n, enquiries about the board in the United Kingdom have been received from schools in both the state and private sectors, with around five times as much interest from the latter. It is hoped that businesses will sponsor purchases for less advantaged schools. The CEO of Premier Farnell said that the government of a country in the Middle East has expressed interest in providing a board to every schoolgirl, to enhance her employment prospects.\n\nIn 2014, the Raspberry Pi Foundation hired a number of its community members including ex-teachers and software developers to launch a set of free learning resources for its website. The Foundation also started a teacher training course called Picademy with the aim of helping teachers prepare for teaching the new computing curriculum using the Raspberry Pi in the classroom.\n\nIn 2018, NASA launched the \"JPL Open Source Rover Project\", which is a scaled down of Curiosity rover and uses a Raspberry Pi as the control module, to encourage students and hobbyists to get involved in mechanical, software, electronics, and robotics engineering.\n\nThere are a number of developers and applications that are leveraging the Raspberry Pi for home automation. These programmers are making an effort to modify the Raspberry Pi into a cost-affordable solution in energy monitoring and power consumption. Because of the relatively low cost of the Raspberry Pi, this has become a popular and economical alternative to the more expensive commercial solutions.\n\nIn June 2014, TECHBASE, Polish industrial automation manufacturer designed the world's first industrial computer based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module, called ModBerry. The device has numerous interfaces, most notably RS-485/232 serial ports, digital and analogue inputs/outputs, CAN and economical 1-Wire buses, all of which are widely used in the automation industry. The design allows the use of the Compute Module in harsh industrial environments, leading to the conclusion that the Raspberry Pi is no longer limited to home and science projects, but can be widely used as an Industrial IoT solution and achieve goals of Industry 4.0.\n\nIn March 2018, SUSE announced commercial support for SUSE Linux Enterprise on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to support a number of undisclosed customers implementing industrial monitoring with the Raspberry Pi. []\n\nOTTO is a digital camera created by Next Thing Co. It incorporates a Raspberry Pi Compute Module. It was successfully crowd-funded in a May 2014 Kickstarter campaign.\n\nSlice is a digital media player which also uses a Compute Module as its heart. It was crowd-funded in an August 2014 Kickstarter campaign. The software running on Slice is based on Kodi.\n\nA project was launched in December 2014 at an event held by the UK Space Agency. The Astro Pi competition was officially opened in January and was opened to all primary and secondary school aged children who were residents of the United Kingdom. During his mission, British ESA astronaut Tim Peake deployed the computers on board the International Space Station. He loaded the winning code while in orbit, collected the data generated and then sent this to Earth where it was distributed to the winning teams. Covered themes during the competition included Spacecraft Sensors, Satellite Imaging, Space Measurements, Data Fusion and Space Radiation.\n\nThe organisations involved in the Astro Pi competition include the UK Space Agency, UKspace, Raspberry Pi, ESERO-UK and ESA.\n\nIn 2006, early concepts of the Raspberry Pi were based on the Atmel ATmega644 microcontroller. Its schematics and PCB layout are publicly available. Foundation trustee Eben Upton assembled a group of teachers, academics and computer enthusiasts to devise a computer to inspire children. The computer is inspired by Acorn's BBC Micro of 1981. The Model A, Model B and Model B+ names are references to the original models of the British educational BBC Micro computer, developed by Acorn Computers. The first ARM prototype version of the computer was mounted in a package the same size as a USB memory stick. It had a USB port on one end and an HDMI port on the other.\n\nThe Foundation's goal was to offer two versions, priced at US$25 and $35. They started accepting orders for the higher priced Model B on 29 February 2012, the lower cost Model A on 4 February 2013. and the even lower cost (US$20) A+ on 10 November 2014. On 26 November 2015, the cheapest Raspberry Pi yet, the Raspberry Pi Zero, was launched at US$5 or £4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Training takes place from 7:30 to 2:00 , five days per week, for the duration of the course. The course starts from fundamentals, assuming very little about participants' initial knowledge of aikido, but a high level of physical ability is expected. Participants learn from the instructors of the \"honbu dojo\". The first two months of the course are considered a trial period, and it is common for participants to drop out. In the year that Twigger participated, the number of foreign participants remained constant at 10 participants throughout the entire course. This is a rare occurrence, most courses have a higher drop out rate.\n\nThe senshusei course was originally created in 1957 by Gozo Shioda, founder of Yoshinkan Aikido, to train the Tokyo riot police. The course has been available to non-police candidates since the 1980s, but was developed primarily for foreign students interested in becoming instructors starting in 1991. There are now two other versions of the course: a less-intensive version for participants aged 40 years or older, and a part-time version taking two years to complete.\n\nThen-9th \"dan\" Kyoichi Inoue, \"shihan\", stopped teaching in the senshusei course when he resigned from the Yoshinkan in March 2006 following an internal dispute, later establishing his own branch, Aikido Shinwakan (合氣道親和館). Following Inoue's departure, Tsutomu Chida, 8th \"dan\", and then-chief instructor of the Yoshinkan \"honbu-dōjō\", also broke away, establishing Aikido Renshinkai (合気道錬身会) in 2008, thus ending his teaching in the course.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "163641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163641", "title": "Sixth form", "text": "Sixth form\n\nIn the education systems of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and some other Commonwealth countries, sixth form (sometimes referred to as Key Stage 5) represents the final 1-3 years of secondary education (high school), where students (typically between 16 and 18 years of age) prepare for their A-level (or equivalent) examinations.\n\nThe term \"sixth form\" describes the school years numbered 12 and 13, which are called the \"Lower Sixth\" (L6) and \"Upper Sixth\" (U6) by many schools.\n\nThe term survives from an earlier system when the first five years of English secondary schooling were known as \"forms\" (which would originally have been long backless benches on which rows of pupils sat in the classroom). Pupils started their first year of secondary school in the \"first form\" or first year, and this was the academic year in which pupils would normally become 12 years of age. Pupils would move up a form each year before entering the fifth form in the academic year in which they would have their sixteenth birthday. Those who stayed on at school to study for A-levels moved up into the sixth form, which was divided into the Lower Sixth and the Upper Sixth. In some private schools, the term \"Middle Sixth\" was used in place of Upper Sixth, with the latter being used for those who stayed on for an extra term to take the entrance examinations that were previously set for candidates to Oxford or Cambridge universities. Other schools described these \"Oxbridge\" examination students as being in the \"Seventh Form\" or \"Third Year Sixth\".\n\nThe system was changed for the 1990–1991 academic year and school years are now numbered consecutively from primary school onwards. \"Year 1\" is the first year of primary school after Reception. The first year of secondary school (the old first form) is now known as \"Year 7\". The Lower Sixth is now Year 12 and the Upper Sixth is Year 13. However, the term \"Sixth Form\" has still been retained as a vestige of the old system and is used as a collective term for Years 12 and 13. Public (fee-charging) schools, along with some state schools, tend to use the old system of numbering.\n\nIn some parts of the country, special sixth form colleges were introduced beginning in a particularly important phase of student life. A large proportion of English secondary schools no longer have an integral sixth form. This is mainly related to reforms in the later 20th century, where different political areas became a factor in the introduction of colleges instead of the original sixth forms. There are now numerous sixth form colleges throughout England and Wales, and in areas without these, sixth form schools and specialist further education (FE) colleges called tertiary colleges may fill the same role.\n\nSixth form is not compulsory in England and Wales (although from 2013 onwards, people of sixth form age must remain in some form of education or training in England only, the school leaving age remains 16 in Wales); however, university entrance normally requires at least three A2-level qualifications and perhaps one AS-level. Students usually select three or four subjects from the GCSEs they have just taken, for one \"AS\" year, the AS exams being taken at the end of Lower Sixth. Three subjects are then carried into the A2 year (the dropped AS being \"cashed in\" as a qualification) and further exams are taken at the end of that year. The marks attained in both sets of exams are converted into UCAS points, which must meet the offer made by the student's chosen university.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the equivalent of Reception is \"P1\", and the equivalent of the English Year 1 \"P2\", while the first year of secondary school is known as \"Year 8\" or \"first year\" (rather than \"Year 7\" as in England), and following that Lower and Upper Sixth are Year 13 and Year 14 respectively.\n\nIn the Scottish education system, the final year of school is known as \"Sixth Year\" or \"S6\". During this year, students typically study Advanced Higher and/or Higher courses in a wide range of subjects, taking SQA exams at the end of both S5 and S6. Pupils in Scotland may leave once they have reached the age of 16; those who reach 16 before 30 September may leave after national examinations in May, whilst those who are 16 by the end of February may leave the previous Christmas.\n\nIt is not essential for candidates to do a sixth year if they wish to attend a Scottish university, as they have obtained adequate Higher grades in S5 they may apply and receive acceptance, but this is conditional on being successful in the examinations. However, the vast majority of Scottish students return for S6 if they plan to attend university. Some English universities will also accept Scottish students who have obtained adequate Higher grades in S5. It was announced in December 2008 that, as from 2010, UCAS will increase the number of points awarded to those who achieve Highers and Advanced Highers.\n\nIn some cases, particularly in independent schools, the term \"sixth form\" is also used for the last two years of secondary education. An increasing number of independent schools are offering their students the International Baccalaureate Programme.\n\nIn some secondary schools in Hong Kong, Jamaica, Barbados, Sierra Leone and Trinidad and Tobago, the sixth and seventh years are called Lower and Upper Sixth respectively. In India and Nepal, it is the \"+2\" part of the \"10+2\" educational system. \n\nIn 2009, Malaysia, which previously used \"Tingkatan Enam Bawah dan Atas\" (Lower and Upper Sixth), switched to \"Pra-Universiti 1\" (Pre-University 1, replacing Lower Sixth) and \"Pra-Universiti 2\" (Pre-University 2, replacing Upper Sixth) to reflect that the sixth and seventh years prepare students for university. Students prepare to sit the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia at the end of the years.\n\nSimilarly, the term \"sixth form\" is also used to define the final two years of education before entering university in Malta.\n\nIn Singapore, however, the equivalent of a sixth form college would be called a \"junior college\", where pupils take their Cambridge GCE A-levels after two years. Prior to the 1990s, these two years were known as \"Pre-University\" (Pre-U) 1 and 2.\n\nIn some college preparatory schools in the United States, such as The Hill School, Woodberry Forest School, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Kent School, Pomfret School, The Church Farm School, The Haverford School, Portsmouth Abbey School and more, \"sixth form\" refers to the final year of education prior to college. It is the equivalent of twelfth grade in the US education system.\n\nIn New Zealand, under the old system of Forms, Standards and Juniors, Sixth Form was the equivalent of Year 12 in today's system. Year 13 was known as Seventh Form. Australia also sometimes uses the term for Year 12, though the Australian Year 12 is equivalent to the NZ Year 13 / Seventh Form and the UK's Upper Sixth / Year 13.\n\nIn Brunei, sixth form comprises Year 12 and 13, which may also be referred to as Lower and Upper Six. At the end of the schooling, students sit for Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level. Students may also opt to take Advanced Subsidiary Level or AS Level halfway at the end of Lower Six or halfway through Upper Six. Sixth form is not compulsory, but a preferable choice for students wishing to continue in academic studies leading to university level.\n\n"}

It is an extension of the Logo programming language, a dialect of Lisp. Designed for education, StarLogo can be used by students to model the behavior of decentralized systems.\n\nThe first StarLogo ran on a Connection Machine 2 parallel computer. A subsequent version ran on Macintosh computers; this version became known later as MacStarLogo (and now is called MacStarLogo Classic). The current StarLogo is written in Java and works on most computers.\n\nStarLogo is also available in a version called OpenStarLogo. The source code for OpenStarLogo is available online, although the license under which it is released is not an open source license according to the Open Source Definition, because of restrictions on the commercial use of the code.\n\nStarLogo TNG (The Next Generation) version 1.0 was released in July 2008. It provides a 3D world using OpenGL graphics and a block-based graphical language to increase ease of use and learnability. It is written in C and Java. StarLogo TNG uses \"blocks\" to put together puzzle-like pieces. StarLogo TNG reads the blocks in the order you fit them together, and sets the program in the Spaceland view.\n\nStarLogo is a primary influence for the Kedama particle system, programmed by Yoshiki Oshima, found in the Etoys educational programming environment and language, which can be viewed as a Logo done originally in Squeak Smalltalk.\n\nThe latest version of StarLogo, StarLogo Nova, was released in beta form in the summer of 2014. StarLogo Nova takes the blocks language and 3D visualization engine of StarLogo TNG and brings them to the web browser. StarLogo Nova's execution engine is built on the Flash runtime and includes a purpose-built instancing rendering engine (using the Adobe Molehill 3D graphics API) capable of rendering tens of thousands of independently moving agents on current hardware. The programming area is built on ScriptBlocks, a Javascript-based blocks library. StarLogo Nova is currently under development by the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program, directed by Eric Klopfer, with lead designer/developer Daniel Wendel.\n\nStarLogo Nova introduces several notable design changes relative to TNG, particularly with the introduction of a \"World\" agent, reminiscent of StarLogo 2.2's \"Observer.\" In StarLogo Nova, any command can be run by any agent, but each \"breed\" has its own program and can have its own set of breed-specific \"traits.\" This brings StarLogo Nova closer to an object-oriented design, in an effort to improve the ease with which students can transfer skills in StarLogo Nova to other, more mainstream languages. Other changes include the use of embedded arguments for blocks (similar to Scratch), WYSIWYG editing of the simulation interface, and splitting the collision primitive into its component halves, with each breed having collision code on its own program page.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "758034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=758034", "title": "Water rocket", "text": "Water rocket\n\nA water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. Like all rocket engines, it operates on the principle of Newton's third law of motion. Water rocket hobbyists typically use one or more plastic soft drink bottle as the rocket's pressure vessel. A variety of designs are possible including multi-stage rockets. Water rockets are also custom-built from composite materials to achieve world record altitudes.\n\nThe bottle is partly filled with water and sealed. The bottle is then pressurized with a gas, usually air compressed from a bicycle pump, air compressor, or cylinder up to 125 psi, but sometimes CO or nitrogen from a cylinder.\n\nWater and gas are used in combination, with the gas providing a means to store energy, as it is compressible, and the water increasing the propellant mass fraction and providing greater force when ejected from the rocket's nozzle. Sometimes additives are combined with the water to enhance performance in different ways. For example: salt can be added to increase the density of the reaction mass resulting in a higher specific impulse. Soap is also sometimes used to create a dense foam in the rocket which lowers the density of the expelled reaction mass but increases the duration of thrust.\n\nThe seal on the nozzle of the rocket is then released and rapid expulsion of water occurs at high speeds until the propellant has been used up and the air pressure inside the rocket drops to atmospheric pressure. There is a net force created on the rocket in accordance with Newton's third law. The expulsion of the water thus can cause the rocket to leap a considerable distance into the air.\n\nIn addition to aerodynamic considerations, altitude and flight duration are dependent upon the volume of water, the initial pressure, the rocket nozzle's size, and the unloaded weight of the rocket. The relationship between these factors is complex and several simulators have been written to explore these and other factors.\n\nOften the pressure vessel is built from one or more used plastic soft drink bottles, but polycarbonate fluorescent tube covers, plastic pipes, and other light-weight pressure-resistant cylindrical vessels have also been used.\n\nTypically a single polyethylene terephthalate (PET) carbonated soft drink bottle serves as the pressure vessel. Multi-bottle rockets are created by joining two or more bottles in any of several different ways; bottles can be connected via their nozzles, by cutting them apart and sliding the sections over each other, or by connecting them opening to bottom, making a chain to increase volume. This adds complexity and the increased volume leads to increased weight - but this should be offset by an increase in the duration of the thrust of the rocket.\n\nMulti-stage rockets are much more complicated. They involve two or more rockets stacked on top of each other, designed to launch while in the air, much like the multi-stage rockets that are used to send payloads into space.\n\nSeveral methods for pressurizing a water rocket are used including:\n\nWater rocket nozzles differ from conventional combustion rocket nozzles in that they do not have a divergent section such as in a De Laval nozzle. Because water is essentially incompressible the divergent section does not contribute to efficiency and actually can make performance worse.\n\nThere are two main classes of water rocket nozzles:\n\n\nThe size of the nozzle affects the thrust produced by the rocket. Larger diameter nozzles provide faster acceleration with a shorter thrust phase, while smaller nozzles provide lower acceleration with a longer thrust phase.\n\nAs the propellant level in the rocket goes down, the center of mass initially moves downwards before finally moving upwards again as the propellant is depleted. This initial movement reduces stability and can cause water rockets to start tumbling end over end, greatly decreasing the maximum speed and thus the length of glide (time that the rocket is flying under its own momentum).\n\nTo lower the center of pressure and add stability, fins or other stabilizers can be added which bring the center of drag further back, well behind the center of mass at all times. Stabilizers of any sort are normally placed near the back of the bottle where the center of mass is found. The increase in stability which well-designed fins give is worth the extra drag, and helps to maximize the height to which the rocket will fly.\n\nStabilizing fins cause the rocket to fly nose-first which will give significantly higher speed, but they will also cause it to fall with a significantly higher velocity than it would if it tumbled to the ground, and this may damage the rocket or whomever or whatever it strikes upon landing.\n\nSome water rockets have parachute or other recovery system to help prevent problems. However these systems can suffer from malfunctions. This is often taken into account when designing rockets. Rubber bumpers, Crumple zones, and safe launch practices can be utilized to minimize damage or injury caused by a falling rocket.\n\nAnother possible recovery system involves simply using the rocket's fins to slow its descent and is sometimes called \"backward sliding\". By increasing fin size, more drag is generated. If the center of mass is placed forward of the fins, the rocket will nose dive. In the case of super-roc or back-gliding rockets, the rocket is designed such that the relationship between center of gravity and the center of pressure of the empty rocket causes the fin-induced tendency of the rocket to tip nose down to be counteracted by the air resistance of the long body which would cause it to fall tail down, and resulting in the rocket falling sideways, slowly.\n\nSome water rocket launchers use launch tubes. A launch tube fits inside the nozzle of the rocket and extends upward toward the nose. The launch tube is anchored to the ground. As the rocket begins accelerating upward, the launch tube blocks the nozzle, and very little water is ejected until the rocket leaves the launch tube. This allows almost perfectly efficient conversion of the potential energy in the compressed air to kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the rocket and water. The high efficiency during the initial phase of the launch is important, because rocket engines are least efficient at low speeds. A launch tube therefore significantly increases the speed and height attained by the rocket. Launch tubes are most effective when used with long rockets, which can accommodate long launch tubes.\n\nThe Water Rocket Achievement World Record Association is a worldwide association which administrates competitions for altitude records involving single-stage and multiple-stage water rockets, a flight duration competition, and speed or distance competitions for water rocket–powered cars.\n\nMany local competitions of various sorts are held, including:\n\n\nThe Guinness World Record of launching most water rockets is held by Kung Yik She Secondary School when on 7 December 2013, they launched 1056 of them at the same time, together with primary school students in Tin Shui Wai, Hong Kong.\n\nThe current record for greatest altitude achieved by a water and air propelled rocket is 2723 feet (830 meters), held by the University of Cape Town, achieved on 26 August 2015, exceeding the previous 2007 record of 2044 feet (623 meters) held by US Water Rockets. The rocket also carried a video camera as payload as part of the verification required by the competition rules.\n\nA steam rocket, or \"hot water rocket\", is a rocket that uses water held in a pressure vessel at a high temperature, and which generates thrust through this being released as steam through a rocket nozzle.\n\n\n\n"}
