{"id": "54885332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54885332", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", "text": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (born October 13, 1989), sometimes referred to by her initials AOC, is an American politician and educator. She is the U.S. Representative-elect for New York's 14th congressional district, elected on November 6, 2018. \n\nOn June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez won the Democratic primary in New York's 14th congressional district covering parts of the Bronx and Queens in New York City, defeating the incumbent Congressman, Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, in what was described as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election primaries. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nWhen she takes office on January 3, 2019, at 29, Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest woman to serve in Congress in the history of the United States. That distinction was previously held by New York Republican Elise Stefanik, who was elected at age 30 in 2014, until it was claimed by Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer (who turns 30 just before being sworn in), also elected at 29.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was born in The Bronx, New York City, on October 13, 1989, to Blanca Ocasio-Cortez () and Sergio Ocasio. Her father, an architect of Puerto Rican descent, was born in the Bronx, while her mother was born in Puerto Rico. Until age five, Ocasio-Cortez lived with her family in an apartment in the neighborhood of Parkchester. The family then moved to a house in Yorktown Heights, a suburb in Westchester County. Growing up, Ocasio-Cortez regularly visited her extended family in the Bronx.\n\nOcasio-Cortez attended Yorktown High School, graduating in 2007, where she won second prize in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair with a microbiology research project on the effect of antioxidants on \"C. elegans\"' lifespan. As a result, the International Astronomical Union named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez. In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. She later became the LDZ Secretary of State while she attended Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship. In 2008, while Ocasio-Cortez was a sophomore at Boston University, her father died of lung cancer. During college, she was an intern in the immigration office of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. She graduated \"cum laude\" from Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in international relations and a minor in economics.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has described her background as working-class, and relates many of her political positions to it. When her father died intestate of lung cancer in 2008, she became involved in a long probate battle to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn \"firsthand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy\".\n\nAfter college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx, while she worked as a bartender in Manhattan and as a waitress in a taqueria. Her mother, meanwhile, cleaned houses and drove school buses. After her father's death, Ocasio-Cortez and her mother struggled to fight foreclosure of their home. With financial backing from Sunshine Bronx Business Incubator, she established a publishing firm, Brook Avenue Press, which specializes in children's literature that portrays the Bronx in a positive light. She worked as lead educational strategist at GAGEis, Inc. Ocasio-Cortez was also an educator at the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute, in which role she served as the Educational Director of the 2017 Northeast Collegiate World Series, where she participated in a panel on Latino leadership.\n\nIn the 2016 primary, Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign. After the general election, she traveled across America by car, visiting places such as Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock, and speaking to people affected by the human rights violations related to the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline. In an interview she recalled her visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that before that, she had felt that the only way to effectively run for office was if you had access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\", inspired her to begin to work for her own community.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was among a slate of nationwide Justice Democrats/Brand New Congress candidacy announcements livestreamed on May 16, 2017. In August 2017, she attended the Netroots Nation Conference in Atlanta, appearing on a panel with fellow candidates on \"how to run a grassroots campaign that puts people above party\".<ref name=\"Netroots Nation Aug. 2017/C-SPAN\"></ref>\nOcasio-Cortez was the first person since 2004 to challenge the Democratic Caucus Chair, Joe Crowley, in the Democratic primary. She faced a significant financial disadvantage, but said, \"You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game.\" Nearly 75% of her donations were small individual contributions, while less than one percent of Crowley's contributions were. The Ocasio-Cortez campaign spent to the Crowley campaign's .\nOcasio-Cortez has not previously held elected office, and her campaign video began with her saying \"Women like me aren't supposed to run for office.\"\n\nOn June 15, the candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, \"Inside City Hall\". The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate. On June 18, a debate in the Bronx was scheduled, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was endorsed by progressive and civil rights organizations such as MoveOn, Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Black Lives Matter, and Democracy for America, and by gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, who, like Ocasio-Cortez, also challenged a longtime incumbent, Andrew Cuomo, in the 2018 New York gubernatorial election.\n\nGovernor Cuomo endorsed Crowley, as did both of New York's U.S. Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, 11 U.S. Representatives, 31 local elected officials, 31 trade unions, and progressive groups such as the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood, the Working Families Party, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, among others. California representative Ro Khanna, like Ocasio-Cortez a Justice Democrat, initially endorsed Crowley, later also endorsing Ocasio-Cortez in an unusual dual endorsement.\n\nFollowing her win, Ocasio-Cortez explained her campaign strategy:\n\nI knew that if we were going to win, the way that progressives win on an unapologetic message is by expanding the electorate. That's the only way that we can win strategically. It's not by rushing to the center. It's not by trying to win spending all of our energy winning over those who have other opinions. It's by expanding the electorate, speaking to those that feel disenchanted, dejected, cynical about our politics, and letting them know that we're fighting for them.\n\nOn June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez received 57.13% of the vote (15,897) to Joe Crowley's 42.5% (11,761), defeating the 10-term incumbent by almost 15 percentage points. \"Time\" called her victory \"the biggest upset of the 2018 elections so far\"; CNN made a similar statement. \"The New York Times\" described Crowley's loss as \"a shocking primary defeat on Tuesday, the most significant loss for a Democratic incumbent in more than a decade, and one that will reverberate across the party and the country\". \"The Guardian\" called it \"one of the biggest upsets in recent American political history\". Her victory was especially surprising as she was outspent 18–1. Merriam-Webster reported that searches for the word \"socialism\" spiked 1,500% after her victory. In a sign of her outsider status, as of 11p.m. on election day Crowley had not phoned Ocasio-Cortez; she believed he did not have her phone number and stated that she did not have his. Earlier in the evening, however, Crowley, an amateur guitarist, had played a cover of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born to Run\" at his election night watch party by way of conceding defeat, having dedicated it to Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBernie Sanders congratulated her, saying, \"She took on the entire local Democratic establishment in her district and won a very strong victory. She demonstrated once again what progressive grassroots politics can do.\" Noam Chomsky saw her victory as \"a quite spectacular and significant event\". He believes her win shows a split in the Democratic Party and he thinks that \"she was right in saying that the policies she's outlined should have broad appeal to a very large segment of the population.\"\n\nAt 28 years old, Ocasio-Cortez was one of the youngest nominees for Congress.\n\nSeveral commentators noted the similarities between Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley and Dave Brat's 2014 victory over Eric Cantor in the Republican primary for Virginia's 7th congressional district. Like Crowley, Cantor was a high-ranking member in his party's caucus. After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed several progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents nationwide, leveraging her fame and spending her political capital in a manner not usually seen even in unexpected primary winners.\n\nWithout campaigning for it, Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party primary as a write-in candidate in a neighboring congressional district, New York's 15th, albeit with a total vote count of nine. She said she appreciated the show of support, but would decline the nomination.\n\nMany journalists faulted the traditional national news media (with a few exceptions such as CBSN) for not identifying, or even recognizing, the newsworthiness of Ocasio-Cortez's campaign. Brian Stelter wrote that progressive media outlets such as \"The Young Turks\" and \"The Intercept\" \"saw the Ocasio-Cortez upset coming\". Margaret Sullivan said that traditional metrics of measuring a campaign's viability, like total fundraising, were contributing to a \"media failure\". Ocasio-Cortez was barely mentioned in print-media coverage until her primary election win.\n\nAfter her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez quickly garnered nationwide media attention, including numerous articles and TV talk-show appearances. She appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The View\" in the first few days after the primary and later on \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\". \n\nOcasio-Cortez also drew a great deal of media attention when she and Bernie Sanders campaigned for James Thompson in Kansas in July 2018. A rally in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a capacity of 1,500 when far more people said they would attend. The event drew 4,000 people, with some seated on the floor. In \"The New Yorker\" Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remains \"the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope.\" Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez has made Sanders's task easier as he can point to her success to show that ideas \"once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream\".\n\nOcasio-Cortez received backlash after barring members of the media from attending her \"listening tour\" on August 8 in the Bronx and August 12 in Corona, Queens.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has been the subject of negative press coverage from right-leaning media outlets since her Democratic primary win in June 2018. Some news outlets, such as Fox News and the Washington Examiner, were criticized for their coverage that mocked Ocasio-Cortez's outfit choices. In July 2018, conservative news outlet CRTV published a doctored video that featured footage of Ocasio-Cortez from a previous interview with PBS, spliced to appear as answers to questions read by CRTV commentator Allie Stuckey. CRTV later added a discaimer that labeled the video as \"satire\" as well as providing a link to the original PBS interview.\n\nOcasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election. Pappas, who lives in Astoria, is an economics professor at St. John's University. According to the \"New York Post\", Pappas did not actively campaign. The \"Post\" wrote that \"Pappas' bid was a long shot,\" since the 14th has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29 and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost six to one. Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former President Barack Obama and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nCrowley also remained on the ballot, as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP). Neither Crowley nor the party actively campaigned, with both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after her Democratic primary victory. On July 17, former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who himself won reelection on a third-party line after losing the Democratic Primary in 2006, expressed hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line in a column in the \"Wall Street Journal\". Dan Cantor, Executive Director of the WFP, wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the \"New York Daily News\", and called on voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.\n\nIn August 2018, Ocasio-Cortez spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in New Orleans. \n\nOcasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (100,044) to Pappas's 13.8% (17,762). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up at least 39 seats. \n\nAfter the election, Ocasio-Cortez chose Justice Democrats co-founder Saikat Chakrabarti as her chief of staff.\n\nOn the first day of congressional orientation, Ocasio-Cortez participated in a climate change protest outside the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Ocasio-Cortez backs Pelosi for Speaker of the House once the Democratic Party reclaims the majority in 2019, under the condition that she \"remains the most progressive candidate for speaker.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a self-described democratic socialist. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. She supports progressive policies such as Medicare for All, a job guarantee, tuition-free public college, ending the privatization of prisons, and enacting gun-control policies.\n\nOcasio-Cortez campaigned in favor of tuition-free universities and public schools, saying that \"[f]or the cost of the GOP's tax bill, we could forgive ALL the student loan debt in the United States.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a self-described hardliner on environmental issues, calling climate change the \"single biggest national security threat\" facing the United States. She advocates for the United States to transition by 2035 to an electrical grid running on 100% renewable-energy production and end the use of fossil fuels. She also calls for a Green New Deal in the United States, in which the federal government would invest in the construction of large-scale green-infrastructure projects.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has proposed \"a select committee in the House to draft a plan that fits the proposal’s standards\". Outlined in a draft resolution on her website, the proposal would mean \"using nothing but renewable energy for electricity generation\" and transitioning to renewable sources of energy \"within 10 years of passing Green New Deal legislation\", but does not provide details about how the US would move away from non-renewable power sources. It would also roll out a nationwide “smart” electrical grid and \"mass energy-efficient building upgrades\". Twelve Democrats in the new Congress have supported this resolution: Representatives Jared Huffman, Ro Khanna, John Lewis, Carolyn Maloney, Jose Serrano, Earl Blumenauer, Deb Haaland, Joe Neguse, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib. Frank Pallone does not believe the committee should have legislative authority.\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system, calling healthcare a human right. She says that a single government insurer should ensure that every American has insurance, while reducing costs overall. On her campaign website, Ocasio-Cortez says \"Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare. It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports a \"path to citizenship\" for immigrants who entered the United States legally and illegally. She supports abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), calling it \"a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation\" and \"an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day\". She later clarified that this does not mean abolishing deportations. She has called immigration detention centers operated by the Department of Homeland Security \"black sites\", citing limited public access to those locations. Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas.\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports federal legalization of marijuana, banning private prisons and detention centers, releasing all nonviolent drug offenders, ending cash bail, and automatic, independent investigations whenever someone is killed by a police officer.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has called for public financing of elections and a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United v. FEC, Buckley v. Valeo, and Speechnow v. FEC. She also supports the replacement of the Electoral College with a National Popular Vote.\n\nOn June 28, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN she would support the impeachment of President Trump, saying, \"I think that, you know, we have the grounds to do it.\" She cited Trump's alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause.\n\nAfter 60 Palestinian protesters participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests were killed on May 14, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force, tweeting, \"This is a massacre. I hope my peers have the moral courage to call it such. No state or entity is absolved of mass shootings of protesters. There is no justification. Palestinian people deserve basic human dignity, as anyone else. Democrats can't be silent about this anymore.\" In a subsequent interview, she said, \"The idea that we are not supposed to talk about people dying when they are engaging in political expression just really moved me\", and said that many constituents, including Jewish Americans, had thanked her for taking that position. In an interview with the PBS series \"Firing Line\", Ocasio-Cortez clarified that she is \"a proponent of a two-state solution\".\n\nAfter her primary victory, J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami expressed his support for \"a new generation of candidates who are more outspoken about their opposition to the policies of Netanyahu's far-right coalition and are eager to see the US play a more constructive role in making life better for both Israelis and Palestinians\".\n\nOcasio-Cortez calls for \"solidarity with Puerto Rico\". She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification. She also advocates for both voting rights and disaster relief. Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status. She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is supportive of the LGBT community, thanking its members for their role in her grassroots campaign. She spoke at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2017.\n\nIn mid-November 2018, Ocasio-Cortez came out against the selection of Long Island City in Queens as one of the two locations for Amazon HQ2. She expressed concern that Amazon would receive tax breaks while critical infrastructure, such as the New York City Subway was deteriorating and the city's public-school and health-care systems were underfunded. Ocasio-Cortez has also raised concerns about the affordability of housing in Queens, since housing prices around the HQ2 campus would rise as a result of the campus's construction.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after Ocasio-Cortez when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Ocasio-Cortez was named the 2017 National Hispanic Institute Person of the Year by Ernesto Nieto.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has family in Puerto Rico, where her grandfather lived in a nursing home before dying as a result of Hurricane Maria. After Ocasio-Cortez's father's death in 2008, her mother and grandmother relocated to Florida due to financial hardship. She described her Catholic faith and its impact on her life and her campaign for criminal justice reform in an article in \"America\", the magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States.\n\nDuring the 2018 election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez resided in a one-bedroom apartment in Parkchester, Bronx, with her boyfriend, Riley Roberts. They met at Boston University.\n\n"}

They remained an informal group, but their growth paralleled the growth of children's museums throughout the world. In addition to organizing museums and administration of grants to museums, the Association partners with other organizations, including the \"Eunice Kennedy Shriver\" National Institute of Child Health and Human Development on health issues related to children.\n\nThe Association of Children's Museums initiated the Great Friend to Kids Award in 1991, to honor individuals who have made outstanding contributions toward strengthening education for children.

{"id": "10806718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10806718", "title": "Data sharing", "text": "Data sharing\n\nData sharing is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Replication has a long history in science. The motto of The Royal Society is 'Nullius in verba', translated \"Take no man's word for it.\" Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the scientific method.\n\nA number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of peer-reviewed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or reproduce published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes.\n\nData and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on data archiving. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the history of science made possible by technological advances in communications and information technology. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative.\n\nDespite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it. When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.\n\nData sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform.\n\nOn August 9, 2007, President Bush signed the America COMPETES Act (or the \"America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act\") requiring civilian federal agencies to provide guidelines, policy and procedures, to facilitate and optimize the open exchange of data and research between agencies, the public and policymakers. See Section 1009.\n\nThe NIH Final Statement of Sharing of Research Data says:\nAllegations of misconduct in medical research carry severe consequences. The United States Department of Health and Human Services established an office to oversee investigations of allegations of misconduct, including data withholding. The website defines the mission:\n\nSome research organizations feel particularly strongly about data sharing. Stanford University's WaveLab has a philosophy about reproducible research and disclosing all algorithms and source code necessary to reproduce the research. In a paper titled \"WaveLab and Reproducible Research,\" the authors describe some of the problems they encountered in trying to reproduce their own research after a period of time. In many cases, it was so difficult they gave up the effort. These experiences are what convinced them of the importance of disclosing source code. The philosophy is described:\n\nThe Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) and Data Conservancy are projects supported by the National Science Foundation to encourage and facilitate data sharing among research scientists and better support meta-analysis. In environmental sciences, the research community is recognizing that major scientific advances involving integration of knowledge in and across fields will require that researchers overcome not only the technological barriers to data sharing but also the historically entrenched institutional and sociological barriers. Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging has stated, \"the old model in which researchers jealously guarded their data is no longer applicable\".\n\nThe Alliance for Taxpayer Access is a group of organizations that support open access to government sponsored research. The group has expressed a \"Statement of Principles\" explaining why they believe open access is important. They also list a number of international public access policies. This is no more so than in timely communication of essential information to effectively respond to health emergencies. While public domain archives have been embraced for depositing data, mainly post formal publication, they have failed to encourage rapid data sharing during health emergencies, among them the Ebola and Zika, outbreaks. More clearly defined principles are required to recognize the interests of those generating the data while permitting free, unencumbered access to and use of the data (pre-publication) for research and practical application, such as those adopted by the GISAID Initiative to counter emergent threats from influenza.\n\n\nWithholding of data has become so commonplace in academic genetics that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital published a journal article on the subject. The study found that \"Because they were denied access to data, 28% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research.\"\n\nIn a 2006 study, it was observed that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period. In a follow up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%).\n\nA 2018 study reported on study of a random sample of 48 articles published during February–May 2017 in the \"Journal of Archaeological Science\" which found openly available raw data for 18 papers (53%), with compositional and dating data being the most frequently shared types. The same study also emailed authors of articles on experiments with stone artifacts that were published during 2009 and 2015 to request data relating to the publications. They contacted the authors of 23 articles and received 15 replies, resulting in a 70% response rate. They received five responses that included data files, giving an overall sharing rate of 20%.\n\nA study of scientists in training indicated many had already experienced data withholding. This study has given rise to the fear the future generation of scientists will not abide by the established practices.\n\nRequirements for data sharing are more commonly imposed by institutions, funding agencies, and publication venues in the medical and biological sciences than in the physical sciences. Requirements vary widely regarding whether data must be shared at all, with whom the data must be shared, and who must bear the expense of data sharing.\n\nFunding agencies such as the NIH and NSF tend to require greater sharing of data, but even these requirements tend to acknowledge the concerns of patient confidentiality, costs incurred in sharing data, and the legitimacy of the request. Private interests and public agencies with national security interests (defense and law enforcement) often discourage sharing of data and methods through non-disclosure agreements.\n\nData sharing poses specific challenges in participatory monitoring initiatives, for example where forest communities collect data on local social and environmental conditions. In this case, a rights-based approach to the development of data-sharing protocols can be based on principles of free, prior and informed consent, and prioritise the protection of the rights of those who generated the data, and/or those potentially affected by data-sharing.\n\n\n — discusses the international exchange of data in the natural sciences.\n\n"}

In this approach the evaluation specifically focuses on the effectiveness of the constructive alignment in the course (subject, paper, unit) design. It was developed for use in the higher education sector but has relevance in training environments also, and may be broadly applicable in any educational environment.\n\nDFE was developed by Calvin Smith, an educational researcher in Australia, to address the fact that most evaluation systems involve a focus on either inputs (the quality of the teaching, the quality of the resources, etc.) or outputs/outcomes (e.g. learning outcomes). Where both inputs and outcomes are included in an approach the items are separate (e.g. The Course Experience Questionnaire (Ramsden 1991) which has scales on inputs and a scale on generic skill development as outcomes). There was at the time no approach that focused on the \"alignment\" of the learning activities and the learning objectives.\n\nDFE is primarily to be used to gather students' perceptions of the efficacy of the alignment (of teaching and learning activities with learning objectives) in the design of a course or unit of study (or part thereof). The reason for doing this is that it is considered a high-quality design practice that learning activities and learning objectives are aligned (Biggs and Tang 2007). Therefore, 'efficacy' here means 'the degree to which the teaching and learning activities \"supported the development of\" the learning outcomes'.\n\nDFE is a survey-based approach to gathering evaluative data, therefore it generates quantitative data. The approach relies heavily on the way items are written for the surveys used. There is a clear articulation of how items can be written for the DFE approach in Smith (2008). In short, each question is composed in two parts conjoined by a grammatical structure that does the work of '...helped me to learn...'. The first part of the question indexes the teaching and learning activity (e.g. 'the lab session on dissection...') and the second part indexes the learning objective ('...how to dissect the human torso.').\n\nOne sophistication in this process is that on both sides of the item structure there can be varying degrees of specificity-generality (or granularity). Compare the following three items all of which are stable on the right hand side, but vary on the left hand side:\n\n\nThese items become increasingly granular, or more specific, moving from reference to all the lectures right down to a specific lecture session. The same issue of degrees of granularity/specificity can apply on the learning objective side of the item construction. Consider the following three items:\n\n\nAgain, the degree of specificity increases with each step.\n\nThis ability means the DFE approach is extremely flexible and allows the course designer to target specific aspects of the course design. This allows a more strategic approach to evaluation design, and allows for the selective and high-leverage use of the limited 'real estate' in any survey instrument.\n\nA further observation about the scope of each side of a DFE item is that, as well as being more or less generic or specific, it can make an \"implicit\" reference to the teaching and learning activities or the learning objectives (respectively). An example of this is when reference is made to 'the course' or 'learning'. Consider the following: 'the course helped me to learn'. In this case the reference to the course is an implicit reference to all of the teaching and learning activities the student experienced. Similarly, the reference to 'learning' in this case implies all of the learning objectives in the course. In one sense implicit references to either the learning objectives or the teaching and learning activities is the most generic level of reference, but a distinction is made in DFE between generic or general references to either TLAs or LOBs and implicit references.\n\nWith these three categories a cross-tabulation of the combinations of left-hand- and right-hand-side components of DFE items can be devised. This is useful in helping novice DFE survey designers develop items (Table 1).\n\nTable 1 - Nine combinations of specific-generic-implicit\nIn the table S=Specific G=Generic I=Implicit\n\nSome examples of follow:\n\n"}

The EPGY programs included distance and residential summer courses for students of all ages. Many of the courses were distance learning, meaning that courses were taught remotely via the Internet, rather than in the traditional classroom setting. Courses targeted students from elementary school up to advanced college graduate. Subjects offered included: Mathematics, English, Humanities, Physics, and Computer Science. Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies is similar to the Center for Talented Youth at the Johns Hopkins University in terms of certain objectives. The EPGY courses themselves were offered by a number of institutions including Stanford and Johns Hopkins.\n\nIn 2015, the EPGY was separated from Stanford University as its own entity known as GiftedandTalented.com.\n\nAs of July 1, 2018, the service was discontinued.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Stanford professors Patrick Suppes and Richard C. Atkinson began researching whether computers could be effectively used in schools to teach math and reading to children. At the time, their area of research was known as \"computer-aided education\". Atkinson eventually left to pursue a career as an administrator (he would retire as President of the University of California), but Suppes stayed. Later Suppes extended his research to college-level material, and computer-based courses in Logic and Set Theory were offered to Stanford undergraduates from 1972 to 1992.\n\nIn 1985, Suppes received a \"proof of concept\" grant from the National Science Foundation to develop a computerized first-year calculus course with the initial objective of making it available to students in their last year of high school who were at schools that did not otherwise offer calculus. Suppes, together with a team that included Raymond Ravaglia, the former Executive Director of EPGY, began work on the course in earnest in 1987. When the course was ready for testing in 1990, the focus was turned to younger students who had been accelerated in their mathematics educations. For the summer of 1990, approximately 40 junior high and high school students with some knowledge of algebra were selected for a five-week instructor-taught accelerated precalculus course at Foothill College. Of those students, thirteen located at seven local schools were invited to take the computer-based calculus course during the subsequent school year, 1990-91. All thirteen took the Advanced Placement AB Calculus examination in May 1991. Six students scored 5, six scored 4, and one scored 3.\n\nFollowing this initial success, computer-based courses in Beginning Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus were created to replace the accelerated summer course. These courses were tested during the 1991–92 academic year with a new group of students. At the same time, the calculus course was expanded to include the material necessary for the BC examination. That year four students took the BC examination, with all scoring 5.\n\nAfter porting the software to the Windows operating system, the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies, then known as the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), was formally launched at Stanford University in fall 1992, making these courses generally available.\n\nIn Fall 2000, the idea emerged of creating academic camps that would provide opportunities for enrichment that complement the opportunities for acceleration in the standard curriculum offered through online courses. The following year, the Summer Institute in Math and Physics (SIMP) was launched with courses in the Theory of Relativity taught by Gary Oas and Real Analysis taught by Marc Sanders. Building on the success of this first year, it expanded to 170 students in the second year. In addition to courses in math and physics, courses in computer programming and writing (including creative writing taught by a recipient of Stanford's very competitive Wallace Stegner Fellowship for emerging writers) were added to the offerings of the program, which was renamed the Summer Institutes. Originally only for high school students, the Summer Institutes added a middle school program in 2005.\n\nIn April 2006, Stanford received a substantial and generous gift from the Malone Family Foundation of Englewood, Colorado. The donation went to forming an online high school independent of EPGY's regular distance learning courses. Its formal name is the Stanford University Online High School, but is often referred to as Stanford OHS, or simply OHS.\n\nIn 2013, EPGY individualized online courses became offered through Redbird Advanced Learning.\n\nIn 2016, Redbird Advanced Learning, formerly EPGY, was acquired by McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nIn 2018, the EPGY known at the time as GiftedAndTalented.com was closed and the courseware was discontinued.\n\nThe Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program currently hosts several residential summer programs for high school students ages 14–17, including the Summer Institutes, the Summer Humanities Institute, the Stanford University Mathematics Camp, the Stanford Medical Youth Science program, and the Summer Arts Institute.\n\nStanford Pre-Collegiate Studies Summer Institutes are three-week residential programs for academically talented and motivated high school students. The Summer Institutes provide an opportunity for these students to enrich and accelerate their academic pursuits and to meet others who share their interests and abilities. Past Summer Institutes participants have come from over 80 countries and all 50 states.\n\nSummer Institutes participants live in supervised Stanford housing and are taught by Stanford instructors. Students engage in intensive study in a single course, and they are introduced to topics not typically presented at the high-school level. The Summer Institutes provide a taste of college life in the beautiful surroundings of the Stanford campus.\n\nSummer Institutes subject areas include mathematics, science, writing, humanities, computer science, engineering and business. The instructors are assisted by undergraduate and graduate student mentors who have expertise in the course subject areas. These mentors serve a dual role of Residential Counselor and Teaching Assistant so that the academic and social aspects of the program are tightly integrated.\n\nThe Summer Humanities Institute is a three-week residential program for rising juniors and seniors interested in the humanities. Led by Stanford professors, the Summer Humanities Institute offers intensive courses in history, philosophy, and literature.\n\nThe Summer Institute hires undergraduates, recent graduates, and graduate students to work during each summer as counselors and teaching assistants. Residential Counselors (RCs) are selected for their ability to work with young people in a residential setting, and for their academic qualifications. This arrangement allows for the social and academic portions of the program to be tightly integrated.\n\n"}

The system begins in pre-school, continues in elementary school (1st-9th grade), secondary school (10th or 12th grade), then the university years (licentiate, master and doctorate). The public education in Honduras also coexist with private schools and universities.\n\nEducation in Honduras is free and compulsory for nine years. In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 97.3 percent and the net primary enrollment rate was 85.7 percent. Among working children, an estimated 34 percent complete primary school. A lack of schools prevents many children in Honduras from receiving an education, as do costs such as enrollment fees, school uniforms, and transportation costs.\n\nUntil the late 1960s, Honduras lacked a national education system. Before the reforms of 1957, education was the exclusive privilege of the upper class, who could afford to send their children to private institutions. It was only when the government of Ramón Villeda Morales (1957–63) introduced reforms that led to the establishment of a national public education system and began a school construction program, that education became accessible to the general population.\n\nThe secondary school is divided in two versace sections, common cycle, which are the first three years (7th-9th grade), and diversified cycle, commonly a bachelor's degree (10th-12th or 13th grade), accountant or technician careers.\n\nThe National Autonomous University of Honduras is the public university in Honduras. It has campuses in the most important cities of Honduras.\n\nIn 1998, Hurricane Mitch damaged more than 3,000 schools nationwide. The poor quality of education and the lack of vocational education are other education concerns.\n\nThere was no proper educational system before the 1950s. The education reforms of the 1950s meant that by 1957, schools were no longer available to the wealthy, but costs are a problem to this day.\n\n"}

De Long's father and younger sister were semi-invalids, so de Long became a caregiver for her family at an early age. Her family moved with her to Northampton, Massachusetts, when de Long started attending Smith College in 1897, so that she would still be able to care for them. While a student, de Long had to take out loans, work as a tutor, and teach at the Easthampton High School.

In 1905, she moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where she taught English at the Manual Training High School for five years.\n\nDe Long was invited by May Stone and Katherine Pettit to become the principal of the Women's Christian Temperance Union Settlement School in Hindman, Kentucky, later to become the Hindman Settlement School. In 1912, de Long joined Pettit in leaving Hindman to establish the Pine Mountain Settlement School.\n\nIn the division of labor determined by Pettit and de Long, de Long was responsible for the academic and industrial departments and supervised the fiscal and administrative work of the school.\n\nAmong her many contributions to the school, de Long assisted with the physical design of the school and was a skilled fundraiser. In 1913, de Long enlisted the help of the architect Mary Rockwell Hook to create a master plan for the new school. De Long's network of women she had met while at Smith College also proved a useful base for fundraising and for hiring workers for the school. She traveled all over the country, giving talks at schools and organizations to raise money for the school.\n\nIn April 1918, de Long married Luigi Zande, an Italian stonemason who had been working at Pine Mountain. Zande built a cottage at the school for them to live in, which came to be known as the Zande House and is still in use at Pine Mountain.\n\nThe Zandes had two children: Alberto, born in Louisville, Kentucky on March 19, 1919; and Elena, born on December 28, 1922, who was adopted.\n\nDe Long died on March 18, 1928, of breast cancer.

The HTAV was founded by a group of teachers and was incorporated in Melbourne in 1980. , has over 700 members and 11 members of staff.\n\nThe association has two ongoing publications. \"The Bulletin\", a newsletter, published eight times a year, and \"Agora\", the quarterly journal. Both publications provide members with information relevant to the teaching of history.\n\nThe History Teachers’ Association of Victoria was incorporated as a legal entity in November 1980. Like any historical development this date, at first glance, appears somewhat arbitrary. It neglects the longer pre-history of causation and origin and tells little about the nature of the organisation.\n\nThis prehistory was long, dating back to the 1950s and the foundation of the Victorian Historical Association. It was during this rather lengthy period of evolution between the 1950s and 1980 that the aims, character and activities that form the modern HTAV were defined. Even the most cursory of glances highlights the continuities of this history.\n\nThe aims of the Victorian Historical Association were articulated clearly in its first Bulletin, published in October 1959, when the association was at least eight years old. This document proclaimed that 'This association of school and university history teachers is concerned to provide history teachers with a forum in which they can discuss professional matters. To this end it holds a number of meetings throughout the school year, sponsors lectures, discussions, film nights and displays.'\n\nAgora, the association’s journal, first appeared nearly a decade later. As if dropping from some point in the future, perhaps the 1980s, maybe the 1990s or could it be last week, the opening sentence declared 'Whether we like it or not History as a subject in the schools appears to be under attack. But why?...' This 1967 statement certainly suggests continuity over time. In addition to the editorial which has been quoted, this first issue contained articles by Wes Blackmore, then the Senior History Master at Yarra Valley Church of England Grammar School, Professor N.D.Harper and Lloyd Evans. Agora underwent a number of change formats over the next forty odd years before it became the glossy quarterly we recognise today. Unsurprisingly given that its history traverses decades, editors also changed. Nonetheless, from the first issue Agora has remained a cornerstone of the service the association provides its members.\n\nThe publishing activities of the association expanded through the late 1960s. In 1967 it produced two regular publications, Historian and Agora. Two years later these were to be joined by a third, the Journal of History for Senior Students, which was to be edited by Don Gibb from its inception.\n\nIn 1968, attempts were made to establish regional groups, ten in total, but these seem to have been relatively unsuccessful. At that year’s AGM, a constitution for the association was adopted, formalising the VHA’s existence.\n\nThe 1970s, despite concerns about the threat to History in schools voiced in the late 1960s, feature continuing growth and expansion of the association’s activities although the decade appears to have culminated in crisis. Student 'seminars' in Australian history were held for the first time in the third (last) term of 1971 at Latrobe and Monash Universities, with approximately 1800 students attending. These figures are certainly a high-water mark although if the number of students attending VCE lectures in 2004 were totalled we would appear to be continuing to grow, albeit at a significantly more modest rate.\n\nIn terms of membership, the association continued to grow throughout the decade. By 1972, AGM membership climbed to 673. In 1975, when the VHA moved to premises at 85 Howard St., North Melbourne, which it shared with the Geography Teachers Association, membership had risen to 945, and was to reach 1144 by 1979.\n\nMoves were made to set up a national association of History teachers, and the VHA was given the task of drawing up a draft constitution for the proposed body, which was to have been launched at Sydney University in May 1973. Ultimately, this national body was formed and exists today as the History Teachers’ Association of Australia. The VHA hosted the HTAA National Conference from 26–30 May 1978. This close association with the national body continued over subsequent decades with the HTAV hosting national conferences on a number of occasions, most recently in 2004.\n\nWhile the 1970s membership figures and student lecture numbers suggest a thriving organisation, 1978–79 was described in the president’s Report as a 'challenging year' during which it 'survived financial crisis'. That period of crisis seems to have led to a desire to reform the organisation with a new name and identity – the History Teachers’ Association of Victoria. So through crisis and a lengthy incubation, in November 1980, the organisation now known as the HTAV was established with Bob Neal as its first president.\n\nWith a new identity as the HTAV, during the 1980s the association continued to evolve towards its current form. Perhaps the most enduring legacy was the 1986 acquisition of a permanent address for the organisation, 'The Bakery' at 402 Smith St, Collingwood. This premise has remained the association’s home for nearly twenty years and would be barely recognisable by those who knew it then. Somewhat dishevelled, it was transformed in 2003 to include carpets, air-conditioning and retail outlets below.\n\nFrom around the mid-1980s, with Tim Gurry in the role of the executive officer, the association expanded its repertoire of activities. While continuing to conduct professional development and publishing Agora the activities of the association expanded to the point that in the early 1990s, under the supervision of Bob Lewis, the publication of teaching resources and education kits constituted nearly half of the association’s income in any one year.\n\nIn the early 1990s the threat seemed to be coming from 'Australian Studies'; the HTAV mobilised to meet it by running conferences on how it could be used to increase the amount of History being taught. Most conferences during this period were held at the Collingwood Football Club, of which the association was a member. The position of Extension Education Officer became a fully funded Departmental appointment advertised statewide, and Tim Gurry was appointed to the position for three years.\n\nThe mid-1990s were a difficult period. In 1992, Jonathan Tapp, an inspiring teacher from Trinity, was elected president, but early in his term of office he fell ill and died of cancer early the following year. Collingwood Football Club became a difficult venue once poker machines were installed, and after a long search a move was made to the Veneto Club in Bulleen. In 1994 the association lost half of its funding for the EEO position, and had to make up the shortfall rather than have a half-time EEO. At the end of 1994 Tim Gurry resigned as Executive Director.\n\nThe loss of considerable state government funding during the early 1990s however meant that there was no longer the same level of government support for the association. The decline in education budgets also meant that levels of membership declined through the second half of the 1990s. This had rather significant implications for the financial viability of the association. This is perhaps nowhere more vividly illustrated than in the annual reports of the late 90s when the association experience a loss of over $60,000.\n\nDespite the financial constraints of the 1990s, under the successive leaderships of John Cantwell and Jacqualine Hollingworth, the HTAV continued to provide for the needs of its membership and the wider History teaching community. As an organisation it represented teachers of History in the development of the Victorian Certificate of Education, the Curriculum and Standards Framework (CSF) and it successor the CSFII and more recently AUSVELS. It also continued to support classroom teachers by publishing an array of resources, Agora and conducting professional development and student lectures.\n\n\n"}

Shown at the Moomin Museum are illustrations made by Tove Jansson (the creator of Moomins), 40 miniatures, tableaux about Moomin events and a small (2.5 metres high) Moomin House. There is a total of about 2,000 exhibits on display. Also shown is the original Moomin Valley multimedia. It also has the Moomin Shop which sells gift items and Moomin Library which have Moomin books in many languages.\n\nThe blue five-storey miniature Moominhouse was built by Tuulikki Pietilä, Pentti Eistola and Tove Jansson in the late 1970s. The original idea was to make it round, like Jansson always made it in her illustrations for the Moomin stories, but since it was going to be displayed in a corner at the Bratislava biennale of illustrations in 1979, they decided to make it square instead. No blueprints were made, the house was built freely, floor by floor, and it does not follow any particular architectural style but is influenced by many different styles. The ground floor was sketched by Tuulikki Pietilä's brother, architect Reima Pietilä. Originally, a world tour was planned for the house after the 1979 biennale, but eventually it went on tour only in the Nordic countries in 1980–1983. Then it was taken to the atelier of Tove Jansson, since it needed some repairs after the tour. It was displayed again at the Art Museum of Tampere in 1986 and then got its permanent location at the new Moomin Museum, where it has been on display since 1987. Photos of the Moomin House serve as illustrations in \"An Unwanted Guest\", the last of Jansson's four picture books about the Moomins.\n\nUp until the end of 2012, the Moomin Museum situated in the basement of the Metso building of the city library. However, during December 2012, the museum moved into the Tampere Art Museum basement. During the move, a small collection of Tove Jansson's Moomin illustrations were on display in the Museum Center Vapriikki. The fully renewed and renovated Moomin Valley opened for visitors on January 2, 2013. The Moomin statue outside the Metso building will remain in place, to remind visitors of the Moomins' old home. In 2016, the museum moved into Tampere Hall and renamed to Moomin Museum. The Moomin statue was also moved to its new place. The museum opened in June 2017.\n\n"}

It was the largest campus drug bust in San Diego County history and one of the largest college drug busts in U.S. history.\n\nThe sting operation was triggered by the overdose deaths of two students at SDSU in 2007. 19-year Jenny Poliakoff died of a cocaine overdose on May 6, 2007, and another student, from Mesa College, died of oxycodone overdose on February 26, 2008.\n\nOn May 6, 2008, San Diego State University Police in collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration culminated a year-long investigation into drug abuse in the college area with a series of early morning raids at several residences in the college area. The DEA initially announced the arrests of 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, (many of them interns at Adobe Systems Incorporated) on a variety of drug charges. One day later, on May 7, SDSU officials stated that only 33 were students, and that the inflated numbers issued originally included all drug-related arrests made over the course of the year-long investigation, many of which were months before the raid and most cases for simple possession. Those arrested included students in the campus's Homeland Security and Criminal Justice programs. Additionally, the Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Theta, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu and Theta Chi fraternity chapters received interim suspensions, as each had at least one member arrested as result of the investigation. \n\nTwo kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 350 Ecstasy pills, 50 pounds of marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, hash oil, methamphetamine, illicit prescription drugs, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. That day, SDSU President Stephen Weber spoke at a news conference, while authorities identified 22 SDSU students as drug dealers who sold to undercover agents, and 17 others that had supplied the drugs. The rest of the suspects apparently bought or possessed illegal drugs. Authorities further found that students from seven fraternities were involved in the drug ring, which operated openly across campus. \n\nSome student groups, including SDSU group \"Students for Sensible Drug Policy,\" protested the arrests, especially SDSU's decision to involve the DEA, a federal agency, in the operation. In addition, they called for a more sympathetic policy toward drug use on the campus.\n\nOn May 15, SDSU Vice President for Student Affairs James Kitchen lifted the interim suspensions from the Phi Kappa Theta, Sigma Alpha Mu, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities. The suspension was lifted after an administrative review found that those arrested in connection to the controlled substances investigation were either inactive members of the fraternity and/or were not presently residents of chapter houses.\n\nOn November 22, SDSU announced that Phi Kappa Psi had been suspended for 18 months and Theta Chi had been suspended for four years.\n\nSeveral months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported that the majority of the defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.\n\n\n"}

It is an integrated primary, middle and high school with around 550 pupils. Founded in 1926, it is one of the oldest Waldorf schools worldwide. It is generally regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in Norway and many of its alumni have been noted in the arts, politics and other areas of society. The school is an independent non-profit foundation governed by a board consisting of representatives of the teachers and parents, and it is a member of the Norwegian Association of Waldorf Schools.\n\nIn November 1921, two years after the first Waldorf School was founded in Stuttgart, Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner held two lectures on education at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo (then named Christiania), and the plan to establish a Waldorf school in Oslo was conceived. Among those involved was Bokken Lasson, who also became one of the first teachers when the school was established in 1926. The school was originally located in Oscars gate in the Frogner district. As of 1932, the school had 102 pupils. Due to financial difficulties, the school had to close in 1936. Vult Simon and Gulle Brun however continued to operate a small Waldorf school in their home at Makrellbekken. In the autumn of 1945 the school was reestablished, and was located in a barracks in Frogner Park. In 1949, the school moved to Smestad, and in 1962, it moved to Hovseter, where it is still located. Its building complex has been successively extended over the years in different architectural styles.\n\nPrior to 1961, the school received no public funding, and was funded entirely by tuition and gifts as well as by idealistic teachers who worked for relatively little pay. The school became entitled to regular public funding under the Private School Act of 1970. Originally a primary school and later also a middle school, the first high school class was established in 1978.\n\nThe famous Norwegian novelist Jens Bjørneboe worked as a teacher at the school in the 1950s and a private school obviously modelled after Oslo Waldorf School has a significant role in his \"Jonas\" novel, which is noted for its criticism of the public school system. He later published the book \"Under en mykere himmel; brev og bud fra en Steinerskole\" (\"Under a softer sky; letters and messages from a Waldorf school\") based on his work as a Waldorf teacher. In Norway, anthroposophy in general and the Waldorf schools in particular have been strongly associated with the cultural and intellectual elite of the country since the early 20th century, and among the school's alumni and parents are many noted individuals, particularly within the arts and the cultural sphere, but also within politics and business. Among the school's alumni is former Labour leader, Prime Minister and now NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and current Labour leader and former Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre is a parent at the school. The school and the Waldorf movement in general was a stronghold of the Riksmål language of the traditional elite during the Norwegian language struggle, and the school is still using the now classic alphabet book \"André Bjerkes ABC\", published by Riksmålsforbundet in 1959.\n\nThe arts play a major role in the school curriculum and the broader activities surrounding the school, and the school includes a professionally equipped theater hall.\n\nDue to its long waiting lists, pupils are often enrolled shortly after birth.\n\n\n"}

It was a collection of regulations for school officials and teachers. The \"Ratio Studiorum\" relied on the classical subjects (theology, philosophy, Latin and Greek) and did not contain any provisions for elementary education. The document was revised in 1832, still built upon the classical subjects but giving more attention to the study of native languages of the students, history, geography, mathematics, and the natural sciences.\n\nThe work was the product of many hands and wide experience, but it most directly derives from the efforts of an international team of academics at the Collegio Romano, the Jesuit school in Rome. The \"Ratio\" had a major impact on later humanist education. In his \"Renaissance Literary Theory and Practice,\" Charles Sears Baldwin writes, \"The sixteenth century closed with the full [classical] doctrine operative in the Ratio Studiorum and in the rhetoric of Soarez\" (64). \n\nThe Society of Jesus had not originally envisaged running a network of schools when it was founded, but it soon became progressively involved in and then largely associated with educational work. One hundred years after the order's founding, the Jesuits were running 444 schools. By 1739, they were running 669 schools. The many schools taken over or started by the Society in its first decades all needed plans (\"rationes\"). In addition, an increasing number of young men were entering the Society in need of the educational background that was required for priestly service, and the Society began to assume a greater and greater role in the direction of its own formational program. For these two reasons, there grew a great desire for a standard plan for all of the Society's educational institutions. \n\nUnder the generalate of Claudio Aquaviva, in 1581, a committee of twelve Jesuit priests was appointed without clear results. A new committee of six was soon formed in 1584: Juan Azor (Spain), Gaspar González (Portugal), James Tyrie (Scotland), Peter Busée (the Netherlands), Anthony Ghuse (Flanders), and Stephen Tucci (Sicily). This committee produced a trial document, the \"Ratio\" of 1586, which was sent to various provinces for comments from the teachers. This plan was not intended for actual use in the classrooms. Reflection on the reactions led to the issuance of another document in 1591, which was to be employed in all Jesuit schools for three years. The reflection on these experiments was then used by the committee in Rome to create the final official document of 1599.\n\nThe \"Ratio Studiorum\" was divided into the following sections:\n\nI. Rules for the provincial superior; for the rector of the college; for the prefect of studies, who supervises classes and instruction, and the prefect of discipline, who maintains order and discipline; \n\nII. Rules for the professors of theology: Scripture, Hebrew language, dogmatic theology, ecclesiastical history, canon law, and moral theology. St. Thomas Aquinas was the main author for theological texts. \n\nIII. Rules for the professors of philosophy, physics, and mathematics. Aristotle was prescribed as the standard author.\n\nIV. Rules for the teachers of the \"studia inferiora\" (the lower department): Latin and Greek, grammar and syntax, humanities and rhetoric. Other subjects were taught from the beginning under the name of \"accessories\"—especially history, geography, and antiquities. \n\n\n\n"}

The organization is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. From its founding in 1975 until 2010, Road Scholar was known as Elderhostel. Road Scholar offers study tours throughout the United States and Canada and in approximately 150 other countries.\n\nElderhostel was founded in 1975 by friends Marty Knowlton, social activist and self-described hippie, and David Bianco, director of residential life at the University of New Hampshire. Knowlton rejected as ageism the belief that one's mind must fail as one ages. After four years of backpacking through Europe and staying in hostels, Knowlton, then in his 50s, returned to the United States to direct the youth hostel program at the University of New Hampshire. There, he and Bianco, the university administrator, decided that society needed \"elderhostels\" in addition to youth hostels.\n\nThe program started in the summer of 1975, offering older adults noncredit classes and dormitory housing on campuses in New England — a sort of \"summer school for retired people.\" Elderhostel was officially established as a not-for-profit organization in 1977. Its program offerings expanded through the United States and Canada, and eventually internationally. By the 1990s, more than 200,000 people were learning with Elderhostel each year.\n\nIn 2010, Elderhostel changed its name to Road Scholar in order to appeal to the next wave of older travelers: Baby Boomers. CEO James Moses explained the name change to the San Francisco Chronicle: \"Hostel\" no longer accurately described the lodging offered on the programs and \"Baby Boomers, even when they're in their 60s, don't like to think of themselves as 'elders,'\" he said. For a few months during 2010, the company was called Exploritas before changing its name to Road Scholar.\n\nRoad Scholar now includes 5,500 programs, dividing them into the categories of theme-based, inter-generational, outdoor adventures, service learning, adventures afloat, and independent city discoveries.\n\nElderhostel extends approximately $300,000 yearly in scholarships to North American participants who might otherwise be unable to attend a Road Scholar program \n\nElderhostel conducts research on aging and lifelong learning. Research articles include:“What Will Baby Boomers Want from Educational Travel,” and “Mental Stimulation and Lifelong Learning Activities in the 55+ Population.”\n\n"}

{"id": "519901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519901", "title": "Students' union", "text": "Students' union\n\nA students' union, student government, free student union, student senate, students' association, guild of students, or government of student body is a student organization present in many colleges, universities, and high schools. In higher education, the students' union is often accorded its own building on the campus, dedicated to social, organizational activities, representation, and academic support of the membership.\n\nIn the United States, \"student union\" often only refers to a physical building owned by the university with the purpose of providing services for students without a governing body. This building is also referred to as a student activity center, although the Association of College Unions International (largely US-based) has hundreds of campus organizational members. Outside the US, \"student union\" and \"students' union\" refer to a representative body, as distinct from a \"student activity centre\".\n\nDepending on the country, the purpose, assembly, method, and implementation of the group might vary. Universally, the purpose of students' union or student government is to represent fellow students in some fashion.\n\nIn some cases, students' unions are run by students, independent of the educational facility. The purpose of these organizations is to represent students both within the institution and externally, including on local and national issues. Students' unions are also responsible for providing a variety of services to students. Depending on the organization's makeup, students can get involved in the union by becoming active in a committee, by attending councils and general meetings, or by becoming an elected officer.\n\nSome students' unions are politicized bodies, and often serve as a training ground for aspiring politicians. Students' unions generally have similar aims irrespective of the extent of politicization, usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services.\n\nSome students' unions often officially recognize and allocate an annual budget to other organizations on campus. In some institutions, postgraduate students are within the general students' unions, whereas in others they have their own postgraduate representative body. In some cases, graduate students lack formal representation in student government.\n\nAs mentioned before universally the purpose of students' union or student government is to represent fellow students. Many times student's unions usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services. Simple variations on just the name include the name differences between the United States (student government) and other countries (student's union). Depending on the country there are different methods of representation compulsory education to Higher education or tertiary.\n\nIn Australia, all universities have one or more student organizations.\n\nAustralian student unions typically provide such services as eateries, small retail outlets (e.g., news agencies), student media (e.g., campus newspapers), advocacy, and support for a variety of social, arts, political, recreational, special interest and sporting clubs and societies. Most also operate specialized support services for female, LGBT, international and indigenous students. Many expressed concerns over the introduction of voluntary student unionism (VSU) in 2006.\n\nIn 2011, the Government passed legislation to allow universities to charge students a compulsory service fee to fund amenities such as sporting facilities, childcare and counselling, as well as student media and \"advocating students’ interests\". The legislation passed after the Greens took the balance of power in the senate.[11]\n\nThe National Union of Students of Australia represents most undergraduate students' unions at a national level; the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations is the umbrella organisation for postgraduate students' unions.\n\nAzerbaijan Students Union (ASU) was established by students from Baku on 15 September 2008. ASU is an organization which was established on basis of international experience and it was the first student organization which united students irrespective of gender, race, creed, nationality.\n\nDuring its action period ASU has formed stable structure, presented new suggestions about student policy to appropriate bodies, made close relations with international and regional student organizations, prepared new action plan according to the universities-students-companies' relations in Azerbaijan.\n\nASU considered international relations very important. For the first time ASU's delegates were participants of the First Asia IAESTE Forum in Shanghai during 12–15 November 2009. After that forum ASU established close relations with IAESTE which is one of the biggest student exchange organizations. As a result of relations on 21 January 2010 ASU was accepted a member of IAESTE. Our union gained right to represent Azerbaijan students in IAESTE. That membership was the union's first success on international level. During 20–27 January Azerbaijan Students Union was accepted as associative member of IAESTE in 64th Annual Conference in Thailand. Azerbaijan Students Union used to be a full member of European Students' Union, but was thrown out in 2015.\n\nIn China, the student body is usually referred to as 学生会 () or 学生联合会 ().\n\nMembership in different universities has different functions. Some universities may give the membership a task of recording the students' attendance and the complex grades. Student associations of Chinese universities are mostly under the leadership of Communist Youth League of China, which to a large extent limit its function as an organization purely belonging to students themselves.\nAll universities in Hong Kong have students' unions. Most of these students' unions are members of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. Many secondary schools also have students' unions or the equivalent.\n\nIndia has developed a complex tradition of student politics dating from the era of Congress Party domination. Student unions are organised both within universities, like the Student Council of IISc and across universities, but affiliated with political parties, as in the case of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Muslim Students Federation (MSF), Dr. Ambedkar Student Front of India (DASFI), All India Students Federation (AISF), Students Federation of India (SFI), National Students Union of India (NSUI) etc. who compete in elections to control posts in universities and colleges. Examples of activist unions include the Delhi University Students Union. Recently few school administrations had also started including the student government system as co-curricular activities in one form or another.\n\nIn Indonesia, every university, college and higher education school has a student union. The student body in high school, which is called \"Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah\" (Student Organization Inside School), abbreviated \"OSIS\", is the official student organization formed by the government. A general election to choose the leader is usually held every year. OSIS organizes the school's extracurricular activities such as music shows and art gallery (\"pentas seni/pensi\").\n\nIn Japan, the student body is called 学生自治会 (gakusei-jichi-kai). In Japanese, the word 学生自治会 (gakusei-jichi-kai) means students' self-government-organizations. The student body in Japan promotes extracurricular activities. Usually, a cultural association, 文化会 (bunka-kai), and a sports association, 体育会 (taiiku-kai), are included within a student body as autonomous organizations. A student belongs to one or more students' organizations, and he or she does extracurricular activities through these students' organizations. However, the extracurricular activities of universities and colleges have been declining since the 1990s.\n\nMalaysia has 20 public universities. Each of them has one Students' Representative Council (), the highest student body of such university.\n\nA general election is held every year, usually in September, to elect representatives to MPP. The percentage of voter turn-outs are usually high (70 to 95 percent) largely due to enforcements from the universities' management which, at the same time, acts as the Election Committee.\n\nEvery year, the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education would set meetings and arrange programmes with all MPPs. Nevertheless, each MPP has their own autonomous right to govern their own membership. The size of MPP differs from each university, from as little as 12 to as many as 50. All MPP members are part-time and unpaid officers.\n\nIn 2011, Universiti Sains Malaysia established Students' Consultative Assembly (), the first student parliament established and the oldest of its kind in Malaysia, to involve participation of more student leaders in decision and policy making as well as to establish a legislative branch in its Students' Union system instead of having the only executive branch. A university student parliament is composed of MPP members and other elected or appointed student leaders representing their respective student body. As at May 2016, 7 public universities in Malaysia had their student parliament established.\n\nStudents associations have a strong history in New Zealand of involvement in political causes, notably the Halt All Racist Tours campaign during the 1981 Springbok Tour. All universities, and most polytechnics and colleges of education have a students association. Since the economic reforms of the 1990s and the introduction of user pays in tertiary education, students associations and the national body have shifted their focus to challenging inequities in the student loan scheme and high levels of student debt. Part-time work alongside the introduction of internal assessment and the change of semester structure has been attributed to the declining involvement in extracurricular activities and a shift in focus of the student movement from mass protest to lobbying.\n\nPrevious to 1998 membership of Students' Associations (pep) was compulsory at all public Tertiary Education providers (universities, polytechnics and colleges of education). In 1997 the centre-right National party proposed the Voluntary Student Membership amendment to the Education act which would have made membership of Students' Associations voluntary at all Tertiary Education Providers.\n\nHowever the National Party relied on support from the centrist New Zealand First party to pass legislation. The New Zealand First party preferred that Tertiary Students themselves choose whether their provider should be voluntary or compulsory and pushed through a compromise to the amendment that allowed for a Compulsory Vs Voluntary referendum to be held at every public Tertiary Education Provider. The amendment also allowed for subsequent referendums which could not be held until at least two years had passed since the previous referendum and only if a petition was signed by 10% of the student populace.\n\nThe first wave of referendums were held in 1999, in which several Polytechnics and two Universities (the University of Waikato and the University of Auckland) elected to become voluntary. In 2002 a second referendum was held at the University of Waikato and students choose to return to compulsory student membership. Similar referendums at Auckland University in 2001, 2003 and 2005 have all elected to retain voluntary student membership.\n\nMost of New Zealand Tertiary students' associations are confederated under the New Zealand Union of Students' Associations.\n\nThe Philippines has a complex student union. The usual names used are \"student government\", \"student council\", \"student body\" The Student Government Program of the elementary and secondary schools is handled by the Department of Education while the student councils in state universities and colleges is under the Commission on Higher Education. As well, Every public and private elementary and secondary schools under the Department of Education (DepED) has its own student governments. At the Tertiary Level, also known as higher education or \"university\" every private and state college and universities in the Philippines has its own student councils. In a university, there is a university student council and every college has its college student council. If a university has external campus(es), the external campuses has its own student council. The student councils within the university (main campus and external campuses) has the student regent, which would represent studentry of the whole university. One example of that is of the West Visayas State University and Central Philippine University.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, each state university has several Students' unions with formal links to respective faculties.Inter University Students' Federation is the umbrella organization of 14 unions of university students. However, most of these have political affiliations and function as proxies of these political factions. Many unions take an active political role within the university and in the country as a whole. This frequently lead to much clashes between rival students' unions or the authorities.\n\nThe role of students' unions in Myanmar were attached with Politics. From 1902, the students' union were outcoming and tried to get the Interdependence of Nation. There were many students boycotts in Myanmar:1920, 1936, 1962, 1974-75-76, 1988, 1996, 2007 and recently 2015 March. Most of them were connected with political issues. The Students' union in Myanmar tried to initiate to get the Interdependence of Burma. They always stood together with the Public difficulties. Now, U Thein Sein Government approved the National Education Law. So, the followed Technical Laws and attached laws are now wishing to get approved. The role of students' union is the greatest power in Myanmar or Burma according to History.\n\nIn South Africa student representative councils are the executive and plenary body of student governance and charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. In several instances representatives of these bodies are members of the university's Senate.\n\nIn 2012 the first student union, after 42 years of suppression, was founded. Students from Al Mimona Ebem Alharth school public school in Tripoli-Libya successfully established the union and promoted for other schools around the country to do the same. The founder Alaa Amed received local media attention for this achievement. \nWhile higher education and student activism might vary depending on the country the National Association of Nigerian Students' (NANS) is an organization with well over 50 university union across the nation.\n\nTunisia has a lot of students unions, we can see Organization of RCD students (Of the party Democratic Constitutional Rally but It was dissolved in 2011 after the Tunisian revolution), but the largest two poles for students in the country are Union générale des étudiants de Tunisie (UGET) since 1952 and Union générale tunisienne des étudiants (UGTE) since 1985.\n\nWhile each student's union varies by countries the European Students' Union is an umbrella organization of 45 national unions of students from 36 European countries.\n\nIn Denmark the higher education system comprises two parallel sectors: universities and university colleges of applied sciences (e.g. nursing and engineering schools or teachers' colleges). Universities are characterised by scientific research and the highest education based thereon. University colleges of applied sciences are oriented towards working life and base their operations on the high vocational skill requirements set by it. These vocational institutions offer 3-4 year 'professional bachelor's degrees'. Besides that there are a number of art schools. Universities belong under the Ministry of Science, University Colleges belong under the Ministry of Education, and the Art Schools belong under the Ministry of Culture. There are 12 universities at the moment, but in 2006 there is a major merger process going on to make fewer, bigger institutions. The student unions at universities (and some of the art schools' student unions) are generally members of the National Union of Students in Denmark which represents these students on the national level.\n\nEvery university has a student union (In Danish, \"Studenterråd\"). Membership is not mandatory. The student unions are funded by the university and the Ministry of Science on the basis of the percentage of votes received every year at the university election. The student union is autonomous, its internal life organized by its by-laws. The student unions are responsible for all representation of the students and elect the student members of different administrative organs. They usually coordinate and finance the activities of smaller, more specialized student organizations. For the financing of their activities, some student unions exact a membership fee and/or engage in different businesses.\n\nIn the Ministry of Culture institutions there are also local student organisations. In the Ministry of Education institutions, The student activities are very much related to a student division of the Labor Union in the different areas. For instance, the teachers' students are organised in the national labor union for teachers and so forth.\n\nThe Upper-Secondary schools (In Danish, \"Gymnasier\"), It is in Denmark a law that there has to be a studentscouncill at the Upper-Secondary schools. The studentscouncils are organized in the following organisations:\n\nThe central organization of the French higher education system means that local university bodies have restricted decision-making power. As a consequence, student unions are generally established at national level with local sections in most universities. The largest national student unions have a strong political identity and their actions are generally restricted to the defense of their vision of higher education rather than being focused on the particular interests of the membership of a single university. Union membership is regarded as an essentially political decision, without any particular advantage for students. The strength of unions is often measured by their effectiveness in national protests rather than by membership figures.\n\nThere are also class-struggle student unions such as the Solidaires Étudiant-e-s (formed in January 2013 through the fusion of the former organizations SUD Étudiant and Féderation syndicale étudiante (FSE)) which refuse to cooperate with the universities' direction and work to organize students.\n\nIn the Grandes écoles, the premium league in the French higher education system, students are generally members of the official Student Office (Bureau des étudiants or Bureau des élèves) in charge of the organization of social activities and sports events. The constitutions of these societies, which work in close partnership with the school administration, usually prevent union members from running for executive positions in order to keep the school independent from political groups liable to harm the school's prestige.\n\nIn Germany the actual form of student representation depends strongly on the federal state. In most states there is a General Students' Committee (AStA) at every university. It is the executive organ of the parliaments and councils of all faculties.\n\nIn Greece every university department has its corresponding student union (in Greek: Σύλλογος Φοιτητών) and all students belonging to the department have the right to register as members. The main objective of a student union is to solve students' problems that can either be related to academic life or have a general political and social nature. Furthermore, student unions organize and support numerous activities such as political debates, demonstrations, university occupations, educational lectures, cultural and artistic events, conferences and so on.\n\nThe structure of a student union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: The General Students' Assembly (Greece) and the board of directors. The general assembly consists of all student-members of the union. It takes place on a regular basis and is the only decision-making body. During the general assembly, many topics of student interest are discussed and the decisions are taken after open vote. The board of directors makes sure that the decisions of the general assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the board of directors, among which is the union's president, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the union.\n\nEvery year in early spring the student elections take place nationwide, during which students vote for their representatives. All student unions in Greece are members of the \"National Student Union of Greece\" (ΕΦΕΕ - Εθνική Φοιτητική Ένωση Ελλάδας).\n\nMost of Ireland's universities and colleges have students' unions which were established to represent the students in the context of internal college issues and on wider student related issues and also a means of solidarity with other movements globally. An ongoing campaign of virtually every students' union in Ireland is to prevent the reintroduction of tuition fees which were abolished in 1995. Most, but not all, of the students' unions are affiliated with the Union of Students in Ireland. Notably, two of the seven university students' unions are not members. The students' unions are operated in accordance with the rules set down in their constitution which invariable enumerates a strong democratic and inclusive procedure for the governance on the union. Some Students' Unions run retail businesses in the interests of its students and run referendums, such as on whether or not to support same-sex marriage or abortion.\n\nAll Universities and Institutes of Technologies in the Republic of Ireland have Students' Unions.\n\nNational Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), the student movement in Northern Ireland was formed in 1972 by bilateral agreement between the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom (NUS) and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), to address the particular problems of representing students in Northern Ireland.\n\nThere are several students' unions in The Netherlands which act as labor unions for students. The largest ones are VSSD in Delft and ASVA Studentenunie in Amsterdam. These students' unions are all members of LSVb, the national students' union. There's also a similar organization called ISO (Interstedelijk Studenten Overleg), which consists of several formal participation organizations, as well as ASVA Studentenunie and VSSD. Both ISO and LSVb are members of European Students' Union.\n\nLastly, the Netherlands has an (unofficial) student union for its students that study abroad: Netherlands Worldwide Students or simply NEWS.\n\nThe Netherlands is also home to a unique case of student representation in which a local political party completely run by student gained seats during local town hall elections: STIP.\n\nIn Norway, every university is instructed and required by law to have a Student Union elected by the pupils/students at the school. The goal for every Student Union is to improve their school environment through encouraging social, cultural and other extracurricular events that is happening in the local community. The student unions in Norway is governed by a board of directors which is elected directly from the Student Council.\n\nIn Portugal, every university, polytechnic institute and any other higher education schools has their own students' unions. Union organizations are generally aimed to organize and promote extracurricular activities such as sports and culture events, parties, and academic festivities. At the same time, they also act as \"labour unions for students\" promoting and defending the student's points of view and rights, and dealing with the teaching institutions and the State's education agencies policies. The oldest union of Portugal is the Associação Académica de Coimbra (founded in 1887) which belongs to the students of the University of Coimbra. The biggest students' union is .\n\nAt Swedish universities, students' unions are responsible for representing the students in evaluation of the education and decision-making within the universities. Not Swedish universities are affiliated with the Swedish National Union of Students. The union normally holds about one-third of the votes within every decision making body and thus holds a great deal of power.\n\nThe unions are usually governed by a general assembly of elected representatives. Students' unions generally provide counselling services to its members and publishes their own magazines or newspapers. Large universities often have several students' unions, where the smaller students' unions only provide basic services. Larger students' unions often own and run their own facilities at the university such as shops, restaurants and night clubs.\n\nThe United Kingdom has a long history of student unionism at a local and national level. The oldest students' union in Britain is St Andrews, founded in 1864, and the oldest in England is believed to be the Liverpool Guild of Students, formed in 1892. Most bodies are termed \"unions\", however there exist a number of \"guilds\" and \"students' associations\". Students' associations is a popular term in Scotland, as historically there were separate men's and women's unions focused on societies and entertainment with representation to the university carried out by separate Students' Representative Councils. Most students' unions in the UK are affiliated to the National Union of Students, although there exist other national representative bodies, such the National Postgraduate Committee, the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland and the Aldwych Group, the association of students' unions of members of the Russell Group.\n\nNational Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), the student movement in Northern Ireland was formed in 1972 by bilateral agreement between the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom (NUS) and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), to address the particular problems of representing students in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Canada, membership in a college or university students' union is mandatory across Canada under various provincial statutes. Included in Canadian students' tuition fees is anywhere from an additional $10–$500 fee to pay for the services of the union. The money raised from dues is often used to support a staff and office. Student elections usually happen around March as the membership elect their unions' executives. The current largest undergraduate student union in Canada is the Alma Mater Society, at the University of British Columbia, with around 56,000 members.\n\nMost students' unions are charged by their membership to protect their best interests at the university, municipal, provincial and federal government levels. Many students' unions in Canada are members of one of the national student organizations, the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA) or the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS). Those that belong to the CFS at the national level also belong to the CFS at the provincial level. Those that do not belong to the CFS may belong to a provincial student organization like the New Brunswick Student Alliance, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance (OUSA), the College Student Alliance, StudentsNS (formerly known as ANSSA), the Alliance of British Columbia Students, the Council of Alberta University Students, or the Alberta Students Executive Council. In Quebec, the provincial student organizations are the Quebec Federation of University Students (\"Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec\" or FEUQ) for university students, college students are represented by the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec or FECQ, while the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante or ASSE is a more radical organisation that includes students from both levels of education.\n\nDifferent provinces have different rules governing student unions. In British Columbia under section 27.1 of the University Act, student unions may only raise or rescind mandatory student union fees through a democratic referendum of the membership. Once fees are passed through this mechanism, the board of governors of the respective institutions are then required to remit those fees to the student union, and may only interfere in the internal affairs of the student union if it fails to complete annual audits of its finances, giving these student unions strong autonomy over their institutions. In Ontario, the autonomy of student unions is set by standards outlined by each institution, giving university administrators a broader scope of powers over the finances of student unions.\n\nIn Mexico, students unions are mostly predominant in universities. Mexican universities have an elected student committee each year, but the faculties or schools within the universities have also their own union. This practice is also extended to other levels of education, such as high and junior high school, but to a lesser extent. An example of this is the Sociedad de Alumnos de HPA Mexico.\n\nJesuit student groups played an important role in Mexico's history, particularly in opposing the imposition of socialist education in Mexico in the 1930s. Leaders from the \"Unión Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos\" (UNEC) had long-term importance in Mexico's political history, since a number of them helped form the conservative National Action Party (Mexico).\n\nIn the United States, these groups are often known as student government, associated students, student senate, or less commonly a student's union. In the U.S., the phrase \"student union\" often refers to a \"student activity center\" (also known as a \"student center\" or \"student commons\"), a building with dining halls, game rooms, lounges, student offices, and other spaces for student activities. At institutions with large graduate, medical school, and individual \"college\" populations, there are often student governments that serve those specific constituencies.\n\nThe Brazilian students union is also called the Brazilian Student Association. It was formed in 1991 in order to provide the Brazilian students with representation that was fair and even within the LSU campus. The union has also set a side goal of promoting their Brazilian culture, since they are a Portuguese-speaking Latin American country.\n\nThe Brazilian Society\n\nThis society has existed since 2003 and now has 190 members, where only one third are Brazilian. The other two thirds are people who are just interested in Brazilian politics, famous parties and culture. This is one of the societies that students may join if they so wish. The society has social events and it hosts lectures. They also have a Brazilian discussion group on a weekly basis in order to discuss current events.\n"}
{"id": "33476174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33476174", "title": "Substitutes for Leadership Theory", "text": "Substitutes for Leadership Theory\n\nSubstitutes for leadership theory is a leadership theory first developed by Steven Kerr and John M. Jermier in 1978. The theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio, Walumbwa, & Weber, 2009; Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001). It has received criticism for shortcomings due to perceived methodological issues (Dionne, Yammarino, Atwater, & James, 2002; Podsakoff & Mackenzie, 1995). Empirical research has produced mixed results as to its ability to predict subordinate outcomes.\n\nOver the years, researchers have developed many leadership theories. Prior to the 1970s, trait leadership theory and path-goal theory were the two heavily researched theories. (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001). Proponents of trait leadership theory held that the ability to lead is a characteristic some people innately have and others do not. Effort was put forth to uncover which characteristics and abilities leaders had that separated them from non-leaders.\nLeadership style was another angle researchers took. Proponents of this approach did not believe the ability to lead was innate, rather it was a set of behaviors anyone could learn (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001).\n\nIn the mid 1970s, a great deal of research was dedicated to the contingency model and path-goal theory (Schriesheim, 1997). The contingency model stated that various leadership styles would be more or less effective depending on the situation (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001; Fiedler, 1965; Hunt, 1967). Path-goal theory proposed that subordinates would be satisfied with their leader if they perceived that their leader’s behavior would bring them future satisfaction. Subordinates would be motivated by their leader if they perceived that completing work tasks would bring them satisfaction, and if the leader provided proper coaching, support, rewards, and guidance (House, 1996). Frustrations with not being able to find significant results with any one theory resulted in the development of reexaminations and new approaches, including questioning which situations necessitated a leader figure and which did not (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001).\n\nSteven Kerr was one of the researchers publicly expressing his frustrations (e.g., Kerr & Harlan, 1973) with current leadership theories. In the 1970s, Kerr was at Ohio State University actively involved in leadership research. Kerr was studying existing proposed subordinate constructs such as organizational independence (Schriesheim, 1997) and proposed leadership constructs such as consideration and initiating structure (put forth by the Ohio State Leadership Studies; Kerr, Schriesheim, Murphy, & Stogdill, 1974).\n\nSubordinates that are organizational independents do not feel tied to one company and are internally motivated instead of motivated by the characteristics of the organization, such as leader behavior (House & Kerr, 1973; Schriesheim, 1997). Leaders high on initiating structure clarify their own role and their subordinates’ roles in obtaining a goal (Kerr et al., 1974). Kerr and colleagues (1974) noticed many studies had found significant moderators that played a part in the relationship between initiating structure leader behavior and subordinate outcomes. For example, when a task was ambiguous, the relationship between leader initiating structure and subordinate satisfaction was stronger than if the task was clear. These findings made it apparent that there were variables that affected the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes, making the relationship stronger or weaker.\n\nKerr (1973) was the first to coin substitutes for leadership as elements in the work setting that lessened leader effectiveness on subordinate outcomes. Further publications (e.g., Kerr et al., 1974) led to Kerr and Jermier’s 1978 paper, which unveiled substitutes for leadership theory. This paper presented two types of elements in the job environment: substitutes and neutralizers. These elements were proposed to serve as moderators in the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.\n\nThe theory originally classified substitutes as characteristics of the subordinate, characteristics of the task, and characteristics of the organization. Howell, Dorfman, & Kerr (1986) proposed an alteration to the theory in terms of subordinate classification. They argued that moderators should be grouped based on their effect on the criterion. The original theory had already proposed moderators that act as substitutes and moderators that act as neutralizers. Howell and colleagues added enhancers to these.\n\nSubstitutes for leadership theory was a heavily researched area until the late 1980s, when transformational leadership became the focus of the majority of leadership research (Dionne, Yammarino, Howell, & Villa, 2005).\n\nSubstitutes for leadership theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio et al., 2009; Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001).\n\nSubstitutes are variables that make leadership unnecessary for subordinates (Schriesheim, 1997) and reduce the extent to which subordinates rely on their leader (Kerr et al.,1974)\n\n\nEnhancers are variables that serve to strengthen leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001; Howell et al., 1986; Schriesheim, 1997).\n\n\nNeutralizers are variables which serve to weaken, or block leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001; Schriesheim, 1997).\n\n\nThe original scale to measure the effects of various substitutes was developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978). They assessed leadership substitutes via a questionnaire that contained thirteen subscales with a total of 55 items. The items were on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost always untrue or completely untrue), to 5 (almost always true or almost completely true).\n\nThe subscales included were:\n\nKerr and Jermier (1978) tested nine of these subscales in a lab setting and found that they were independent and had adequate internal reliabilities. They claim that the subscales produce easily interpretable data which describe the extent to which substitutes for leadership are present or absent in a given work situation.\nThey went on to test their subscales in a field setting using police officers, and concluded that the subscales met acceptable standards of reliability, and can be used to assess the validity of the substitutes for leadership construct in future studies.\n\nPodsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams (1993) noted that studies testing the substitutes for leadership model had not been fully supportive of the theory, and believed that one reason for this may be that the quality of the scale developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978) to measure the substitutes constructs may be to blame. In response to this, they designed their own 74-item measure of substitutes for leadership.\nTo test their scale, they administered it to 372 business students. Their analyses of the psychometric properties of the revised measure revealed their scale to be superior to Kerr and Jermier’s scale, as evidenced by better dimensionality and reliability of the revised scale.\n\nKerr and Jermier (1978) proposed that substitute variables should render leader behaviors unable to predict subordinate outcomes. Researchers that have tested this characteristic of substitutes have found mixed results (Howell & Dorfman, 1981; Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1995).\n\nA study involving hospital personnel (Howell & Dorfman, 1981) found that tasks that gave feedback regarding performance were negatively correlated with job satisfaction. Routine repetitive work tasks were correlated with organizational commitment. Intrinsically satisfying work, organizational formulation, and cohesive work groups were substitutes that were significantly correlated with both job satisfaction and organizational commitment. However, they found little evidence that substitutes prevented or replaced a leader’s effect on subordinate job satisfaction or organizational commitment. The only substitute that served as a replacement was organizational formulation, which replaced leader behavior’s predictive power in explaining subordinate job satisfaction and organizational commitment .\n\nAnother study (Podsakoff & Mackenzie, 1995) looked at 1,235 employees working for 265 leaders in a variety of job settings. Among their findings were that intrinsically satisfying tasks were positively related to subordinate satisfaction, indifference to rewards was negatively related to organizational commitment, and organizational formulation was negatively related to subordinate perceptions of role ambiguity. The researchers in this study concluded that substitutes for leadership were useful in predicting subordinate outcomes, but leader behaviors and substitutes should always be studied together, because together they explained about a third of the total variance in subordinate outcomes in their sample .\nA more recent study conducted by Dionne and colleagues (2002) collected data from 940 subordinates. Unsatisfied with the fact that prior studies had tested substitutes, enhancers, and neutralizers as moderators, they tested the effect of substitutes as mediators as well as moderators. Testing a variety of different substitutes and outcomes, the researchers found only very weak evidence that substitutes make a difference, and concluded that leader behaviors are the only important variable in predicting employee outcomes.\nPodsakoff, MacKenzie, and Bommer (1996) conducted a meta-analysis in which they took the results of 22 studies that examined the main effect of substitutes for leadership on the relationship between leader behaviors and subordinate outcomes. They found evidence supporting the theory— taking into account both leader behaviors and the effect of substitutes accounted for more of the variance in subordinate outcomes than taking into account leader behaviors alone.\n\nBass (1990) suggested that autonomous work groups can substitute for formal leadership. In this scenario, employees are divided into groups that are responsible for managing their own day-to-day work (i.e. collective control over pace, distribution of tasks, organization of breaks, recruitment, and training; Gulowsen, 1972). A quasi-experiment conducted by Wall, Kemp, Jackson, and Clegg (1986) found that implementing autonomous work groups of 8 to 12 shop-floor employees in a manufacturing setting positively affected both the intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of employees, while obviating some supervisory positions.\n\nSelf-management is defined by Thoresen and Mahoney (1974) as occurring when an individual behaves in a way he would not normally behave, and there are no external forces dictating that the person maintain that behavior.\nSelf-management requires self-observations (e.g., keeping a log of what one has discussed with others on the phone), specification of goals (e.g., being responsible for setting one’s own schedule and priorities), cueing strategies (e.g., putting a checkout board by the exit to remind an employee to let their secretary know where they are going and when they expect to return), rehearsal (e.g., recording one’s presentation to clients and making corrections as needed), self-evaluation (e.g., using a chart to keep track of work quality and quantity), and self-reinforcement (accomplished by building intrinsic rewards for the performance of tasks; Bass, 1990; Manz & Sims 1980). These strategies can be understood as being substitutes for leadership. Instead of requiring that a supervisor monitor a subordinate’s progress on a work task, a subordinate can self-manage by utilizing one of the strategies listed above. This makes the supervisor’s guidance unnecessary for the subordinate.\n\nDionne and colleagues (2002) argued that significant effects of substitutes found in prior studies may be a statistical artifact due to \"common-source bias\", or bias occurring when independent and dependent variables are collected from the same person or group of people. In a study sampling 49 organizations, Dionne and colleagues controlled for the effect of common-source bias and found no moderating or mediating effects of substitutes on the relationship between leader behavior and group effectiveness.\n\nIn a study by Podsakoff and Mackenzie (1995), the predictor variables, as well as the job attitude and role perception variables, were both taken from individual employees, while the performance measures were taken from supervisors. They found that their predictors accounted for a higher proportion of variance in job attitudes and role perceptions, than in employee performance. They posit the reason for this was that their predictors shared a common source with the job attitudes and role perception criterion measures, but not with the employee performance criterion measures. They suggested that common-source bias may not be the only reason for this, but that it should be controlled in future research.\n\nKeller (2006) conducted a longitudinal study in which he pointed out that the vast majority of studies conducted on substitutes for leadership theory are cross-sectional in nature, making it more difficult to discern a causal relationship between substitutes and their effects on employee performance. Cross-sectional research is focused on finding relationships between variables at a specific point in time, whereas longitudinal studies involve taking multiple measures over a longer period of time. Keller’s longitudinal study of the effect of substitutes on Research & Development teams found that two of the seven substitutes (ability and intrinsic satisfaction) affected team performance over time.\n\nYukl (1998) pointed out that it is hard to identify specific substitutes and neutralizers for broad behavior categories, and that an improvement on the theory would be to use more specific behaviors in place of \"supportive and instrumental leadership behaviors.\" Yukl said that recent studies testing the theory have used specific behaviors (e.g., contingent reward behavior and role clarification), however the development of the theory does not reflect these developments.\n\nThe contingency model of leadership was developed by Fred Fiedler in the 1960s after Fiedler spent 12 years collecting data from over 800 groups of employees. This model predicts that the most effective method of leadership will vary depending on the situation. A study which supported the model was one Fiedler did with 48 petty officers and 240 recruiters at a Belgium naval training center (Fiedler, 1965). Fiedler found that a leader’s fit with the group and the task was more important in predicting outcomes than the leader’s characteristics. For example, controlling leaders went best with heterogeneous groups with low position power (Fiedler, 1965; Hunt 1967).\nThere are many different theories within the contingency paradigm, which differ on what situational factors change leadership effectiveness. The most influential theory within this model is path-goal theory (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001).\n\nProposed by Robert House in 1971, path-goal theory predicts that subordinates will be satisfied with their leader if they feel their leader’s behavior will lead them to satisfaction. Also, subordinates will be motivated when they feel that their satisfaction depends on their performance and their leader acts in a way to help them reach goals (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001, House, 1971). Path-goal theory predicts that when goals and the paths to those goals are clear, subordinates may not need leader guidance (Kerr & Jermier, 1978).\n\n\n"}

It aims to increase transparency and create a corruption-free world by working together with the private sector, civil society and public sector. Corruption is rife and a major issue in Slovakia. TIS focuses on policies involving local and regional governments to uphold democracy and a free market economy.\n\nUnder the previous heavily corrupted governance (1994–1998), privatization was not a transparent process, leading to many cases of embezzlement. Many private firms were sold at a loss, leading some to bankruptcy and causing negative fiscal impact on the Slovak economy. With the change to a new governance in October 1998, TIS was invited to monitor and increase the transparency level of the privatization process of Slovak Telecom and ultimately, reduce corruption.\n\nThe main goals of the monitoring of the privatization process of Slovak Telecom in which Transparency International Slovakia participated as an independent observer were: \n\nTIS sought to improve transparency of the process by first forming a tri-party which, together with TIS, helped monitor the entire process, thereby increasing transparency. Observing the process also allowed TIS to brainstorm ideas that would improve transparency. For instance, a major problem identified was with regard to the documentation language. Documents are written only in English, a language of which command is imprecise, hence leaving the document open to interpretation.\nIn addition, TIS published news and information on the privatisation to educate and increase public awareness on transparency issues.\n\nThrough the media, TIS managed to increase public interest and awareness on issues concerning transparency and anti-corruption. The extent of public participation and media influence was exemplified during the process, through public outcry against corruption that led to the resignation of two corrupt officials, the first of its kind in the country. Realizing the need for a greater transparency level in the privatization process, TIS established and recommended numerous policies for administrative changes. These included:\n\nAccording to two reports, the progress of corruption in Slovakia remains unclear. World Bank statistics show that in the period after the policy implementation, corruption in Slovakia worsened from 0.31 in 2000 to 0.13 in 2002, thereafter the corruption index showed a general upward trend of an increase of the index by 0.3 points by 2008.\nOn the other hand, Transparency International statistics show that after 2000, corruption has been steadily decreasing in the country from 3.5 in 2000 to 4.98 in 2008 signaling a decrease by 1.48 index points.\n\n"}

Her husband was a Siddha practitioner and was into agriculture and cultivation, She moved to Negamam after marriage and later to Ganapathy, Coimbatore. At the age of 8, She learnt yoga from her father, she mastered more than 50 asanas. Over the past five decades, Nanammal has trained more than one million students and continues to teach 100 students daily at the 'Ozone Yoga Centre' established by her. Around 600 of her students, including 36 members of her family, have become 'Yoga instructors' around the world.\n\nNanammal started practicing yoga when she was 8 years old. She learned yoga from her father, who was a martial artist, Nanammal's husband was a Siddha practitioner in the village and was also into agriculture. That is how she cultivated a liking towards naturopathy after her marriage. She never stopped practicing yoga at any point in her life.\n\nNanammal's father and grandfather were both 'Registered Indian Medicine Practitioners (RIMP)', Yoga was their family tradition and they were not teaching yoga to anyone outside the family and it stayed within the group. During those days, the primary business was agriculture in Kerala state, where their family owned coconut and cashew farms, along with traditional Siddha medicine.\n\nThere was an incident involving her mother-in-law that made Nanammal to realize that yoga could potentially help other people as well. Her mother-in-law was out in the farm and had wrenched her leg, Instead of getting treatment from a doctor, She offered to teach her some yoga poses and she got better wit this technique.\nAfter that incident, her mother-in-law became her very first student. Over the years, Nanammal began teaching her neighbors and other children, and by the time 1970s, she had decided to teach yoga to even more people.
