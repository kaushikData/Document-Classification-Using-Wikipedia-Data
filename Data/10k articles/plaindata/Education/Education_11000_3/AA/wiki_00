At that time, California educational law prohibited Native American children from attending a public school if a separate government run Indian school was established within three miles of the public school.\n\nAlice Piper along with six other Indian children sued the district for the right to attend. Piper sued on the grounds that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated knowing full well that she was not receiving the same education that the newly built public school afforded. The local Indian day school only offered education up to the 5th grade level, was underfunded, and lacked many basic resources. Furthermore, the District trustees had previously agreed to allow Indian students to attend the school if their parents voted for a measure that would fund the construction of the school. Although the measure passed, the board of trustees did not honor their agreement.\n\nAs a local resident recalled, \"It was an exciting morning when the request was made, all the mothers and fathers of children of school age, Indian and white, were on the street to hear the answer of the district trustees. When the request was denied, the Indians immediately took court action pressing their case in the name of Alice Piper, a beautiful, intelligent, Indian girl.\" The California Supreme Court unanimously ruled in her favor in the case \"Piper v. Big Pine\" (1924), thus opening the door for herself and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California.\n\nPiper's court victory became a turning point in the struggle for Native American education and ended the practice of sending Indian children who qualified for public school to separate government-run Indian day schools. \"Piper v. Big Pine\" was later cited by Chief Justice Warren as a precedent in the Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ruling that ended the practice of segregated schools in the United States.\n\nAlice Piper stands as an early civil rights hero who championed equal educational opportunities for Native Americans, opening the door for equal access to education for all children regardless of race. Says Ada Wardle Robinson, the Inyo County Superintendent who held the office years after the Piper case decision had been handed down, \"And as each year as both eighth grade and high school students graduate, we are reminded that the development of our youthful citizens is not confined to the white race and we are thankful to those Indians who years ago insisted that their children be given an equal chance.\"\n\nIn 2009, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe and Big Pine Unified School District agreed to commemorate Piper's victory with a statue placed in front of the school in her honor. The statue was dedicated on June 2, 2014, on the 90th anniversary of Alice Piper's victory in front of the school steps on the same ground in which the board of trustees had denied Alice Piper the right to attend in 1923. This date also marks the day in 1924 that president Grover Cleveland signed the \"Indian Citizenship Act\", which declared all Indians, regardless of membership in a tribe, citizens of the United States.\n\nAs of 2014, 56% of the students who attend Big Pine high school are Native American.\n"}

Due to its features and dimensions, it has been considered (as of the date it was commissioned) the largest sail vessel in Latin America.\n\nFor a long time, the Peruvian Navy desired a training ship for instruction of its cadets. Accordingly, the Peruvian government enacted 1985 Law N° 24094, which declared as a public necessity the navy having this kind of ship. However, due to the economic crisis of debt and hyper-inflation Peru suffered at the end of the 1980s, and later for public spending restraints, the project was postponed.\n\nEventually, in 2010 the project was approved and the construction was authorized. In 2012 the Peruvian government announced its decision to order the ship's construction to the Shipyard Marine Industrial Services of Peru, known as SIMA; in cooperation with the Government of Spain, through the contractors Cypsa Ingenieros Navales and Navantia, which were responsible for the ship´s structural design. The governmente named the ship as \"Union\" to honors a Peruvian corvette that took part in the first stage of the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific as part of a naval squadron under the command of Miguel Grau, a hero of the Peruvian Navy. On December 8, 2012 \"Unión\"s construction began with a keel laying ceremony in the presence of Peruvian president Ollanta Humala. The hull was finished two years later and the ship was launched on December 22, 2014.\n\nIn June 2015, the ship received its masts and propeller; and the interior fitout began in charge of contractors Acopafi and MO Contract. Also, according to an agreement between SIMA and Navantia, the ship was provided with an \"Integrated Control System Platform, Navigation and Communications\".\nWhile the ship was under construction, the Peruvian government arranged training for the future \"Unión\"s crew with the help of an instructor from the Spanish Navy and by sending personnel to serve on training ships of other countries, such as the Mexican sailing ship . Also, a Peruvian delegation was sent to take part in maintenance and repair works on Colombian sailing ship .\n\nOn January 27, 2016 BAP \"Unión\" was commissioned in an official flag raising ceremony held on its deck witnessed by the President Ollanta Humala, Jakke Valakivi, the Minister of Defense and Admiral Edmundo Deville, the Commander of the Navy. Captain Gianfranco Polar Figari was named to be the first captain of the ship, who conducted the sea trials of the vessel in June 2016.\n\nBAP \"Unión\"s first training cruise abroad began on July 27, 2016.

As the main element it shows the image of the Sapa Inca (emperor) Tupac Yupanqui, known as \"The Shining\", who appears with his right arm raised to the image of the Inca sun god Inti; and who is placed over a representation of the archeological artefact known the twelve-angled stone. The Sapa Inca wears a checkered cloth and a cape that depicts ocean waves. He also wears two puma heads (the puma was a sacred animal in Inca culture) as knee guards.

It may be accompanied by a larger project involving varying areas of study.\n\nTypically classes which would include a balsa wood bridge cover the subject areas of physics, engineering, static equilibrium, or building trades, although it may be done independently of any of these subjects. Building a balsa wood bridge can be done after completing a section or unit covering a related topic or the process of design and building can be used to guide students to a better understanding of the desired subject area.\n\nAlthough there is great variety between different balsa wood bridge projects, students are in general trying to build a bridge that can withstand the greatest weight before it fails. Other restrictions are often applied, but these vary widely from one contest to another.\nSample requirements include:\n\nBridges are usually tested by applying a downward force on the bridge. How and where the force is applied varies from one contest to the next. There are two common methods of applying the test force to the bridge:\n\nOf the two, the hanging container method provides by far the greater dramatic effect. Testing with a pneumatic press or ram is often complete in matter of seconds. Exceptionally strong bridges may take up to thirty minutes to test as weight (a combination of steel weights and sand is often used) is added to the suspended container.\n\nThere are two chief ways that balsa wood bridge competitions may be scored. One way is simply by measuring how much weight each bridge can support. The second way is by structural efficiency, often expressed as a strength to weight ratio. The weight-only method is most effective where competitors are all building from a specified set of materials and are expected to use all the available materials. The strength-to-weight method is better when competitors are expected to use their materials as efficiently as possible.\n\nCompetitive grading compares how well each bridge does against bridges built by other participants to determine a grade. The top scoring bridge is assigned a maximum numeric grade (say, 100%) while the lowest scoring bridge that still meets all basic specifications is assigned a minimum grade (say, 70%).\n\nThe method guarantee that some scores will be high even if the overall quality of bridges is low. Conversely, it also guarantees that some scores will be low, even in situations where all bridges are of high quality.\n\nStandards-based grading sets certain standards that need to be met in order to earn a certain grade. An example of standards-based scoring would be to say that all bridges that hold 50 kg earn full credit; bridges that hold 25 kg earn half credit, and bridges that hold less than 10 kg earn no credit.\n\nThis method allows every bridge to potentially earn full credit if the standards are met. In situations where competition is weak, this method runs the risk of having many competitors receive no credit.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also founder of the Green Wood Guild, a collective of green wood carvers who run carving workshops and owns a spoon shop and woodworking venue in Hackney in London's East End. Carder also teaches spoon carving, woodworking and bladesmithing (with master smith Nic Westermann).\n\nCarder was born in 1982 and grew up in Berkshire. At the age of 12 a neighbour introduced him to woodturning by showing him how to make bowls and soon he had a lathe in the garage of his parents' house. He graduated from Bristol University with a degree in biology, intending initially to become a biology teacher before becoming apprenticed to a cabinet maker. After apprenticing himself to green wood worker Mike Abbott in Hereford, he then spent 3 years working in forestry and living in the forests, sourcing green wood. It was while living in the woods he began to carve and then sell spoons for a living travelling between Oxford and Bristol, finding that the spoons sold better in cities. Carder holds an official pedlar's licence for this purpose. \n\nCarder is founder of The Green Wood Guild, London's school of traditional woodwork, based at Stepney City Farm. The Guild also has a woodworking venue at Abney Park in Stoke Newington. The guild provides courses in woodworking, carving, whittling and bladesmithing and runs two regular clubs, Whittlers Anonymous and Spoonclub. \n\nCarder uses freshly cut (green) wood and traditional techniques to carve his spoons, usually using an axe, spoon knife (a curved bladed knife for hollowing out the bowl of the spoon), and small carving knife. The wood is sourced locally from parks in and around London and is recycled from trees which have been removed for conservation reasons. Carder states that a single spoon can take him from twenty minutes to two hours to carve. He opened his Hackney Road shop at the end of 2012 and carves in the shop window, where people often stop to watch. \n\nCarder has a display of some of his spoons in the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton, Massachusetts and his spoons have also sold in the Conran shop in Tokyo. In 2016 Carder and Robin Wood joined Stevie Parle during London Craft Week to explore wood-fired cooking and how dining from wooden utensils can affect the experience of eating. Carder has been described by the press as \"legendary\" and it has been said that \"No one in Britain knows more about crafting a spoon from green wood than Barn the Spoon\".\n\nIn May 2017 following the release of his book, Carder announced the lease on his shop is to expire and he hopes to leave London to be closer to nature. He launched a '1000 spoons' project where he intends to carve 1000 spoons from a single tree, using any profits to plant and maintain his own woodland.\n\nCarder teaches spoon and bowl carving at his shop on the Hackney Road and has run courses at various other venues around the UK including Stepney City Farm, Tate Britain, the Pitt Rivers Museum and Heal's.\n\nIn May 2017 Carder published his first book, a spoon carving guide entitled \"Spon: A Guide to Spoon Carving and the New Wood Culture\" published by Penguin Books. 'Spon' refers to the Anglo-Saxon English word for a wood chip which is believed to be the etymological root of spoon. In it Carder shows techniques and the appropriate use of tools used in creating different types of spoon.\nCarder explains the need to think in three dimensions, as with other forms of sculpture, and has said \n\nCarder is co-founder of Spoonfest with Robin Wood MBE (trustee and ex-chairman of the Heritage Crafts Association).

There were two major exceptions to this law: a child who had already graduated high school did not have to stay in school until turning eighteen; and a child who was sixteen years old and had passed the seventh grade was allowed to work as a farmer instead of attending school.\n\nThe Bing Bill was drafted for Ohio legislation by Ohio Council of Child Welfare’s education committee. Although the Bill had many supporters, women’s groups were the primary activists for the bill. On January 24, 1921, the bill was introduced to the Ohio House of Representatives by Simeon H. Bing from Gallia County, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Schools and President of Rio Grande College.\n\nThe Bing Bill was opposed by groups such and farmers and the Amish. They didn’t want to take their children out of the workforce and they knew it would cost them more with taxes being raised to run the schools. They also thought the schools would train the children to be delinquent and have bad behavior. Supporters argued that schooling will help the young farmers bring more efficient practices and modern ideas to the farms. \nThis law was created to stop child labor. Business wanted to employ children so that they could pay them less money than they would an adult worker. People who opposed child labor were for the Bing act because it mandated that children had to be at least sixteen years of age to work at most industries in Ohio. At age sixteen the children had to get a work permit from their parents and school to say they have passed the seventh grade and are allowed to work. \nWhen children were forced to attend school some families had some financial troubles because they relied on their children to help with the bills and help on the farms. The schools also had financial trouble because more children attended schools. Every school had to have equivalent education through the highs school level and rural schools needed transportation. The Ohio Legislature adopted a 3 percent sales tax that gave half of the funds to the school districts for education purposes and operating costs. With making schooling mandatory, school attendance went up. This reduced illiteracy and promoted good citizenry. Businessmen and industrialists were for the Bing bill because they wanted more intelligence in the work field.\n\n"}

He is currently the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Trustees, Khazar University (beginning from September, 2010); founder of integrated primary, secondary and high schools (Dunya School); and founder of a publishing house (all in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan) as well as a translator of poetry, lecturer, and editor.\n\nHe is a founding member of Eurasian Academy.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli ( () is the penname that he uses as a poet and in his publications in the fields of humanities and social sciences. All his works in mathematics have been published under the surname Isayev (H.A. Isayev, G.A. Isaev, etc. depending on the Western transliteration of his name). Nowadays he is better-known among the general public as Hamlet Isakhanli.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli's academic and literary works cover a broad range of fields including research in mathematics and in many areas of humanities and the social sciences, poetry, and creative writing. He is often described as a polymath displaying talent in a wide range of subjects.\n\nHis critical approach to the reform of education systems in countries with transitional economies has affected the thoughts and actions of educators, policy makers and general public. He has represented Azerbaijan and the broader region on cultural, scientific, educational, and political matters in North America, Europe and Russia, Asia and Africa.\nHamlet Isakhanli is a prominent thinker, influential to his own and new generations, public intellectual and cultural figure who speaks out about what he sees as radical conservatism and injustice. He has also become a noted public figure in Azerbaijan, often giving interviews for newspapers, magazines, internet-based news agencies, and television. He hosts a lecture-based broadcast on Public TV called \"Triangle of Science.\"\n\nHamlet’s father Abdulla Isakhan oglu Isayev (1926–1972) taught mathematics in a secondary school and his mother, Perikhanim, is a housewife.\n\nHamlet attended public school (elementary, secondary and high school) in his home village of Kosali (1954–1965) where the main language of instruction was Azeri with Russian as a second language, French as a foreign language and Georgian as an official language of Georgia. Hamlet finished this school with a gold medal for highest achievement.\n\nHis brothers live in a village in Georgia and in Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli’s wife, Naila Isayeva (née Asgarli), was born in Quba, Azerbaijan.

She works at Khazar University now, acting as the Human Resources Director and as coordinator of the Department of Psychology.\n\nFor more information on Hamlet Isakhanli's life through his academic, literary and public activities, see below.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli (G.A. Isaev, or H.A. Isayev in mathematical works) finished high school with a gold medal and was admitted to the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Azerbaijan State University (present-day Baku State University, BSU) in 1965. He graduated from BSU in 1970 with honors. In the same year, he was admitted to the postgraduate research course (aspirantura) at the Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics, Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, Baku, Azerbaijan, and sent to Lomonosov Moscow State University for his graduate education and research. In 1973, he defended his dissertation \"On Problems of Spectral Theory of Operator Pencils\" and received the Ph.D. (Kandidat nauk) degree in Physical-Mathematical sciences.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1983, he carried out research in mathematics in Moscow and Baku at Moscow State University, the Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, then Azerbaijan State University. During this period, he lectured occasionally. Later he also worked as professor at Azerbaijan State Institute of Oil and Chemistry (currently Azerbaijan State Oil Academy) and chaired the department of mathematics in the Baku campus of the Leningrad Institute of Economics and Finance.\n\nIsakhanli's articles were published in leading academic periodicals and transactions in the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, which brought him international recognition. In 1983, Hamlet Isakhanli defended his second doctoral dissertation (leading to a D.S. - Doctor of Science degree) \"On Problems of Multiparameter Spectral Theory\" at the V.I. Steklov Institute of Mathematics, Moscow. He received the degree of Doctor of Physical-Mathematical Sciences, and was later awarded the title of Professor by the Soviet Higher Attestation Committee.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli is recognised as a scholar of great research capacity in mathematics. He has performed research in various areas of mathematics and the applied sciences such as non-self-adjoint operator theory, multiparameter spectral theory, the theory of joint spectra, differential equations, numerical ranges, and mathematical models of economy. He is considered one of the founders of the modern Multiparameter Spectral Theory. He was the first Soviet mathematician to carry out scientific research in this field of study, which has its origin in mathematical physics.\n\nIsakhanli was not only a representative of the famous Moscow mathematics school, but his background also reflects achievements in the scientific schools of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. During the times of the Soviet \"Iron Curtain,\" in spite of some difficulties, he viewed the West not only from a distance, but also as a visiting professor. Scientific - research centers, academies and universities in Europe, the Americas and Asia continuously invited him to their institutions to deliver lectures, undertake joint research, and speak at international conferences. He in turn invited foreign scholars to Moscow and Baku to deliver lectures for furthering good relations between the East and the West. He achieved the establishment of an international academic network even in those Soviet times.\n\nHis achievements in the field of mathematics were highly praised by prominent mathematicians, particularly by members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as N.N.Bogolyubov, V.S.Vladimirov and S.M. Nikolskiy, Lenin Prize winners B.M. Levitan and V.B. Lidskiy, and by well-known mathematicians A. G. Kostyuchenko, A.A. Dezin, and V.A. Sadovnichiy (currently rector of Lomonosov Moscow State University), professor F.Atkinson (University of Toronto), professor P.J.Browne (University of Calgary), and other scholars. His published works are included in \"The List of Best Scientific Works of the Year\" by the Presidium (an Executive Committee) of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli is a scholar who has carried out research and produced significant results in various fields of sciences and arts, particularly outside of mathematics. Overall, he has written hundreds of articles, monographs, and textbooks in the philosophy of history, history of science, education and culture; education policy; theory and history of translation; language and literature; and in many other areas.\n\nThe book \"In Search of Khazar\" by Hamlet Isakhanli has become very popular in Azerbaijan and throughout the international community. His storytelling style connected with description of political, cultural, personal and psychological situations of the process of establishment of a new institution of higher education, and well-documented analyses of events of the time, make this a valuable book to read. \"The realities of events associated with the establishment and development of Khazar University have left indelible traces in my memory. I intend to pass these events to you in their entirety and in all sincerity,\" says the author in the introductory note to the book.\n\nHis research and writings on translation problems, on language policy, and on lexicography are worthy of esteem. A large article entitled \"Translating Poetry and Cross-cultural Communication: In Search of Beauty and Harmony Within Limited Borders\" devoted to the history and analyses of East-West communication through the translation highway, to problems of translation from and into Azerbaijani, and to problems of translating poetry, is a \"must, for constant reference\" according to one expert viewpoint.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli is one of the authors and co-editor of the Khazar English-Azerbaijani Comprehensive Dictionary in six volumes. This work has been completed for the most part; its first three volumes have already been published. This dictionary is, without a doubt, one of the monumental achievements of the Azerbaijani culture.\nThe textbook \"The Azerbaijani Language\" for foreigners, written by Hamlet Isakhanli with two co-authors, is based on the communicative approach and is a handbook to which foreigners and teachers may have recourse.\n\nIsakhanli an influential scholar, liberal intellectual, educator, writer and public speaker in the fields of history of science, philosophy and culture; philosophy of history; theory and history of literature, languages; translation studies; education; education policy; and history/philosophy of education. He has written books, numerous articles, policy papers and reports in addition to abundant interviews in TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, and bulletins. For a sampling of them see.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli discusses in his writings the problems of poetry and philosophy. political science and international relations, history, journalism, etc.\n\nA complete list of writings by Hamlet Isakhanli as well as others' writings about him is available in print as \"Hamlet Isaxanli: Bibliography. Scholar, Founder, Poet.\" \n\nHamlet Isakhanli is also well known and respected in Azerbaijan and other countries as a poet. Although he has written poems since childhood (Isakhanli remembers that the first poem he wrote was at age 9 while a primary school student), he did not begin to publish them until recently.\nHis poems are translated into Russian, English, German, Chinese, Ukrainian, Persian, Turkish, Georgian, Finnish/Suomi; Estonian, etc. His poetical volumes have been published in Azerbaijan \n(\"Təzadlar\", 2001; \"Bu da bir həyatdı\", 2004; \"Dördlüklər\", 2007; \"Ziyarət\", 2009), Russia (\"Контрасты\", ИзографЪ, 2006), Iran ( \"Şeirə dönən duyğular\" (\"ﺭﻻﻮ۔۔ﻐﯿﻮﺩ ڹ۔۔ﻧﺅﺪ ﮦﺭﻌﺷ\"), Əxtər nəşriyyatı, Təbriz, 2004; \"Təzadlar\" (\"ﺭﻻﺩﺎﻀﺘ\").

Blake, Robert Herrick, and Gérard de Nerval, Vasily Zhukovsky, Evgeny Baratynsky, Fyodor Tyutchev, Afanasy Fet, Sergei Yesenin, Nikolay Gumilev, Anna Akhmatova, and Alla Akhundova.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli's poems are melodic; for this reason his poems have attracted Azerbaijani composers' attention. Many of his lyric poems have been used for composing songs and musical spectacles.\n\nProminent national composers, the late Ramiz Mustafayev and the late Vasif Adigozalov, composed music - a hymn based on his poem \"My Khazar University\"; Ramiz Mustafayev – on the poem \"In Search of my Khazar\"; Vagif Garayzadeh - on the poem \"Parting\"; Lutfiyar Imanov – on the poem \"Life will be so easy\"; Naila Isayeva - on poems \"I just fell in love with you\", \"It is beautiful\", \"Poppy\", \"Lily\", \"Wind and a lassie\", \"I want to stay alone\", \"Come soon\", and \"My world\"; Tahir Akber -on four poems, Elza Seyidcahan - on the poems \"I couldn’t understand this world\" and \"Baku\", Jahangir Zulfugarov – on the poem \"Where we meet\", Dilara Gulamova - on the poems \"An old question\", \"Magical night\", \"Clouds lag behind childhood\", and musical spectacle \"The life path is just a moment\" based on a series of Hamlet Isakhanli's philosophical poems. His entire epic-lyric poem \"Pilgrimage\" was set to music by composer Javanshir Guliyev, who also composed eleven songs on the lyric by Hamlet Isakhanli. All these songs and musical spectacles are sung and performed by master-singers Lutfiyar Imanov, Flora Karimova, Brilliant Dadashova, Azer Zeynalov, Ilgar Muradov, Rashida Behbudova, Manana Japaridze, Gulyanaq Memmedova, Elza Seyidcahan, Samir Jafarov, Beture Huseynova, Anar Shushali, Yusif Savalan, Mehseti Cabbarova, Fadaya Lachin, Azerbaijani State Symphony Orchestra and Choir, the \"Savalan,\" \"Sheron\" and \"Kristal\" bands and others. Khanandas singing mugham such as Arif Babayev, Alim Qasimov, Nazakat Teymurova, Zabit Nabizadeh, and Zakir Aliyev also have used Hamlet Isakhanli’s poems while singing.\n\nBesides conducting his research and delivering lectures abroad during the Soviet Period, Hamlet Isakhanli was also interested in studying different aspects of educational organizations in the West. In the late 1980s, Isakhanli tried to explain to the public and to the government the meaning of and reasons for the crisis that was occurring in the Soviet and Azerbaijani Higher Education System. He showed ways to overcome the crisis and called for substantial reforms through his articles published in Azerbaijani and Russian newspapers and in speeches made on the radio and TV.\n\nNew ideas started to emerge and be implemented in a country that was living through political and economic crisis and war. Hamlet Isakhanli played an important role in that development.\nOn the one hand, he noted the necessity for step-by-step reforms in the entire education system; on the other hand, he emphasized the prospect of establishing new types of higher education institutions that would meet the demands of the new, rapidly changing and globalized world.\nIn his opinion, these new higher education institutions might benefit to some degree from US models of higher education (particularly in terms of curriculum, management, quality of teaching and research, university-industry relations, the knowledge economy and innovation, an interactive student-centered system based on credit accumulation, programs leading to Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees, extensive international relations, etc.), and they would play an important role not only in education and research, but also in the overall awareness and democratization of society as a whole.\n\nIn addition to thinking and writing about means for educational reform, Hamlet Isakhanli decided to establish a university. In this way he aimed to contribute to the process of implementing his own proposed reforms through his actions. As an outcome of these activities, official preparatory efforts by the Resolution of the Cabinet (Council) of Ministers of the Republic of (then Soviet!) Azerbaijan were carried out (dated on December 20, 1990). Khazar University (then called Azerbaijan University of the English Language) was subsequently created by a Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers dated March 18, 1991. The university, which began with seven teachers and 19 students, was the first private (not for profit) university established in Azerbaijan and one of the first officially established in the present-day post-Soviet area\n\nDue to its Western-type curricula and study programs, adoption of a flexible credit accumulation system and student-centered model of education, application of modern methods of management, establishment of broad and effective international relations, recruitment of high-quality local and foreign specialists, fighting against corruption in education, and generally speaking, provision of high-quality education under the direction of Hamlet Isakhanli, Khazar University became famous as one of the leading universities not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the wider geographical region covering the former Soviet area, particularly the Caucasus and Central Asia, and also the Middle East.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli decided to use English as a main language of instruction at Khazar. The reasons for this include providing ways to facilitate the use of books and other educational and research resources published in the West, for student exchange programs, for inviting visiting professors; and, in general, for breaking away from inertia and encouraging innovative thinking.\n\nThe innovative endeavors of Hamlet Isakhanli and Khazar University played an important role in the introduction and successful application of the two-cycled (Bachelor, Master) system and in methodology for evaluation in the higher education system of Azerbaijan, which was later envisaged in the Bologna Process on the creation of the European Higher Education Area. He was one of the main initiators in joining Azerbaijan to the Bologna Process in 2005.\n\nDunya School, established by Hamlet Isakhanli in 1998 and affiliated with Khazar University, providing education at the preschool, primary, secondary and high school levels, is a successful and highly sought-after school where schoolchildren receive bilingual education in the Azerbaijani and English.\n\nRecently (January 16, 2009) Dunya School gained an international status through accreditation by International Baccalaureate Organization - IBO. Namely, Dunya School as an IB World School now offers the IB Diploma Program to its students in the last two years of high school.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli not only put his ideas into practice in the higher education system; he is also trying to create a model for pre-university education that would be able to compete internationally. Thus he is realizing and providing the idea of lifelong education by building a network of education institutions from early childhood till PhD and professorship.\n\nAs part of the goal of providing lifelong education, Isakhanli also established the Khazar University Training Center which provides courses in foreign languages, all academic fields, standardized examination preparation, and musical instruments for students of all ages.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli is engaged within two worlds: mathematics and natural sciences along with the humanities and social sciences.\n\nIsakhanli is recognized as a scholar, leader, and public figure among intellectuals, scientists and men of arts, as well as the international community.\nHamlet Isakhanli is a member of international networks, associations, academies and boards, as well as a participant in and organizer of international projects and gatherings on different continents and various countries. He delivered plenary lectures at conferences held by UNESCO, NATO, UNDP, Council of Europe, etc. He has received honors and awards for his contribution to the development of research, education and culture.\nAs a member of the Education Commission under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Hamlet Isakhanli is actively participating in preparation and realization of reforms carried out in the fields of research, development and education.\n\nThe Assembly of Science and Art (), founded and chaired by Hamlet Isakhanli, has turned into a creative intellectual center where scholars and men of arts from diverse fields of study and creative young people come together and carry out discussions on various topics of the arts and sciences. Speeches of presenters from different countries and minutes of the discussions are published first in the Khazar Review magazine (previously Khazar View), then in separate books by Khazar University Press.\n\nHis editorship includes research journals and magazines both in the sciences and humanities, transactions of conferences, textbooks and monographs, encyclopedias and dictionaries, translations from various languages into Azerbaijani and vice versa in history, mass media, poetry, novels, etc.\n\nThrough his academic activity, creativity and leadership, Hamlet Isakhanli greatly contributed to human resources development, sending students and scholars to universities of developed countries as well as teaching and supervising them himself.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli taught mathematics and its applications, intellectual and cultural history, history of science and philosophy, and literature for many years in Azerbaijan in Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences), Baku State University, Azerbaijan State Oil Academy, Azerbaijan State Economic University, Khazar University, as well as in the Former Soviet Union, Europe and North America, Middle East and Far East for PhD, master and undergraduate students, helping and supervising them in their research works.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli focuses developing outlook and insight in his advanced (Master and PhD) students, taking them to the frontlines of research if they are ready to work hard. Scientists and researchers who have defended dissertations under his supervision now work in the USA, Europe, Russia, Israel, Turkey, Iran and in other countries.\n\nHamlet Isakhanli is a member of the well known Hajibayramli clan. His grandfather was a famous guerilla Isakhan Hajibayramli (1897–1930), who organized an armed rebellion against the Soviets during the collectivization period (in the late 1920s to 1930) in the territories of Georgia and Armenia. Isakhan is retained in the memory of the old generation for his bravery and chivalry. His 100-year anniversary was celebrated in both Azerbaijan and Georgia.\nHamlet's grandmother Zeynab and her children and close relatives were exiled from their home country to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan for two years.\n\n\n\nHamlet Isakhanli's many-sided activity and image have been broadly represented in literary, publicistic, scientific articles and books, and in art works written, made and performed by various authors, scholars, writers and artists.\n\nThe life and activity of the scholar have been thoroughly investigated in the book \"The Life of the Scholar and Founder\" by Fuad Tanriverdiyev, published in 1997. Another book, \"What I Brought to this World\" by Knyaz Aslan and Vahid Omarli, published in 2005 in both Azerbaijani and Russian languages, is devoted to brief descriptions of his academic and creative works, public and organizational life, and also contains the thoughts of well-known people of academia, arts and culture from various countries about Hamlet Isakhanli. Besides all this, scholars, writers, poets and journalists in Azerbaijan, the USA, Canada, Russia, Turkey, Georgia, Iran, India, China, Estonia and other countries have written and published works about his creative life and activities.\n\nA number of monographs and scientific articles properly appraise and contain reference to Isakhanli’s (Isayev’s) works, part of which is based on his research. At the same time in the Eastern and Western World, in developed and developing countries, he has repeatedly appeared as an interviewee and as a visitor of broadcasts and telecasts.\n\nThe poets Nariman Hasanzadeh, Huseyn Kurdoglu, Muzaffar Shukur, Shahin Fazil, Alla Akhundova, Saadat Buta and many others have devoted special poems to the person of Hamlet Isakhanli. In Azerbaijan, Jamal Mustafayev, Manaf Suleymanov, Rafael Naghiyev, Movlud Suleymanli, Mirabbas Gasimov, Vidadi Babanli, Zalimkhan Yagub, Bahlul Abdulla, Vagif Yusifli, Alirza Khalafli, Kamran Nazirli, Khalil Majidoglu, Aydin Khan, Tamilla Aliyeva, İrena Seidova, Maarifa Hajiyeva, Sevil Gulten, Elza Samadli, Hafiz Rustam and numerous other authors have written about his literary and academic activity.

On 23 June 2008, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Cambridge, in absentia.\n\nOn 11 December 2008, the press media reported that Pinter received an honorary degree (an honorary fellowship) from the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), in London, also in absentia, as he \"was forced to withdraw from the [honorary degree ceremony] event due to illness.\"\nIn October 2008, two months prior to his death on 24 December, Pinter also became honorary president of the Central School of Speech and Drama, a constituent college of the University of London, and received his 20th honorary award, from that institution, on 10 December 2008, in absentia because of illness.\n\nIn 1986, at an annual convention of the Modern Language Association (MLA), Steven H. Gale, who became the organisation's first president, brought together several American academic scholars to form The Harold Pinter Society, which later became an Allied Organization of the MLA and an Associated Organization of the Midwest Modern Language Association (M/MLA). The Pinter Society is international in membership and scope, according to the masthead of \"The Pinter Review\" and the Society's \"Webpages\" (home page). According to the website of the \"International Pinter Society\", its members are \"dedicated to studying, celebrating, and appraising the works of this prolific and frequently enigmatic writer\" (home page). As an MLA Allied Organization, it organises \"a business meeting, programs in which scholars present papers, and related social events at the MLA annual convention.\" The home page also lists the officers of the Society: President Ann C. Hall (Ohio Dominican University); Vice-President Mark Taylor-Batty (University of Leeds), who designs and maintains the Society's website; and Treasurer Judith Roof (Rice University), who edits and distributes its newsletters to an electronic subscribers' mailing list. The most recent newsletters can be downloaded from the Society's website.\n\nMembers of The Harold Pinter Society and individual and institutional subscribers receive \"The Pinter Review\", whose founding co-editors are Francis Gillen (University of Tampa) and Steven H. Gale (Kentucky State University), an academic journal first published in conjunction with the Pinter Society by The University of Tampa Press in 1987.\n\n\"The Pinter Review\" became a collection of \"Annual Essays\" in 1989 and then a biennial book publication of \"Collected Essays\" in 1997 and 1998; it is published in both hardcover and softcover editions. Each issue or volume contains a bibliography of works, productions, and other events by and about Pinter compiled by Bibliographical Editor Susan Hollis Merritt.\n\nThe cover of \"The Pinter Review: Collected Essays 2003 and 2004\" (published by The University of Tampa Press in 2004) features Pinter's poems \"Meeting\" (August 2002) and \"After Lunch\" (September 2002), which, along with some of his other recent poetry, are both posted on his official website.\n\n\"The Pinter Review: Nobel Prize/Europe Theatre Prize Volume: 2005–2008\", a special \"celebratory\" volume edited by Francis Gillen with Steven H. Gale, was published by The University of Tampa Press in 2008. Gillen updated his introduction with an \"Editor's Note\" to account for Pinter's death, which occurred on 24 December 2008, \"While this volume was going to press\" (xi). Consisting of 347 pages, this special volume is \"dedicated to Harold Pinter—in celebration\" and to the memory of Gillen's late wife, Marie C. Gillen. Among its contributions, it includes: the \"Presentation Speech for the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature\", by Per Wäsberg (3–5); Pinter's 2005 Nobel Lecture \"Art, Truth and Politics\" (6–17); and his May 2006 dramatic sketch \"Apart from That\" (18–19). The softcover edition and the dust jacket of the hardcover edition feature a photograph of \"p. 12\" of Pinter's handwritten manuscript of his 2005 Nobel Lecture. The volume's first page features the poem \"Grandpa\", written by Pinter's step-grandson Simon Soros between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 2008, after Pinter's death (Driscoll); and the second page (opposite) features the poem \"To My Wife\", written by Pinter for Antonia Fraser in June 2004. The \"Harold Pinter Bibliography: 2002–2004\" (262–343), compiled by Susan Hollis Merritt, includes a \"\"Special Supplement on the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature, October 2005 – May 2006\".\"\n\nThe University of Leeds's Workshop Theatre hosted Artist and Citizen: 50 Years of Performing Pinter, organised by Senior Lecturer in Theatre Studies Mark Taylor-Batty, for the Harold Pinter Society. From 12 to 14 April 2007, the conferees celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first production of Harold Pinter's first play, \"The Room\". On 13 April Pinter was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the School of English by University Chancellor Melvyn Bragg. Invited guests included: Harold Pinter, Henry Woolf, reprising his original role as Mr. Kidd in a revival of \"The Room\" and his performance as the Man in \"Monologue\" (1980); Michael Billington, leading a roundtable discussion on \"Working with Pinter\" with composer James Clarke, visiting playwright in residence Donald Freed, and Pinter directors Katie Read and Ian Rickson; and plenary speakers Steven H. Gale and Susan Hollis Merritt.\n\nThe conference poster features a photograph of a portrait of Harold Pinter by artist Amy Shuckburgh. The portrait (\"pastel and acrylic on wood, 2006\") was on display at the Workshop Theatre during the conference, displayed later at Trafalgar Studios, during Harry Burton's production of \"The Dumb Waiter\", and also \"reproduced in the programmes for The Dumb Waiter; the touring production of Old Times; Betrayal at the Donmar Warehouse; and The Hothouse at the National Theatre, London.\"\n\nFollowing the honorary degree ceremony, on the evening of 13 April 2007, the Free Theatre, of Minsk, Belarus, where several of its members have been censored, imprisoned, and \"under attack\" by the authorities, performed their \"collage\" of Pinter's work \"Being Harold Pinter\", introduced by \"their patron\" Sir Tom Stoppard, receiving strong notices from Billington and his colleagues; Pinter participated in the post-performance discussion with the company through a Belarusian-English interpreter. After Pinter added his support to recommendations by Tom Stoppard, Václav Havel, and Arthur Kopit, the European Theatre Convention invited the Belarus Free Theatre to become a member, waiving the membership fee.\n\nGoldsmiths College, University of London, inaugurated its Pinter Centre in June 2003, installing Harold Pinter as its honorary president. Directed by Professor of Drama Robert Gordon, it is \"an interdisciplinary research centre, involving principally the Departments of English & Comparative Literature and of Drama, the latter organising and hosting the Centre, and with links in Media and Communications, Music, PACE and the Digital Studios.\" Consistent with \"Pinter's keen awareness of the centrality of political issues\", according to its mission statement, the Pinter Centre \"is particularly committed to looking at postcolonial and diasporic literature and performance, and the ways in which contemporary creativity is forging new forms that respond to the cultural diversity of the world in which we live. It also has a strong interest in questions of gender, and writing and performing the body.\"\n\nThe section on the Pinter Centre in \"Introducing the Department of Drama\", part of a document on \"Drama\" published by Goldsmiths, observes that \"The Department of Drama founded the Pinter Centre in 2003 as an interdisciplinary research centre dedicated to performance research\"; after it \"widened its remit to embrace both performance and writing\", the Pinter Centre was renamed to include Creative Writing, \"becoming the focus for the many different writing courses and research activities concerned with writing and dramaturgy within Goldsmiths.\" Among its previous conferences and symposia, the Pinter Centre hosted \"an international conference\" on Stephen Sondheim: Collaborator and Auteur, in 2005, and, Ravenhill 10, \"a major conference to celebrate 10 years of work by the playwright Mark Ravenhill, in November 2006.\n\nThe Pinter Centre's official website (as periodically updated) provides news and a schedule of its upcoming events; information about its collaborative research project \"Beyond the Linear Narrative: Fractured Narratives in Writing and Performance in the Postcolonial era\"; \"The Pinter Centre Blog\" (\"a resource for anyone interested in the work and influence of Harold Pinter, post-colonial writing and performance, life writing and the future of the fractured narrative\", the focus of its Beyond the Linear Narrative project); \"In Memoriam: Harold Pinter\"; the \"Department of Drama\" at Goldsmiths; and related links.\n\n\"Harold Pinter: A Bibliographical History\", compiled by William Baker and John C. Ross, was published by the British Library and Oak Knoll Press in 2005. As a result of Pinter's winning the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature, according to its publisher, the book, which \"provides a comprehensive account of the print-published writings, and texts in other media, which he has wholly or partly authored\", became an academic library best-seller.\n\nSusan Hollis Merritt provides an intensive analysis of the book in \"The Pinter Review: Nobel Prize/Europe Theatre Prize Volume\" (238–60; dust jacket).\n\nThe Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library is the literary archive of Harold Pinter, which Pinter had first placed \"on permanent loan\" in the British Library in September 1993 and which became a permanent acquisition in December 2007. On 11 December 2007 the British Library announced that it had purchased Pinter's literary archive for ₤1.1 million (approx. $2.24 million), augmenting its current \"Harold Pinter Archive\" of 80 boxes (\"Loan 110 A\"). It comprises \"over one hundred and fifty boxes of manuscripts, scrapbooks, letters, photographs, programmes, and emails\", constituting \"an invaluable resource for researchers and scholars of Pinter's work for stage, cinema, and poetry.\" The work of cataloguing the full archive, a process documented in the BL's official \"Harold Pinter Archive Blog\", was completed in December 2008 (before Pinter's death on the 24th), the description of its contents was uploaded to the BL \"Additional Manuscripts Online Catalogue\" on 2 February 2009, and then the archive was re-opened to qualified researchers and scholars.\n\nPinter satirises academics or intellectual \"distance\" in several of his plays, beginning with his character Edward, a scholarly writer, in \"A Slight Ache\" (1959) and continuing with Teddy, an English philosophy professor in an American university who refuses to become \"lost in it\", in \"The Homecoming\" (1965), and Devlin, an English academic, in \"Ashes to Ashes\" (1996).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4143738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4143738", "title": "International Year of Astronomy", "text": "International Year of Astronomy\n\nThe International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) was a year-long celebration of astronomy that took place in 2009 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first recorded astronomical observations with a telescope by Galileo Galilei and the publication of Johannes Kepler's \"Astronomia nova\" in the 17th century. The Year was declared by the 62nd General Assembly of the United Nations. A global scheme, laid out by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), was also endorsed by UNESCO, the UN body responsible for educational, scientific, and cultural matters.\n\nThe IAU coordinated the International Year of Astronomy in 2009. This initiative was an opportunity for the citizens of Earth to gain a deeper insight into astronomy’s role in enriching all human cultures. Moreover, served as a platform for informing the public about the latest astronomical discoveries while emphasizing the essential role of astronomy in science education. IYA2009 was sponsored by Celestron and Thales Alenia Space.\n\nOn 25 September 1608, Hans Lippershey, a spectacle-maker from Middelburg, traveled to the Hague, the then capital of the Netherlands, to demonstrate to the Dutch government a new device he was trying to patent: a telescope. Although Hans was not awarded the patent, Galileo heard of this story and decided to use the \"Dutch perspective glass\" and point it towards the heavens.\n\nIn 1609, Galileo Galilei first turned one of his telescopes to the night sky and made astounding discoveries that changed mankind's conception of the world: mountains and craters on the Moon, a plethora of stars invisible to the naked eye, and moons around Jupiter. Astronomical observatories around the world promised to reveal how planets and stars are formed, how galaxies assemble and evolve, and what the structure and shape of our Universe actually are.\nIn the same year, Johannes Kepler published his work \"Astronomia nova\", in which he described the fundamental laws of planetary motions.\n\nHowever Galileo was not the first to observe the Moon through a telescope and make a drawing of it. Thomas Harriot observed and detailed the Moon some months before Galileo. \"It's all about publicity. Galileo was extremely good at irritating people and also using creative writing to communicate what he was learning in a way that made people think,\" says Pamela Gay in an interview with Skepticality in 2009.\n\nThe vision of IYA2009 was to help people rediscover their place in the Universe through the sky, and thereby engage a personal sense of wonder and discovery. IYA2009 activities took place locally, nationally, regionally and internationally. National Nodes were formed in each country to prepare activities for 2009. These nodes established collaborations between professional and amateur astronomers, science centres and science communicators. More than 100 countries were involved, and well over 140 participated eventually. To help coordinate this huge global programme and to provide an important resource for the participating countries, the IAU established a central Secretariat and the IYA2009 website as the principal IYA2009 resource for public, professionals and media alike.\n\nAstronomy, perhaps the oldest science in history, has played an important role in most, if not all, cultures over the ages. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 (IYA2009) was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy, but in science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.\n\nThe IYA2009 marked the monumental leap forward that followed Galileo's first use of the telescope for astronomical observations, and portrays astronomy as a peaceful global scientific endeavour that unites amateur and professional astronomers in an international and multicultural family that works together to find answers to some of the most fundamental questions that humankind has ever asked. The aim of the Year was to stimulate worldwide interest in astronomy and science under the central theme \"The Universe, Yours to Discover.\"\n\nSeveral committees were formed to oversee the vast majority of IYA2009 activities (\"sidewalk astronomy\" events in planetariums and public observatories), which spun local, regional and national levels. These committees were collaborations between professional and amateur astronomers, science centres and science communicators. Individual countries were undertaking their own initiatives as well as assessing their own national needs, while the IAU acted as the event's coordinator and catalyst on a global scale. The IAU plan was to liaise with, and involve, as many as possible of the ongoing outreach and education efforts throughout the world, including those organized by amateur astronomers.\n\nThe major goals of IYA2009 were to:\n\nAs part of the scheme, IYA2009 helped less-well-established organizations from the developing world to become involved with larger organizations and deliver their contributions, linked via a huge global network. This initiative also aimed at reaching economically disadvantaged children across the globe and enhancing their understanding of the world.\n\nThe central hub of the IAU activities for the IYA2009 was the IYA2009 Secretariat. This was established to coordinate activities during the planning, execution and evaluation of the Year. The Secretariat was based in the European Southern Observatory headquarters in the town of Garching near Munich, Germany. The Secretariat was to liaise continuously with the National Nodes, Task Groups, Partners and Organizational Associates, the media and the general public to ensure the progress of the IYA2009 at all levels. The Secretariat and the website were the major coordination and resource centers for all the participating countries, but particularly for those developing countries that lack the national resources to mount major events alone.\n\nThe International Year of Astronomy 2009 was supported by eleven Cornerstone projects. These are global programs of activities centered on specific themes and are some of the projects that helped to achieve IYA2009's main goals; whether it is the support and promotion of women in astronomy, the preservation of dark-sky sites around the world or educating and explaining the workings of the Universe to millions, the eleven Cornerstones were the key elements in the success of IYA2009.\n\n100 Hours of Astronomy (100HA) is a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009 and was part of the scheduled global activities of the International Year of Astronomy 2009. The main goal of 100HA was to have as many people throughout the world as possible looking through a telescope just as Galileo did for the first time 400 years ago. The event included special webcasts, students and teachers activities, a schedule of events at science centers, planetariums and science museums as well as 24 hours of sidewalk astronomy, which allowed the opportunity for public observing sessions to as many people as possible.\n\nThe Galileoscope was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009, where the program was to share a personal experience of practical astronomical observations with as many people as possible across the world. It was collaborating with the US IYA2009 National Node to develop a simple, accessible, easy-to-assemble and easy-to-use telescope that can be distributed by the millions. In theory, every participant in an IYA2009 event should be able to take home one of these little telescopes, enabling them to observe with an instrument similar to Galileo's one.\n\nThe Cosmic Diary, a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April, was not about the science of astronomy, but about what it is like to be an astronomer. Professionals were to blog in texts and images about their life, families, friends, hobbies and interests, as well as their work, latest research findings and the challenges they face. The bloggers represented a vibrant cross-section of working astronomers from all around the world. They wrote in many different languages, from five continents. They have also written feature article \"explanations\" about their specialist fields, which were highlighted in the website. NASA, ESA and ESO all had sub-blogs as part of the Cosmic Diary Cornerstone.\n\nThe Portal to the Universe (PTTU) was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009, to provide a global, one-stop portal for online astronomy contents, serving as an index, aggregator and a social-networking site for astronomy content providers, laypeople, press, educators, decision-makers and scientists. PTTU was to feature news, image, event and video aggregation; a comprehensive directory of observatories, facilities, astronomical societies, amateur astronomy societies, space artists, science communication universities; and Web 2.0 collaborative tools, such as the ranking of different services according to popularity, to promote interaction within the astronomy multimedia community. In addition, a range of \"widgets\" (small applications) were to be developed to tap into existing \"live data\". Modern technology and the standardisation of metadata made it possible to tie all the suppliers of such information together with a single, semi-automatically updating portal.\n\nPromoting gender equality and empowering women is one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. She Is an Astronomer was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009, to promote gender equality in astronomy (and science in general), tackling bias issues by providing a web platform where information and links about gender balance and related resources are collected.\nThe aim of the project was to provide neutral, informative and accessible information to female professional and amateur astronomers, students, and those who are interested in the gender equality problem in science. Providing this information was intended to help increase the interest of young girls in studying and pursuing a career in astronomy.\nAnother objective of the project was to build and maintain an Internet-based, easy-to-handle forum and database, where people regardless of geographical location could read about the subject, ask questions and find answers. There was also to be the option to discuss astronomy-sector-specific problems, such as observing times and family duties.\n\nDark Skies Awareness was a worldwide astronomy event that ran from 2 to 5 April 2009. The IAU collaborated with the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), representatives of the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), the Starlight Initiative, and other national and international partners in dark-sky and environmental education on several related themes.\nThe focus was on three main citizen-scientist programs to measure local levels of light pollution. These programs were to take the form of \"star hunts\" or \"star counts\", providing people with a fun and direct way to acquire heightened awareness about light pollution through firsthand observations of the night sky. Together, the three programs were to cover the entire International Year of Astronomy 2009, namely GLOBE at Night (in March), the Great World Wide Star Count (in October) and How Many Stars (January, February, April through September, November and December).\n\nUNESCO and the IAU were working together to implement a research and education collaboration as part of UNESCO's thematic initiative, Astronomy and World Heritage as a worldwide astronomy event that also ran 2–5 April 2009. The main objective was to establish a link between science and culture on the basis of research aimed at acknowledging the cultural and scientific values of properties connected with astronomy. This programme provides an opportunity to identify properties related to astronomy located around the world, to preserve their memory and save them from progressive deterioration. Support from the international community is needed to implement this activity and to promote the recognition of astronomical knowledge through the nomination of sites that celebrate important achievements in science.\n\nThe Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP): the International Year of Astronomy 2009 provided an opportunity to engage the formal education community in the excitement of astronomical discovery as a vehicle for improving the teaching of science in classrooms around the world. To help training teachers in effective astronomy communication and to sustain the legacy of IYA2009, the IAU – in collaboration with the National Nodes and leaders in the field such as the Global Hands-On Universe project, the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific – embarked on a unique global effort to empower teachers by developing the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP).\n\nThe GTTP goal was to create a worldwide network of certified \"Galileo Ambassadors\" by 2012. These Ambassadors were to train \"Galileo Master Teachers\" in the effective use and transfer of astronomy education tools and resources into classroom science curricula. The Galileo Teachers were to be equipped to train other teachers in these methodologies, leveraging the work begun during IYA2009 in classrooms everywhere. Through workshops, online training tools and basic education kits, the products and techniques developed by this program could be adapted to reach locations with few resources of their own, as well as computer-connected areas that could take advantage of access to robotic optical and radio telescopes, webcams, astronomy exercises, cross-disciplinary resources, image processing and digital universes (web and desktop planetariums). Among GTTP partners, the Global Hands-On Universe project was a leader.\n\nUniverse Awareness (UNAWE) was a worldwide astronomy event that also ran during 2–5 April 2009, as an international program to introduce very young children in under-privileged environments to the scale and beauty of the Universe. Universe Awareness noted the multicultural origins of modern astronomy in an effort to broaden children's minds, awaken their curiosity in science and stimulate global citizenship and tolerance. Using the sky and children's natural fascination with it as common ground, UNAWE was to create an international awareness of their place in the Universe and their place on Earth.\n\nThe Cornerstone project From Earth to the Universe (FETTU) is a worldwide public science event that began in June 2008, and still ongoing through 2011. This project has endeavored to bring astronomy images and their science to a wider audience in non-traditional informal learning venues. In placing these astronomy exhibitions in public parks, metro stations, art centers, hospitals, shopping malls and other accessible locations, it has been hoped that individuals who might normally ignore or even dislike astronomy, or science in general, will be engaged.\n\nThe Developing Astronomy Globally was a worldwide astronomy event that ran during 2–5 April 2009, as a Cornerstone project to acknowledge that astronomy needs to be developed in three key areas: professionally (universities and research); publicly (communication, media, and amateur groups) and educationally (schools and informal education structures). The focus was to be on regions that do not already have strong astronomical communities. The implementation was to be centred on training, development and networking in each of these three key areas.\n\nThis Cornerstone was using the momentum of IYA2009 to help establish and enhance regional structures and networks that work on the development of astronomy around the world. These networks were to support the current and future development work of the IAU and other programmes, plus ensure that developing regions could benefit from IYA2009 and the work of the other Cornerstone projects. It was to also address the question of the contribution of astronomy to development.\n\nThe Galilean Nights was a worldwide astronomy event that also ran 2–5 April 2009, as a project to involve both amateur and professional astronomers around the globe, taking to the streets their telescopes and pointing them as Galileo did 400 years ago. The sources of interest were Jupiter and its moons, the Sun, our Moon and many others celestial marvels. The event was scheduled to take place on 22–24 October 2009. Astronomers were to share their knowledge and enthusiasm for space by encouraging as many people as possible to look through a telescope at planetary neighbours.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1095131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1095131", "title": "Kinesthetic learning", "text": "Kinesthetic learning\n\nKinesthetic learning (American English), kinaesthetic learning (British English), or tactile learning is a learning style in which learning takes place by the students carrying out physical activities, rather than listening to a lecture or watching demonstrations. As cited by Favre (2009), Dunn and Dunn define kinesthetic learners as students who require whole-body movement to process new and difficult information.\nKinesthetic intelligence, which was originally coupled with tactile abilities, was defined and discussed in Howard Gardner's \"\" in 1983. In this book, Gardner describes activities such as dancing and performing surgery as requiring great kinesthetic intelligence: using the body to create (or do) something.\n\nMargaret H'Doubler wrote and spoke about kinesthetic learning during the 1940s, defining kinesthetic learning as the human body's ability to express itself through movement and dance.\n\nNeil Fleming, a New Zealand teacher and educational theorist, designed the VARK model (visual, aural or auditory, read/write and kinesthetic). According to Fleming’s model, kinesthetic learners are similar to tactile learners in that they like hands-on experiential learning. They excel in concrete learning such as on-the-job training, work experience, internships, simulations and so forth (Kte’pi, 2016).\n\nThe Fleming VAK/VARK model (one of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles) categorized learning styles as follows:\nSkill memory also fits into the category of kinesthetic learning, as it is what happens when somebody is learning kinesthetically. Skill memories are difficult to convey except by direct demonstration, may be acquired without awareness, and require several repetitions.\n\nRita Dunn contends that kinesthetic and tactile learning are the same style. Galeet BenZion asserts that kinesthetic and tactile learning are separate learning styles, with different characteristics. She defined kinesthetic learning as the process that results in new knowledge (or understanding) with the involvement of the learner's body movement. This movement is performed to establish new knowledge or extend existing knowledge. Kinesthetic learning is at its best, BenZion found, when the learner uses language (their own words) in order to define, explain, resolve and sort out how their body's movement reflects the concept explored. One example is a student using movement to work out the sum of 1/2 plus 3/4 via movement, then explaining how their motions in space reflect the mathematical process leading to the correct answer.\n\nIn addition, Denig (2004) in his article ‘Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions’, presented Dunn and Dunn’s Learning Styles Model, which addresses 21 elements that affect students’ learning. These elements are broken down into five stimuli: environmental, emotional, sociological, physiological and psychological variables. Under this model, physiological stimuli consist of four elements, one of which is perceptual. Perceptual depicts the auditory, visual, tactual and kinesthetic styles whereby learners learn more effectively. This gives meaning to the concept that kinesthetic learners learn best through whole-body activities and experiences while tactual learners learn best through manipulation of items with their hands.\n\nDepending upon memory systems the kinesthetic learners respond differently. The different kinds of learners mainly include whole body learners, hands-on learners, doodlers, students learning through emotional experiences. The learning and the memory is generally short term. To achieve a long term memory different techniques can be used depending on the learning style. Mind mapping, story mapping, webbing, drawing can be used to enhance the learning of a doodler. For the hands-on learner, role play, clay, building and math manipulative can be used. The whole book body learner can learn better through role-playing, body mapping, puzzles and use of computer technology which allows for certain movement while learning. Students can be engaged in group activities and activities which involve bodily movement such as dance, drama, sports can be used to nurture their learning. The following strategies can be used to facilitate kinesthetic memory through procedural motor pathway such as:\nThe kinesthetic learners who have memories associated with emotions learning can be facilitated through dance, debate, drama, role-play, and charades. This kind of learning leads to a long-term memory since it is associated with emotions such as excitement, curiosity, anger, disappointment and success.\n\nPerceptual-motor skills are skills learned by movement patterns guided by sensory inputs. There are closed skills and open skills. Closed skills are skills learned such as dance. A ballerina learns a specific set of moves and doesn’t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option. Open skills are skills that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports. A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can't know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open skills are required to become successful. Cognitive skills also are a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories. Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well. Cognitive skills are skills which require individuals to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move their bodies based on what they perceive. Solving a puzzle would be an example of a cognitive skill.\n\nLearners with kinesthetic preferences learn through active movements and experiences. Activities such as playing, puppetry, drama, acting and designing ensures involvement of the learners. Thus, it is also important to manage the students during such activities.\n\nSome effective strategies used to involve unmotivated students during activities are:\nSome effective strategies used to manage hyper motivated students are:\n\nSubjects can be taught to cater for kinesthetic learners. Through a strength-based and learner-centered approach, educators should engage kinesthetic students in activities that require movements because they learn by doing. Activities could include role-plays, drama, dance, races and competitions, field trips and projects.\n\nFavre (2009) stated that instructional strategies should include movement in a game-like format. Favre suggested designing kinesthetic games. For example, “game boards such as Tic-Tac-Toe affixed to the classroom floor and hopscotch template painted on the playground tarmac or sidewalks around the school” (p. 32). Favre also suggested that instructors can use “commercial games such as Twister, Jeopardy and Nerf basketball and create game cards that align with their lesson objectives” (pp.32-33) . \n\nReese & Dunn (2007) in their research of college freshmen learning styles provided recommended that \"to ensure success for kinesthetic learners, classes should provide active experiences for planning or carrying out objectives, such as visits, project, role playing, simulations and floor or wall games\"(p. 108). \n\nAlthough the concept of learning styles is popular among educators in some countries (and children and adults express preferences for particular modes of learning), there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes; on the contrary, there is substantial evidence that the meshing hypothesis (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid. Well-designed studies \"flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis\".\n\nProponents state that the evidence related to kinesthetic learners benefiting from specialized instruction (or targeted materials) appears mixed at best; the diagnosis of kinesthetic and tactile learning is coupled (rather than isolated), and teachers are likely to misdiagnose students' learning styles.\n\nOn the other hand, studies do show that mixed-modality presentations (for instance, using auditory and visual techniques) improve results in a variety of subjects. Instruction that stimulates more than auditory learning (for example, kinesthetic learning) is more likely to enhance learning in a heterogeneous student population.\n\nThere are three parts of the brain that are the most important to kinesthetic and skill learning. The basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and the cerebellum all play equally important roles in the ability to learn new skills and master them.\n\nThe basal ganglia are a collection of ganglia (clusters of neurons) that lie at the base of the forebrain. The basal ganglia receive information from other parts of the brain such as the hippocampus and cortical areas that send messages about the outside world. Most of these messages are sensory, meaning what a person is physically feeling. The basal ganglia then interpret this information and sends it on a path to the thalamus and the brainstem which both play large factors in physical movement. Therefore, the basal ganglia are the beginning of the process for somebody who is learning-by-doing to respond viscerally to the stimuli around them. It is important once a skill is learned to practice it. This can change how basal ganglia circuits participate in the performance of that skill and that synaptic plasticity is a basic neural mechanism enabling such changes. The more a person practices, the more plasticity they develop.\n\nThe cerebral cortex is the brain tissue covering the top and sides of the brain in most vertebrates. It is involved in storing and processing of sensory inputs and motor outputs. In the human brain, the cerebral cortex is actually a sheet of neural tissue about 1/8th inch thick. The sheet is folded so that it can fit inside the skull. The neural circuits in this area of the brain expand with practice of an activity, just like the synaptic plasticity grows with practice. Clarification of some of the mechanisms of learning by neuro science has been advanced, in part, by the advent of non-invasive imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). These technologies have allowed researchers to observe human learning processes directly. Through these types of technologies, we are now able to see and study what happens in the process of learning. In different tests performed the brain being imaged showed a greater blood flow and activation to that area of the brain being stimulated through different activities such as finger tapping in a specific sequence. It has been revealed that the process at the beginning of learning a new skill happens quickly, and later on slows down to almost a plateau. This process can also be referred to as The Law of Learning. The slower learning showed in the FMRI that in the cerebral cortex this was when the long term learning was occurring, suggesting that the structural changes in the cortex reflect the enhancement of skill memories during later stages of training. When a person studies a skill for a longer duration of time, but in a shorter amount of time they will learn quickly, but also only retain the information into their short-term memory. Just like studying for an exam; if a student tries to learn everything the night before, it will not stick in the long run. If a person studies a skill for a shorter duration of time, but more frequently and long-term, their brain will retain this information much longer as it is stored in the long-term memory. Functional and structural studies of the brain have revealed a vast interconnectivity between diverse regions of the cerebral cortex. For example, large numbers of axons interconnect the posterior sensory areas serving vision, audition, and touch with anterior motor regions. Constant communication between sensation and movement makes sense, because to execute smooth movement through the environment, movement must be continuously integrated with knowledge about one's surroundings obtained via sensory perception. The cerebral cortex plays a role in allowing humans to do this.\n\nThe cerebellum is critical to the ability for a human or animal to be able to regulate movement. This area of the brain wraps around the brainstem and is very densely packed with neurons and neural connections. This part of the brain is involved in timing as well as movement. It assists in predicting events, especially in the formation, execution, and timing of conditioned responses. The cerebellum plays a very important role in all forms of kinesthetic learning and motor function. For a ballerina, it is important to be able to control their movements and time it exactly right for their routine. For a football player it is important to be able to regulate movement when running throwing, and being able to have control over where the ball goes as well as the timing of it.\n\nAll three of these important systems in the brain function together as a team, one not being more important than the other. They work together to allow for responding to sensory events, timing, controlling physical actions, and more. However, it is important to remember than unless a person is actively practicing, these parts of the brain won't help them get to their full potential. Alterations in the brain that occur during learning seem to make the nerve cells more efficient or powerful. Studies have shown that animals raised in complex environments have a greater volume of capillaries per nerve cell—and therefore a greater supply of blood to the brain—than the caged animals, regardless of whether the caged animal lived alone or with companions. Overall, these studies depict an orchestrated pattern of increased capacity in the brain that depends on experience.\n\n"}

Lakehead University, shortened to 'Lakehead U', or 'LU', is non-denominational and provincially supported. It has undergraduate programs, graduate programs, the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law, the only internationally accredited (AACSB) business school in northern Ontario, and is home to the western campus of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine. \n\nLakehead has more than 45,000 alumni. The main campus in Thunder Bay has about 7,900 students. As of September 2006, a new permanent extension campus in Orillia, located about north of Toronto, has about 1,400 students.\n\nLakehead University evolved from Lakehead Technical Institute and Lakehead College of Arts, Science, and Technology.\n\nLakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology was established by an Act of the Ontario Legislature proclaimed on August 1, 1957. Years later, the original Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology Act was amended to grant the college authority to establish new faculties, and confer degrees in arts and sciences. The Lakehead University Act, 1965, was given royal assent on June 22, 1965, and came into force on July 1, 1965. The \"Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology\", thereafter known as \"Lakehead University,\" was continued under this new charter. The first degrees were conferred on May 5, 1965. The first university chancellor was Senator Norman McLeod Paterson.\n\nThe original college site comprised about 32 hectares of land in south-west Port Arthur, Ontario. From 1962 to 1965, an additional 87 hectares of adjoining land was purchased in anticipation of future expansion. The first building was opened in 1957.\n\nIn 2005 the Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) was formed as a joint initiative between Lakehead University and Laurentian University in Sudbury organized within the Faculty of Medicine of both Laurentian (East Campus) and Lakehead (West Campus) universities. The medical school has multiple teaching and research sites across Northern Ontario, including large and small communities. Students are given a choice of attending either one of the two main NOSM campuses. NOSM is the only Canadian medical school to be established as a stand-alone not-for-profit corporation, with its own Board of Directors and corporation bylaws.\n\nA new law school was established; the faculty accepted its first students in 2013. The program is housed in the former Port Arthur Collegiate Institute. In 2014 it was named the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law, after the fourteenth Chief Justice of Canada.\n\nLakehead University's physical plant now consists of 39 buildings and 116 hectares of property including 40 hectares of landscaped and maintained grounds.\n\nLakehead University opened a campus at Heritage Place in Downtown Orillia in 2006; during the first semester there were about 100 students.\n\nIn September 2010 the university expanded to its new 500 University Avenue location. A new academic building at this site represents the first phase in the development of Canada’s first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum university campus. A 271-bed student residence building and a cafeteria/bookstore facility opened in November 2012 at the University Avenue site. Lakehead Orillia now has over 1,400 students studying at the Heritage Place and University Avenue sites. Undergraduate programs are offered at the 500 University Avenue site, while the professional year of Lakehead – Orillia’s education programs are offered at the downtown campus.\n\nAccommodations at Lakehead are divided into three living styles: residence halls, apartments and townhouses. The Thunder Bay residence currently has a total of 1,196 beds and three cafeteria/dining halls. Students can choose from meal options that range from kitchenette, full-kitchen and complete meal plan depending on the residence styles.\n\nThe men's residence for 52 students was opened in fall of 1962, and has grown to include a residence village consisting of 10 new buildings. The village is situated on the banks of the McIntyre River within five-minute walking distance of all university buildings and athletic facilities.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, a complex of townhouses, including some handicap accessible units, was added to the residence facility.\n\nA 271-bed residence in Orillia opened its doors in late Fall 2012. The Orillia residence has one mandatory meal plan for students, as well as one cafeteria, owned by Madison County.\n\nThe university supports a research station near Thunder Bay to test newly developed crop varieties. The station had been in operation for a number of years, and was officially taken over by the university in 2018.\n\nThe university has nine faculties: Business Administration, Education, Engineering, Natural Resources Management, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, Science and Environmental Studies, Social Sciences and Humanities, Medicine, and Graduate Studies. The Faculty of Law welcomed its first students in September 2013.\n\nBy full-time undergraduate enrollment, the Social Sciences & Humanities is the largest faculty at Lakehead, with about 30% of the students, followed by Health and Behavioral Sciences, Science & Environmental Studies, Engineering, Education, and Business Administration. Two small faculties are Natural Resources Management and Medicine, each with less than 2% of the student enrollment.\n\nAs a percentage of total student population, Lakehead University has one of the largest aboriginal student communities in Canada. The university has a governing board with senate policies along with Aboriginal-governed councils within its university governance structure. Lakehead also offers Aboriginal support including the Office of Aboriginal Initiatives. Special first-year bridging programs for Aboriginal students are provided. Tutoring services are available within Lakehead’s Native Nursing Access Program. There is also the Superior Science Program which goes to remote Aboriginal communities. Lakehead has Canada's only Department of Aboriginal Education to foster Native Language instruction and prepare teachers to meet the needs of Aboriginal students and communities.\n\nLakehead University scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Hamlin Family Fund Nursing Bursaries; Hamlin Family Fund Bursary; Hamlin Family Fund Native Bursary; Lakehead University Native Award; TBayTel Bursary \n\nApart from these awards, Lakehead University provides entrance scholarships to high school students with marks above 80%, paid out during four years of undergraduate. Lakehead also offers free tuition to students with a 95% average or higher.\n\nLakehead University Student Union, or LUSU, serves as a governing body for student-run clubs. Students can participate in various activities in clubs ranging from student government to multi-cultural and athletics. LUSU is also responsible for publishing the student newspaper, The Argus, as well as running The Study Coffeehouse and The Outpost Pub. These sites serve as gathering places for many campus community activities and as performance venues.\n\nLakehead's Thunder Bay campus has two main athletic facilities known as the Fieldhouse and the Hangar. The Fieldhouse contains a main gymnasium, weight room, squash court, 50-meter swimming pool and change-room facilities. The Hangar has a 200-meter indoor track, soccer field, cardio area, aerobic studio and a climbing wall. Lakehead University is represented in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport league by the Lakehead Thunderwolves. Varsity teams include: Basketball, Cross-Country, Hockey, Nordic Skiing, Track & Field, Volleyball, and Wrestling.

Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.\n\nThe following table shows some of the most crucial variables to consider:\nSeveral special education approaches have been developed for students with dyslexia. Adaptive technology, such as specialized computer software, has resulted in recent innovations helpful to many people with dyslexia.\n\nOne factor that characterises the field of dyslexia remediation is the stream of alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities. These controversial treatments include nutritional supplements, special diets, homeopathy, and osteopathy/chiropractic manipulation.\n\nA writing system is a type of symbolic system used to represent elements or statements expressible in language.\nThe orthography of a language specifies the correct way of using a specific writing system to write the language. Where more than one writing system is used for a language, for example for Kurdish, there can be more than one orthography.\n\nMost teaching is geared to remediating specific areas of weakness, such as addressing difficulties with phonetic decoding by providing phonics-based tutoring. Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners. Despite claims of some programs to be \"research based\", there is very little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular approach to reading instruction as compared to another when used with dyslexic children.\n\nTorgesen (2004) emphasized the importance of explicit instruction for remediation as well as the need for intensity that is completely different from regular classroom instruction. To make gains in reading, students need highly structured, sequential interactive activities and close monitoring, directly connecting the known with the new, with sufficient time for practice of new skills to build automaticity and fluency. The size of the instructional group is also important, ideally between 1:1 and 1:3.\n\nThere is little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular program for reading instruction when used with dyslexic children.\n\nIn 2007 the researchers Joseph Torgesen and Richard Wagner have shown that, when teaching children with reading disabilities, programs including systematic and explicit instruction in phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence are far more successful than programs that do not.\nWith appropriate instruction, dyslexics can become skilled readers. Appropriate remedial instruction includes using:\n\n\nAlthough there are no treatments or quick cures for dyslexia there are many techniques that can be used to assist dyslexic students in the classroom while reading skills are being remediated. These include such things as:\n\nAccessible publishing works to make reading easier for all who struggle with the standard one-size-fits-all method of book publishing. Accessible publishing works with publishers and Print on Demand technology which allows the reader to choose how the books will be published. Available format variations include choosing the font size (from 11 point font through to 28 point font), whether the font is bold, italic or regular, and choosing the amount of line spacing. There are also a variety of special fonts being developed for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and other conditions. Although some individuals with dyslexia report improved ease of reading with different fonts, these reports are anecdotal; there is little empirical evidence to support the use of \"dyslexia fonts\". \nAccessible publishers, such as ReadHowYouWant, also work to make books available in Braille, e-books, audiobooks and DAISY.\n\nNew formats such as streamline text have been developed that help dyslexic people to track (move from one line to the next) more fluently. These work by adding 'sign-posts' into the text to show where to go next.\n\nTeachers are also using audiobooks as a way of teaching textbooks in an engaging way to those with dyslexia. In the UK, one of the biggest charities is Listening Books, which offers members a streaming service over the internet. An Australian company, ReadHowYouWant is working to make all published books available in audiobook form. In the United States, the nonprofit Learning Ally offers the world's largest library of human-narrated audio textbooks, and a second organization, Bookshare, offers a wide selection of synthetic-read audiobooks. These audiobooks work well for individuals who have word reading accuracy and fluency difficulties (i.e. dyslexics).\n\nIndividuals with dyslexia require more practice to master skills in their areas of deficit. In the circumstances where typically developing children need 30 to 60 hours training, the number of hours that has resulted in optimistic conclusions concerning the remediation of dyslexia is between 80 and 100 hours, or less if the intervention is started sufficiently early. Only approximately 20% of adults with early reading difficulties have acquired fluent reading skills in adulthood.\n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown neurological changes in dyslexic children and adults who have used phonological interventions, with improved performance on tests of phonemic awareness and text decoding.\nfMRI studies have also shown changes in the brain and spelling improvement of dyslexic children taught spelling phonetically in an orthographic manner.\n\nA recent study has shown that the usage of an FM system drives neural plasticity in children with dyslexia. A FM system is a personal assistive listening device, consisting of a wireless microphone worn by the teacher, and a wireless receiver similar to a Bluetooth receiver worn on the ears by the pupil. Measurements of the brain’s response to speech sounds showed that the children who wore the device for one year responded more consistently to the very soft and rapidly changing elements of sounds that help distinguish one consonant from another (cat, bat, pat etc.). That improved stability was linked with reading improvement based on standardized measures of readability – which, as a long-term benefit, points to brain plasticity.\n\nEach country has adopted and developed a writing system of choice.\nEach country has their own Statutes relating to the , and special educational needs. The statutory provision framework of support in each country is usually complemented by many independent and voluntary support agencies providing more specialised information and support.\n\n\n"}

PMT has also been studied as a treatment for disruptive behaviors in children with other conditions. Limitations of the existing research on PMT include a lack of knowledge on mechanisms of change and the absence of studies of long-term outcomes. PMT may be more difficult to implement when parents are unable to participate fully due to psychopathology, limited cognitive capacity, high partner conflict, or inability to attend weekly sessions.\n\nPMT was initially developed in the 1960s by child psychologists who studied changing children's disruptive behaviors by intervening to change parent behaviors. The model was inspired by principles of operant conditioning and applied behavioral analysis. Treatment, which typically lasts for several months, focuses on parents learning to provide positive reinforcement, such as praise and rewards, for children's appropriate behaviors while setting proper limits, using methods such as removing attention for inappropriate behaviors.\n\nPoor parenting, inadequate parental supervision, discipline that is not consistent, and parental mental health status, stress or substance abuse all contribute to early-onset conduct problems; the resulting costs to society are high. In the context of developing countries in particular, family socio-economic disadvantage is a significant predictor of abusive parenting that impacts adolescent's psychological, behavioural and physical health outcomes. Negative parenting practices and negative child behavior contribute to one another in a \"coercive cycle\", in which one person begins by using a negative behavior to control the other person's behavior. That person in turn responds with a negative behavior, and the negative exchange escalates until one person's negative behavior \"wins\" the battle. For example, if a child throws a temper tantrum to avoid doing a chore, the parent may respond by yelling that the child must do it, to which the child responds by tantruming even louder, at which point the parent may give in to the child to avoid further disruption. The child's tantrums are thereby reinforced; by throwing a tantrum, she/he has achieved the end goal of getting out of the chore. PMT seeks to break patterns that reinforce negative behavior by instead teaching parents to reinforce positive behaviors.\n\nThe content of PMT, as well as the sequencing of skills within the training, varies according to the approach being used. In most PMT, parents are taught to define and record observations of their child's behavior, both positive and negative; this may involve the use of a progress chart. This monitoring procedure provides useful information for the parents and therapist to set specific goals for treatment, and to measure the child's progress over time. Parents learn to give specific, concise instructions using eye contact while speaking in a calm manner.\n\nProviding positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of PMT. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child). In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called \"successive approximations\").\n\nPMT also teaches parents to appropriately set limits using structured techniques in response to their child's negative behavior. The different ways in which parents are taught to respond to positive versus negative behavior in children is sometimes referred to as differential reinforcement. For mildly annoying but not dangerous behavior, parents practice ignoring the behavior. Following unwanted behavior, parents are also introduced to the proper use of the time-out technique, in which parents remove attention (which serves as a form of reinforcement) from the child for a specified period of time. Parents also learn to remove their child's privileges, such as television or play time, in a systematic way in response to unwanted behavior. Across all of these strategies, the therapist emphasizes that consequences should be administered calmly, immediately, and consistently, and balanced with encouragement for positive behaviors.\n\nIn addition to positive reinforcement and limit setting in the home, many PMT programs incorporate collaboration with the child's teacher to track behavior in school and link it to the reward program at home. Another common element of many PMT programs is preparing parents to manage problem behaviors in situations that are typically difficult for the child, such as being in a public place.\n\nThe training is usually delivered by therapists (psychologists or social workers) to individual families or groups of families, and is conducted primarily with the parents rather than the child, although children can become involved as the therapist and parents see fit. A typical training course consists of 12 core weekly sessions; with different programs ranging from four to twenty-four weekly sessions.\n\nPMT is underutilized and training for therapists and other providers has been limited; it has not been widely used outside of clinical and research settings.\n\nThe theory behind PMT has been \"repeatedly validated\", and many programs have met the \"gold-standard criteria for well-established interventions\". All of the established programs teach better parenting skills and emphasize that the parent-child relationship is \"bidirectional\".\n\nSpecific treatment programs that can be broadly characterized as PMT include Parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT), the Incredible Years parent training (IYPT), Positive parenting program (Triple P), and Parent management training – Oregon model (PMTO). PCIT, IYPT, Triple P and Helping the non-compliant child (HNC) are among the most frequently used PMTs; according to Menting \"et al\" (2013), IYPT \"is considered a 'blueprint' for violence prevention\".\n\nThe per family cost of group parent training programs to bring an average child into a non-clinical range of behavioral disruption was estimated in 2013 to be US$2,500, which according to the authors of a Cochrane review was \"modest when compared with the long-term health, social, educational and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems\".\n\nPMT is one of the most extensively studied treatments for childhood disruptive behaviors. PMT tended to have larger effects for younger children than older children, although the differences between age groups were not statistically significant. Improvement in parental mental health (depression, stress, irritability, anxiety, and sense of confidence) as well as parental behavior is noted. Improvements in child and parent behavior were maintained up to one year after PMT, although the effects were small; very few studies have been done on the durability of the effects of PMT.\n\nFamilies from economically disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to benefit from PMT than their more advantaged counterparts, but this difference was attenuated if the low-income families received individual rather than group treatment. Overall, group formats of PMT delivery were less effective than individual formats, and the addition of individual therapy for the child did not improve outcomes. Parental psychopathology, substance abuse, and maternal depression are associated with less successful outcomes; this may be because the \"parents' ability to learn and consolidate the skills being taught\" is affected, or parents may not be able to stay engaged in the program or translate the skills acquired to the home.\n\nFurlong \"et al\" (2013) concluded that group-based PMT is cost-effective in reducing conduct problems, and improving parental health and parenting skills, but that there is not enough evidence that it is effective on the measures of \"child emotional problems and educational and cognitive abilities\".\n\nAlthough the bulk of the research on PMT examines its impact on disruptive behavior, it has also been studied as an intervention for other conditions.\n\nConflict is high in families of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with parents showing \"more negative and ineffective parenting (e.g., power assertive, punitive, inconsistent) and less positive or warm parenting, relative to parents of children without ADHD\". PMT targets dysfunctional parenting and school-related problems of children with ADHD, such as work completion and peer problems. Pfiffner and Haack (2014) say PMT is well-established as a treatment for school-age children with ADHD, but that questions persist about the best methods for delivering PMT. A meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment in children further supports this, as researchers found wide variability in how PMT was carried out across previous studies. This analysis also noted that the clinicians involved in these studies often modified the training based on the needs of the family. This variation however, did not create significant differences in effectiveness of PMT across studies. A 2011 Cochrane review found some evidence that PMT improves general child behavior and parental stress in treating ADHD, but has limited effects on ADHD-specific behavior. The authors concluded that there was a lack of data to evaluate school achievement, and a risk of bias in the studies due to poor methodology; existing evidence was not strong enough to form clear clinical guidelines with regard to PMT for ADHD, or to say whether group or individual PMT was more effective.\n\nA 2009 review of long-term outcomes in children with Tourette syndrome (TS) said that, in those children with TS who have other comorbid conditions, PMT is effective in dealing with explosive behaviors and anger management.\n\nThe US National Institute of Mental Health has designated the \"gap between evidence-based treatments and community services\" as an area critically in need of more research; PMT for disruptive behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders is an area of ongoing research.\n\nThere is a great deal of support for PMT in the research literature, but several limitations of the research have been noted. A common concern with implementing evidence-based treatments in community (as opposed to research) contexts is that the robust effects found in clinical trials may not generalize to complex community populations and settings. To address this concern, a meta-analysis of PMT studies coded across \"real-world\" criteria found no significant differences in the effectiveness of PMT when it was delivered to clinic versus study-referred populations, in routine service versus research settings, or by non-specialist versus specialist therapists (such as those with direct links to the program developers). Increased attention to the impact of cultural diversity on PMT outcomes – especially given that parenting practices are deeply rooted in culture – was called for in the 1990s; a 2013 review said the emphasis on ethnic and cultural differences was unjustified in terms of efficacy.\n\nOther limitations of the existing research is that studies tend to focus on statistically significant rather than clinically significant change (for example, whether the child's daily functioning actually improves); there is no data on long-term sustainability of treatment effects; and little is known about the processes or mechanisms through which PMT improves outcomes.\n\nTraining programs other than PMT may be better indicated for \"parents with significant psychopathology (such as anger management problems, ADHD, depression, substance abuse), limited cognitive capacity, or those\nin highly conflicted marital/partner relationships\", or those parents unlikely or unable to attend weekly sessions.\n\nParent management training was developed in the early 1960s in response to an urgent need in American child guidance clinics. Research across a national network of these clinics revealed that the treatments being used for young children with disruptive behaviors, who constituted the majority of children served in these settings, were largely ineffective. Several child psychologists, including Robert Wahler, Constance Hanf, Martha E. Bernal, and Gerald Patterson, were inspired to develop new treatments based on behavioral principles of operant conditioning and applied behavioral analysis. Between 1965 and 1975, a behavioral model of parent training treatment was established, that emphasized teaching parents to positively reinforce prosocial child behavior (such as praising a child for following directions) while negatively incentivizing antisocial behavior (such as removing parental attention after the child throws a tantrum). The early work of Hanf and Patterson hypothesized that \"teaching parents the principles of behavioral reinforcement would result in effective, sustainable change in child behavior\". Early studies of this approach showed that the treatment was effective in the short-term in improving parenting skills and reducing children's disruptive behaviors. Patterson and colleagues theorized that adverse environmental contexts lead to disruptions in parent practices, which then contribute to negative child outcomes.\n\nFollowing the initial development of PMT, a second wave of research from 1975 to 1985 focused on the longer-term effects and generalization of treatment to settings other than the clinic (such as home or school), larger family effects (such as improved parenting with siblings), and behavioral improvements outside of the targeted areas (such as improved ability to make friends). Since 1985, the literature on PMT has continued to expand, with researchers exploring such topics as application of the treatment to serious clinical problems, dealing with client resistance to treatment, prevention programs, and implementation with diverse populations.\n\nEvidence in support of PMT has not always been rigorously examined; future research should examine the effectiveness of PMT on the families most at risk, address parental psychopathology as a factor in outcomes, examine whether gains from PMT are maintained in the long-term, and better account for variability in outcomes dependent on practices under \"real-world\" conditions.\n\n\n"}

The others are nearby Rays Hill Tunnel, and farther west, the Laurel Hill Tunnel. It was less expensive to realign the Turnpike than to bore a second tube for four lane traffic. Sideling Hill Tunnel is long. It was the longest of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Ray's Hill Tunnel and Sideling Hill Tunnel are now part of the Pike2Bike Trail. Together, the two tunnels as well as the roadway are commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike.\n\nFrom the Turnpike's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects, the tunnels were bottlenecks; opposing traffic in the same tubes reduced speeds. Four other tunnels on the Turnpike – Allegheny Mountain, Tuscarora Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, and Blue Mountain – each had a second tube bored, the least expensive option. All of the original tunnels except for the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel were part of \"Vanderbilt's Folly\", the never-completed South Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nThe Sideling Hill Tunnel's original plans date back to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred at the end of the Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission started construction on a new toll highway from Carlisle, Pennsylvania to Irwin, Pennsylvania in 1938. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened on October 25, 1940, the Sideling Hill Tunnel was one of the seven original tunnels along the highway, six of which were built from the old railroad tunnels from the 1880s. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was constructed from scratch rather than from the tunnels because of structural concerns. \n\n<section begin=LaurelHillTunnelBottleneck />\nBeginning in 1951, the eastbound traffic at the Laurel Hill Tunnel would back up during the summer weekends. By 1958, the Laurel Hill experienced congestion anytime from June to November. Because of the long bottlenecks, the Commission started looking into ways to remove the congestion. There were studies that began in the mid-1950s to decide on what to do with the tunnels. The studies looked into the major tunnels, the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain, and the possibility of adding a second tube, or \"twinning\", to them. <section end=LaurelHillTunnelBottleneck />\n\n<section begin=tunnelactions />\nStudies were completed for the remaining five mainline tunnels to determine the cost benefit of twinning of the tunnels, or complete bypass. After the studies completed, the decision was made to go ahead with a US $100 million construction project to work with the tunnels. Construction began on September 6, 1962, with the first subproject being a bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel. On October 30, 1964, just two years after construction began, the Laurel Hill Bypass was completed and opened. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was permanently closed on that day. However, this was not the last bypass to occur for tunnels along the turnpike. Two years after the closing of the Laurel Hill, the Allegheny Mountain became the first tunnel to be twinned, and opened on August 25, 1966. With the twinning of the Blue Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain and Tuscarora Mountain tunnels under construction, the Commission turned its focus to the remaining two mainline tunnels, the Rays Hill Tunnel (the shortest tunnel) and the Sideling Hill Tunnel (the longest tunnel).\n\nAn engineering report dating back to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels was the best way to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).\n\nIn 2001, the Turnpike Commission gave control of the length of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels and other roadways to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy, who began work to convert the stretch into a bicycle trail. The trail is used by hundreds of bicycle riders, and studies occurred in 2004 and 2005 to figure how to best safely construct the trail. Because there is a lack of good lighting in the tunnels the conservancy wants to look into how to solve it. The system is called the Pike2Bike Trail and is planned to be an mountain bicycle loop that serves access to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's BicyclePA Route S.<section end=tunnelactions />\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24011067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24011067", "title": "Steeluniversity.org", "text": "Steeluniversity.org\n\nsteeluniversity is a collection of free-to-use E-learning resources and interactive simulations covering major aspects of iron and steelmaking. It provides the underlying scientific, metallurgical and engineering principles and environmental aspects of the production, use and recycling of steel. These internet-delivered resources are aimed at undergraduate students of metallurgy, materials science and engineering subjects as well as graduate employees in the steel industry supply chain.\n\nThe basic objective of steeluniversity.org is to inform university students and their teachers about steel technologies and to attract young people to the global steel industry. Another major aim is to reduce the cost of in-service training at steel companies by providing them with freely available training and professional development material. In view of the decline in metallurgy-related courses in universities and the retirement of professors and steel industry experts, it aims to sustain knowledge of ferrous metallurgy by joint efforts of academia and the steel industry.\n\nA gradual decline in the number of students enrolling in science subjects such as physics and mathematics can be seen in many industrialized countries. This phenomenon has been indicated in several studies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Science Forum reports in a study that the relative share of science and technology graduates declined in 10 out of 16 member countries between 1993-2003. Metallurgy is one of the most affected disciplines in this trend in terms of available courses, overall enrolments and the number of graduates. An important factor relating to this change in US universities is described as transformation in the late twentieth century of metallurgy departments into ‘material sciences’ departments. A similar pattern in other Western European countries e.g. in the UK is reported during the same time span. \nSteel industry, once an attractive career destination for metallurgy graduates is directly affected by these changes and now faces the challenge of replacing the retiring work force. The idea of preserving knowledge of metallurgy and attracting young people towards career in the steel industry was born out of this challenge.\n\nIn response to the declining skilled workforce in the steel industry, the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) took the initiative by creating a collection of web-based E-learning resources on metallurgy in a pilot project named Internet Learning of Steel Applications and Processes (ILSAP). Initially two introductory modules; Secondary Steelmaking and Steel for Automotive Applications were launched in partnership with the MATTER project at the University of Liverpool on 1 August 2002\nFollowing the success of the pilot project, the IISI board of governors approved a budget of €2.5 million for development of an extensive set of E-learning resources and the project was renamed steeluniversity.org in October 2003.\n\nThe E-learning modules on the website cover major aspects of iron and steelmaking grouped in four different categories:\n\nSteel applications\n\nSteel processing\n\nFerrous metallurgy\n\nSustainability\nThe modules in this section address the selection of steels for different steel markets – such as automotive, construction, engineering and offshore applications. Acting as the materials advisor in a multidisciplinary team, the user aims to select suitable steel in order to satisfy design specifications for a particular application. The major engineering design equations are studied during this process in order to select and compare the performance of steel and other metals and materials. \n\nThis section contains a series of interactive simulations of major steelmaking processes from raw materials, Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and Electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, secondary steelmaking, Continuous casting and Hot rolling. Different steel grades can be processed using two levels of operation which are suitable for students and graduates in the industry. The ‘student level’ provides a basic functionality enabling the user to understand and control the process principles without too many operational complications, whereas the ‘industry level’ has advanced functionality and the user needs to deal with practical disturbances that are not anticipated in advance. Real-time feedback is given on the composition and quality of the steel, on process time and temperature and incurred costs, to allow the process to be optimized. A user guide and more conventional supporting e-learning units are also available within each module to enable the learner to better understand the reactions. For example, in the secondary steelmaking module, there are sections on deoxidation, desulphurization, decarburization and dehydrogenation.\n\nThe section on ferrous metallurgy contains modules on thermodynamics and kinetics, including strengthening mechanisms, phase transformation, recrystallisation and grain growth, heat treatment and steel properties. An introduction is provided on steel specifications, with exercises to ensure that they can be accurately interpreted. The learner can check mechanical properties of a given grade of steel by conducting virtual tensile, Charpy impact and hardness tests as well.\n\nThis section introduces the environmental aspects of steelmaking, usage and recycling processes. The learner gets a basic idea of Life Cycle Thinking and the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and its practical application. In addition selected LCA scenarios facing the steel industry and its customers in the automotive and construction sectors can be explored.\n\nThe e-learning modules were initially only available in English. Currently, several modules can be found in different languages such as Spanish, Chinese (traditional & simplified), Korean, Russian and German. The process of translation is not yet complete and a number of modules are in various stages of proof reading.\n\nThe \"steelChallenge\" is an annual competition organized by steeluniversity.org for students and steel industry employees. Using one or more of the steelmaking simulations on the steeluniversity.org website, the entrants are to produce a particular steel grade at the lowest cost. The competition runs for a 24-hour period during which multiple attempts are allowed. Awards are given for the best, one for the best industry entry and the other for the best university entry. Other local prizes sponsored by steel companies are also presented at the event.\n\n"}
{"id": "1052485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052485", "title": "TES (magazine)", "text": "TES (magazine)\n\nTes, formerly known as the Times Educational Supplement, is a weekly UK publication aimed primarily at school teachers in the UK. It was first published in 1910 as a pull-out supplement in \"The Times\" newspaper. Such was its popularity that in 1914, the supplement became a separate publication selling for one penny.\n\n\"TES\" focuses on school-related news and features. It covered higher education until the Times Higher Education Supplement (now \"Times Higher Education\") was launched as a sister publication in 1971. Today its editor is Ann Mroz. Since 1964, an alternative version of the publication, TESS, has been produced for Scotland. An edition for Wales, TES Cymru, was also published between 2004 and 2011. All are produced by London-based company TES Global, which has been owned by US investment firm TPG Capital LLP since 2013. The \"TES\" no longer has a connection with \"The Times\" newspaper. \n\n\"TES\" is published weekly on Fridays, at a cover price of £2.90. Data from the National Readership Survey Jan–Dec 2012 suggested that the average yearly readership was around 362,000, of which around 90 per cent of the readership were in the ABC1 category.\n\nThe publication has developed a popular website featuring teaching jobs, forums, and classroom resources that are uploaded by teachers.\n\nThe idea for a regular section on education in \"The Times\" was first proposed in 1905 by J E G de Montmorency, a barrister and writer who later composed leader articles for \"The TES\". The first issue of the monthly educational supplement appeared on 6 September 1910, opening with a witty weather forecast for the UK’s school systems. King George V had recently begun his reign, and the paper noted that “some great resettlement of the English school system seems likely to take place”.\n\nOver its first decade, \"The TES\" established itself as a paper for teachers, though it was primarily aimed at those in private and grammar schools. However, it pressed for education reform from its early years, calling in 1913 for “Secondary Education for All”.\n\nIn 1914, \"The TES\" became a stand-alone publication, noting on the outbreak of the First World War that “every great war in the modern world has been followed by changes in education”. Two years afterwards, while the war still raged, the paper began to be published weekly. \"The TES\" later explained that “the decision to change into a weekly periodical was taken in order to lend the support of \"The Times\" more effectively to the movement for reform in education which culminated in the Fisher Reform Act of 1918”.\n\nNotable editors of \"The TES\" included George Sydney Freeman, who was editor for its first 28 years and Harold Dent, a progressive former schoolteacher who became acting editor in 1940. He put the newspaper together practically single-handedly during the Blitz. His editorials pressed for “total reform” of the education system, “based on a new conception of the place, status and function of education in a democratic State, not a patching and padding of the present system”. This attitude chimed with the radical thinking then going on within the Board of Education. Mr. Dent had regular meetings with its president, Rab Butler, in the years building up to the 1944 Education Act.\n\nThe readership of \"The TES\", once primarily private and grammar school teachers, broadened during the 20th century. During the 1970s, the paper became more supportive of Comprehensive schools, when it had once defended grammars.\n\nIn the 1980s, it became increasingly concerned that political reforms might overload or restrict teachers, particularly the launch of the national curriculum and league tables with the Education Reform Act 1988. Its then editor, Stuart Maclure, noted in 1985 that “the irony of the last 10 years, in which the politicians and industrialists have clamoured for reform and accused the educationists of blocking it, was not lost on anyone who cares to look back”.\n\nWhen the newspaper reached its centenary in 2010, its former editor Gerard Kelly, wrote: “If there is one phenomenal, outstanding, amazing development of the past century in this country, it has to be that education has liberated women in a way that was never anticipated by the most liberal of reformers, even by those far-sighted individuals on \"The TES\" in 1910”.\n\nAt its start, \"TES\" was owned, like its parent paper, by Lord Northcliffe. After his death in 1922, the newspapers were sold to the Astor family, and it was sold on again in 1966 to the Canadian newspaper tycoon Roy Thomson.\n\nRupert Murdoch took ownership of the newspaper in 1979. Murdoch’s News International restructured its newspapers to set up 'Times Supplements Limited' and by 1999, this became 'TSL Education Ltd', which also published \"THE\" and \"Nursery World\". In October 2005, the group was sold to Exponent, a private equity group, who in turn sold it to Charterhouse in May 2007.\n\n\"TES\" online is run by the London-based 'TES Global', which claims to be \"The largest network of teachers in the world\", and has been owned by the US-based TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group) global investment company since July 2013.\n\nStaff journalists at \"TES\" have included Simon Jenkins, who became editor of the \"Evening Standard\" and \"The Times\"; novelist, literary historian, and biographer Valerie Grosvenor Myer; and Timothy Mo and Frances Hill, who both became novelists.\n\nThe newspaper’s columnists have included Ted Wragg, Caitlin Moran and Libby Purves. The pop singer Daniel Bedingfield was employed to work on the newspaper’s website.\n\nExternal contributors have included Gordon Brown, who contributed comment articles to the Scottish edition of \"TES\" as a young lecturer in 1979.

It holds violence prevention and nonviolence education programs for schools and sports clubs around the world.\n\nNVP, which was registered in 1993 in Bagnes, Switzerland, and has offices in 15 countries around the world. Its logo is the iconic Knotted Gun sculpture named \"Non-Violence\".\n\nNVP has educated eight million students, teachers, and sports coaches with programs covering three main subjects: conflict management, self-esteem building, and nonviolence.\n\nSir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Yoko Ono are, among others, ambassadors of the Non-Violence Project.\n\nNVP's signature logo is the Non-Violence also known as the Knotted Gun. It has been created by the Swedish artist, Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd as a memorial tribute to John Lennon after he was shot and killed on December 8, 1980, in New York City. One of the 3 original bronze sculptures is displayed at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. The Knotted Gun has become a worldwide symbol of the non-violence movement. Several replicas of this sculpture can be found around the world, including the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, at Victoria & Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town and in the Chaoyang Park in Beijing, China.\n\nNVP was born with the idea to use the Non-Violence to inspire, motivate and engage the young community in positive action and give them the tools and skills to solve conflicts peacefully. In 1993, Jan Hellman and Rolf Skjöldebrand founded the Non-Violence Project. The best way to achieve the Non-Violence mission was to convince schools and sports clubs to include violence prevention and life skills programs into their basic education schedule.\nNVP's concept was first piloted in Sweden with great success. NVP invited the business community to partner in their endeavor and toured roughly 100 cities, spreading the non-violence message. A year later NVP had reached 100 000 students and initiated 300 local projects in Sweden. In 1995, a crowd of people gathered at the Sergel's Square in central Stockholm lighting candles in the shape of the Knotted Gun Several celebrities participated at the event like model Emma Wiklund, singer Siw Malmkvist, Lill-Babs and the actress Lena Olin. The television host Kristin Kaspersen organized the event.\n\nDuring the years, NVP has increased its international activities from 10 to 31 countries on five continents around the world including the USA, the UK, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, China, Pakistan, Mexico, Sweden, Uganda, Peru, Guatemala, Tanzania, the Bahamas, Liberia, Kenya, Italy and nov 2017 India opened an office. The headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nIn 2008, the first Knot Violence Campaign was launched in Portsmouth, United Kingdom with the support of the England football goalkeeper, David James and the presence of local pupils. The campaign helped to introduce the Non-Violence Creativity Program into local schools. The initiative was an arts-based education program whose main tool was the Non-Violence Box. The box includes a violence prevention module as well as a one-meter fiberglass replica of the Knotted Gun. Students, teachers and sports coaches are challenged to give their interpretation of the symbol and of what it communicates. David James has worked closely with pupils from City of Portsmouth Boys' School to help them paint their own knotted gun sculptures. He also did his own interpretation which is displayed outside the Fratton Park stadium in Portsmouth.\nDuring the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, under the campaign theme \"Futbol For Peace\" and in close cooperation with the Western Cape and Gauteng Education Departments, NVP engaged several prominent football players such as the Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, German captain Michael Ballack, Wilson Palacios from Honduras, Alex Song from Cameroon, Aaron Mokoena from South Africa and football legend Gus Poyet to paint and interpret the Non-Violence symbol. This became an exhibition at the Waterfront in Cape Town. The painted sculptures communicated a global vision of peace and non-violence and created awareness of the education programs which took place at several youth hubs and schools in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The campaign included daily football tournaments, violence prevention education, life skills training and a \"Train the Trainer\" program to secure continuity after the World Cup. In 2011, Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon donates his self-designed Non-Violence sculpture to former South African President Nelson Mandela on Mandela Day, July 18, in recognition of his lifelong work to bring peace and non-violence in South Africa and the world.\n\nNVP has educated and trained more than eight million students, teachers and sports coaches around the world. The NVP programs provide tools for schools and sports clubs to get started. The programs which cover three main subjects - conflict management, self-esteem building, and violence prevention - are constructed to inspire, motivate and engage teachers and students to increase their knowledge of how violence emerges, why conflicts escalate, the importance of a strong self-esteem, and the nonviolent keys to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. The same approach is used to address the sports community. NVP focus on issues of non-violence, peace, youth participation, interactive exercises, life skills and community development.\n\nThe Train the Trainer Program works with teachers and sports coaches. The program attempts to give future trainers the competence and tools to implement the Non-Violence Project education model into their respective schools and sports clubs.\n\nA pilot program has been done at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland and at the UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), in Mexico. The project NVP St Andrews was launched on October 3, 2012 at the University of St Andrews in presence of the golfer Dustin Johnson. University of Tsukuba, in Japan started official education in 2018. The project equips university students with the tools to go out into their local communities and inspire conflict resolution and promote non-violence in schools and on playing fields.\n\nThe Non-Violence Project launched a call for peace and non-violence online to honor the legacy of John Lennon and to strengthen the outreach of NVP education programs.\n\nThe Tour, featuring fiberglass Non-Violence sculptures interpreted and painted by children from throughout the world and by internationally renowned role models within sports, music and art, are displayed in cities around the world. The Tour promotes the presence of the Non-Violence Symbol and secures local distribution of the NVP education programs to schools and sports clubs. The former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated;\n\n\"The Non-Violence Symbol has not only endowed the United Nations with a cherished work of art; it has enriched the consciousness of humanity with a powerful symbol. It is a symbol that encapsulates, in a few simple curves, the greatest prayer of man: that which asks not for victory, but for peace\".\n\n\nDuring the last 20 years, NVP settled regional offices [10] in 17 countries around the world including the USA, the UK, Brazil, Mexico, Sweden, Denmark, Uganda, South Africa, Japan, China, India,Pakistan, Russia, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Tanzania, the Bahamas, Liberia, Kenya and Italy. The headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nNon Violence Project Foundation India (NVPF India)\nThis is the India chapter of The Non-Violence Project Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland.
