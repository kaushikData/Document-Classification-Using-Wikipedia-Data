{"id": "4868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4868", "title": "B. F. Skinner", "text": "B. F. Skinner\n\nBurrhus Frederic Skinner (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as B. F. Skinner, was an American psychologist, behaviorist, author, inventor, and social philosopher. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974.\n\nSkinner considered free will an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the probability of the action being repeated becomes stronger. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.\n\nTo strengthen behavior, Skinner used operant conditioning, and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning, he invented the operant conditioning chamber, also known as the Skinner Box, and to measure rate he invented the \"cumulative recorder\". Using these tools, he and C. B. Ferster produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in their book \"Schedules of Reinforcement\" (1957).\n\nSkinner developed behavior analysis, the philosophy of that science he called radical behaviorism, and founded a school of experimental research psychology—the experimental analysis of behavior. He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel, \"Walden Two\", and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work, \"Verbal Behavior\".\nSkinner was a prolific author who published 21 books and 180 articles. Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism, along with John B. Watson and Ivan Pavlov. A June 2002 survey listed Skinner as the most influential psychologist of the 20th century.\n\nSkinner was born in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an atheist after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his grandmother described. His brother Edward, two and a half years younger, died at age sixteen of a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nSkinner's closest friend as a young boy was Raphael Miller, whom he called Doc because his father was a doctor. Doc and Skinner became friends due to their parents’ religiousness and both had an interest in contraptions and gadgets. They had set up a telegraph line between their houses to send messages to each other, although they had to call each other on the telephone due to the confusing messages sent back and forth. During one summer, Doc and Skinner started an elderberry business to gather berries and sell them door to door. They had found out that when they picked the ripe berries, the unripe ones came off the branches too, so they built a device that was able to separate them. The device was a bent piece of metal to form a trough. They would pour water down the trough into a bucket, and the ripe berries would sink into the bucket and the unripe ones would be pushed over the edge to be thrown away.\n\nHe attended Hamilton College in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude. While attending, he joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Hamilton was known for being a strong fraternity college. Skinner had thought that his fraternity brothers were respectful and did not haze or mistreat the newcomers, instead, they helped out the other boys with courses or other activities. Freshmen were called “‘slimers’” who had to wear small green knit hats and greet everyone that they passed for punishment. The year before Skinner entered Hamilton, there was a hazing accident that caused the death of a student. The freshman was asleep in his bed when he was pushed onto the floor, where he smashed his head, resulting in his death. Skinner had a similar incident where two freshmen captured him and tied him to a pole, where he should have stayed all night, but he had a razor blade in his shoe for emergency and managed to cut himself free. He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the traditional mores of his college. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an experimental science from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the Skinner Box and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments. After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years. He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet Robert Frost, concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with John B. Watson's \"Behaviorism\" led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.\n\nSkinner received a PhD from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis and later at Indiana University, where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his life. In 1973, Skinner was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.\n\nIn 1936, Skinner married Yvonne (Eve) Blue. The couple had two daughters, Julie (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. Buzan). Yvonne Skinner died in 1997, and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSkinner's public exposure had increased in the 1970s, he remained active even after his retirement in 1974, until his death. In 1989, Skinner was diagnosed with leukemia and died on August 18, 1990 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ten days before his death, he was given the lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association and gave a talk in an auditorium concerning his work.\n\nA controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. He has been widely revered for bringing a much-needed scientific approach to the study of human behavior; he has also been vilified for attempting to apply findings based largely on animal experiments to human behavior in real-life settings.\n\nSkinner called his approach to the study of behavior radical behaviorism. This philosophy of behavioral science assumes that behavior is a consequence of environmental histories of reinforcement (see Applied behavior analysis). In contrast to the approach of cognitive science, behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other \"private events\" as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words: \n\nIn this way we repair the major damage wrought by mentalism. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.\n\nSkinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book, \"Behavior of Organisms\". Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior—respondent and operant—which are controlled in different ways. \"Respondent\" behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be modified through respondent conditioning, which is often called \"Pavlovian conditioning\" or \"classical conditioning\", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. \"Operant\" behaviors, in contrast, are \"emitted\", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called \"instrumental conditioning\", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov, and operants by Thorndike. Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones, and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.\n\nThe idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions. Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place? (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled? (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?\n\nSkinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a \"new\" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. \"Shaping\" was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that \"superstitious\" behavior can arise when a response happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.\n\nThe second question, \"how is operant behavior controlled?\" arises because, to begin with, the behavior is \"emitted\" without reference to any particular stimulus. Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This three-term contingency (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.\n\nMost behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of \"chaining.\" Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a \"conditioned reinforcer.\" For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may also be used to reinforce \"turning around\" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence \"noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food.\" Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.\n\nHowever, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences. Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to \"jump\", \"open the book\", and so on. After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.\n\nReinforcement, a key concept of behaviorism, is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, \"positive\" and \"negative.\" In \"The Behavior of Organisms\" (1938), Skinner defined \"negative reinforcement\" to be synonymous with punishment, that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in \"Science and Human Behavior\" (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).\n\nBoth types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences. Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.\n\nWriting in 1981, Skinner pointed out that Darwinian natural selection is, like reinforced behavior, \"selection by consequences.\" Though, as he said, natural selection has now \"made its case\", he regretted that essentially the same process, \"reinforcement\", was less widely accepted as underlying human behavior.\n\nSkinner recognized that behavior is typically reinforced more than once, and, together with C. B. Ferster, he did an extensive analysis of the various ways in which reinforcements could be arranged over time, which he called \"schedules of reinforcement.\"\n\nThe most notable schedules of reinforcement studied by Skinner were continuous, interval (fixed or variable), and ratio (fixed or variable). All are methods used in operant conditioning.\n\n\nAn operant conditioning chamber (also known as a \"Skinner Box\") is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior. It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at Harvard University. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this \"manipulandum\" could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response (\"memory\"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the water maze.\n\nThe cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the Operant chamber as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck. In this device, a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder. Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer. Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, \"Schedules of Reinforcement\", is full of cumulative records produced by this device.\n\nThe air crib is an easily cleaned, temperature- and humidity-controlled enclosure intended to replace the standard infant crib. \nSkinner invented the device to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing. It was designed to make early childcare simpler (by reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while allowing the baby to be more mobile and comfortable, and less prone to cry. Reportedly it had some success in these goals.\n\nThe air crib was a controversial invention. It was popularly mischaracterized as a cruel pen, and it was often compared to Skinner's operant conditioning chamber, commonly called the \"Skinner Box.\" This association with laboratory animal experimentation discouraged its commercial success, though several companies attempted production.\n\nA 2004 book by Lauren Slater, entitled \"\" caused a stir by mentioning the rumors that Skinner had used his baby daughter, Deborah, in some of his experiments, and that she had subsequently committed suicide. Although Slater's book stated that the rumors were false, a reviewer in \"The Observer\" in March 2004 misquoted Slater's book as supporting the rumors. This review was read by Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan, an artist and writer living in London) who wrote a vehement riposte in \"The Guardian\".\n\nThe teaching machine was a mechanical device whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of programmed learning. The machine embodies key elements of Skinner's theory of learning and had important implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.\n\nIn one incarnation, the machine was a box that housed a list of questions that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.\n\nSkinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. \"Unison\" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, \"learning by doing.\"\n\nTeaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.\n\nNot only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.\n\nSkinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today computers run software that performs similar teaching tasks, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the topic related to the development of adaptive learning systems.\n\nDuring World War II, the US Navy required a weapon effective against surface ships, such as the German \"Bismarck\" class battleships. Although missile and TV technology existed, the size of the primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated Project Pigeon, which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.\n\nDespite an effective demonstration, the project was abandoned, and eventually more conventional solutions, such as those based on radar, became available. Skinner complained that \"our problem was no one would take us seriously.\" It seemed that few people would trust pigeons to guide a missile, no matter how reliable the system appeared to be.\n\nEarly in his career Skinner became interested in \"latent speech\" and experimented with a device he called the \"verbal summator.\" This device can be thought of as an auditory version of the Rorschach inkblots. When using the device, human participants listened to incomprehensible auditory \"garbage\" but often read meaning into what they heard. Thus, as with the Rorschach blots, the device was intended to yield overt behavior that projected subconscious thoughts. Skinner's interest in projective testing was brief, but he later used observations with the summator in creating his theory of verbal behavior. The device also led other researchers to invent new tests such as the tautophone test, the auditory apperception test, and the Azzageddi test.\n\nChallenged by Alfred North Whitehead during a casual discussion while at Harvard to provide an account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior, Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, inductive approach to the complexity of human verbal behavior. Developed over two decades, his work appeared in the book \"Verbal Behavior\". Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of \"Verbal Behavior\", he conceded that Skinner's \"S-R psychology\" was worth a review. (Behavior analysts reject the \"S-R\" characterization: operant conditioning involves the emission of a response which then becomes more or less likely depending upon its consequence–see above.).\n\n\"Verbal Behavior\" had an uncharacteristically cool reception, partly as a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms. Skinner's peers may have been slow to adopt the ideas presented in \"Verbal Behavior\" because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's experimental work. However, in applied settings there has been a resurgence of interest in Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior.\n\nSkinner's views influenced education as well as psychology. Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as \"the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity\" can be an effective reinforcer . Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p. 389).\n\nSkinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.\n\nBecause teachers are primarily responsible for modifying student behavior, Skinner argued that teachers must learn effective ways of teaching. In \"The Technology of Teaching\", Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): He says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of teaching and learning. Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:\n\nSkinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught. The steps are\nSkinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book \"The Technology of Teaching\". They are also reflected in Fred S. Keller's \"Personalized System of Instruction\" and Ogden R. Lindsley's \"Precision Teaching\".\n\nSkinner is popularly known mainly for his books \"Walden Two\" and \"Beyond Freedom and Dignity,\" (for which he made the cover of \"TIME\" Magazine). The former describes a fictional \"experimental community\" in 1940s United States. The productivity and happiness of citizens in this community is far greater than in the outside world because the residents practice scientific social planning and use operant conditioning in raising their children.\n\n\"Walden Two\", like Thoreau's \"Walden\", champions a lifestyle that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure. In 1967, Kat Kinkade and others founded the Twin Oaks Community, using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system and other aspects of the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.\n\nIn \"Beyond Freedom and Dignity\", Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an autonomous agent is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.\n\nSkinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and human science of behavioral control – a technology of human behavior – could help with problems as yet unsolved and often aggravated by advances in technology such as the atomic bomb. Indeed, one of Skinner's goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself. He saw political activity as the use of aversive or non-aversive means to control a population. Skinner favored the use of positive reinforcement as a means of control, citing Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel \"\" as an example of literature that \"did not fear the power of positive reinforcement.\"\n\nSkinner's book, \"Walden Two\", presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.) Skinner's utopia is both a thought experiment and a rhetorical piece. In \"Walden Two\", Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – \"What is the Good Life?\" The book's answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption. \n\nSkinner described his novel as \"my New Atlantis\", in reference to Bacon's utopia. \n\nOne of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of superstition in one of his favorite experimental animals, the pigeon. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon \"at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior.\" He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.\n\nSkinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their \"rituals\", and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:\n\nModern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's \"superstition\" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's \"adventitious reinforcement\" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the \"terminal response\", which occurred in anticipation of food, and \"interim responses\", that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their \"autoshaping\" procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced polydipsia seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).\n\nAs understood by Skinner, ascribing \"dignity\" to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say \"Skinner is brilliant\" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's determinist theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. J. E. R. Staddon (\"The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition\", 2014) has argued the compatibilist position; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.\n\nNoam Chomsky, a prominent critic of Skinner, published a review of Skinner's \"Verbal Behavior\" two years after it was published. Chomsky argued that Skinner's attempt to use behaviorism to explain human language amounted to little more than word games. Conditioned responses could not account for a child's ability to create or understand an infinite variety of novel sentences. Chomsky's review has been credited with launching the cognitive revolution in psychology and other disciplines. Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, Kenneth MacCorquodale's reply was endorsed by Skinner.\n\nChomsky also reviewed Skinner's \"Beyond Freedom and Dignity\", using the same basic motives as his \"Verbal Behavior\" review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented 'scientistic' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the hypothetico-deductive model of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.\n\nSkinner has been repeatedly criticized for his supposed animosity towards Sigmund Freud, psychoanalysis, and psychodynamic psychology. Some have argued, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, and that he was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of defense mechanisms, such as repression. To study such phenomena, Skinner even designed his own projective test, the \"verbal summator\" described above.\n\n\nSkinner received honorary degrees from:\n\nWriter of \"The Simpsons\" Jon Vitti named the Principal Skinner character after behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is based in Burlingame, and its current president is Eric C. Heins.\n\nCTA was founded in 1863, during the Civil War, in response to a call in 1863 from the California Superintendent of Public Instruction, John Swett, for a \"teachers' institute\", about one hundred teachers gathered in San Francisco, resulting in the formation of the California Educational Society. In 1875, the organization changed its name to the California Teachers Association.\n\nCTA won its first major legislative victory in 1866 with a law providing free public schools to California children. A year later, public funding was secured for schools that educated nonwhite students. More early victories established bans on using public school funding for sectarian religious purposes (1878-79); free textbooks for all students in grades 1-8 (1911); the first teacher tenure and due process law (1912); and a statewide pension, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (1913).\n\nCTA led efforts to outlaw child labor in the state and enact other protections for children (1915), and to strengthen the teacher due process law (1921). In the 1940s, the union was the only major organization in California to protest against the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\n\nWhile the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 made collective bargaining a lawful, protected activity in the private sector, it did not include public workers or teachers. Wisconsin passed the nation's first public employee bargaining law (1959), and several large, urban affiliates of NEA or the American Federation of Teachers started winning bargaining rights (New York in 1961, Denver in 1962, Chicago in 1966). After a decade of school strikes and teacher organizing, California K-14 educators at last won the right to bargain collectively in 1975 when the CTA-sponsored Educational Employment Relations Act, also known as the Rodda Act, was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. \n\nA turning point in CTA's history came in 1988. That was the year teachers fought to pass Proposition 98, the landmark state law guaranteeing about 40 percent of the state's general fund for schools and community colleges. \n\nIn 2005, CTA ran numerous ads criticizing Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for refusing to pay back $2 billion that the Governor had \"borrowed\" from the education budget. CTA strongly opposed propositions 74, 75, 76, which were advanced by Schwarzenegger. None of the initiatives were approved by voters. CTA also criticized Governor Schwarzenegger for spending nearly $80 million on the special election.\n\nCTA strongly opposed Proposition 8 and donated a total of $1.25 million to help fight the measure that would ban gay marriage, stating that the proposition would violate civil rights and that proponents' advertising made false claims about the effect the proposition would have on public school curricula.\n\n"}

It is commonly also expressed as a percentile. For instance, a student may have a GPA better than 750 of his or her classmates in a graduating class of 800.\n\nThe use of class rank is currently in practice at about less than half of American high schools. Large public schools are more likely to rank their students than small private schools. Because many admissions officers were frustrated that many applications did not contain a rank, some colleges are using other information provided by high schools, in combination with a student's GPA to estimate a student's class rank. Many colleges say that the absence of a class rank forces them to put more weight on standardized test scores.\n\nColleges often use class rank as a factor in college admissions, although because of differences in grading standards between schools, admissions officers have begun to attach less weight to this factor, both for granting admission, and for awarding scholarships. Class rank is more likely to be used at large schools that are more formulaic in their admissions programs.\n\nSome U.S. states guarantee that students who achieve a high enough class rank at their high school will be admitted into a state university, in a practice known as \"percent plans\". Students in California who are in the top nine percent of their graduating class, and students in Florida who are in the top twenty percent of their graduating class are guaranteed admission to some state school, but not necessarily any particular institution. The University of Alaska system awards an $11,000 scholarship for four years to students in the top 10% of their graduating class at Alaskan high schools. The top ten percent of students in Texas high schools are guaranteed admission to the state school of their choice, excluding the University of Texas, which only allocates 75% of its incoming freshman class seats to top 7% members.\n\n\n"}

Public education in Honduras is provided free for children aged 6 to 15 where it is mandatory for children to attend at the primary level (Age 6 to 12). The Honduran Constitution moreover stipulates that parents have the right to choose the education ; whether free or private, of their children.\n\nWorld Bank statistics put the adult literacy rate (% of people ages 15 and above) of Honduras at 83.6%. However, UNESCO statistics reveal a 12% repeater rate, and only an 80% progression and completion rate in primary education. Moreover, only 64.5% enroll for secondary education.\n\nPoverty is rife in Honduras, with the poverty headcount ratio at national poverty line standing at 60% as of 2010. In typical situations, children have to quit school permanently to work at an early age to help support their families. Even though school is fully state-subsidized up till the 5th grade, many children are still unable to attend school because their families can not afford to buy uniforms and school supplies. A study conducted in 2006 by National Institute of Statistics estimated that as many as 368,000 of the 1.7 million children ages five to 12 did not receive schooling in that year.\n\nHonduras is a patriarchal society, and males are favoured over females when it comes to education. While parents may send both genders to primary school; the females are likely the first to be withdrawn to help at home and made to work to provide income. This is further supported by the belief that occupational opportunities resulting from education are greater for males, as females have greater difficulty in finding jobs that match their academic credentials even if they have the same education level. Both genders have equal access to the limited available educational facilities; however, attendance rates for females were slightly lower than for males.\n\nThe quality of the curriculum in Honduran public schools is poor, evidenced by the fact that for much of the last century, Honduran students were required to memorize useless or impractical data at the expense of sharpening their reasoning powers and critical thinking skills. Teachers are paid low wages, they do not have access to effective teaching materials, and they are not trained in the latest technologies and current teaching methods.\nIn addition, there is a scarcity of teachers, with a teacher:student ratio of 1:33 in 2008. The destruction of over 3000 schools nationwide caused by Hurricane Mitch further weakened the country’s poor education infrastructure.\n"}

Research states that between 90% and 93% of the Dutch population claims to be able to converse in English. According to some, the main reasons for the high degree of English speakers is the country's small size, dependency on international trade, and the use of subtitles for foreign languages on television rather than audio dubbing. Dutch's genealogical proximity to English is also noted as a significant factor; both languages are closely related West Germanic languages. Occupations which require a complex knowledge of the English language, such as those in aviation and the sciences, are also abundant in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it is an official and the majority language in the Caribbean municipalities of Saba and Sint Eustatius.\n\nVarious explanations contribute to the popularity of English in the Netherlands. Due to the small size and population of the Netherlands, and hundreds of years of having a trade and commerce economy, particularly between mainland Europe and the United Kingdom, the Dutch put strong emphasis on learning English and other foreign languages, especially German. The Netherlands was also liberated from the Germans by English speaking troops, boosting the status of the English language. In the following decades, with American-dominated globalization, English gradually increased in importance as a lingua franca, at the expense of German and French, both losing popularity as secondary languages in the latter part of the 20th century. This is in spite of the fact that German is linguistically much closer to Dutch than English, and that Germany is the most important trade partner of the Netherlands. Nevertheless, knowledge of more than one foreign language is still widespread compared to other states of the European Union.\n\nIn Amsterdam, in particular, visitors may get the impression that it is possible to live in the Netherlands for a long time without learning Dutch. A substantial number of the inhabitants of Amsterdam have English as their native language (mostly British and North American immigrants), however most of them make an effort to learn at least some Dutch. Nevertheless, in and around Amsterdam one may find announcements, traffic signs and advertisements in both Dutch and English, or even in English only (as in Schiphol Airport). Amsterdam however already has had an English speaking community for hundreds of years. A church worshipping in English, the English Reformed Church was reopened for worship in 1607.\n\nNowadays, most important scholarly and scientific publications in the Netherlands are in English with the exception of government related and legal publications.\n\nEnglish is compulsory on all levels of the Dutch secondary education system. In addition:\nPupils learn Received Pronunciation/ Queen's English.\nSince high schools in the Netherlands have different levels of education (preparatory mid-level professional, higher general continued education , pre-university college/preparatory scientific education. A test from elementary school together with the advice of the teacher will determine which level a pupil will attend.)\nWhere the first one will teach a pupil enough English to have simple conversations.\nThe second will be focused on achieving the ability to speak formally and in a professional setting.\nThe third is focused on understanding the most difficult kinds texts and communicating on a university/scientific level, which is a little bit more than a master in English needed for British universities would ask. Though without the proverbs and or sayings.\n\nIn addition to the availability of the British channels BBC One, Two and World, the American CNN and the English edition of Al Jazeera, many programmes broadcast on Dutch channels are broadcast in English with Dutch subtitles. English language children's programmes, however, are usually dubbed.\nDubbed commercials, films and TV programmes (apart from animations and cartoons) have often come to be disliked by the Dutch public. People very much prefer these to be broadcast with subtitles, or even with no form of translation whatsoever.\n\nApart from this, there are a few television stations broadcasting in English, targeting the English speaking community of the Netherlands, such as AF-TV, or dedicating large portions of airtime to programming in English, such as RTV7 and Amsterdam local TV channel Salto 1. (See also: Television in the Netherlands)\n\nDunglish (called \"steenkolenengels\" in Dutch translating to \"coal English\") is a portmanteau of \"Dutch\" and \"English\" and a term often used pejoratively to refer to the mistakes native Dutch speakers make when speaking English.\n\nAnglophobia, or more accurately linguistic anglophobia, within the European Dutch language area (i.e. the Netherlands and Flanders) has evolved out of schools and companies switching to English as medium of communication and a large number of English loanwords in the Dutch language. Consequentially this has led to some anglophobia with some groups advocating to dispose of all English loanwords.\n\nEnglish disease (Dutch: \"Engelse ziekte\") is a pejorative term for the effect of the English language on the use of linguistic compounds in written Dutch. The anglicisms (and sometimes Americanisms) enter the written language as a result of being exposed to English words and expressions.\n\n\n"}

It addresses issues such as twin studies, sex differences and socio-economic status. Part one is summarized in 7 \"big ideas\" which are the following:\n\nAverage school performance doesn’t change the fact that half of the students will fall above and the other half below the average. Seeing those scoring below average as ‘failing’ wastes resources on approaches that have little or no effect. Instead of making pupils identical, the diversity should be embraced after providing a certain level of common education.\n\nStudents that are high performing or low performing are no more likely to be more genetically exceptional than an average student and same genes influence performance all across the distribution of performance. In other words, a math professor and a student struggling with mathematics are using the same genes when they perform mathematical tasks. There are many genes with small effect which are working together in an interplay with many environmental experiences and the same genes can have allelic differences. This is why turning on or off genes is unlikely to have large effects.\n\nSchool performance is influenced by the same genes across life span and dramatic fluctuations in performance are likely to be caused by environment, not biology. Even though it’s likely that emerging biotechnology will make it possible to have predictive genetic information relevant to learning, the predictions can never reach full accuracy because of environmental factors.\n\nGenes that influence one cognitive ability are likely to influence others as well; for example high performance on a reading test predicts high performance on math test. Education, on the other hand, is more specific and increasing performance in one area doesn’t transmit to other areas to the same extent.\n\nGenetics influence individuals as they select their environment.\n\nIdentical twins raised in same households and who are taught by the same teachers still differ from each other. The differences not explained by shared genes or family household, the \"non-shared environment\", accounts for most of the environmental influence.\n\nPerfect equality of opportunity would still result in differences between individuals, but these differences would be more due to genetics. There is a need to introduce more choice so different natures can be nurtured to full potential.\n\nThe part two consists of eleven practical policy recommendations and their genetic basis.\n\nThe mandatory learning should be minimized to the skills that are required to succeed in society, such as reading and numeracy.\n\nPupils should be able to choose from a large variety of subject options according to their own interests, particularly as they get older.\n\nExtra help should be given to those who need it as quickly as possible with as little labels and bureaucracy as possible.\n\nPupils should have an Individual Education Plan that would be reviewed and revised each year and would serve as the basis for their school-leaving certificate.\n\nIQ and self-confidence have a positive impact on education and both can be improved with coaching. Such coaching is described as \"Thinking Skills Sessions\" and should be provided for an hour every week for every student.\n\nDisadvantaged children from age 2 should be offered free high-quality preschool education. All children aged 3 – 4 should be offered high quality preschool education tailored according to their needs and extra support should be provided to all low-SES families from birth.\nThe playing field for extracurricular activities should be made more equal by providing poor families with vouchers that can be exchanged to extracurricular activities based in schools or elsewhere.\n\nPupils should first have a standardized PE program where they would be exposed to different activities. The next stage would be choice-driven and pupils would be given the opportunity to choose from the activities introduced to them in the earlier stage.\n\nMake apprenticeships more attractive and affordable to employers and increase the number and variety of options available for work and college based vocational training.\n\nInclude a course on genetics of learning in teacher training and make useful information about personalization of education available to all schools.\n\nMake the schools bigger to increase capability to provide larger variety of options. Make the links between different levels of schooling stronger.\n\nThe book sparked public debate and was for example featured in BBC radio programme The Moral Maze. Steven Pinker wrote in his review of the book \"This may be the most important book about educational theory and practice in the new millennium, giving educators, policy-makers, and parents much to think about.\"\n"}

It became an umbrella organization of the pioneering Zionist youth movements.\n\nHeHalutz was founded by Eliezer Joffe in America in 1905, and about the same time in Russia.\n\nDuring World War I, HeHalutz branches opened across Europe (including Russia), America and Canada. Leaders of the organization included Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (later the second president of the State of Israel), and David Ben-Gurion (later the first Prime Minister of Israel) in America, and Joseph Trumpeldor in Russia.\n\nBen-Gurion was living in Jerusalem at the start of the First World War, where he and Ben Zvi recruited forty Jews into a Jewish militia to assist the Ottoman army. Despite this, he was deported to Egypt in March 1915. From there he made his way to the United States, where he remained for three years. On his arrival, he and Ben Zvi went on a tour of 35 cities in an attempt to raise a Hechalutz \"pioneer army\" of 10,000 men to fight on Turkey's side. After the Balfour Declaration of November 1917, the situation changed dramatically and Ben-Gurion, with the interest of Zionism in mind, switched sides and joined the newly formed Jewish Legion of the British Army, leaving to fight the Turks in Palestine.\n\nAt its peak, between 1930 and 1935, HeHalutz operated in 25 countries throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Northern South America. In 1932-1934, Golda Meir, later the prime minister of Israel, was the secretary of the women's chapter of HeHalutz in the United States.\n\nIn 1932, the organization established headquarters in New York and twenty branches in cities and towns throughout the United States and Canada. Farms were then established to train members for agricultural work in Palestine. Such farms operated in Creamridge, New Jersey, Heightstown, New Jersey, Poughkeepsie, New York, Smithville, Ontario., and Colton, California. \n\nIn 1933, after Jews were expelled from the workforce in Nazi Germany, HeHalutz farms became the primary framework for vocational training and preparation for emigration. \n\nBy the eve of Second World War in 1939, HeHalutz numbered 100,000 members worldwide, with approximately 60,000 having already emigrated (\"aliyah\") to Mandate Palestine, and with 16,000 members in training centers (\"hakhsharot\") for the pioneering life in the Land of Israel. During the war and German occupation, Jews in some ghettos in Europe established Hechalutz units, as in Lithuania's Šiauliai Ghetto.

Henriette married the Cologne businessman Emil Mayer in 1857, who had moved to Antwerp to open a franchise for his family's pharmacy and spice business. The Mayer-Van den Berghs purchased the 'Hof van Arenberg' on the corner of Lange Gasthuisstraat and Arenbergstraat in 1861 and renovated it to suit their taste. They had two sons, Fritz and Oscar. After the death of her husband Emil in 1879, Henriette withdrew from society but turned to the study of art. Her oldest son Fritz broke off his studies to move back in with her and Oscar took over the family business. In 1887 Fritz took her name, and in 1888 both sons were granted noble titles. Fritz became thereafter known in the art world as 'Chev. Mayer-van den Bergh'.\n\nDuring the years her husband was alive, Henriette was probably already active as a collector, as the archives of her museum have provenance notes by her son Fritz indicating \"Maman\" for works purchased by her. After her son returned to live with her, he first spent time on his own numismatic collection and then turned his attention to cataloguing the family's art. In 1892, mother and son sold a large part of their collection, presumably to enable Fritz to make serious acquisitions with an eye for founding a museum. During the next nine years he became a dealer in his own right, making sales and purchases to augment his growing collection. After his untimely death, Henriette fulfilled his dream, hiring the architect Joseph Hertogs to build an adjacent building in Gothic style, and hiring advisors to help her oversee her son's estate, while securing his papers regarding the core collection that was destined for the museum. She curated the museum herself until she died, leaving a legacy that has survived to the present day.\n\n"}
{"id": "53573494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53573494", "title": "History of early childhood care and education", "text": "History of early childhood care and education\n\nThe History of early childhood care and education (ECCE) refers to the development of care and education of children between birth and eight years old throughout history. ECCE has a global scope, and caring for and educating young children has always been an integral part of human societies. Arrangements for fulfilling these societal roles have evolved over time and remain varied across cultures, often reflecting family and community structures as well as the social and economic roles of women and men. Historically, such arrangements have largely been informal, involving family, household and community members. The formalization of these arrangements emerged in the nineteenth century with the establishment of kindergartens for educational purposes and day nurseries for care in much of Europe and North America, Brazil, China, India, Jamaica and Mexico.\n\nState-led expansion of ECCE services first emerged in the Russian Federation in the early twentieth century as part of the socialist project to foster equal participation of women and men in production and in public life, and to publicly provide education from the youngest possible age. This development extended to socialist or former socialist countries such as Cambodia, China and Viet Nam. France was another early starter having integrated pre-school into its education system as early as 1886 and expanded its provision in the 1950s. In real terms, the significant expansion of ECCE services began in the 1960s with the considerable growth in women's participation in the labour market and extensive developments in child and family policies in Europe and the United States of America.\n\nThe 1990s opened a new page in the history of the development of ECCE catalysed mainly by the rapid and successive ratification of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). By its explicit mention of 'the child' – meaning every human being under the age of eighteen or majority – the CRC reinforced the 1960 UNESCO Convention and Recommendation against Discrimination in Education which should have covered young children in any case. With its moral force and near universal ratification, the CRC formally recognized children as holders of rights to survival and development, to be heard and to participate in decisions affecting them in accordance with their evolving capacities with their best interests and non-discrimination as overarching principles. While the CRC in Article 18 also recognizes the primary role of parents and legal guardians in the upbringing and development of children, it obliges States Parties to help them carry out these duties.\n\nThe second boost to the development of ECCE was the adoption of the World Declaration on Education for All (EFA) in March 1990 in Jomtien, Thailand. Reflecting General Comment 7, the Jomtien Declaration explicitly stated that 'learning begins at birth', and called for 'early childhood care and initial education' (Article 5). This novel recognition of ECCE as an integral part of basic education featured again in the major goals adopted at the 1990 UN World Summit for Children. Ten years later, in 2000, this expanded vision of basic education was rearmed in the Dakar Framework for Action on EFA, adopted at the World Education Forum as the first of the six EFA goals: 'Expanding and improving comprehensive ECCE especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children'. Regrettably, unlike other EFA goals, this was stated as a broad and aspirational goal without numerical targets or clear benchmarks.\n\nECCE was further reinforced by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), albeit only partially. Adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, two of the MDGs had direct relevance to early childhood development: (i) improving maternal health, with the targets of reducing the maternal mortality rates by three-quarters and providing universal access to reproductive health (MDG4), and (ii) reducing the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 (MDG5). Thus, the child and maternal health aspects of ECCE became part and parcel of a global 'effort to meet the needs of the world's poorest' while childcare and early education aspects were left out.\n\nIn recent decades, ECCE has further received attention from diverse stakeholders including research communities, civil society and intergovernmental organizations which furthered understanding of its holistic and multisectoral nature. Research continues to document the multifaceted development benefits of ECCE for health, education, social and emotional well-being, social equity and cohesion, the economy, employment and earnings.\n\n\n"}

His family lived in Schulstraße 17, not far from today's subway station Leopoldplatz.\n\nWhen he was a student he met Magnus Hirschfeld after a lecture in Munich around 1918-1920. Later, Giese became an employee in Institut für Sexualwissenschaft and finally a lover of Hirschfeld. He took over the management of the archive of Institut für Sexualwissenschaft. Hirschfeld described their relationship as a \"physical-mental connection\". Giese also gave lectures, curated exhibitions and wrote articles.\n\nDuring this time, Giese met the British archaeologist Francis Turville-Petre and the French author and later Nobel Prize laureate André Gide. British-American writer Christopher Isherwood, who lived for some months in the neighboring building, wrote about himself and Karl Giese: \n\nEllen Bækgaard, a dentist from Copenhagen and World League for Sexual Reform committee member, describes Giese in her memoirs as \"woman of the house\". According to Bækgaard, Giese enjoyed decorating the place and doing needlework, as well as looking after Hirschfeld's wardrobe.\n\nKarl Giese was interested in theater and acting. He was part of a theater group \"Theater der Eigenen\". Giese also had a role as the young violinist Paul Körner in Richard Oswald's film Different from the Others \n\nWhen Magnus Hirschfeld traveled on world tour in 1930, he entrusted Giese to run the affairs of the institute.\n\nHirschfeld did not return to Germany from his world journey in 1932, and Giese went to meet him in Paris. He found Hirschfeld living with another partner, 23 year old Chinese medical student Li Shiu Tong. Despite some initial jealousy, they all lived together in Paris in a \"menage a trois\".\n\nAfter the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin fell victim to the Nazi Regime with books from its library burned, Giese spent several months in Brno in 1933 trying to purchase surviving literature from the Institut's archives. He also made contact with the magazine, \"Nový Hlas: list pro sexuální reformu\" (\"New Voice: Journal of Sexual Reform\"), arranging the publication of some articles by both Hirschfeld and himself.\n\nIn 1934, Karl Giese was caught having sex with another man in a public bathhouse and sentenced to three months in prison on charges of \"arousal of public annoyance\". As a result of his imprisonment, Giese's residence permit was not extended and he was forcibly required to leave France in October 1934. He then went to Vienna and lived there for a year, studying for matriculation exams. Hirschfeld, Bækgaard and Norman Haire provided him with money for living and studying. Hirschfeld and other Giese benefactors hoped for him to study medicine in London after completing exams in Vienna.\n\nAfter Hirschfeld's death in 1935, Giese managed to return to Nice for the funeral. Two months before his death, Hirschfeld had named his two lovers, Li Shiu Tong and Karl Giese, as his sole heirs. However, Hirschfeld stipulated in his will that both men use their inheritance for the purposes of sexual science and not for personal use. Karl Giese was awarded the library and the objects that had been saved from the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft. Eventually he wasn't able to use his inheritance. Norman Haire privately provided Giese with financial help in the hopes he'd settle in Britain as per Hirschfeld's wishes. However, Giese moved to Brno in 1936 and lived with Karel Fein for several months before moving into his own flat.\n\nIn March 1938 Karl Giese committed suicide in Brno. His heir, the lawyer Karl Fein, was deported and murdered by the Nazi regime in 1942. All of Giese's possessions, including his inheritance from Hirschenfeld, have since been lost.\n\nA memorial plaque was laid in front of his former residence in Berlin-Tiergarten, John-Foster-Dulles-Allee 10 on February 9, 2016.\n"}

It is an AmeriCorps program administered by Equal Justice Works. Nationally, there are 18 of these projects. Individual programs vary greatly; however, all seek to engage law students in the delivery of legal services. \n\nThe goal of LSAP is twofold. First, it provides law students with pro bono opportunities with non-profit public interest law firms throughout the LAWNY service area and beyond. Secondly, by placing student volunteers at these firms, it helps the firms deliver services to their clients more effectively. In addition, LSAP is designed to encourage law students to continue engaging in public service and \"pro bono\" activities as attorneys. \n\nTo accomplish these goals, LSAP works with public interest law firms in Western and Central New York to create placement opportunities and projects for students and to encourage the use of law students as a regular part of the delivery of legal services. LSAP also works with area law schools to promote student interest in public interest law and pro bono activities both while in law school and in the future. In addition, LSAP works to encourage area law schools to create lasting partnerships in the public interest community, create programs which promote public interest and \"pro bono\" work, and create programs and systemic changes which seek to ease the difficulties associated with such work.\n\nLSAP provides numerous opportunities for law students to volunteer both during the school year and during the summer. The Volunteer Research Assistance Team, Spanish Translation and Interpretation Assistance Team, and the Pro Bono Assistance Project are primarily remote projects in which law students can volunteer their time from home or school. Students are rarely required to work at the requesting office. Semester and winter/spring break internships offer law students the ability to get some hands-on experience in a public interest law office setting while taking classes or during their breaks. \n\nLSAP has a \"pro se\" divorce clinic and a re-entry clinic through its Tompkins/Tioga Neighborhood Legal Services office in Ithaca, New York. The pro se divorce clinic allows law students to assist clients with \"do-it-yourself\" divorces. The second clinic allows law students to provide advice to clients on prisoner re-entry issues in a supervised setting. This clinic focuses on issues such as cleaning up rap sheets.\n\nThe Summer Associate Program is LSAP’s signature internship opportunity of the year, with SAP recruitment lasting from late summer through the winter months.\n\nLSAP’s Summer Associate Program (SAP) combines a legal internship with substantive legal trainings, lunch discussions and social activities. The program is designed to provide students with a comprehensive experience, similar to that provided by a big firm summer associate program. For rising 3Ls, the Summer Associate Program provides them with the opportunity to seek sponsorship in the fellowship process with one of the LAWNY offices. The LAWNY offices currently have particular projects which they are interested in sponsoring, but all project applications are considered.\n\nLSAP begins recruiting for the Summer Associate Program in the prior fall as part of the general fall recruiting season. Recruiters post the program announcement at numerous law schools across the country, which will then collect any resumes and forward them to the recruiters for review. Interested law students may also apply directly.\n\nThe 2007 program included a two-day orientation in May, a mandatory substantive training in June, and a number of social events capped off by the Summer Social in late July.\n\nOrientation training includes discussion of the Student Handbook/LSAP Policies and Procedures, Housing, Public Benefits, Domestic Violence, Client Interviewing Skills, Cultural Competency, and Ethics. Substantive training has included Family Law, Consumer Law, Disability Advocacy (SSI/SSD), and Elder Law.\n\nLSAP has 35-40 openings in its Summer Associate Program. Internships are available in the following substantive areas: consumer rights, disability, domestic violence, education, elder law, employment, family law, farmworker rights, health law, housing, immigration, prisoner re-entry, and public benefits. Applications must be received no later than Friday, February 1, 2008. Because LSAP will be interviewing at a number of career fairs, the deadline for submission may be earlier for these interviewing opportunities. \n\nLSAP seeks dedicated, hardworking and public interest-minded students for its Summer Associate Program. Summer Associates are expected to work an average of 30 hours per week for at least 10 weeks in a given 12-week timeframe. Some placements may allow for part-time work and are indicated as such. The Summer Associate Program begins in May with a two-day mandatory orientation program. This orientation will provide summer associates with an introduction to the Law Students in Action Project and their placements, as well as the practice of public interest law. The goal of the LSAP Summer Associate Program is to provide law students with an exciting and challenging introduction to public interest law and a career in the legal profession. \n\nDue to programming and funding restraints, LSAP Summer Associate positions are unpaid.\n\n\n"}

The process generally works within each class, where the instructor grades each exam, and then ranks the exams against each other, adding to and subtracting from the initial grades so that the overall grade distribution matches the school's specified curve (usually a bell curve). \"The curve\" is the permitted range of each letter grade that can be awarded, for example, 0-3% A+, 3-7% A, etc. Curves vary between different law schools, as do the rules for when the curve is mandatory versus suggestive. It is common for the curve to be mandatory for first year (\"1L\") courses, and for classes above a certain size.\n\nGrading on a curve contributes to the notoriously competitive atmosphere within law schools. \"The main source of this competition is the mandatory curve you will likely encounter once you enter law school. The curve affects the class rank, affects the chances of making law review, affects the chances of scoring that big job/externship.\" Some law schools set their curve lower to retain scholarship funding; others set their curve higher to make their students more competitive in the job market.\n\nThe following list shows where law schools set the 50% mark for an individual class subject to the curve. Because not all classes are curved and because professors still have discretion within the curve's ranges, where a law school sets its curve is not necessarily revealing of that school's average student GPA (whether after 1L or upon graduation).\n\n\nThe following law schools have adopted a grading system which does not allow for the calculation of a comparable median GPA on a 4.0 scale, if any GPA is recorded at all:\n"}

As with a major, the college or university in question lays out a framework of required classes or class types a student must complete to earn the minor—although the latitude the student is given changes from college to college. Academic minors and majors differ in that the former is subordinate to the latter. To obtain an academic minor, a total of three years of study at a university in a selected subject is the usual requirement.\n\nSome students will prepare for their intended career with their major, while pursuing personal interests with a minor, for example, majoring in civil engineering while minoring in a foreign language or performing arts. Other students may pursue a minor to provide specific specialization and thus make themselves more attractive to employers. It is not infrequent for a physics major to minor in computer science, or an engineering or economics student to minor in mathematics. Students intending to become secondary education teachers often major in their teaching subject area (for example, history or chemistry) and minor in education.\n\nWhile academic minors are usually associated with undergraduate degrees as a student's secondary focus, academic minors also exist at the graduate level, particularly in U.S. institutions. Sometimes this can refer to a student's minor or secondary field within their discipline, such as a Political Science PhD student pursuing a major field in American Politics and a minor field in Political Theory, or a Religious Studies PhD student pursuing a major field in Theology and a minor field in History of Religion. \nHowever, as in undergraduate courses of study, outside graduate study minors also exist at many universities - sometimes officially and sometimes unofficially. For example, at Oregon State University, Master's and PhD students are able to pursue an official graduate minor in addition to the discipline of their degree. At Florida State University, graduate minors exist on an unofficial basis on the grounds that a Master's or Doctoral student takes at least 9 and at most 18 credit hours in a secondary field outside of his or her academic discipline.\nTypically, an outside minor at the maximum allowed credit hours or quarter credit units (typically 18 credit hours in many public universities, or 24 credit units at others) fulfills a qualifying requirement to teach the discipline as an adjunct at a community college or state college, and the research experience and connections from an outside minor can also be tailored toward pursuing a non-academic career related to the minor field. \nSome PhD students, pursuing an outside graduate minor, choose to integrate the minor field into their dissertation with a scholar from their minor field serving as an outside committee member on their dissertation.\n"}

It began in 2007 in response to the variety of new materials and technologies being used by contemporary artists in their work, and the lack of known conservation treatments for these new materials. This area was seen as a gap in the field of conservation, but also posed unique challenges when considering the intention of the artist and the physical aging that his or her materials might endure. According to Thomas F. Reese, \"Conservators...must enter into the critical spirit of the works themselves if they are to save and transmit not merely decontextualized fragments but their essence to the future.\" \n\nThis program consists of various individual research projects that are looking to the conservation issue surrounding modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture, among other areas as well. The Getty Conservation Institute works collaboratively with other cultural institutions and conservation institutes on these projects, and states its goal for the program as being to making \"significant and lasting impact on the field in this area.\" The GCI is able to take on this project thanks to its role within the larger J. Paul Getty Trust - the Institute has access to its broader resources, and has the opportunity to choose projects that best serve its mission: \"to advance conservation practice in the visual arts, including objects, collections, architecture and sites.\"\n\n\nAccording to the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), those participating in this research initiative are intending to address the aforementioned concerns surrounding the conservation of modern and contemporary art in the following ways:\n\nThough there are several challenges that face conservators with regard to modern and contemporary art, the CGI has focused its resources on three major areas that are in need of further research and information sharing. Because these materials and types of art objects are still rather new to the field, conservators have worked to identify the areas that require the most immediate attention. Currently, the three major projects focus on modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture.\nThe Modern Paints Project is a collaborative research project that began in response to the various new materials that contemporary artists are using in their work. Major collaborators include the Tate London, The National Gallery in Washington, DC, the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute, and several other international and domestic museums and cultural institutions. After 1920, cellulose nitrate was successfully converted into a form that could be used as a paint binder. Following this, the paints that artists were using were constantly changing and were composed of synthetic binders. While these various paints were utilized by several artists in the 20th century and up to the present day, the knowledge regarding how well any of these modern paints would withstand the passing of time is still extremely limited. Research is needed to determine the extent of the probable deterioration. In 2004, Thomas Learner, a senior conservation scientist at the Tate, London, published the findings of his research into the types of techniques currently being used to test and learn more about the synthetic resins and materials used in many modern commercial paints. \n\nThis project intends to increase in a significant and valuable way the amount of information available to conservators on modern paints, so that those working on objects of this sort are able to make informed decisions with regard to their treatments. This in-depth research will help conservators who study the techniques of modern painters. It also aims to assist them with determining the best storage and display conditions, and also contribute significantly to the development of safe and effective cleaning methods and other treatments. In order to do this, researchers monitor the behavior of actual art objects and conduct extensive analytical testing on materials. \n\n1. Assessment of analytical methods for modern paints:\nAt the beginning of this project, there were very few methods established for identifying any of the components of modern paints, but by using several analytical techniques and scientific tests, conservators have been successful in being able to identify the binding agent, types of pigments, and additives in modern paints. Through this testing, the researchers have been able to select a number of testing techniques that are commonly used to make these identifications, giving them a better idea of how to move forward with future testing on objects. \n\n2. Study of the physical and surface properties of modern paints:\nBecause these paints are still being identified, their physical characteristics are still somewhat unknown. This area of the project intends to determine how the newer materials will respond to changes in temperature and relative humidity. The methods for measuring these properties in changing environments are thermal analysis, mechanical analysis, and surface characterization. The main challenge here, despite the fact that almost all of the materials used are completely new, is keeping track of the huge amount of variation between paints and their physical makeups. \n\n3. Evaluation of cleaning methods for modern paintings:\nThis main area of focus stems from the goal to develop an established method for cleaning modern paintings. Like the analysis of the environment responses, this area of focus consists of analytical testing to monitor any potential changes that could occur with cleaning treatments. The Tate London has worked closely with the Getty on each of these components of the project, but has played a leading role in this aspect in particular. \n\nLike the Modern Paints Project, plastics are a new medium for conservators to deal with. The composition of the material is largely unknown, and the Preservation of Plastics project aims to help conservators understand why some plastics are more unstable than others. Research is required in this area because while degradation of plastics has been an ongoing issue in museums for several years, the main cause for concern is the rapid deterioration o the material with no obvious warning sign. \n\nThe main goal of this project is to develop strategies that improve the preservation and maintenance of objects in museum collections. Its aim is to coordinate scientific studies with the projects multiple collaborators to establish recommended practices for risks associated with handling these artifacts. \n\nThe larger POPART project involves five steps:\n\nThe Getty Conservation Institute's project, the Preservation of Plastics, focuses specifically on coordinating the comparison of a wide range of analytical techniques for plastics identification and to participate in a details study into the physical and aging properties of a few key classes of polymer specifically. As with the Modern Paints project, if the conservators can learn more about these new materials being used, they can develop a procedure for how to treat them.\n\nThis project stems from the recognition that outdoor sculpture is by nature particularly prone to damage but that research in this area was lacking. Conservation of outdoor painted sculpture works is especially challenging, given the uncontrolled, and often harsh, environments to which works are constantly exposed. Collaborators on the project took a step back and looked at current interests, needs, and practices in the conservation of modern and contemporary outdoor painted sculpture. \n\nThe goals of this project, according to the Getty Conservation Institute are as follows:\n• Facilitate dialogue between professionals involved in the conservation of outdoor painted sculpture (conservators, paint chemists, paint industry, artists' estates, foundations, and studios, curators, and caretakers). \n• Create guidelines for the production of paint swatches, for the documentation of paint surfaces (gloss, color and texture), and for the sharing of such information among those involved in the preservation of outdoor painted sculpture\n• Collaborate with artists', estates, foundations, and studios (EFS) to develop guidelines on original paint surfaces related to their respective artists and best practices for production of EFS-approved coupons.\n• Develop paints specifically formulated for the field, with improved durability and suitable working and optical properties in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory and the paint industry, and in consultation with conservators and EFS\n• Explore the possibility of carrying out local retouching to increase the duration between costly and invasive stripping and repainting campaigns\n• Carry out a number of case studies on outdoor painted sculpture and sculpture parks to explore bridges between theory and practice\n\nOver the long term the project seeks to build a repository of paint swatches documenting original paints and/or paints approved by EFS; to build bridges between industry and the conservation profession, and to disseminate the knowledge gained through courses and online publications. \n\n1. Documenting original paint sources:\nOutdoor painted sculpture is unique in that the paint is an important visual element of the object itself, but the paint also serves as a protection to the metal substrate of the object. The paint layer can also work to prevent corrosion of the metal underneath. As a result, when the paint chips or peels off, the sculptures are often repainted to both improve their appearance and protect them from the elements that they are exposed to. This proves to be an issue when the sculpture is repainted an incorrect color or finish, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and the work is changed from its originally intended appearance. For this reason, documenting the original paint source for a contemporary outdoor sculpture is considered a main area of focus of this project - this would give the conservators something to refer back to before conducting any further treatments.\n\n2. Analyzing and understanding paint composition:\nMuch like the Modern Paints Project, the type of paints used on outdoor sculptures are mainly commercial produced automotive or industrial paints, meaning that the complete composition of the paint is usually unknown to the conservators. For this reason, conducting testing on the paints used has been deemed essential in figuring out how to best treat these types of works.\n\n3. Developing new paint systems:\nAlthough good paints with excellent performance characteristics are commercially available, they may not match all the requirements necessary for conservation treatment. To address these issues the GCI has partnered with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), which has been working to investigate new paint formulations suitable for conservation—the project builds off of previous work on matte black paints for Calder carried out by the ARL in collaboration with the National Gallery, Washington DC.\n\n4. Collaborating with artists' estates, foundations, and studios:\nThis area of focus is more of an ethical or philosophical discussion surrounding the involvement of artists' studios and estates in determining guidelines for repainting outdoor sculpture.\n\nFrom its launch, the Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative has taken an expansive approach to its research efforts regarding modern and contemporary works of art. While focusing on learning about the behaviors of new materials, specifically polymers, resins, plastics, modern paints, etc., the GCI has also considered how to best share its discoveries with conservators working in the field. Along with its several collaborators, the Getty Conservation Institute has organized several conferences to disseminate its findings and continue to discuss the questions and issues surrounding modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture conservation. In addition to meetings such as the Modern Paints Uncovered Symposium, hosted by the Tate Modern in May 2006, and the Object in Transition Conference held in January 2008, those involved with each project publish their findings in the Getty Conservation Institute's newsletters, as well as other conservation publications.\n\n\n"}

It uses a quiz-bowl format, with lockout buzzers and extended team challenge questions to test students on their knowledge of oceanography. This includes the subjects of biology, chemistry, geology, geography, social science, technology, and physics. The annual competition was started in 1998, the International Year of the Ocean. The current director of NOSB is Kristen Yarincik, who is based out of Washington, DC. Currently there are 25 regions in the U.S. that compete in the NOSB, each with their own regional competitions. The regional competitions are coordinated by the Regional Coordinators, who are typically affiliated with a university in their region. Each year approximately 2,000 students from 300 schools across the nation compete for prizes and a trip to the national competition. The goal of this organization is to increase knowledge of the ocean among high school students and, ultimately, magnify the public understanding of ocean research. Students who participate are eligible to apply for the National Ocean Scholar Program.\n\nSchools with greatest number of wins\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2017 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\nKalani High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2016 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\nYork High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2015 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\nSanger High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2014 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\nLangham Creek High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2013 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\nAnnapolis Christian Academy won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2012 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2011 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2010 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\nLangham Creek High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2009 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2008 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nKealakehe High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2007 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nPoplarville High School won the sportsmanship award.\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2006 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nTop-placing teams at the 2005 National Ocean Sciences Bowl:\n\nPast National Ocean Sciences Bowl Winners:\n\nThe prizes for placing at the national competition vary from year to year.

The prizes for the three most recent competition years are listed below. \n\n2016\n\n2015\n2014\n2013\n\n\nA single NOSB match consists of two 6-minute buzzer rounds with two Team Challenge Questions in between. Each round is made up of 20 questions pairs. After the break, the second half begins with the first toss-up that was not read in the first half and continues until time expires or all questions have been read. The most points a team can earn each round is 240 points (20 toss-ups and bonuses each plus full-credit on the two TCQs), but earning 100 or more points is considered very impressive. Teams may make substitutions only during the break.\n\nWith the exception of articles such as \"a\",\"an\", and \"the\", answers to multiple-choice questions must be exactly as those on the written page. Prefacing answers with phrases such as \"My answer is\" is not acceptable.\n\nThe SEB is a mock congressional hearing where students present science recommendations on a piece of legislation, enhancing the critical thinking elements of the competition and focusing on real-world skills. Regional bowl winners must participate in the SEB to be eligible for the national finals.\n\n\nThe National competition is held in one of the participating colleges that hold the regional bowls. These colleges draw from high schools in their area and run the regional competitions, often naming the regional according to the characteristics of the region. For example, the region encompassing Colorado and the surrounding area is called the \"Trout Bowl.\" The annual themes, since 2008, are also listed below.\n\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2016, NOSB held a video contest. Submissions were judged on multiple criteria, with a maximum length of two minutes. The theme of the contest changes each year along with the National competition themes. The winners were:\n\n\n"}

The award comes with a federal grant for research and education activities for five consecutive years. NSF grants these awards once a year. The reviewing, award and selection process is one of the most competitive within the NSF.\n\nNSF CAREER awards support promising and talented researchers in building a foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. NSF encourages submission of CAREER proposals from junior faculty members at all CAREER-eligible organizations.\n\nIn 1983 the Presidential Young Investigators (PYI) program was initiated. It remained active until the NSF New Young Investigators (NYI) program replaced it in 1992. Both programs were research-oriented and funded an average of 200 faculty per year. Another, more selective program began in 1992, when the White House asked NSF to institute the Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) program. The PFF awarded young faculty up to $100,000 per year for five years with no matching-fund option. The PFF also put more emphasis on education and outreach activities. In 1994, the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program was approved by NSF's National Science Board. The first awards were made in FY 1995. Several programs were terminated and their objectives incorporated into CAREER.\n\nThe most recent shift occurred in 1996, when the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) program was instituted, replacing the PFF awards. Beginning in FY 1997, nominees were selected by the NSF from among the \"most meritorious first year CAREER awardees supported by the CAREER program.\" In the same year, the CAREER program announcement termed CAREER \"a premier program.\" When a CAREER awardee is granted a PECASE award, the funding level is adjusted to the maximum amount of $500,000 over a five-year period. A maximum of 20 PECASE awards are granted per year to NSF nominees (and 40 more to nominees of other federal agencies).\n"}

{"id": "47890212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47890212", "title": "Piggate", "text": "Piggate\n\n\"Piggate\" refers to an uncorroborated anecdote that during his university years former British prime minister David Cameron put a \"private part of his anatomy\" into a dead pig's mouth as part of an initiation ceremony for the Piers Gaveston Society. The anecdote was reported by Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott in their unauthorised biography of Cameron, \"Call Me Dave\", attributing the story to an anonymous Member of Parliament who was a \"distinguished Oxford contemporary\" of Cameron's. Extracts from the book were published in the \"Daily Mail\" on 21 September 2015, prior to its publication.\n\nDowning Street sources responded by saying that Cameron would not dignify the anecdote with a response while friends reported him saying that it was \"utter nonsense\". Cameron said later that \"a very specific denial was made a week ago\".\n\nAshcroft and Oakeshott failed to receive a response from the purported owner of a photograph of the alleged incident, and since the extract's publication no corroborating evidence has as yet been produced to support the anecdote.\n\nIn an interview, Valentine Guinness, one of the Piers Gaveston Society founders, said that Cameron \"may well have attended one of their parties\" but as far as he knew he was never a member.\n\nIt was alleged that, as a student at Oxford University, former British prime minister David Cameron inserted \"a private part of his anatomy\" into the mouth of a dead pig, as part of an initiation ceremony for the Piers Gaveston Society. The pig's head is said to have been resting on the lap of another society member during the act.\n\nIn their unauthorised biography of Cameron, \"Call Me Dave\", Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott recount that a Member of Parliament and \"distinguished Oxford contemporary\" told the anecdote \"out of the blue\" at a business dinner in June 2014. They initially assumed the statement to be a joke, but the MP repeated the anecdote some weeks later, and for a third time with more detail some months after that. The MP claimed to have seen photographic evidence of the event, describing the dimensions of the alleged photograph and naming an individual who he claimed now possessed the image.\n\nAshcroft and Oakeshott failed to receive a response from the purported owner of a photograph of the alleged incident, and since the extract's publication no corroborating evidence has as yet been produced to support the anecdote. In their book, Ashcroft and Oakeshott comment that \"Perhaps it is a case of mistaken identity. Yet it is an elaborate story for an otherwise credible figure to invent.\" Speaking to \"Channel 4 News\" in September 2015, Oakeshott said: \"We couldn’t get to the bottom of that source’s allegations ... So we merely reported the account that the source gave us … We don’t say whether we believe it to be true\". Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in October 2015, Oakeshott said that the source of the allegation \"could have been slightly deranged\" and said that \"there is no need for burden of proof on a colourful anecdote where we’re quite upfront about our own reservations about whether to take it seriously\".\n\nThe anecdote first came to public attention when extracts from the book were published in the \"Daily Mail\" on 20 September 2015, prior to its publication.\n\nLord Ashcroft had long been a supporter of the British Conservative Party and was its biggest donor, having donated around £10 million, before dropping his support for the party in 2013 due to conflicts with David Cameron, especially his refusal to give Ashcroft a senior role in government despite his donations. Some commentators have interpreted the pig story and other anecdotes in the book as Ashcroft's revenge and reignition of the feud.\n\nAfter being asked about the anecdote, Downing Street said that it would not \"dignify\" the claim with a response. \"The Independent\" reported that Cameron had told friends the claim was \"utter nonsense\". Cameron did not post a tweet on his Twitter account until 23 September, whereupon he received a barrage of pig-sex-related replies.\n\nCameron joked about the situation during a talk in Oxford later that week, stating \"I've had an interesting week. It's a week in which thousands of trees have died in vain, sales of Supertramp albums have gone through the roof and one man's reputation lies in ruins. I don't think Michael Ashcroft will ever recover.\" Six days after the story broke, Cameron responded to a question about the issue saying: \"Everyone can see why the book was written and everyone can see straight through it. As for the specific issue raised, a very specific denial was made a week ago and I've nothing to add to that.\" At the time of the statement, Downing Street had made no on-the-record denial of the anecdote. Cameron also stated that he was deferring taking action at the present time to sue Ashcroft over the allegations because he was \"too busy running the country\".\n\nWith the specific detail that the source of the story was a contemporary of Cameron's at Oxford, speculation mounted about which of the limited number of candidates could be the source of the story. Conservative Party vice-chairman and former MP Mark Field was initially suspected within his own party as having been the source of the anecdote due to having briefed the co-author Isabel Oakeshott. Government sources accused Field of fabricating the anecdote as a part of a leadership plot, an allegation he furiously denied. Other MPs would go on to deny being the source including Boris Johnson and Ed Vaizey as Downing Street announced the launch of an investigation into the identity of the MP in question.\n\nValentine Guinness, one of the founders of the Piers Gaveston Society, was quoted by journalist Toby Young as saying that although David Cameron \"may well have attended one of their parties\", as far as he knew Cameron \"was never a member of the Piers Gaveston Society\", so would not have taken part in such an initiation ceremony. Guinness called the story \"purely malicious gossip\". Young and Cameron attended Oxford together.\n\nOn 21 September 2015, James Kirkup in \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote, \"Toby Young, a Telegraph writer, [...] has investigated Mr Cameron’s university antics and found no evidence of the pig incident. 'I think it’s a figment of someone’s imagination,' he says.\"\n\nWithin minutes of the \"Daily Mail\" posting an article about the anecdote, #piggate, #snoutrage and #hameron became trending topics on Twitter. The \"Piggate\" name was quickly accepted by the media reporting on it (scandals are often given a name suffixed with \"-gate\"). This example of social media distraction was so great that there were concerns from some employers about the impact on workplace productivity.\n\nAfter the anecdote appeared, social media users quickly made connections to \"The National Anthem\", an episode of \"Black Mirror\" wherein a fictional Prime Minister has sex with a pig under duress. Series creator Charlie Brooker, who wrote the episode, quickly denied any prior knowledge of the allegations, calling the situation \"a complete coincidence, albeit a quite bizarre one.\"\n\nSuzanne Moore in \"The Guardian\" compared the incident to the story related by Hunter S. Thompson on Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign tactics early in his political career. Johnson supposedly planned to spread a fabricated story that his opponent had a penchant for \"carnal knowledge of his own barnyard sows\". Although the story was unbelievable, Johnson's purpose, according to Thompson, was to force his opponent to discuss it even in a refutation: \"But let's make the sonofabitch \"deny\" it.\"\n\nJournalist Solomon Hughes has argued that Ashcroft \"has an 18th century attitude towards buying a place in government\" and says that Ashcroft thought that his donations to the Conservative Party would provide him with a \"shortcut\" to a ministerial position. He says that when Cameron \"didn't let Ashcroft buy a place in government\" Ashcroft filled his book with \"barely political smears\". Hughes argues that this means the book \"tells us something about our political world, but not much about David Cameron\".\n\nClaims were made that the story was deliberately avoided by some media sources. The initial decision not to report on the anecdote by the BBC and some other broadcasters was criticised by the assistant editor of \"The Independent\", Ian Burrell, who described its choice to \"dodge\" the story of the day as \"unacceptable\". The BBC covered the story from 21 September.\n\nThe publication of the anecdote elicited responses from other politicians as well as media such as a clip by Cassetteboy parodying Will Smith's song \"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\" and an animated enactment from Next Media Animation. HBO's satirical news program, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\", also covered the published anecdote, saying 'bizarre is a kind way of describing it'.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the media's handling of the accusations, telling ITV News: \"The media treatment of any politician [over] unsubstantiated allegations, be it David Cameron, me or anyone else is wrong, too much of our media is obsessed with personality politics.\"\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage referred to the matter in the context of the upcoming British European Union referendum. After noting that there was the \"In\" campaign and the \"Out\" camp, he reflected: \"And then we've got the Prime Minister. Or should I call him, in this context, piggy in the middle\". Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP also made reference to the incident, accusing Cameron of being \"pig-headed\" with regards to the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.\n\nOn 4 October 2015, a protest rally outside the Conservative Party conference in Manchester city centre was attended by a reported 60,000 people. A number of demonstrators carried signs or wore costume items referring to the anecdote. At one of the country's biggest Bonfire night celebrations in Lewes, a large effigy of Cameron with a pig's head was processed through the town and then burnt.\n\nIn November 2015, solicitor Myles Jackman said that performing a sexual act with a dead animal would not be illegal under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. He noted that possessing a photograph of such an act would be illegal under the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 if it was produced for pornographic purposes, but not if the purpose was \"satire, political commentary or simple grossness\".\n\n"}

King High School, where she learned Arabic and played on the soccer and tennis teams.\n\nWinner served in the United States Air Force from 2010 to 2016, achieving the rank of senior airman (an E-4 paygrade) with the 94th Intelligence Squadron. After two years of language and intelligence training, she was posted to Fort Meade, Maryland. She worked as a cryptologic linguist, being fluent in the Persian language and in Dari, the Persian dialect spoken in Afghanistan, as well as in Pashto. Assigned to the drone program, she listened in on intercepted foreign chatter to provide U.S. forces with intelligence. Winner was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal for \"aiding in 650 enemy captures, 600 enemies killed in action and identifying 900 high[-]value targets.\"\n\nA month after being honorably discharged from the Air Force in November 2016, Winner moved to Augusta, Georgia, where she taught at CrossFit and at a yoga studio. Still possessing a top-secret security clearance, Winner was then hired by Pluribus International Corporation, a small firm that provides services under contract to the National Security Agency. On February 13, 2017, Pluribus assigned her to work at Fort Gordon, a U.S. Army post near Augusta, where she had once been stationed while in the Air Force. Assigned to translate documents relating to Iran's aerospace program from Persian, Winner was employed by Pluribus at the time of her arrest for unauthorized disclosure of classified documents.\n\nOn February 11, 2017, just two days before she began employment as an NSA contractor, she wrote on her Twitter account that \"the most dangerous entry to this country was the orange fascist we let into the White House\". She described President Donald Trump as \"a soulless ginger orangutan\" on her Facebook page. Prior to the 2016 presidential election, she posted: \"On a positive note, this Tuesday when we become the United States of the Russian Federation, Olympic lifting will be the national sport.\"\n\nFederal agents found her diary during a search of her home, in which she allegedly expressed support for Taliban leaders and Osama bin Laden. The U.S. magistrate judge who presided over Winner's bail hearing said: \"She seems to have a fascination with the Middle East and Islamic terrorism,\" and quoted her writing: \"It's a Christlike vision to have a fundamentalist Islamic state.\" However, one of the prosecutors at her bail hearing said: \"The government is not in any way suggesting the defendant has become a jihadist or that she is a Taliban sympathizer.\"\n\nWinner was arrested on June 3, 2017. The U.S. Department of Justice announced her arrest on June 5, shortly after \"The Intercept\" published an article describing Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election by hacking a U.S. voting software supplier and sending spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before the November 8 election. \"The Intercept\" story was based on a top-secret May 5, 2017, National Security Agency (NSA) document leaked to them anonymously.\n\n\"The Intercept\" had contacted the NSA on May 30 and sent copies of the documents in order to confirm their veracity. The NSA notified the FBI of the situation on June 1. According to media coverage published in VICE, an official report from the FBI noted the documents \"appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space.\" Next, the NSA did an internal audit, confirming that Winner was one of six workers who had accessed the particular documents on its classified system, but only Winner's computer had been in contact with \"The Intercept\" using a personal email account. On June 3, the FBI obtained a warrant to search Winner's electronic devices, and she was arrested. Both journalists and security experts have suggested that \"The Intercept\" handling of the reporting, which included publishing the documents unredacted and including the printer tracking dots, was used to identify Winner as the leaker.\n\nIn an 'Affidavit in Support of Application for Arrest Warrant' dated July 5, 2017, FBI Special Agent Justin C. Garrick stated: \n\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, called on the public to support Winner, offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for \"The Intercept\" who had allegedly helped the U.S. government identify Winner as the leaker. Assange wrote on Twitter that \"Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\"\n\nWinner was charged with \"removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.\" On June 8, 2017, she pleaded not guilty to a charge of \"willful retention and transmission of national defense information\", and was denied bail. Prosecutors alleged she may have been involved in other leaks of classified information, and might try to flee the country if released. The U.S. Justice Department lawyers also argued that her defense team should not be allowed to discuss any classified information, even if it was in news reports published by the media.\n\nOn August 29, 2017, Winner's attorneys filed a motion in U.S. District Court to suppress her statements to law enforcement, arguing that Winner was not read her \"Miranda\" rights before being interrogated by the FBI on June 3. On October 5, 2017, Judge Brian Epps denied a second request from her defense attorneys that bail be set. In December 2017, \"The Intercept\" reported that Winner's defense team is allowed to discuss the case with her, including its classified aspects, in a \"sensitive compartmented information facility\".\n\nOn January 31, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a lower court order blocking Winner from posting bond, determining that no combination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence at trial, thus ensuring that she remains in jail until her trial, which was scheduled to begin on October 15, 2018.\n\nA \"Stand with Reality\" campaign was formed by representatives from Courage to Resist, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Freedom of the Press Foundation with the goal of \"raising public awareness\" to ensure that Reality Winner receives a fair trial. Billie Winner-Davis, mother of Reality Winner, called on members of the public to join this campaign.\n\nOn June 21, 2018, Winner asked the court to allow her to change her plea to guilty and on June 26 she pleaded guilty to one count of felony transmission of national defense information. Winner's plea agreement with prosecutors called for her to serve five years and three months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.\n\nOn August 23, 2018, at a federal court in Georgia, Winner was sentenced to the agreed-upon five years and three months in prison for violating the Espionage Act. Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media. \"The New York Times\" reported, \"Under the plea agreement, Ms. Winner will be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons' medical center in Carswell, Tex., where she can receive treatment for bulimia and be relatively close to her family.\" As of August 31, she remained at the Lincoln County Jail, where she has been incarcerated for more than a year, awaiting transfer.\n\nOn August 24, President Trump tweeted: \"Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over 'classified' information. Gee, this is 'small potatoes' compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff, Double Standard.\" Winner expressed appreciation for his support, saying, \"I can't thank him enough.\" On August 31, Winner said she will ask Trump for clemency as a result of his tweet, and that her legal team was already working on her pardon application.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "325726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=325726", "title": "Social network analysis", "text": "Social network analysis\n\nSocial network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of \"nodes\" (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the \"ties\", \"edges\", or \"links\" (relationships or interactions) that connect them. Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, memes spread, information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. These networks are often visualized through \"sociograms\" in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines.\n\nSocial network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology. It has also gained a significant following in anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies, economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, political science, social psychology, development studies, sociolinguistics, and computer science and is now commonly available as a consumer tool (see the list of SNA software).\n\nSocial network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg Simmel and Émile Durkheim, who wrote about the importance of studying patterns of relationships that connect social actors. Social scientists have used the concept of \"social networks\" since early in the 20th century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. In the 1930s Jacob Moreno and Helen Jennings introduced basic analytical methods. In 1954, John Arundel Barnes started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Scholars such as Ronald Burt, Kathleen Carley, Mark Granovetter, David Krackhardt, Edward Laumann, Anatol Rapoport, Barry Wellman, Douglas R. White, and Harrison White expanded the use of systematic social network analysis. Even in the study of literature, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo, Wouter De Nooy, and Burgert Senekal. Indeed, social network analysis has found applications in various academic disciplines, as well as practical applications such as countering money laundering and terrorism.\n\nHomophily: The extent to which actors form ties with similar versus dissimilar others. Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values or any other salient characteristic. Homophily is also referred to as assortativity.\n\nMultiplexity: The number of content-forms contained in a tie. For example, two people who are friends and also work together would have a multiplexity of 2. Multiplexity has been associated with relationship strength.\n\nMutuality/Reciprocity: The extent to which two actors reciprocate each other's friendship or other interaction.\n\nNetwork Closure: A measure of the completeness of relational triads. An individual's assumption of network closure (i.e. that their friends are also friends) is called transitivity. Transitivity is an outcome of the individual or situational trait of Need for Cognitive Closure.\n\nPropinquity: The tendency for actors to have more ties with geographically close others.\n\nBridge: An individual whose weak ties fill a structural hole, providing the only link between two individuals or clusters. It also includes the shortest route when a longer one is unfeasible due to a high risk of message distortion or delivery failure.\n\nCentrality: Centrality refers to a group of metrics that aim to quantify the \"importance\" or \"influence\" (in a variety of senses) of a particular node (or group) within a network. Examples of common methods of measuring \"centrality\" include betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, alpha centrality, and degree centrality.\n\nDensity: The proportion of direct ties in a network relative to the total number possible.\n\nDistance: The minimum number of ties required to connect two particular actors, as popularized by Stanley Milgram's small world experiment and the idea of 'six degrees of separation'.\n\nStructural holes: The absence of ties between two parts of a network. Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an entrepreneur a competitive advantage. This concept was developed by sociologist Ronald Burt, and is sometimes referred to as an alternate conception of social capital.\n\nTie Strength: Defined by the linear combination of time, emotional intensity, intimacy and reciprocity (i.e. mutuality). Strong ties are associated with homophily, propinquity and transitivity, while weak ties are associated with bridges.\n\nGroups are identified as 'cliques' if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, 'social circles' if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as structurally cohesive blocks if precision is wanted.\n\nClustering coefficient: A measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater 'cliquishness'.\n\nCohesion: The degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by cohesive bonds. Structural cohesion refers to the minimum number of members who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group.\n\nVisual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis. Numerous methods of visualization for data produced by social network analysis have been presented. Many of the analytic software have modules for network visualization. Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes. Visual representations of networks may be a powerful method for conveying complex information, but care should be taken in interpreting node and graph properties from visual displays alone, as they may misrepresent structural properties better captured through quantitative analyses.\n\nSigned graphs can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating) and a negative edge between two nodes denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of \"balanced\" and \"unbalanced\" cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a cycle where the product of all the signs are positive. According to balance theory, balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balanced and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of signed social network graphs can be predicted.\n\nEspecially when using social network analysis as a tool for facilitating change, different approaches of participatory network mapping have proven useful. Here participants / interviewers provide network data by actually mapping out the network (with pen and paper or digitally) during the data collection session. An example of a pen-and-paper network mapping approach, which also includes the collection of some actor attributes (perceived influence and goals of actors) is the * Net-map toolbox. One benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to collect qualitative data and ask clarifying questions while the network data is collected.\n\nSocial networking potential (SNP) is a numeric coefficient, derived through algorithms to represent both the size of an individual's social network and their ability to influence that network. A close synonym is the Alpha User, a person with a high SNP.\n\nSNP coefficients have two primary functions:\n\nBy calculating the SNP of respondents and by targeting High SNP respondents, the strength and relevance of quantitative marketing research used to drive viral marketing strategies is enhanced.\n\nVariables used to calculate an individual's SNP include but are not limited to: participation in Social Networking activities, group memberships, leadership roles, recognition, publication/editing/contributing to non-electronic media, publication/editing/contributing to electronic media (websites, blogs), and frequency of past distribution of information within their network. The acronym \"SNP\" and some of the first algorithms developed to quantify an individual's social networking potential were described in the white paper \"Advertising Research is Changing\" (Gerstley, 2003) See Viral Marketing.\n\nThe first book to discuss the commercial use of Alpha Users among mobile telecoms audiences was 3G Marketing by Ahonen, Kasper and Melkko in 2004. The first book to discuss Alpha Users more generally in the context of social marketing intelligence was Communities Dominate Brands by Ahonen & Moore in 2005. In 2012, Nicola Greco (UCL) presents at TEDx the Social Networking Potential as a parallelism to the potential energy that users generate and companies should use, stating that \"SNP is the new asset that every company should aim to have\".\n\nSocial network analysis is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines. Some common network analysis applications include data aggregation and mining, network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, social sharing and filtering, recommender systems development, and link prediction and entity resolution. In the private sector, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, information system development analysis, marketing, and business intelligence needs (see social media analytics). Some public sector uses include development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and media use, and community-based problem solving.\n\nSocial network analysis is also used in intelligence, counter-intelligence and law enforcement activities. This technique allows the analysts to map a clandestine or covert organization such as a espionage ring, an organized crime family or a street gang. The National Security Agency (NSA) uses its clandestine mass electronic surveillance programs to generate the data needed to perform this type of analysis on terrorist cells and other networks deemed relevant to national security. The NSA looks up to three nodes deep during this network analysis. After the initial mapping of the social network is complete, analysis is performed to determine the structure of the network and determine, for example, the leaders within the network. This allows military or law enforcement assets to launch capture-or-kill decapitation attacks on the high-value targets in leadership positions to disrupt the functioning of the network.\nThe NSA has been performing social network analysis on call detail records (CDRs), also known as metadata, since shortly after the September 11 attacks.\n\nLarge textual corpora can be turned into networks and then analysed with the method of social network analysis. In these networks, the nodes are Social Actors, and the links are Actions. The extraction of these networks can be automated, by using parsers. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.\nSocial network analysis has also been applied to understanding online behavior by individuals, organizations, and between websites. Hyperlink analysis can be used to analyze the connections between websites or webpages to examine how information flows as individuals navigate the web. The connections between organizations has been analyzed via hyperlink analysis to examine which organizations within an issue community.\n\nSocial network analysis has been applied to social media as a tool to understand behavior between individuals or organizations through their linkages on social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook.\n\nOne of the most current methods of the application of SNA is to the study of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). When applied to CSCL, SNA is used to help understand how learners collaborate in terms of amount, frequency, and length, as well as the quality, topic, and strategies of communication. Additionally, SNA can focus on specific aspects of the network connection, or the entire network as a whole. It uses graphical representations, written representations, and data representations to help examine the connections within a CSCL network. When applying SNA to a CSCL environment the interactions of the participants are treated as a social network. The focus of the analysis is on the \"connections\" made among the participants – how they interact and communicate – as opposed to how each participant behaved on his or her own.\n\nThere are several key terms associated with social network analysis research in computer-supported collaborative learning such as: density, centrality, indegree, outdegree, and sociogram.\n\n\nIn-degree and out-degree variables are related to centrality.\n\n\nResearchers employ social network analysis in the study of computer-supported collaborative learning in part due to the unique capabilities it offers. This particular method allows the study of interaction patterns within a networked learning community and can help illustrate the extent of the participants' interactions with the other members of the group. The graphics created using SNA tools provide visualizations of the connections among participants and the strategies used to communicate within the group. Some authors also suggest that SNA provides a method of easily analyzing changes in participatory patterns of members over time.\n\nA number of research studies have applied SNA to CSCL across a variety of contexts. The findings include the correlation between a network's density and the teacher's presence, a greater regard for the recommendations of \"central\" participants, infrequency of cross-gender interaction in a network, and the relatively small role played by an instructor in an asynchronous learning network.\n\nAlthough many studies have demonstrated the value of social network analysis within the computer-supported collaborative learning field, researchers have suggested that SNA by itself is not enough for achieving a full understanding of CSCL. The complexity of the interaction processes and the myriad sources of data make it difficult for SNA to provide an in-depth analysis of CSCL. Researchers indicate that SNA needs to be complemented with other methods of analysis to form a more accurate picture of collaborative learning experiences.\n\nA number of research studies have combined other types of analysis with SNA in the study of CSCL. This can be referred to as a multi-method approach or data triangulation, which will lead to an increase of evaluation reliability in CSCL studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

UbD is an example of backward design, the practice of looking at the outcomes in order to design curriculum units, performance assessments, and classroom instruction. UbD focuses on teaching to achieve understanding. It is advocated by Jay McTighe and Grant Wiggins in their \"Understanding by Design\" (1998), published by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Understanding by Design and UbD are registered trademarks of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD).\n\nUnderstanding by Design relies on what Wiggins and McTighe call \"backward design\" (also known as \"backwards planning\"). Teachers, according to UbD proponents, traditionally start curriculum planning with activities and textbooks instead of identifying classroom learning goals and planning towards that goal. In backward design, the teacher starts with classroom outcomes and then plans the curriculum, choosing activities and materials that help determine student ability and foster student learning.\n\nThe backward design approach has three stages. Stage 1 is identification of desired results for students. This may use content standards, common core or state standards. Stage 1 defines \"Students will understand that...\" and lists essential questions that will guide the learner to understanding. Stage 2 is assessing learning strategies. Stage 3 is listing the learning activities that will lead students to your desired results.\n\nIn their article on science education, Smith and Siegel argue \"that education aims at the imparting of knowledge: students are educated in part so that they may come to know things\". While a student can know a lot about a particular subject, teachers globally are beginning to push their students to go beyond simple recall. This is where understanding plays an important role. The goal of Teaching for Understanding is to give students the tools to take what they know, and what they will eventually know, and make a mindful connection between the ideas. In a world that is filled with data, teachers are only able to help students learn a small number of ideas and facts. As such, it is important that we give students the tools needed to decipher and understand the ideas. This transferability of skills is at the heart of McTighe and Wiggins' technique. If a student is able to transfer the skills they learn in the classroom to unfamiliar situations, whether academic or non-academic, they are said to truly understand.\n\nTeaching for Understanding had been used as a framework for developing literacy education for TESOL students, see Pearson and Pellerine (2010) \n\n\n"}

{"id": "18465292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18465292", "title": "White Stag Leadership Development Program", "text": "White Stag Leadership Development Program\n\nThe White Stag Leadership Development Program, founded in 1958, is a summer camp for youth 11-18 led by two California-based non-profits that sponsor leadership development activities. The teen youth staff of the two programs develop and produce several week-long leadership summer camps every year for several hundred youth from Central and Northern California and a few youth from other states and countries. The outdoors program is based on hands-on learning methods to develop competencies.\n\nThe program was founded on the Monterey Peninsula, California, in 1958 by Dr. Béla H. Bánáthy, a Hungarian immigrant who taught at the language school. In the 21st century, there are two programs in California: one in Concord, sponsored by the White Stag Association, and one in Monterey, sponsored by the White Stag Leadership Development Academy. Bánáthy drew from his youth experience at the 1933 World Jamboree in Gödöllő, Hungary; he named the program after the mythological white stag used as an emblem at the jamboree. Years later, in June 1951 Bánáthy met two other Hungarians teaching at the Army Language School. They had all escaped Hungary before Soviet occupation, Joe Szentkiralyi and Paul Sujan, who had also attended the 1933 World Jamboree. They were initially assisted by a local American Scouter, Fran Peterson.\n\nAs Monterey Bay Area Council Training Chairman, Bánáthy developed a program to train Scouts in leadership skills. He collaborated with research psychologist Paul Hood, who was leader of Task NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer), a U.S. Army project that assessed the essential leadership skills of non-commissioned leaders. As part of his Master's thesis, Bánáthy identified eleven specific leadership competencies that he taught in the program's summer camp. The efforts of the four men, assisted by Maury Tripp, rapidly gained the attention of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. They conducted extensive research that validated Bánáthy's leadership model and developed its own version for nationwide use. They introduced the leadership competencies during the 1970s into both the adult Wood Badge program and youth-focused National Youth Leadership Training. These two programs had originally focused primarily on teaching Scoutcraft skills and the Patrol Method. The change to teaching leadership was a marked cultural shift for how both adults and youth were trained in the skills of Scouting.\n\nBánáthy and two of his co-founders have claimed their joint experiences at the Fourth World Scout Jamboree (1933) in Gödöllő, Hungary, were highly influential in their lives. They drew from this in developing the White Stag program. \n\nAt the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14-year-old Scout named Bela Bánáthy was kneeling by his campfire when three uniformed men rode up on horseback: Count Paul Teleki, the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Royal Hungarian Army; and Baden-Powell, the British hero of the Boer War and Chief Scout of the World. The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on a job well done and rode on. Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer War hero Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided he would become a military officer instead of a minister.\n\nBánáthy briefly met fellow scout Joseph Szentkiralyi. Hungarian Sea Scouter Paul Ferenc Sujan's camp was visited by Baden-Powell, who asked to taste some of his soup. American Maury Tripp attended the Jamboree from Saratoga, California. These four Scouts would later play instrumental roles in forming the White Stag program on the Monterey Peninsula. At the conclusion of the Jamboree, Baden-Powell gave a farewell speech in which he challenged the Scouts present to pursue the ideals represented by the White Stag.\n\nThis challenge and the myth of the White Stag inspired Bánáthy. During World War II, he was a junior officer in the Royal Hungarian Army. After being seriously wounded during combat in Russia, through the connections he made at the World Jamboree, he was invited by General Farkas to join the faculty of the Hungarian Royal Academy. While there he served on the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association and became the voluntary national director for youth leadership development. Barely escaping Soviet capture (and likely execution) at the end of World War II, Bánáthy reached the United States in June 1951. He had been hired to teach at the Army Language School at Monterey, California. There he became reacquainted with Joe Szentkiralyi, whom he had met at the Fourth World Jamboree.\n\nJoseph Szentkiralyi had also barely survived World War II. He and his family had previously lived in the United States in 1939, where Szentkiralyi worked in New York City. At the start of World War II, they were deported as enemy aliens to Hungary. Because he spoke English, Szentkiralyi was assigned to watch over the crew members of the first American B-17 bomber to crash land in Hungary. When the crew told him sensitive information, he was ordered to reveal the information to his superiors. Citing the Geneva Convention, he refused. The authorities prepared to court-martial him, and Szentkiralyi fled. During a time of frequent Allied aerial bombing raids, he hid in the upper floors of apartment buildings. During one bombing raid a bomb crashed through and landed on the floor above him, but it did not explode. Szentkiralyi and his family later narrowly survived the Siege of Budapest.\n\nAfter the war ended, Szentkiralyi as a translator for the American Embassy in Budapest. However, this put him in a vulnerable position as the Communists hardened their grip on power. Because he had lived in the United States and spoke English, he knew he would fall under suspicion. People he knew began to disappear, including a friend who worked at the U.S. Embassy. Within a few days he found a note on his desk that read, \"You are next.\" With American assistance, he immediately fled Hungary for Switzerland. He and his family returned to New York City for a few months, and Szentkiralyi applied for a position as a Hungarian instructor at the Army Language School. The Army hired him in the summer of 1948 and he founded theHungarian Department.\n\nStarting in 1951, four men who had been Scouts at the 1933 World Jamboree encountered each other at Monterey. Joseph Szentkiralyi (who later Anglicized his name as St. Clair) hired Bánáthy. In 1956, Hungarian Paul Ferenc Sujan joined them at the School. In Monterey, they joined the Boy Scout movement, meeting F. Maurice Tripp.\n\nWhen serving in the Hungarian Army, Bánáthy became interested in leadership development in boys and youth. In Monterey, he became Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council. He gained support for his concept of a leadership camp for boys from the Council Executive and Executive Board.\n\nBánáthy informally recruited one patrol of boys, including his own sons, and took them to summer camp in 1957 to test his idea. John Chiorini, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout, was working on the waterfront. \"Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft. He said he was trying out some new ideas with this patrol,\" Chiorini reported \"Béla listened intently as I presented and then he came up after and gave me some tips on teaching. He was a mentor to me from that point on.\"\n\nDuring the summer of 1958, Bánáthy recruited two patrols of boys to take part. Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning there was not much discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, \"White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were.\" Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.\n\nDrawing from the 1933 World Jamboree, Bánáthy based the program symbol and its spirit on the white stag from Hungarian mythology. On June 8, 1959, the adults adopted this. \"Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received,\" Bánáthy said.\n\nDuring August 1959, the first full-scale program was put on. Bánáthy served as Scoutmaster, Fran Petersen was Assistant Scoutmaster, along with eight other adult staff and 13 youth staff. The training troop consisted of 39 trainees from 24 troops. In the first two years of the program, emphasis was placed on training patrol leaders. \n\nDuring the same year, Bánáthy studied leadership. He learned that the U.S. Army's Human Resources Research Organization (HumRRO) at the Presidio of Monterey was conducting research into the leadership characteristics of non-commissioned officers. Bánáthy contacted research psychologist Paul Hood, Task Leader of Task NCO (Non-commissioned Officer), and began a fruitful collaboration. A HumRRO publication titled, \"A Guide for the Infantry Squad Leader – What the Beginning Squad Leader Should Know About Human Relations\" defined a core set of leadership competencies. Bánáthy found Hood's research useful, identifying characteristics of leadership. With Hood's active encouragement, he decided to emphasize development of those skills in the White Stag program. \n\nIn 1960, the adult staff announced that they would expand the program to offer an additional phase of leadership development for boys 14 – 17 years old, to train \"junior trainers and impart leadership skills.\" This phase was christened \"Troop Leadership Development\".\n\n With the interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, the program was continually tested and improved. Two men with connections on the National Council, Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council's Engineering Service) and F. Maurice Tripp (a research scientist and member of the National Boy Scout Training Committee), brought the White Stag program to the National Council's attention. In 1962, Tripp formed and chaired an advisory board of educators, psychologists, management specialists, and members of the Scout professional staff.\n\nDuring 1962 – 63, Bánáthy focused his research, using it as the basis of his Master's Thesis at San Jose State University. The Monterey Bay Area Council published Bánáthy's abbreviated version entitled \"A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting.\" Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on \"Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys\". In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.\n\nAt the end of the August 1964 summer camp, Bánáthy and Peterson announced that White Stag would begin in 1965 to offer a third phase of leadership development for boys age 11 – 13, called \"Patrol Member Development.\" This enabled all boys 11 – 17 years old to learn leadership skills appropriate to their maturity. If they stayed with scouting, they had the chance to advance in other phases of development.\n\nIn 1969, the World Organization of the Scout Movement published Bánáthy's paper titled \"Leadership Development: World Scouting Reference Paper No. 1\". Describing the results of BSA's research and testing of the leadership program, it was presented at the World Scoutings Conference in Helsinki. Bánáthy was appointed to the Interamerican Scout Committee and guided their national training teams at three Interamerican 'Train the Trainer' events in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela.\n\nIn January 1967, John Larson began work with Bánáthy and Bob Perin to write a new Wood Badge staff guide focusing on leadership. Ken Wells and Perin had participated in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. Despite their long experience with Wood Badge, they saw the benefit of adding leadership skills development to its requirements. William \"Green Bar\" Hillcourt, Scoutmaster of the first U.S. Wood Badge course in 1948, felt very strongly that the traditional teaching of Scoutcraft skills should be retained. Hillcourt had recently formally retired, but his opinion held considerable weight. Chief Scout Joseph Brunton approved the changes.\n\nLater that year, the National BSA began to evaluate the revised Wood Badge program using leadership competencies . On June 17, 1967, the first experimental Wood Badge course was offered at Philmont. One month later, the Circle Ten Council in Dallas presented its first new Wood Badge course. In September 1967, six councils were approved to pilot-test the new Wood Badge program in 1968: Monterey Bay Area Council, Piedmont Council, Middle Tennessee, Del-Mar-Va, and Hiawatha (formerly Onondago) and Circle Ten Council.\nAmong these was an experimental Wood Badge course in Monterey in 1968. Bánáthy was Course Director, Joe St. Clair served as Scoutmaster, and Fran Petersen was senior patrol leader. John Larson, National Director of Education, was also present. All attendees were asked to bring their entire troop to a single week of summer camp, allowing the Wood Badge staff to use the summer camp as an application for Wood Badge.\n\nPilot-testing and experimentation continued for three more years. An experimental junior leader training program was begun in 1969. It was later known as Troop Leader Development; the final \"Troop Leadership Development Staff Guide\", written by John W. Larson, credited White Stag with its origins.\n\nThrough the early 1970s, the White Stag program presented the Monterey Bay Area Council's official junior leader training program; this was revived from 1994 to 2004. In 1975, Bill Roberts, the Phase III Director, invited the first Explorer girls age 14 – 18 to take part in the program and adult women to serve on adult staff. This was the first co-educational leadership development program in the BSA. The next year White Stag invited girls age 11 – 13 to participate as well. The program was evaluated in 1978 by a staff member from the Western Region of the BSA. He wrote:\n\nAt the same time, the Monterey Bay Area Council decided to replace the White Stag program with the Troop Leader Development program. The adult volunteer leaders of White Stag, informally known as the White Stag Steering Committee, incorporated in 1982 as the non-profit foundation White Stag Association; it continued to sponsor the program. \n\nFor two years, the Association rented Skylark Ranch Resident Camp in the Santa Cruz Mountains from the Girl Scouts of Santa Clara County. Over the next few years, the Association moved the summer program to San Mateo County Council's Camp Cutter in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and later, at different times, to Marin Council's Camp Marin-Sierra and Yosemite Council's Camp Mensinger in the California Sierra Nevada. They began to attract most youth attendees from the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2014, the Association secured use of Camp Robert L. Cole in the Tahoe National Forest near Cisco Grove, California.\n\n\nWhen the Monterey Bay Area Council's Junior Leader Training Chairman offered in 1994 to run the Council's junior leader training program using the White Stag methods, the Council Executive agreed. White Stag adult alumni of the now San Francisco Bay Area-based program who lived in the Monterey Peninsula area recruited a youth staff who planned and presented the White Stag program at Camp Pico Blanco in 1994. This Monterey-based program continued to present the council's junior leader training program until 2005. That year a new Council Executive decided to adopt the current BSA National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) program. \n\nThe adult leadership of the Monterey White Stag group incorporated in 2005 as the non-profit charity White Stag Leadership Development Academy, Inc. to support the program. Until 2015, they based the summer camp program at camps Cutter and Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Camp Tamarancho in Marin County, and a custom-built camp in Arroyo Seco on private land. In August 2015, the Academy purchased for $462,000, in Carmel Valley and renamed the site, formerly a gun club, \"Piney Creek Camp.\"\n\n\nDuring 2004, some leaders of the White Stag Academy organized a comparable program for the Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast. The program teaches the eleven leadership skills used by White Stag. It was held at Cutter Scout Reservation for two years and is currently held at Boulder Creek Scout Reservation in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Girl Scouts assumed leadership of the program after 2006 and renamed it Camp Artemis, after the Greek goddess who protects young girls, animals, and the natural environment. The Youth Staff are referred to as members of ALTA (Artemis Leadership Training Adventure). They have continued to run Camp Artemis as a resident camp for girls 11 – 17 each summer.\n\n\nBoth the organization in Central California and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. The program will observe its 60th anniversary in 2018. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015, including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored by the White Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.\n\nIn his master's thesis, Bánáthy established his reasoning for focusing on developing leadership skills in youth rather than adults. He wrote that adults in leadership development experiences often have \"deeply and rigidly established patterns which are difficult to change.\" He felt leadership development needs to start early in life, when an opportunity exists to give individuals long-term exposure to leadership behavior. Bánáthy formulated the White Stag program to address the needs of youth from 11 to 17 years of age. He did this when defining leadership as a learnable skill was still in its infancy.\n\nA number of researchers have identified needs of youth for specific kinds of formative experiences. In one study, Ferber, Pittman, and Marshall described five developmental priorities for youth. These were \"learning\" (developing positive basic and applied academic attitudes, skills, and behaviors), \"thriving\" (developing physically healthy attitudes, skills, and behaviors), \"connecting\" (developing positive social attitudes, skills, and behaviors), \"working\" (developing positive vocational attitudes, skills, and behaviors), and \"leading\" (developing positive civic attitudes, skills, and behaviors).\n\nEducators report that successful programs use \"positive and sustained relations with a caring adult, mentoring in life skills and opportunities to use newly learned skills.\" Other elements identified for training of youth are strong relationships with adults; training in mediation, conflict resolution, team dynamics, and project management; new roles and responsibilities based on experiences and resources that provide opportunity for growth, teamwork and peer networking; and opportunities to practice communication, negotiation, and refusal skills.\n\nThe White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods address all of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and implement the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required to live in a camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.\n\nIn his research for his master's thesis, Bánáthy identified 80 characteristics of leadership. He summarized them as 11 leadership competencies, which he proposed be taught in a systematic process, using six developmental levels tailored to the various needs of youth at different stages. The White Stag leadership competencies are organized into three groups, taught in relation to individual and group readiness.\n\nThe group writes down both general goals and very specific, measurable objectives each year that describe leadership in behavioral terms. When engaging learners in leadership development learning activities, the youth staff implement a four-phase approach called \"Manager of Learning\".\n\nThe first step requires the participant to practice the skill without preparation. The simulation is made as real and practical as possible within the limitations of the training environment. Both the participant and the instructor gain through this \"Guided Discovery\" an assessment of the learner's current knowledge, skills, attitudes relevant to the learning task.\n\nThe second step is a \"Teach/Learn\" session where the instructor begins to present information based on what the participants don't already know. This is usually prefixed with a written statement describing in behavioral terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.\n\nOnce the Teach/Learn is complete, the third step allows participants an opportunity in an \"Application\" to practice their newly acquired skills. This may or may not be an experience like the Guided Discovery.\n\nThe final step is an \"Evaluation\" discussion, during which the participants not only self-assess whether they achieved the stated learning objectives, but to give feedback to the instructor about their success in presenting the information.\n\nThe first three competencies are essential to forming the group's ability to organize itself and become ready for action.\n\n\"Getting and Giving Information\" teaches participants about different types of communication and how communication helps establish the group. They learn how to get, store, and retrieve information. Individuals practice communicating to both help get the job done and keep the group together.\n\n\"Understanding Group Needs and Characteristics\" helps individuals build group morale and unity. They learn about values, norms, needs, and characteristics.\n\n\"Knowing and Understanding Group Resources\" helps learners to use resources to improve group togetherness, to learn about different kinds of resources, and how as a leader can use the diversity of group members' skills and abilities to help the group succeed. They learn about how resources affect getting the job done and keeping the group together.\n\nThe second group of leadership competencies help the group to develop and implement a plan.\n\n\"Controlling the Group\" helps individuals to learn how their behavior affects others. Individuals learn the difference between external control of the group and personal control of their own behavior. They learn that controlling the group is something that everyone in the group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.\n\n\"Counseling\" helps individuals to define key counseling ideas, learn simple counseling methods, and identify when simple counseling is appropriate.\n\n\"Setting the Example\" helps participants identify what it means to set a good example, why setting an example is important, and describe ways a leader can set a good example.\n\n\"Planning\" provides learners a chance to learn about problem-solving and its importance to a leader. They learn problem-solving and planning methods and how planning contributes to accomplishing the task and to group success.\n\n\"Evaluation\" enables the learner to use evaluation improve group focus and get the job done. They learn to balance getting the job done and helping the group, and learn to continually assess their level of success.\n\nThe last group of leadership competencies helps individuals to grow the organization.\n\n\"Sharing Leadership\" helps participants learn that leadership is something that is shared by all group members depending on the situation and group member's abilities. They learn about what kinds of things affect the leader and the group, and what style of leadership is appropriate. They learn to select a style of leadership based on the job and the group situation.\n\n\"Representing the Group\" is a way for participants to learn about how groups communicate and how to represent one group to another. They learn how to accurately represent their group to another.\n\n\"Manager of Learning\" is a four-step technique for instructing others. Participants learn how to develop effective learning techniques. for effectively communicating information; emphasize the learner in the learning process.\n\nThe program has defined a set of values that govern how the program is implemented.\n\nOne of the most important is \"outdoor learning\". Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.\n\nIn addition, the program utilizes outdoor camping skills to provide opportunities to practice leadership skills. One of the very first challenges a leader-in-training faces is to plan how to set up of their camp and cook their meals. They learn how to analyze the task, how to plan the task and organize the group, how to use all of the groups' resources, how to implement their plan, and how to evaluate and correct.\n\nThe program teaches participants to cultivate an \"evaluation attitude\", or a predisposition to continually seek improvement. Growth as a leader is dependent on his ability to assess his current skill level and to accept the necessity for change. The leader can only attain his goals if he continuously works to analyze his movement towards achieving his goals and objectives.\n\nWhite Stag uses the \"patrol method\" to effectively include all members. Baden-Powell wrote \"[t]he Patrol System is the one essential feature in which Scout training differs from that of all other organizations, and where the System is properly applied, it is absolutely bound to bring success. It cannot help itself! The formation of the boys into Patrols or from six to eight and training them as separate units each under its own responsible leader is the key to a good Troop.\"\n\nOne of the most important values is a focus on \"hands-on learning\". The program emphasizes use of experiential learning activities in the context of outdoor education. These help participants retain what they learn about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically. For example, participant teams can be challenged to build foot bridges, complete a hike, build a Tyrolean Traverse, cook a meal, or other practical challenges.\n\nAlways seeking to engage individuals both physically and mentally, the program uses the \"hurdle method\". The hurdle method teaches individuals how to nimbly respond situation for which they have not specifically prepared themselves. The manager of learning prepared and present unexpected tasks or challenges to the leader and the group which they must organize themselves to find a solution or to complete a task. The hurdle method is closely linked to hands-on learning.\n\nThe program believes leadership can be taught using a \"direct approach\", not by osmosis or example alone. In early leadership development programs, learning about leadership was not specifically defined with qualified objectives. Learning about leadership was a by-product of other learning activities. The White Stag Method challenges these \"indirect\" methods and focuses the participant's experience using a \"direct approach.\" The White Stag program defines leadership behaviors in specific terms as eleven leadership competencies.\n\nYouth spend too much time learning what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The \"manager of learning\" value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.\n\nThe program believes that learning never stops and embraces this as the \"infinity principle\". According to Bánáthy, leadership behavior cannot be developed \"during a few weeks, not even during several months,\" but must be ongoing.\n\nIt takes months for individuals to gain proficiency in leadership skills. \"The White Stag continues to leap on—upward and forward—in a never-ending journey that leads the joyous followers to the promised land. For us who wear the badge of the White Stag, the White Stag journey symbolizes the idea of becoming the best we can.\" The program borrowed words from Baden-Powell's Jamboree farewell, \"Forward, Upward, Onward,\" to define leadership:\n\nIndividuals are taught to believe that difficult situations are opportunities for growth that must be overcome. Thus, leadership development cannot take place during a single training course. It is a continuous sequence of sequential, structured learning and experience-building opportunities. The program subscribes to the belief that when an individual embraces the infinite challenge to change, he is engaged in the never-ending process of becoming a leader. \"The infinity principle of growth in leadership is what the White Stag symbolizes in this leadership development process.\"\n\nAvoiding stereotypes and labeling based on personal dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as \"uniforms\". Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell at the conclusion of the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.\n\nBased on Béla Bánáthy's original work, the program is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and more advanced levels of instruction. Each level is tailored to the needs of youth at specific ages and maturity levels.\n\nThe youth staff develop each summer camp's program during the preceding nine months in a series of leadership development training and planning events. They are ultimately responsible for the entire leadership program's content.\n\nIn 2017, White Stag Monterey started a new exclusive program called Advanced Leadership Development. The program focuses on the real world applications of the leadership competencies in addition to delving deeper into the theory of the skills taught in the lower levels. \n\nALD is an extension of the teachings of the earlier phases. To be accepted into the program, applicants must be between the ages of 16 and 21 and have completed Troop Leadership Development, making it the only part of the White Stag program with a mandatory prerequisite. In addition, they must be interviewed by one of the ALD staff members. \n\nBecause of the small number of candidates in ALD, instead of multiple candidates being assigned a single patrol counselor or patrol leader, each individual candidate is assigned a staff member as a \"buddy\", who they work with one-on-one throughout the week. \n\nThe program has four primary aims that are closely aligned with the aims of the Boy Scouts of America with the addition of leadership development. The program focuses on \"character development\", which it defines as encouraging people to do what is right, no matter what, and to serve themselves and others. Its second aim is \"personal fitness\", and in its programs it encourages individuals to accept physical and mental challenges, to surpass their own expectations, expand their knowledge, skills and abilities, and strive for continuous personal improvement. Their third aim is \"citizenship training\", in which it helps individuals to develop a positive attitude, influence those around them, join in and shape their community. The paramount aim however is \"leadership development\", in which it inspires individuals to engage life as an ongoing adventure, to challenge themselves, and to lead others to pursue excellence.\n\nDifferentiating White Stag from any other leadership program for youth is its \"spirit and traditions\", including campfires, ceremonies, skits, yells, cheers, and emblems, all of which give it a distinctive character. These are used to communicate an ethic of always striving for self-improvement and personal achievement, and values that include characteristics of servant leadership, compassion, enthusiasm, kindness, and selflessness.\n\nThe symbolism of the White Stag is described in a story telling the White Stag legend. The legend borrows from the Fourth World Jamboree held in Hungary, which in turn was inspired by Hungarian mythology of the white stag. The White Stag Legend is used to inspire in the participants a desire for reflection, continuous self-improvement, and pursuit of higher aims and goals. Other traditions include woggles, waist ropes, staves, berets, and patrol names. The legend tells a version of a legend honoring Hunor and Magyar, who led their people in pursuit a mythical White Stag, following it over impassable trails to a new home. Through this story and other ceremonies, the program challenges individuals to continually strive \"onward and upward\" and \"overcome challenges, continuously evaluate, focus on learning, and always strive to improve\".\n\nThe White Stag program is currently offered by two related non-profit groups in Northern and Central California. In northern California, the non-profit White Stag Association sponsors three Venturing crews, a Learning for Life group, and a Boy Scout troop that plan and produce the summer camp program in Northern California, in the past at Camp John Mensinger, Camp Wolfeboro, and since 2014 at Camp Robert L. Cole.\n\nIn central California, the non-profit White Stag Leadership Development Academy sponsors a Learning for Life group, a Venturing crew, and a Boy Scout troop in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council. These youth plan and put on a program each summer in Central California. In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in Marin County in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the program at a site in the Santa Lucia Range near Arroyo Seco. Youth staff participants are registered as members of the Boy Scouts or Venturing programs in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council.\n\nBoth programs adhere to the Youth Protection Standards of the Boy Scouts of America, including background checks of all adult leaders. The Monterey-based program has drawn participants from overseas, including France, China, Martinique, and Taiwan.\n\nThe White Stag program is implemented by two 501(c)3 non-profits. The White Stag Leadership Development Academy is located on the Monterey Peninsula and the White Stag Association is located in the San Francisco East Bay. Both are financially self-supporting. The programs are administered and managed by part-time adult volunteers. All participants, including youth and adult staff, pay fees to participate. Fees for participants attending the week-long summer camp are US$275–$325 in 2012. Candidate attendees to White Stag Sierra pay up to $320, while the Association in Monterey charges $335. , adult and youth staff volunteers paid about US$400 in fees over the course of a year of staff development.\n\nSince 1960, the program has recognized one or two youth and adults each year by presenting them with a \"Silver Stag\" award. The device, a miniature solid sterling silver stag on a chain or medallion, recognizes the individual's outstanding \"contributions and qualities of leadership, spirit and service to the program.\" One youth staff member from each phase is selected as the outstanding youth staff member. Each graduating participant received a neckerchief unique to each phase that is to be worn only at White Stag functions. Participants may also be recognized with other awards that vary from year to year.\n\nIn 1967, Rex Hatch returned to the Crossroads of America Council after attending a pilot test of the JLT program at Philmont. He founded in 1972 a junior leader training program, previously known as Silver Bars, which was initially based on the White Stag program's principles. It was later modified to follow the National Youth Leadership Training Course syllabus. The Hoosier Trails Council in Bloomington, Indiana produced a \"National Youth Leadership Training\" program based on the national syllabus that was nicknamed \"White Stag NYLT\" until 2011. On the east coast, the Narragansett Council in Rhode Island nicknamed their national NYLT program as \"White Stag NYLT\" until 2011.\n\nThese programs are produced by the local councils. They present the standardized, nationally mandated National Youth Leadership Training program. The non-profit White Stag Academy in Monterey, California sponsors Venture Crew 122, which develops and produces a summer camp program independent of the Boy Scout of America's nationally mandated junior leaders training program.\n"}

Hoping it may make bright and intelligent people after I'm dead and gone.\n\nAccording to Ben Lucien Burman in \"Children of Noah: Glimpses of Unknown America\",In any rural community the mail is always a matter of importance, particularly in a region so isolated as the Cumberlands. Uncle William had decided that Pine Mountain's crying need was a post office.\"\n\nCreech's efforts to gain a local post office were a struggle because his rural area would not be allowed to have its own post office until it was deemed able to support enough postal business. To stimulate mail delivery, Creech worked with often illiterate residents to request mail-order catalogs. Following his initial efforts with a more personal campaign, Creech helped residents write letters to their sons, husbands, and boyfriends who were fighting in World War I. Although often requiring the help of literate friends, many soldiers responded with letters home.\n\nCreech's labor was successful. The United States Postal Service was impressed by the quantity of mail, and a post office was established in the area.\n"}
