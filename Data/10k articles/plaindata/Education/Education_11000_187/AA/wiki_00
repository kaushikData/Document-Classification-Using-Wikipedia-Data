{"id": "8736138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8736138", "title": "Bourse du Travail", "text": "Bourse du Travail\n\nThe Bourse du Travail (French for \"labour exchanges\"), a French form of the labour council, were working class organizations that encouraged mutual aid, education, and self-organization amongst their members in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nEarly Third Republic France was a time of dramatic social and economic change. With the tremendous growth of industrial capitalism in the last twenty years of the 19th century and the continued migration of workers to cities, the traditional system of meeting places for those seeking work was overtaxed. Skilled and unskilled trades alike had gradually developed systems to match those seeking work with employers, but the legalisation of trades unions in 1884, helped formalise these structures. Employers, too, were creating private labour placement offices.\n\nThe Republican government of Gambetta relied upon the support of working class voters, and so helped create the first Bourses du Travail under the control of newly legalised labour unions. Socialists and radicals, elected to city offices in some areas, made the funding of Bourses du Travail a priority. As the system expanded, radicals in local government extended aid. The \"loi du 14 mars 1904\" mandated that every city of over ten thousand inhabitants had to create a \"bureau de placement\", establishing job offices and undercutting employer run placement agencies. These government offices were usually placed in the local Bourses du Travail.\n\nWith government support came government regulation. While there was no legal obligation for the state or the municipality to put in place these buildings, their construction helped both the workers' movement and surveillance of its activities. Business interests and the police saw the formalisation of Bourses du Travail as a way to channel the labour movement away from revolutionary change or to keep an eye on those who promoted it.\n\nThe ideology behind the explosion in Bourses du Travail, popularized by revolutionary syndicalists like Fernand Pelloutier, intended to create in them the key organizational component of radical economic transformation. By acting as future co-ordinating bodies, facilitating communication between \"syndicates\" (unions), the Bourse du Travail would co-ordinate production and consumption in the absence of both the state and the private ownership of the means of production. These institutions were central to the notion of Revolutionary Syndicalism which dominated the Confédération Générale du Travail, France's largest labor federation in the first twenty years on the 20th century. Pelloutier and other revolutionary syndicalists argued that the Bourses—small scale, local, self made—were the guarantee that the CGT would remain both directly democratic and revolutionary. They saw labor organizations as interconnecting in three ways: a national federation uniting each specific union (traditional craft or trade unions); a national federation of \"all\" unions (in this case, the CGT); and all local workers, across union and political boundaries, united in the Bourse du travail. Supporters of the Bourse movement believed this structure last should become the most important form of workers' association.\n\nThe other major change of this period was the Republican promulgation of Laic laws, taking education out of the hands of the Catholic church, and eventually taxing and regulating Church institutions. Bourses du Travail, like civil marriage or lay funerals, filled a communal role once played by local parishes.\n\nBourses du Travail were centres of working class culture. Almost every one contained lending libraries, classrooms, meeting halls, and theatres. Family and community celebrations took place here (away from the church), as did classes and political discussions, formal meetings and light entertainment. The Bourses du Travail buildings are still often the locations of theatres and concert venues.\n\nThe idea of French labour exchanges far predates the institution. In 1790, at the height of the French Revolution, an abortive Bourse du Travail was established in Paris. The loi Le Chapelier of 1791 outlawed this and any other labour organisation, and despite the brief legalisation during the Second Republic, unions remained illegal until 1884. Adolphe Leullier presented in 1845 a similar project which he called the \"Bureau central des ouvriers\".\n\nThe idea of creating a Labour Exchange (\"Bourse du travail\") is credited to the economist Gustave de Molinari in 1845.\nIn February 1851 François Joseph Ducoux submitted a bill to the Legislative Assembly that proposed to establish a state-run Labour Exchange in Paris.\nHis project was also submitted to the Paris Municipal Commission.\nThe project was abandoned, but later revived in 1875 and 1883 and eventually came into force in 1886.\n\nIn 1875, workers petitioned the Paris municipal council to establish a Bourse du Travail, which was rejected. Labour organisations had existed underground or by other names, but their new status led to an explosion of radical activity. The French Revolutionary tradition was evolving into the economic sphere of union organising, rather than the seizure of power (exemplified by Auguste Blanqui).\n\nThe first Bourse du Travail, in Paris, was begun in 1887. A building on rue JJ Rousseau was donated by the Socialist municipal council, and a second on rue du Château d’eau was created in 1892. By this time there were 14 Bourses du Travail established around France, by 1902 83, with a further 75 created by 1914.\n\n\"See also , and Anarcho-syndicalism\"\n\nThe \"Fédération des Bourses de travail\" (Federation of Labour Exchanges) was created in 1892 at the Congress of Saint-Etienne by Fernand Pelloutier to federate each city's workers' organisations. It was first led by Bernard Resset (1892), then Rieu Cordier, then Fernand Pelloutier (1895) and from 1901 to 1918 by Georges Yvetot.\n\nThe Federation of Labour Exchanges merged in 1895 with the Fédération nationale des syndicats (National Federation of Trade-Unions), which had been created in 1886, giving rise to the Confédération générale du travail (CGT), which was dominated by a revolutionary syndicalist strategy until 1921.\n\nIt was the FBT that, as much as any organization, created the CGT. At their Nice congress in 1901 the fédération des Bourses du Travail formally proposed the creation of and fusion with the CGT which took place in 1902.\n\nMany of the leaders of the Bourse du Travail went on to lead the CGT, and the FBT was a co-equal partner with individual unions in the CGTs founding. Bourses have thus been called the \"mère des syndicat\" (the mother of unions) for their role.\n\nStructurally, individual Bourses comprised the \"building\" itself (and its social, education, and other practical resources), and the Bourse as a council of local unions. Unions paid a fee to join the bourse, though CGT affiliated unions were often exempted, and sent representatives to regular meetings of all the local unions. The administration of the bourse was by elected representatives. Contrary to Pelloutier's vision, these representatives came from a variety of ideological backgrounds which both represented the local political leanings of unions, but also the wider political left in the area. In many towns there were socialist municipal councils and mayors, either in Jules Guesde's French Workers' Party, the Jauresin possibilists of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), or independent reformers of the Briand group. This leaves aside the constellation of syndicalist focused socialists (like Jean Allemane's Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party), cooperativists, and individualist anarchist workers who sometimes played active roles in their local Bourse. In most places anarcho-syndicalism was but one small faction in both the bourses \"and\" the CGT, and so the bourses took on roles of a reformist, or Marxist, or strictly trade unionist character which presaged the CGT split.\n\nThe birth of the French Communist Party began the decline of the Bourse du Travail movement. The CGT, which had regrouped the individual organisations, was swept up in the ideological tumult of the post war years. It became, like much of the French left, dominated by the Communists ideological vision, which saw the loose federalism of Revolutionary Syndicalism as a reason for the failure of the 1918-1919 strike wave. In 1921, the CGT revised its structure, eliminating the local Bourses du Travail as constituent organisation of the Union, and replacing them with a network of \"Unions Locales\". From here on, the CGT followed a British and American model of local trade specific unions, federated into a single national structure.\n\nA split, eventually into three federations, created a French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO)-dominated CGT, the United General Confederation of Labour (Confédération générale du travail - unitaire or CGTU), where communists cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists, and the Revolutionary Trade Unionist General Confederation of Labour (Confédération générale du travail - syndicaliste révolutionnaire or CGTSR) in 1923 when the communists gained control of the CGTU. (The CGT and CGTU reunited in 1936, and remained close to the French Communist Party.) Predictably, these often bitter party divisions in the labor movement made the local and inclusive vision of the Bourses impossible.\n\nThe Bourses du Travail survived, often as a single organisation union hall, while the history of splits in the French labour movement saw the buildings pass from one hand to another, revert to municipalities, or disappear entirely.\n\nBourse du Travail buildings and institutions remain in most large French cities. Many are headquarters of the local unions which are federated into the Confédération nationale du travail, or of other unions which split from the French Communist Party. Many bourse were central as places of organizing and resistance during May 1968. In some places municipal governments have retained ownership, or community and radical groups have taken them over. Some have simply been sold off for office space or torn down.\n\nIn Lille, one of the earliest bourses remains as the home of five unions and a radical community center, and came center stage in the resistance to the deportation of undocumented immigrants, when 460 \"sans-papiers\" staged a 30-day hunger strike to oppose government policies.\n\nThe Bourse du Travail concept has been central to Anarcho-syndicalists across the globe, and the model greatly influenced Council communism and other forms of left communism. Anarchists of many stripes point to the Bourse du Travail as an example of a directly democratic, small scale federalist institutional structure.\n\nThe Bourse du Travail idea was exported along with French imperialism. The FBT's full name was actually \"Fédération des Bourses du Travail de France et des Colonies\", though in practice this meant there were sections in the French settler dominated parts of Algeria. These declined with their French counterparts, and did not survive the anticolonial struggle.\n\nIn Subsaharan Africa, Bourses du Travail were implanted in two ways. In French controlled regions, labor unions were organized by the CGT in the 1930s and 1940s. Their labour halls were styled Bourses du travail, some of which remain as centers of union activity.\n\nThe rulers of Belgian Congo created a Bourse du travail at Katanga in 1910 as a state controlled hiring hall, in an attempt to lure labor to areas of planned industrial (mostly mining) concentration. Attempts by local officials to recast this cynically created employment agency into a more worker run operation suggest that the idea of a Bourse du travail never lost its syndicalist connotations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyon\nBourse du travail \n3 ème Arr.

The formative assessment covers the range of informal diagnostic tests a teacher can use to assist the process of learning by their students. This may include activities such as weekly pop quizzes or preparatory assignments. Prescriptive but ungraded feedback enables students to reflect on what they are learning and why. The goal is to improve performance and achieve successful outcomes. Robert Stake, Director of the Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation, likens formative assessment to a cook tasting a soup before serving it to a guest. Despite its advantages, formative assessment can be time-consuming, and incentives in education systems tend to favor more objective assessments.\n\nAn advantage of formative assessment for learning is that it is ongoing. This allows for incremental feedback to identify problems at their earliest stages. For example, a student can correct conceptual errors before undertaking work on a term paper. As a student works on a topic, input from the teacher can inform, guide, and validate each step of the process. Cheating and plagiarism remain significant problems in academic settings. Compared to graded summative assessments like final exams, ungraded formative assessments reduce the temptation to cheat. This allows students to focus on learning instead of grades.\n\n"}
{"id": "505760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505760", "title": "Counter-Enlightenment", "text": "Counter-Enlightenment\n\nThe Counter-Enlightenment was a term that some 20th-century commentators have used to describe multiple strains of thought that arose in the late-18th and early-19th centuries in opposition to the 18th-century Enlightenment. \n\nThough the first known use of the term in English was in 1949 and there were several uses of it, including one by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Counter-Enlightenment is usually associated with Isaiah Berlin, who is often credited for re-inventing it. The starting point of discussion on this concept in English started with Isaiah Berlin's 1973 Essay, \"The Counter-Enlightenment\"\".\" He published widely about the Enlightenment and its challengers and did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterized as relativist, anti-rationalist, vitalist, and organic, which he associated most closely with German Romanticism. \n\nDespite criticism of the Enlightenment has emerged as a widely discussed topic in twentieth-century thought, the term 'Counter-Enlightenment' was underdeveloped. It was first mentioned briefly in English in William Barrett's 1949 article \"Art, Aristocracy and Reason\" in \"Partisan Review.\" He used the term again in his 1958 book on existentialism, \"Irrational Man,\" however, his comment on Enlightenment criticism was very limited. In Germany, the expression \"Gegen-Aukflärung\" has a longer history. It was probably coined by Friedrich Nietzsche in \"Nachgelassene Fragmente\" in 1877. \n\nLewis White Beck used this term in his \"Early German Philosophy\" (1969), a book about Counter-Enlightenment in Germany. Beck claims that there is a counter-movement arising in Germany in reaction to Frederick II's secular authoritarian state. On the other hand, Johann Georg Hamann and his fellow philosophers believe that a more organic conception of social and political life, a more vitalistic view of nature, and an appreciation for beauty and the spiritual life of man have been neglected by the eighteenth century.\n\nIsaiah Berlin established this term's place in the history of ideas. He used it to refer to a movement that arose primarily in late 18th- and early 19th-century Germany against the rationalism, universalism and empiricism, which are commonly associated with the Enlightenment. Berlin's essay \"The Counter-Enlightenment\" was first published in 1973, and later reprinted in a collection of his works, \"Against the Current\", in 1981. The term has been more widely used since.\n\nBerlin argues that, while there were opponents of the Enlightenment outside of Germany (e.g. Joseph de Maistre) and before the 1770s (e.g. Giambattista Vico), Counter-Enlightenment thought did not start until the Germans 'rebelled against the dead hand of France in the realms of culture, art and philosophy, and avenged themselves by launching the great counter-attack against the Enlightenment.' This German reaction to the imperialistic universalism of the French Enlightenment and Revolution, which had been forced on them first by the francophile Frederick II of Prussia, then by the armies of Revolutionary France and finally by Napoleon, was crucial to the shift of consciousness that occurred in Europe at this time, leading eventually to Romanticism. The consequence of this revolt against the Enlightenment was pluralism. The opponents to the Enlightenment played a more crucial role than its proponents, some of whom were monists, whose political, intellectual and ideological offspring have been terreur and totalitarianism.\n\nIn his book \"Enemies of the Enlightenment\" (2001), historian Darrin McMahon extends the Counter-Enlightenment back to pre-Revolutionary France and down to the level of 'Grub Street,' thereby marking a major advance on Berlin's intellectual and Germanocentric view. McMahon focuses on the early opponents to the Enlightenment in France, unearthing a long-forgotten 'Grub Street' literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries aimed at the \"philosophes\". He delves into the obscure world of the 'low Counter-Enlightenment' that attacked the \"encyclopédistes\" and fought to prevent the dissemination of Enlightenment ideas in the second half of the century. Many people from earlier times attacked the Enlightenment for undermining religion and the social and political order. It later became a major theme of conservative criticism of the Enlightenment. After the French Revolution, it appeared to vindicate the warnings of the \"anti-philosophes\" in the decades prior to 1789.\n\nCardiff University professor Graeme Garrard claims that historian William R. Everdell was the first to situate Rousseau as the \"founder of the Counter-Enlightenment\" in his 1971 dissertation and in his 1987 book, \"Christian Apologetics in France, 1730–1790: The Roots of Romantic Religion\". In his 1996 article, \"the Origin of the Counter-Enlightenment: Rousseau and the New Religion of Sincerity\", in the \"American Political Science Review\" (Vol. 90, No. 2), Arthur M. Melzer corroborates Everdell's view in placing the origin of the Counter-Enlightenment in the religious writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, further showing Rousseau as the man who fired the first shot in the war between the Enlightenment and its opponents. Graeme Garrard follows Melzer in his \"Rousseau's Counter-Enlightenment\" (2003). This contradicts Berlin's depiction of Rousseau as a \"philosophe\" (albeit an erratic one) who shared the basic beliefs of his Enlightenment contemporaries. But similar to McMahon, Garrard traces the beginning of Counter-Enlightenment thought back to France and prior to the German \"Sturm und Drang\" movement of the 1770s. Garrard's book \"Counter-Enlightenments\" (2006) broadens the term even further, arguing against Berlin that there was no single 'movement' called 'The Counter-Enlightenment'. Rather, there have been many Counter-Enlightenments, from the middle of the 18th century to 20th-century Enlightenment among critical theorists, postmodernists and feminists. The Enlightenment has opponents on all points of its ideological compass, from the far left to the far right, and all points in between. Each of the Enlightenment's challengers depicted it as they saw it or wanted others to see it, resulting in a vast range of portraits, many of which are not only different but incompatible.\n\nThe idea of Counter-Enlightenment has evolved in the following years. The historian James Schmidt questioned the idea of 'Enlightenment' and therefore of the existence of a movement opposing it. As the conception of 'Enlightenment' has become more complex and difficult to maintain, so has the idea of the 'Counter-Enlightenment'. Advances in Enlightenment scholarship in the last quarter-century have challenged the stereotypical view of the 18th century as an 'Age of Reason', leading Schmidt to speculate on whether the Enlightenment might not actually be a creation of its opponents, but the other way round. The fact that the term 'Enlightenment' was first used in 1894 in English to refer to a historical period supports the argument that it was a late construction projected back onto the 18th century.\n\nBy the mid-1790s, the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution fueled a major reaction against the Enlightenment. Many leaders of the French Revolution and their supporters made Voltaire and Rousseau, as well as Marquis de Condorcet's ideas of reason, progress, anti-clericalism, and emancipation central themes to their movement. It led to an unavoidable backlash to the Enlightenment as there were people oppose to the revolution. Many counter-revolutionary writers, such as Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre and Augustin Barruel, asserted an intrinsic link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution. They blamed the Enlightenment for undermining traditional beliefs that sustained the ancien regime. As the Revolution became increasingly bloody, the idea of 'Enlightenment' was discredited, too. Hence, the French Revolution and its aftermath have attributed to the development of Counter-Enlightenment thought. \n\nEdmund Burke was among the first of the Revolution's opponents to relate the \"philosophes\" to the instability in France in the 1790s. His \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790) refers the Enlightenment as the principle cause of the French revolution. In Burke's opinion, the \"philosophes\" provided the revolutionary leaders with the theories on which their political schemes were based on. \n\nAugustin Barruel's Counter-Enlightenment ideas were well developed before the revolution. He worked as an editor for the anti-\"philosophes\" literary journal, \"\". Barruel argues in his \"Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism\" (1797) that the Revolution was the consequence of a conspiracy of \"philosophes\" and freemasons. \n\nIn \"Considerations on France\" (1797), Joseph de Maistre interprets the Revolution as divine punishment for the sins of the Enlightenment. According to him, \"the revolutionary storm is an overwhelming force of nature unleashed on Europe by God that mocked human pretensions.\"\n\nIn the 1770s, the \"'Sturm und Drang\"' movement started in Germany. It questioned some key assumptions and implications of the \"Auflärung\" and the term 'Romanticism' was first coined. Many early Romantic writers such as Chateaubriand, Federich von Hardenberg (Novalis) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge inherited the Counter-Revolutionary antipathy towards the philosophes. All three directly blamed the \"philosophes\" in France and the \"Aufklärer\" in Germany for devaluing beauty, spirit and history in favour of a view of man as a soulless machine and a view of the universe as a meaningless, disenchanted void lacking richness and beauty. One particular concern to early Romantic writers was the allegedly anti-religious nature of the Enlightenment since the \"philosophes\" and \"Aufklarer\" were generally deists, opposed to revealed religion. Some historians, such as Hamann, nevertheless contend that this view of the Enlightenment as an age hostile to religion is common ground between these Romantic writers and many of their conservative Counter-Revolutionary predecessors. However, not many have commented on the Enlightenment, except for Chateaubriand, Novalis, and Coleridge, since the term itself did not exist at the time and most of their contemporaries ignored it.\nThe philosopher Jacques Barzun argues that Romanticism has its roots in the Enlightenment. It was not anti-rational, but rather balanced rationality against the competing claims of intuition and the sense of justice. This view is expressed in Goya's \"Sleep of Reason\", in which the nightmarish owl offers the dozing social critic of \"Los Caprichos,\" a piece of drawing chalk. Even the rational critic is inspired by irrational dream-content under the gaze of the sharp-eyed lynx. Marshall Brown makes much the same argument as Barzun in \"Romanticism and Enlightenment\", questioning the stark opposition between these two periods.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the memory of the French Revolution was fading and so was the influence of Romanticism. In this optimistic age of science and industry, there were few critics of the Enlightenment, and few explicit defenders. Friedrich Nietzsche is a notable and highly influential exception. After an initial defence of the Enlightenment in his so-called 'middle period' (late-1870s to early 1880s), Nietzsche turned vehemently against it.\n\nIn the intellectual discourse of the mid-20th century, two concepts emerged simultaneously in the West: enlightenment and totalitarianism. After World War II, the former re-emerged as a key organizing concept in social and political thought and the history of ideas. The Counter-Enlightenment literature blaming the 18th-century trust in reason for 20th-century totalitarianism also resurged along with it. The \"locus classicus\" of this view is Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947), which traces the degeneration of the general concept of enlightenment from ancient Greece (epitomized by the cunning 'bourgeois' hero Odysseus) to 20th-century fascism. They mentioned little about Soviet communism, only referring to it as a regressive totalitarianism that \"clung all too desperately to the heritage of bourgeois philosophy\".\n\nThe authors take 'enlightenment' as their target including its 18th-century form – which we now call 'The Enlightenment'. They claim it is epitomized by the Marquis de Sade. However, there were philosophers rejecting Adorno and Horkheimer’s claim that Sade's moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.\n\nMany postmodern writers and feminists (e.g. Jane Flax) have made similar arguments. They regard \"the\" Enlightenment conception of reason as totalitarian, and as not having been enlightened enough since. For Adorno and Horkheimer, though it banishes myth it falls back into a further myth, that of individualism and formal (or mythic) equality under instrumental reason.\n\nMichel Foucault, for example, argued that attitudes towards the \"insane\" during the late-18th and early 19th centuries show that supposedly enlightened notions of humane treatment were not universally adhered to, but instead, the Age of Reason had to construct an image of \"Unreason\" against which to take an opposing stand. Berlin himself, although no postmodernist, argues that the Enlightenment's legacy in the 20th century has been monism (which he claims favours political authoritarianism), whereas the legacy of the Counter-Enlightenment has been pluralism (associates with liberalism). These are two of the 'strange reversals' of modern intellectual history.\n\nWhat seems to unite all of the Enlightenment's disparate critics from 18th-century religious opponents, counter-revolutionaries, to Romantics, to 20th-century conservatives, feminists, critical theorists and environmentalists is a rejection of what they consider to be the Enlightenment's perversion of reason: the distorted conceptions of reason associate with the Enlightenment in favour of a more restricted view of the nature, scope and limits of human rationality. Debates have occurred over the scope, meaning and application of reason, not over whether it is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, essential or inessential per se. Some charge that the Enlightenment inflated the power and scope of reason, while others claim that it narrowed it.\n\n\n"}

It is designed to make graduates job-ready by the end of the program. Dev Bootcamp was headquartered in San Francisco, California, with additional locations in Seattle, Chicago, New York City, Washington DC, San Diego, and Austin. It was acquired by for-profit education company Kaplan, Inc in 2014. Dev Bootcamp closed in 2017.\n\nThe program was 9 weeks of remote work (called Phase 0) and then 9 weeks of intensive onsite training in professional web development, including Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. A week of career training followed the 18 weeks of technical training. The program took students with little or no prior programming experience and taught them the fundamentals of computer programming. The program's goal was to develop the necessary skills within the students to make them job-ready for an entry-level developer position. According to Hoover, applicants to the 2013 Chicago programs had varied backgrounds, ranging from students who have master's degrees in computer science to a Starbucks barista.\n\nThe program valued learning by building and doing; in contrast to traditional classrooms, Dev Bootcamp students worked through a series of programming challenges, usually working in pairs or small groups, which culminated in a final group project. The tuition costs were $13,950 in the New York and San Francisco locations, and $12,700 for the Chicago, San Diego, Austin, and Seattle locations for the 9-week, 40-hour-per-week program. Core class hours were weekdays 9am-6pm in San Francisco and 8am-5pm in Chicago. However, most students stayed nights and weekends, which amounted to an approximate 70–80 hours per week. Dev Bootcamp organized hiring days for technology companies to interview students. They then collected a referral fee from employers that hire their graduates, and they passed along part of that fee to the graduate in the form of a hiring bonus.\n\nIn 2015, Dev Bootcamp tested a remote teaching model in a pilot program in Columbus, Ohio, which was canceled after the first round even though four of its 14 enrollees had already found jobs. The company announced it was closing its doors on July 23, 2017 via a press release. \n\nThe program was divided into three core phases, each lasting three weeks. In the first phase, students learned some of the fundamentals of computer programming in Ruby, including algorithms and database querying. The next phase introduced front-end technologies and combined them with previously learned material. The final phase brought everything full-circle with the Ruby on Rails framework. In this phase, students built a web application from scratch.\n\nStudents were also required to remotely complete 9 weeks of preparation material before the on-location courses began.\n\nAfter its founding in 2012, Dev Bootcamp was featured in \"The Chicago Tribune\", \"Fast Company\", \"Business Insider\", TechCrunch, and \"Inc. Magazine\". According to the company, 95% of the individuals who had graduated from Dev Bootcamp San Francisco that year found jobs, with an average starting salary of more than $85,000. Dev Bootcamp was also highly rated on bootcamp reviews sites like Course Report.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35587000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35587000", "title": "Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice", "text": "Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice\n\nDevelopmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP) is a series of musical experiences that early childhood educators can promote to young children (birth through Age 8) during the traditional school day. These experiences are grounded in a plethora of research studies both in the field of music education and early childhood education. Essentially, DAMP provides young children with optimal learning experiences in which have a profound influence on young children’s social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development.\n\nDevelopmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP) was coined in 2011 by music education researcher Dr. Guerino Terracciano while conducting a study for the effect of a hands-on music education in-service program on early childhood educators’ attitude, knowledge, and self-efficacy for providing DAMP in the learning environment with young children. Terracciano states the following:\nSeveral studies have investigated the effect of music education on the early childhood educators’ capacity for promoting Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP) in the learning environment with young children (de l’Etoile; Nicholas; Rogers, Hallam, Creech, & Preti; Saunders & Baker ). For example, these studies show that when providing educators with quality musical resources, they are able to gain the confidence and the knowledge to successfully promote musical experiences during the traditional school day. On the other hand, these studies also suggest that music education has an effect on the young child’s social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development. Music education in relationship to cognitive development has been acknowledged throughout history (Dewey; Gardner; Collins, Griess, Carither, & Castillo ). For example, in the areas of language and literacy development young children have the propensity to learn their everyday spoken language by acquiring the vocabulary words through active engagement during music activities (Moomaw & Davis ). (p. 1)\n\nAccording to the book titled \"Smart Moves\", learning is not all in our head. Hannaford stated that the more young children move the better they will learn. As a result, movement stimulates neurological development, which explains the potential it has on the learning process. Consequently, Gordon suggests that promoting movement while learning has the potential to expand the child’s nerve network wiring system, therefore facilitating understanding of the element of rhythm. Gordon’s empirical research goes on to explain that young children construct musical understanding through movement. Gordon looked at movement as an important learning process that the body must undergo in order for the learner to gain a comprehensive understanding of various elements of music, such as rhythm and melody.\n\nGiving students the autonomy to pursue music has shown positive results in students acquiring an interest of the subject. For example, Kemple, Batey, and Hartle suggest that exploration and play become vehicles for musical growth. When young children are given access to play a simple instrument, they unintentionally ‘construct’ specific knowledge and information that relates to an area of interest. Fundamentally, through autonomous engagement young children develop intuitively an interest that the classroom teacher is not able to foster through direct instructional methods.\n\nChildren’s musical interest may vary from exploring a specific instrument to listening to a type of musical literature that the child finds interesting because of his or her cultural background. In other words, early childhood musical interest lies with the involvement that the child is actively engaged in the learning milieu. Morin’s article suggests that in order for students to develop a personal interest during the exploration of music, they need opportunities and experiences that have been aligned by the educator as developmentally appropriate. In essence, Morin communicates about the importance of giving young children ample opportunities to explore, manipulate, and play in the classroom.\n\nHistorically, music education has been deemed an important subject in the lives of young children during their daily learning experiences (Monroe; Rousseau; McDonald; Brosterman ). Since 1838, The Boston School Committee in the United States adopted music as a branch of instruction in their public school system for the purpose of positively affecting students’ academic potential (Abeles, Hoffer, & Klotman ). During this period, music was given importance, based on the assumption that it could humanize, refine, and elevate our elementary learning communities through listening and singing (Greata). Subsequently, one of the first decisions for music instruction was related to its capacity and potential in fostering intellectual growth (Dewey; Seefeldt ).\n\n"}

{"id": "49355115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49355115", "title": "Formative Assessment in Sports", "text": "Formative Assessment in Sports\n\nFormative assessments are check points during the learning process. Unlike summative assessments, that check for understanding at the end of learn, formative assessments come in during learning. and “Formative assessments support learning during the learning process. They serve as practice for students, just like a meaningful homework assignment. They check for understanding along the way and guide teacher decision making about future instruction.” Formative assessments give teachers a chance to break down complex ideas into smaller understandable pieces. This allows teachers to correct “mistakes” and fine tune skills before summative assessments.\n\nI thought you said sports?\n\nWhile formative assessment is mostly talked about in the classroom it can also be used in athletics. Think about the process in learning a new sport. We take the whole sport and break it down into simple steps. Along the way we have coaches giving us specific feed back. We don’t teach a new sport to kids by having them go out and play in a game right away. If we did, our feedback after our summative assessment (their game) would likely be negative. Instead along the way we break sports up into drills and game like situations. This allows coaches to give athletes feedback and make corrections before the game. The process of breaking “chunking” a sport can be broken down into three parts: drill, situations, and competitions. Each one of these is a stepping stone to the next. Even during competitions adjustments and learning can occur.\n\nDrill\n\nWe take a sport and break it down to simple moves. Like dribbling a basketball or shooting a single leg takedown. While we are working on simple moves, coaches are looking for specific things. Where are the athlete’s eyes? Are their feet moving in the right direction? These things are considered our success criteria for each drill. Coaches use these to give athletes’ feedback in order for them to successfully complete the drill. By providing good feedback like, “keep your eyes up when dribbling,” or, “your left foot is sliding to the right,” coaches are giving pointers to the learner that they can immediately work on correcting. \"The principle of specificity in training states that the body will adapt to the specific imposed stimulus. Therefore, if an athlete desires to improve in a specific skill, movement, or exercise, he or she must perform that exercise in training with multiple variations, or tweaks, to that drill. Because of the complexity of the human structure and human movement, specificity is paramount in training to reach the desired outcome. Another layer to this philosophy is that if the test is the exercise, then if the exercise is properly tweaked (complex variations), it will provide the best opportunity for an improved outcome .\" The only way to achieve the desired outcome is to drill and tweak until we get to the desired outcome.\n\nTakedown Drill - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfu1ikO__-s\n\nSituations\n\nCoaches put athletes in live situations all the time. Full-court presses, fumbles on the football field, bunting with man on bases are just a few examples. These situations are assessing a team's response to the situation. The coach can tell if the team has specifics areas they need to work on. Maybe the pitcher needs to cover first base, but was unaware of that until the situation. By chunking up a game into situations coaches are able to simulate games while keeping the ability to give instruction and instant feedback. \"Simulation training enables athletes to develop and master the skills they will need to maintain optimal focus and perform their best in competition. In simulated competitions, athletes become aware of what they will confront in actual competition.\" \n\nBaseball practice- Bunt offense and bunt defense- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvXT6kq4lR4\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe last way coaches can use formative assessment is during a competition. While some may see this as the summative assessment, I believe that happens as a team looks back on the season as a whole. During competitions coaches might praise specific things and athlete is doing, “good coverage on the receiver, turn your hips with him right away.” Coaches can also give feedback during halftime or the end of a quarter. “We are giving the quarterback open passing lanes in the middle. Our middle linebacker should line up five yards off the ball instead of three.” These are formative assessments made during the progression of competitions.\n\nGreg Popovich- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8it7TADz6Xg\n"}

Until 2017, it was run by the now Acting United States Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. FACT's website states that the organisation is \"dedicated to promoting accountability, ethics, and transparency in government and civic arenas by hanging a lantern over public officials who put their own interests over the interests of the public good.\"\n\nThe conservative group Donors Trust was the source of $500,000 of FACT's revenue in 2015 and $800,000 in 2016. As a 501(c)(3) organization it is not required to disclose donors however Charles Koch has acknowledged giving to DonorsTrust.\n\nFACT has largely focused on Hillary Clinton and the e-mail scandal or other Democratic representatives such as Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, Representative Patrick E. Murphy of Florida and Representative Ted Strickland of Ohio. FACT lobbied against the confirmation of one-time Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, and filed an FEC complaint against Democratic voter data firm Catalist in 2015. Despite claiming to be nonpartisan, the organization called for ethics investigations into or filed complaints about forty-six different Democratic politicians, officials, and organizations, compared to only a few Republicans. During his tenure, Whitaker wrote opinion pieces that appeared in \"USA Today\" and \"The Washington Examiner\", and appeared regularly on conservative talk-radio shows and cable news. In 2017 Whitaker as executive director of FACT wrote:The most disturbing aspect of Hillary Clinton’s continued blame game is that she still doesn’t think there was anything wrong with recklessly handling highly sensitive and classified information, intentionally instructing her staff to do the same and then lying to the entire world about it at the United Nations of all places.In addition notably FACT under Whitaker filed a complaint in 2017 with the Federal Election Commission against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Alexandra Chalupa a consultant working for the DNC who was investigating Paul Manafort and Donald Trumps ties to Russia which eventually led to Manafort stepping down as Donald Trump's campaign chairman. On March 30, 2016 Chalupa briefed the DNC's communications staff on Manafort's and Trump's ties to Russia exposing one part of election interference that Russia conducted against the U.S. 2016 elections. FACT has acted in close concert with U.S Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa who also made a complaint with the DOJ, Whitaker is also from Iowa, Grassley has acted as Whitaker's mentor and patron assisting him in obtaining political positions. FACT's complaint was based on the claim that Chalupa “met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia.”\n\nChalupa's, who denied any wrongdoing, investigation was confirmed in 2018 when Robert Mueller's special Counsel investigation found Manafort guilty on eight felony counts of financial crimes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and a month later he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice. No charges were made from the complaints from FACT.\n\nIn 2016, Whitaker defended ExxonMobil as the executive director of FACT when the Attorneys General United for Clean Power Coalition started their investigation into the firm for not disclosing climate change risks. Whitaker called the investigation \"both unconstitutional and unethical\". The investigation has since matured leading to four counts of fraud being filed against ExxonMobil.\n\nIn 2018 FACT scrutinised a pro Rick Scott Political action committee.\n\nFACT has paid outside Republican firms to perform some of its work. One such firm is America Rising LLC, which was given $144,000 for research in 2015. FACT paid America Rising at least $500,000 for research from 2015 to 2017. FACT also had close working relationship with America Rising, sharing information and political communication strategy. The foundation last year paid $134,119 to Creative Response Concepts, a conservative political public relations company and has paid a total of $500,000 to the agency.\n\nSome experts such as Daniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, have questioned the status of FACT saying that it may have Violated Tax-Exempt Status. FACT has called for ethical investigations or filed complaints against over 46 individuals or organizations, the vast majority of whom are either Democrats or associated with Democratic causes. \n\nKendra Arnold is the Executive Director and was previously the General Counsel from 2014 onward.\n\nFACT's treasurer was Neil Corkery from 2015 to 2016 whose wife established the Judicial Crisis Network.

After the end of the Second World War and before India got independence, Sir Ardeshir Dalal from the Viceroy's Executive Council foresaw that the future prosperity of India would depend not so much on capital as on technology. He, therefore, proposed the setting up of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. To man those laboratories, he persuaded the US government to offer hundreds of doctoral fellowships under the Technology Cooperation Mission (TCM) program. However realizing that such steps can not help in the long run for the development of India after it gains independence, he conceptualized institutes that would train such work forces in the country itself. This is believed to be the first conceptualization of IITs.\n\nDr Humayun Kabir encouraged Dr B. C. Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal to work on Sir Ardeshir's proposal for an IIT. It is also possible that Sir J.C. Ghosh, the then Director of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, prompted him to do so. In 1946, Dr Kabir along with Sir Jogendra Singh of the Viceroy's Executive Council (Department of Education, Health and Agriculture) set up a committee to prepare a proposal, and made Sir Nalini Ranjan Sarkar the chairman. The Sarkar Committee was taking too much time, but Dr Roy did not wait for the Committee to finalise its report and started working on the interim draft itself. The 22 member committee (in its interim draft) recommended the establishment of \"Higher Technical Institutions\" in the Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern regions of the country. These institutes were recommended to have a number of secondary institutions affiliated to them. The draft also urged the speedy establishment of all the four institutions with the ones in the East and the West to be started immediately. The committee also felt that such institutes should not only produce undergraduates but should be engaged in research – producing research workers and technical teachers as well. The standard of the graduates was recommended to be at par with those from elite institutions abroad. They felt that the proportion of undergraduates and postgraduate students should be 2:1.\n\nL. S. Chandrakant and Biman Sen in the Education Ministry played significant role in producing a blueprint for a truly autonomous educational institution. Sir J.C. Ghosh (later to be the first Director of IIT Kharagpur) ensured liberal provisions of the IIT Act allowing the IITs to work free from interference from the \"babudom\". It is largely because of the IIT Act that IIT directors were granted authority superseding even some parts of the government. On the ground Bengal had the highest concentration of engineering industries, the Committee suggested that an IIT may be set up in that state. This encouraged Dr. Roy. to use that fragment of a report in order to persuade Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to push through a special Act to establish an IIT in Bengal.\nWith the recommendations of the Sarkar committee in view and on the basis of blueprint made by L. S. Chandrakant, Biman Sen, and Sir J.C. Ghosh, the first Indian Institute of Technology was born in May, 1950 at the site of Hijli Detention Camp in Kharagpur, a town in eastern India. Initially the IIT started functioning from 5, Esplanade East, Calcutta[ (now Kolkata) and shifted to Hijli in September, 1950 when Sir J.C. Ghosh offered the place as a ready made place for the IIT. The present name 'Indian Institute of Technology' was adopted before the formal inauguration of the Institute on 18 August 1951, by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. On 15 September 1956, the Parliament of India passed an act known as the \"Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act\" declaring it as an Institute of National Importance. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur in 1956, said:\nTo counter the criticisms of setting up IIT in West Bengal, the draft report suggested that a second IIT may be located in the Western Region to serve the process industries concentrated there. It also added that a third IIT should be considered for the North to promote the vast irrigation potential of the Gangetic basin. Not willing to leave South out (and to make it politically correct), the draft report hinted that a fourth one might be considered for the South too. However, it offered no specific economic justification for the same.\n\nWhen the pressure started building up to set up IIT in the West, Jawaharlal Nehru sought Soviet assistance in order to set up the institute in Mumbai. Krishna Menon (the then Defence Minister) and closest to the Russians, got Brig Bose appointed the first Director of IIT Bombay when it got established in Powai in 1958. As a fallout of the prevailing Cold War, the Americans offered to help to set up yet another IIT. The way the Sarcar Committee had suggested, it was established in the North as IIT Kanpur (in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh) in 1959. Dr Kelkar was the first Director of the institute.\n\nAt that time, the Germans had run up large trade surpluses, and they were persuaded to support an IIT in the South. The Germans had initially decided on Bangalore as the location but when they visited Madras, C. Subramaniam, the Education Minister, took them round the Governor's estate with frolicking deer roaming among hundreds of venerable banyan trees, and offered the space across the table. The visiting German team was considerably impressed by it and Madras got the fourth IIT in 1959 itself as IIT Madras.\n\nR. N. Dogra the Chief Engineer of Chandigarh persuaded Prof M. S. Thacker, then Member of the Planning Commission to set up an IIT at Delhi on the ground that the country was divided into five regions, and all but the North had an IIT each. It was done on the basis of the logic that Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh constituted the Central Region. Hence, officially, Kanpur was located in the Central Region, not the North. This led to the establishment of IIT Delhi in 1961. The Indian Institutes of Technology Act was suitably amended to reflect the addition of new IITs.\n\nAfter the establishment of IIT in Delhi, there was a long gap in any notable development in the history of IITs. However, in the beginning of the 1990s, widespread student agitations in Assam led to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi promising another IIT in Assam. Rajiv Gandhi agreed to it on the spot considering it a minor request of IIT although eventually it cost over Rs 1,500 crore. The IIT Guwahati campus was established in 1994 and started functioning in 1995. In the beginning of the 21st century, Dr Murli Manohar Joshi (the Education Minister of India) made University of Roorkee into an IIT, making IIT Roorkee the newest IIT but the oldest institution amongst the seven in 2001.\n\nEstablishment of the eight new IITs began with decision of the cabinet, which was announced by the Minister of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Arjun Singh, on 28 March 2008 that the government planned to establish more IITs, Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and Central Universities across the country. Six IITs at Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Patna and Ropar began functional from 2008 while other two at Indore and Mandi commenced their sessions from 2009.\n\nIn order to establish more IITs in India, MHRD constituted Professor S K Joshi Committee in 2003 and Anand Krishnan Committee in 2005 to recommend names of existing institutes that had the potential of being converted into an IIT institute, both of which had recommended for the conversion of the IT-BHU into an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). On 17 July 2008, the government of India issued a press release granting \"In principle approval for taking over the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University – a constituent unit of the Banaras Hindu University, a Central University, its conversion into an Indian Institute of Technology and integrating it with the IIT system in the country.\" After the approval of BHU Executive Council, a Bill was introduced on 4 August 2010 a bill seeking to amend the Institutes of Technology Act 1961 to declare IT-BHU as an IIT. The Bill was eventually signed by the President of India on 20 June 2012 and notified in the gazette on 21 June. The Central Government released a notification on 29 June that as per the Act, the transformation process was complete and the erstwhile IT-BHU was renamed as Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi.\n\nThe proposal for conversion of ISM Dhanbad into an IIT had been strongly recommended in 1994 by a Government Committee, headed by Prof. S. Sampath (former Director of IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras). However, no action was taken by the Government over the proposal.\n\nSeveral years later, in 2007-08, several new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) like IIT Patna were set up without even having a campus, while ISM was not converted into IIT. This was despite the fact that since 1997, ISM was taking in IIT-JEE qualified students (along with the 7 older IIT's and IT-BHU). After the conversion of IT-BHU to IIT-BHU in June 2012, ISM was the only non-IIT institute which admitted IIT-JEE (now called IIT-JEE Advanced) qualified students to its various undergraduate and dual degree programmes. Once admitted into ISM or an IIT through IIT-JEE (Advanced) exam, a student was not permitted to appear in the exam again, and hence could not take admission in an IIT next year (as per rules of the JEE Advanced exam). In this respect, Govt of India treated ISM at par with IITs.\n\nIn 2009, ISM got the approval of its Finance Committee, Executive Board and General Council, proposing its conversion to an IIT. This was forwarded to Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Government of India in early 2010. This was followed by a detailed project report on the conversion prepared by EdCIL (a Public Sector Enterprise), on the directions of the HRD Ministry. The ISM Teachers Association and ISM Alumni Association passed resolutions in 2010-11, favoring this conversion. In September 2011, a resolution was passed by the Government of Jharkhand, recommending to the Government of India to convert ISM to an IIT soon.\n\nOn 7 May 2012, the Director of ISM gave a detailed presentation highlighting the various aspects of institute and the need for its conversion to an IIT, at the Yojana Bhawan, Planning commission. The meeting was chaired by Narendra Jadhav, Member of MHRD. The conclusion that came to be was inclusion of the conversion in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17).\n\nIn June 2012, a Planning Commission panel, on a reference to it from the Union Cabinet, favoured that this conversion be done, during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) and in such a possible way that ISM's core competency in mining and geology is maintained.\n\nThe proposal to convert ISM to IIT became a part of the 12th Five Year Plan after its passage by the Prime Minister headed National Development Council or NDC, on 27 December 2012. ISM was the only institute of India selected by NDC to be converted into an IIT in the 12th Five Year Plan.\n\nFinally, the Union Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley, during his budget speech in Parliament on 28 February 2015, had proposed to upgrade ISM Dhanbad into an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). On May 25, 2016, the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Modi approved that a bill be introduced in Parliament for converting ISM Dhanbad into an IIT.\n\nOn 25 May 2016, the Union Cabinet passed a draft Bill proposed to set up 6 new IITs and convert ISM Dhanbad into a full-fledged IIT. On 19 July 2016 the said Bill, named The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in the Lok Sabha. On 25 July 2016, the mentioned Bill was passed without any opposition by the Lok Sabha.. On August 2, 2016, the IIT Amendment Bill 2016 (for conversion of ISM DHANBAD to IIT(ISM) DHANBAD and including setting up of 6 new IITs ) was passed by Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe Bill was eventually signed by the President of India on 10 August and notified in the Gazette of India and ISM Dhanbad was renamed as Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad\n\n"}

Co-created by Phyllis Webb and William A. Young, the show premiered in 1965 under the title \"The Best Ideas You'll Hear Tonight\". It is currently hosted by Paul Kennedy and is broadcast between 9:05 and 10:00 P.M. weekday evenings; one episode each week is repeated on Friday afternoons under the title \"Ideas in the Afternoon\".\n\nThe show describes itself as a radio program on contemporary thought. The subject matter of the shows varies, but music, philosophy, science, religion, and especially history are common topics. The show has won many plaudits for its quality and depth.\n\nThe series is notable for soliciting programming proposals from people who are not professional broadcasters, and having the successful applicants write and host their own documentaries (aided in production by CBC staff producers). Many \"Ideas\" programs are multi-part, with two, three, four, or more fifty-five-minute programs devoted to a single topic. Transcripts and audio recordings of many programs are made available, and sold directly by the CBC.\n\nNotable CBC staff producers who have been associated with the program include Bernie Lucht, Geraldine Sherman, Damiano Pietropaolo, Phyllis Webb, and David Cayley. Individual programs are produced at CBC Radio One facilities across Canada. Documentarian William Whitehead also wrote or cowrote a number of shows for \"Ideas\".\n\nA television version for CBC News Network, \"Ideas on TV,\" was short-lived. The book \"Ideas: Brilliant Thinkers Speak Their Minds\", edited by Bernie Lucht, commemorated the series' 40th anniversary.\n\nThe show broadcasts Canada's annual Massey Lectures, Lafontaine-Baldwin Lecture, and the Munk Debates. Since 2006, they have included the Henry G. Friesen lectures.\nAudio downloads of many episodes are available from the CBC website, as well as via the CBC Ideas podcast, which was, by popular demand, one of the first to be included in the network's large podcasting initiative begun in 2005. Many episodes are also available for sale on audio CD.\n\nIn January 2014, \"Ideas\" broadcast a two-part documentary about Wikipedia entitled \"The Great Book of Knowledge\", produced and narrated by Philip Coulter. Part 1 of the documentary aired on January 15 and Part 2 on January 22. As of February 2014, both episodes were also available in streaming audio on the \"Ideas\" website, and via subscription to the \"Ideas\" podcast.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50896194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50896194", "title": "ImageNet", "text": "ImageNet\n\nThe ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. Over 14 million URLs of images have been hand-annotated by ImageNet to indicate what objects are pictured; in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. ImageNet contains over 20 thousand categories; a typical category, such as \"balloon\" or \"strawberry\", contains several hundred images. The database of annotations of third-party image URLs is freely available directly from ImageNet; however, the actual images are not owned by ImageNet. Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes. The ImageNet Challenge uses a \"trimmed\" list of one thousand non-overlapping classes.\n\nA dramatic 2012 breakthrough in solving the ImageNet Challenge is widely considered to be the beginning of the deep learning revolution of the 2010s: \"Suddenly people started to pay attention, not just within the AI community but across the technology industry as a whole.\"\n\nThe database was presented for the first time as a poster at the 2009 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Florida by researchers from the Computer Science department at Princeton University.\nImageNet crowdsources its annotation process. Image-level annotations indicate the presence or absence of an object class in an image, such as \"there are tigers in this image\" or \"there are no tigers in this image\". Object-level annotations provide a bounding box around the (visible part of the) indicated object. ImageNet uses a variant of the broad WordNet schema to categorize objects, augmented with 120 categories of dog breeds to showcase fine-grained classification. One downside of WordNet use is the categories may be more \"elevated\" than would be optimal for ImageNet: \"Most people are more interested in Lady Gaga or the iPod Mini than in this rare kind of diplodocus.\" In 2012 ImageNet was the world's largest academic user of Mechanical Turk. The average worker identified 50 images per minute.\n\nSince 2010, the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is a competition where research teams evaluate their algorithms on the given data set, and compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks. The ILSVRC aims to \"follow in the footsteps\" of the smaller-scale PASCAL VOC challenge, established in 2005, which contained only about 20,000 images and twenty object classes. The ILSVRC uses a \"trimmed\" list of only 1000 image categories or \"classes\", including 90 of the 120 dog breeds classified by the full ImageNet schema. The 2010s saw dramatic progress in image processing. Around 2011, a good ILSVRC classification error rate was 25%. In 2012, a deep convolutional neural net achieved 16%; in the next couple of years, error rates fell to a few percent. While the 2012 breakthrough \"combined pieces that were all there before\", the dramatic quantitative improvement marked the start of an industry-wide artificial intelligence boom. By 2015, researchers reported that software exceeded human ability at the narrow ILSVRC tasks. However, as one of the challenge's organizers, Olga Russakovsky, pointed out in 2015, the programs only have to identify images as belonging to one of a thousand categories; humans can recognize a larger number of categories, and also (unlike the programs) can judge the context of an image.\n\nBy 2014, over fifty institutions participated in the ILSVRC. In 2015, Baidu scientists were banned for a year for using different accounts to greatly exceed the specified limit of two submissions per week. Baidu later stated that it fired the team leader involved and that it would establish a scientific advisory panel.\n\nIn 2017, 29 of 38 competing teams got less than 5% wrong. In 2017 ImageNet stated it would roll out a new, much more difficult, challenge in 2018 that involves classifying 3D objects using natural language. Because creating 3D data is more costly than annotating a pre-existing 2D image, the dataset is expected to be smaller. The applications of progress in this area would range from robotic navigation to augmented reality.\n\nAround November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and COCO. According to Google, NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published ImageNet performance.\n\n"}
{"id": "47535271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47535271", "title": "International History Olympiad", "text": "International History Olympiad\n\nThe International History Olympiad is a competition for top history students from around the world which debuted in 2015. The International History Olympiad was founded and is overseen by International Academic Competitions (IAC), though prior participation in IAC events (such as the National History Bee and Bowl or International History Bee and Bowl), is not required for students to attend the Olympiad. The qualification process, events, and awards structure at the International History Olympiad are markedly different from the International Science Olympiads. The International History Olympiad is open to students age 12-19 as long as they have not completed a year of university (from 2020 onwards; prior to 2020, students who had finished just one year of university and had qualified could attend) and have qualified. Students compete in three separate age ranges: Varsity, Junior Varsity, and Middle School, as is the case at other IHBB events. The International History Olympiad is sponsored by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which helps cover travel costs and registration fees for participants who perform well in Olympiad qualification events. For the first time in 2018, a geography equivalent of the International History Olympiad took place in conjunction with the Olympiad: The International Geography Bee World Championships.\n\nStudents typically qualify for the Olympiad either by finishing in the top half of a regional or championship level tournament in either the International History Bee or the International History Bowl. US students must either win a National History Bee and Bowl regional bee or bowl or finish in the top half in either at the National Championships. Students who finish among the top students at the US National Championships or IHBB Divisional Championships may be awarded discounted or free entry, and/or travel stipends. Students who live over 400 kilometers from the nearest History Bee or Bowl tournaments or who could not attend due to extenuating circumstances may qualify by taking a specific exam administered by a teacher at their school. Qualification is valid for both the current academic year and the following (e.g. a student who qualifies in November 2015 could attend all Olympiads through the summer of 2017). There is no limit to the number of students from any one country or US state who can attend the International History Olympiad.\n\nThe majority of the competition events at the International History Olympiad follow a quiz bowl style format (utilizing a lock-out device buzzer system) with students competing individually. Students answer comprehensive, paragraph-length questions about specific topics in history, depending on the type of competition (e.g. Ancient History Bee, Art History Bee, etc.).\n\nTwo of the buzzer-based competitions, the International History Bee World Championships, and the International History Bowl World Championships, do not focus on specific aspects of history, but are meant to be comprehensive. The Bowl World Championships feature students on teams (usually from the same US state or country) rather than from the same school, as is the case at other IHBB tournaments.\n\nOther competitions at the Olympiad include a research competition, various types of exams, games, and simulations of historical events (similar to Model UN historical crisis committees). The Olympiad also features a number of guest speakers, field trips, medals ceremonies for each event (complete with flags and national/state anthems), and opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThree events (the International History Bee World Championships, the Written Exam, and the Battery Exam) combine to form the official Olympiad championship. Students are ranked in order of their performance on these three competitions; the students with the combined best ranks are the official Olympiad champions.\n\nAll students at the International History Olympiad compete for a US state (if they attend school in the USA or are an American citizen) or for their country of citizenship or residence. Students who would be eligible to compete for two affiliations must select one. Medals are awarded solely to the top three competitors in each event, but they are awarded for every event. In this way, the Olympiad more closely approximates the Olympics than the International Science Olympiads. A medals table is maintained as well - the ranking is first done by total number of golds, then total number of silvers, then total number of bronzes. \nStudents are also assigned to teams for the team events at the Olympiad based on a number of factors, though every effort is made to keep students from the same country or state together. Teams consist of either 2 or 3 students. For team events, if a \"mixed\" team wins a medal, the medals are credited fractionally on the medals table depending on how many students from a state or country were on the team.\n\nAfter 2016, the Olympiad became a biennial model; Olympiads thus occur in even-numbered years. The location of the 2020 International History Olympiad has yet to be determined, though it will take place in July 2020 and will once again be held in conjunction with the International Geography Bee World Championships.\n\nAt the end of the International History Olympiad, the International History Bee World Championships are contested. For a full list of European, Asian, and Canadian International History Bee champions, see the International History Bee and Bowl page. For a full list of USA National History Bee National Champions, see the National History Bee and Bowl page.\n\nThe Middle School division is open to some students age 14 and under, depending on month of birth. Some of the winners below were high school students at the time they won the competition.\n\nOne of the marquis events at the International History Olympiad is the International History Bowl World Championships. In contrast with all other International History Bowl events, where students compete on teams representing their schools, at the Olympiad, students compete on their designated Olympiad-specific teams. Also, while teams at other International History Bowl events typically feature four students playing at once, and permit teams of 1-6 students (at regionals) and 1-unlimited students (at Championships), the Olympiad features only teams of either 2 or 3 students. Wherever possible, teams consist exclusively of students in an age division from one US state or country. However, if only one student registers for the Olympiad from a particular affiliation, then that student will be paired with 1 or 2 other students from other affiliations. For a full list of European, Asian, and Canadian International History Bowl champions, see the International History Bee and Bowl page. For a full list of USA National History Bowl National Champions, see the National History Bee and Bowl page.\n\n"}

Felsen served as Director of Archeworks, an alternative design school in Chicago from 2008-11. Under his leadership, Archeworks completed several significant public interest design projects, and developed and organized two influential urban design workshops titled \"Infrastructures for Change\". During Felsen’s tenure, Archeworks’ projects were exhibited internationally at the Venice Biennale of Architecture and The Architecture Foundation in London. Felsen founded and served as editor of a new Archeworks publication titled \"Works\".\n\nUrbanLab: Bowling is a new book about UrbanLab’s work authored by Martin Felsen and Sarah Dunn, published by Applied Research + Design. The book explores relationships and realities between cities, architecture and water. As populations steadily increase in cities, the world’s natural resources are consumed at ever-faster rates. The majority of the world’s populations live in countries where clean water supplies are dwindling, and these water shortages are also quickly translating into food shortages. What can designers do to avert looming water-related realities? UrbanLab: Bowling views potential water crises as opportunities to speculate on future urban design possibilities, especially in cities. Several projects are presented that take an ecological approach to re-thinking received urban design methodologies of addressing the design of water-related infrastructures in existing and new cities.\n\n\n\n"}

The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 5,000 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in 60 plus languages.\n\nFormerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.\n\nBased on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions. This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite. In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district. In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.\n\nMcGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the \"American Journal of Railway Appliances\". He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing \"The McGraw Publishing Company\" in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, \"The Hill Publishing Company\".\n\nIn 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into \"The McGraw-Hill Book Company\". John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into \"The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc\". In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.\n\nIn 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased \"Byte\" from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.\n\nIn 1988, McGraw Hill closed its trade book division.\n\nMcGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became \"The McGraw-Hill Companies\" in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.\n\nIn 2004, The McGraw-Hill Companies sold it's children's publishing unit to School Specialty.\n\nIn 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.\n\nOn November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion. On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.\n\nIn 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.\n\nMcGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR.

In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.\n\nDuring the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.\n\n\nIn 1980, McGraw-Hill Education paid the African American writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin a $200,000 advance for his unfinished book \"Remember This House\", a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Following his death, the company sued his estate to recover the advance they had paid him for the unfinished book. The lawsuit was dropped by the company in 1990, citing a desire not to cause distress to Baldwin's family. \n\nIn October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as \"workers.\" The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge. Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34856632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34856632", "title": "NGO involvement in Guatemala", "text": "NGO involvement in Guatemala\n\nNGO involvement in Guatemala includes the following.\n\nThe Guatemalan Association for Sexual Education (AGES), with backing from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has set into motion several programs tailored to both improve the quality of the education, and the amount of people getting educated. To achieve this, it was necessary to have a mix of activities that sought to “balance broad systemic improvements with specific classroom support, and institutionalisation of project activities into existing organizational units”. Two programs implemented by AGES were particularly successful in achieving these goals.\n\nTraditional gender roles are still prevalent in Guatemala and this has had a negative impact on the education levels of women. Women are tasked with domestic chores and are made to work on agricultural land such that there is no perceived need for educated women. It is estimated that Guatemala has one of the lowest literacy rate in Latin America with 43 percent of all women over 15 are illiterate, compared with 28 percent of all men.\n\nThe implementation of Eduque a la Niña was to address the pressing issue of basic education for girls and inculcate in parents the importance of girls’ education. AGES funded students with a $4.30-per-month scholarship, developed close parent teacher relationship to monitor the progress of the child and offered education materials specific to girls. These schemes were put in place in hope that girls will be motivated to learn and parents would be supportive of their academic endeavours.\n\nThe schemes were well received and the provisions of scholarships were proven to be effective in encouraging girls to advance to the second grade.\n\nThe NEU was based on the Colombian’s Escuela Nueva model. NEU schools are multi-grade schools serving rural indigenous communities. These schools use flexible individual and group study and active participation to increase the quality of education. It moved teachers away from traditional instructional teaching methods and introduced the use of small groups in the classroom. This innovation permitted students, in particular girls, to participate more actively in the classroom and have their experiences and knowledge recognised. Teachers from schools in close proximity are also required to meet regularly to \"train, support and adapt learning materials\".\n\nThe NEU schools were evaluated in series of studies by Chesterfield and Rubio and by Baessa, as part of the Improving Educational Quality (IEQ) Project. The study found that NEU schools retained significantly more students. The students were also able to achieve at a higher level in mathematics and reading. The active pedagogy in NEU schools contributed to emotional growth, participatory behavior, and group work. NEU teachers had greater confidence and capabilities to work in multigrade classrooms and used small group instruction. Overall parental satisfaction was higher in NEU schools citing their children’s ability to read better and behave better at home.\n\nOne drawback of this program that has been noted is that the costs per NEU student is 58% higher than costs per student in standard schools. However, the higher relative costs of the NEU can be seen as reasonable due to the small percentage of national budget directed to primary schools in Guatemala. Furthermore, the improved quality of education in NEU schools led to reduced repetition and dropout rates, resulting in a 15% drop in total costs per student to complete the primary cycle.\n"}

{"id": "19247492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19247492", "title": "Olivier Zahm", "text": "Olivier Zahm\n\nOlivier Zahm (born 25 September 1963) is a French magazine editor, art critic, art director, curator, writer, and photographer He is the co-founder, owner, and current editor-in-chief of the bi-annual art and fashion magazine \"Purple.\" In addition to his innovative print publishing, he is a recognized pioneering cultural influence at the dawn of the electronic era during \"the Digital Revolution\". His early blogs garnered notoriety, and featured highly stylized photographs taken by him, that took his audience on daily tours of his fantasyland populated by the artists, intellectuals, designers, filmmakers, socialites, models and celebrities who regularly appeared in his magazine. His aesthetic has been described as anti-fashion, counterculture, and unfettered by the constraints of the mainstream publishing world. His online activity served as an early electronic precursor to popular social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. His magazine remains one of the only independent and privately owned publications of its kind. Created in the beginning of the \"1990s\" - it still remains a major reference for other alternative magazines today.\n\nOlivier Zahm was born and raised in Paris, France. He was the eldest of three children born to two university professors. His parents, who were both students at the time of his birth, raised Zahm and his other siblings in student quarters that were designed by Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouvé, located at in Antony.  Much of his early childhood was spent in academic settings, particularly- during the volatile period of civil unrest in France that broke out in May 1968\".\"  The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism, and traditional institutions, values and order. Many of the new and radical ideas surrounding Zahm, immersing his youth in tumultuous generational discord, stayed with him, shaping his views on art, philosophical ideas and lifestyle choices.  He leveraged his profound formative experience using it as a tool to build aspects and themes that remain prevalent in his personal and professional life in adulthood.  He told The New York Times in 2010 that he, “remembers summers spent vacationing in the South of France with his parents in a community of like minded free spirits” - who he labeled hippies. It was the \"1970s\", the decade of sex revolution and Zahm's parents were committed to free love\",\" nudism and polyamourous relationships. \"My parents had a lot of lovers, they had a lot of affairs. At the time, my parents were really part of this alternative movement in Paris but quite bourgeois too. It wasn't San Francisco or New York. It was the French way.\" Zahm’s love of magazines began when he was a teenager in the Paris suburbs. “We used to steal porn magazines in the bookstores and shops and look at them during school,” he says. “It was fun and secret. This is where my obsession for magazines comes from. Magazines used to reveal and give us access to sex, fashion, music and art. TV never did that, and books are mostly academic. Magazines were a symbol of freedom.”  He studied philosophy, history, semiotics and literature at the Sorbonne. His father, Claude, taught philosophy, and Zahm was on track to do the same, before realizing, at 25, that he preferred life outside “la tour d’ ivoire.” Zahm's youngest sister committed suicide in 1994 at the age of 20. \n\nBefore entering the world of fashion, Zahm worked as an art critic with widespread recognition for his work as a curator as well as his participation in over 150 exhibitions featuring international contemporary art. In responding to the superficial glamour of the 1980s, Zahm co-founded Purple Prose magazine. In the introduction of Purple Anthology, Zahm shares why he chose to create Purple Prose:\"\"We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that no one else supported, much less talked about. It would be a form of opposition of our own\".\" \n\nDuring the beginning of the 80’s Zahm started to observe and take an interest in the art world. He liked the notion of “being everywhere and on the move”, following art fairs, meeting artists, educating himself in the universe of contemporary art while immersing himself into its social landscape.  Zahm’s gift of being a charismatic intellectual and having an eye for contemporary art made itself apparent early on. He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time Art Forum, Art Flash, Texte Zur Kunst and Art Presse and introduced a then unknown Jeff Koons, Martin Kippenberger, and Larry Clark to the European art world.   He started traveling to the United States and Japan, realizing he could set up his own operation and work agenda, 24/7. He told I-D magazine in 2010: \n\n\"Freedom for me came from the art world because it was a place where I could meet the artists. I wanted to be a social critic. I was more interested in the category of intellectual, involving art and politics and writing sometimes. But I didn't want to be a writer necessarily, I just wanted to be part of an intellectual world.\"  In 1989, while working at Artforum,  Elien Fleiss, then a young gallery curator received a phone call from Zahm. She was looking for an art critic to write a manifesto against a journalist from a daily newspaper who she felt was writing insanities about contemporary art in general. Zahm agreed to do it, and that was the beginning of the encounter, which then became a love story. Their romance was short-lived, but their professional relationship was fruitful.  In 1994, they curated “The Winter of Love,” a hit show for the Museum of Modern Art in Paris that they later took to P.S. 1 in New York.\n\nIn May of  2017, Zahm published a book in collaboration with Donation Grau titled,' Une avant-garde sans avant-garde'.The book is a collection of Zahm’s most significant texts written during the last 30 years. It is above all a radical reading of art from the 1990s to the present. The anthology tries to decipher this chaotic, contradictory, oppressive, and ultra-creative period. The introductions that precede each chapter contextualize the selected texts, and develop the idea that the 1990s invented an avant-garde without an avant-garde, the issues of which are increasing and intensifying. \n\nZahm gravitated towards the idea of working with magazines from the conception of his career in art. In 1992 Zahm and his partner Elien Fleiss printed the first issue of Purple Prose, a Parisian literary art zine. Their goal was to create a new kind of space for artists to present their work and express their ideas; and to design a network through which people working in different disciplines, could easily access new information and each other and contributing to the early 90s alternative indie culture.  Zahm liked the idea of a color sharing the title with an art magazine. Dike Blair an American artist suggested the title Purple Prose in reference to the literary term in which a prose text is so extravagent, ornate, or flowery that it breaks the flow and draws excessive attention to itself.  Soon after the birth of Purple Prose, Zahm created spin-off publications like Purple Sexe, Purple Fiction and Purple Fashion. Zahm aimed at fusing together his two worlds, fashion and art, in creating Purple Fashion.  A typical issue featured interviews, articles and presentations covering a wide range of topics and disciplines which include; film and video, politics, fashion, architecture, sexuality, science, photography and music. Each issue was built around a loose theme which serves to create a link between subjects-past examples have been: Indian Summer, Violet Violence, Post-Sex. With its international correspondents and cutting-edge design, Purple Prose had the distinctive feel of a truly global art zine. The texts were written in roughly equal parts French and English, without translations.\n\nFor many years the magazine was associated with a realist esthetic, that of the new photography of the early 1990s- of photographers like Juergen Teller, Terry Richardson, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Mario Sorrenti.  From a visual standpoint, the magazine represented a break from 80s imagery (like Richard Avedon’s photography for Versace, for example.) From an artistic standpoint, the artists from the early 1990s were raising up against art as a capitalist fetish; they were aligning themselves with the artistic social and political practices of the 1970s-- those of performance, video art, Fluxus, and the conceptual and minimalist avant-garde. The magazine was an integral part of this burgeoning context, which included the deconstruction of fashion by Martin Margiela and Comme des Garçsons; the return of subtle political art, with that of Felix Gonzalez- Torres, Maurizio Cattelan, and Philippe Parreno, among others; photography of Juergen Teller; and Harmony Korine and Larry Clark’s independent filmmaking. \n\nFor its 25th anniversary issue, Purple celebrated the artists and models who incarnated the spirit of the magazine through their style, attitude, and personality: Cindy Sherman, Wolfgang Tillmans, Chloe Savigny, Richard Prince, Paul McCarthy, Susan Cianciolo , Maurizio Cattelan, and more. It was the first time the magazine printed multiple covers for one issue. 25 different covers showed  25 Purple icons. It was also the first time purple distributed hard-cover magazines instead of the traditional soft-cover print. He described in the editions Edito: “It’s been years now that younger generations don’t use magazines to express themselves — at least not the way we did back in 1992. Social media now generally satisfy the need for images, contacts, and creativity. Publishing a magazine has become so expensive… An actual print object like Purple is a luxury item, which is why new alternative magazines don’t last more than a few years, are often bought, or simply disappear. Doing a luxury magazine today is one of the paradoxes of the Instagram era, when such things cost nothing… A magazine is not an ego trip… It’s a collective work by a group of creative people who believe in the artistic value of the print media and share a similar vision. (Thanks to all of them!) Every image, every single text, the choice of paper, the layout, even the choice of typefaces matters. Everything matters… Purple is made to last. Purple is made to capture a moment every season… In this period of global Internet obsession and digital amnesia, I think that means something\"In 2017 Purple moved their US based headquarters and offices from New York City to Los Angeles. \n\nIn the year 2000, Serge July, the founder and editor-in-chief of French national newspaper Libération hired Olivier Zahm to launch Liberation Style, an occasional Saturday supplement to the main paper. 15 issues were published every season until 2005. \n\nIn 2009 Chanel launched its very first magazine: 31 Rue Cambon. Chanel’s goal was to combine sales and information. Karl Lagerfeld delegated the artistic direction of the magazine which was not available to the public, but instead only the private cliental of Chanel to Zahm \n\nIn 2018 Zahm designed a fanzine for Gucci’s FW2019 collection presented at Le Palace in Paris. The magazine was the 14th issue of Le Palace Magazine. \n\nZahm credited Lagerfeld for reigniting his sentiment for taking photos in 2005.  Zahm told WWD in an interview dedicated to Purple’s 25th Anniversary: “He (Lagerfeld) was buying these little digital cameras at the time, Sony Cyber-shots, a little pocket-size, flat, digital camera. He had a pile of them on his table and said: “Take this, if you’ll use it.” We had this long discussion about photography and I said, “Karl how can you want to be a photographer when you were friends with Helmut Newton because, me, I have Juergen Teller in my generation and I haven’t been able to do photography since I’ve known him, because he’s the best.” And he said: “Olivier, shut up. You don’t understand, photography is not about getting the right picture, it’s about documenting your everyday life. Remember Warhol, do you think he was a good photographer? He always had a camera on him. Do like Warhol, do like me: Don’t let a day go by without taking a picture.”In 2009, he began documenting his late-night partying escapades in high-contrast black-and-white photographs which appeared on Purple Diary, a notorious photo blog that would become the seed for a full Purple website. He has had shows of his photographic work at Half Gallery in New York, Colette in Paris , Leadapron in Los Angeles and The Last Gallery in Tokyo. \n\nIn addition to documenting his personal life on social media platform he continues to shoot many editorials and campaigns for various brands including Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Uniqlo,  Agent Provocateur, and magazines including Lui, Vogue Russia, and Kadewe among others. \n\nIn 2014, Zahm partnered with Rizzoli published O.Z. Diary, a cosmopolitan 500-page photo diary exposing the lifestyles of the creative elite through a series of intimate, autobiographical photographs. Glenn O'Brien contributed various texts for the book.\n\nZahm has a son, Balthus, with designer Natacha Ramsay-Levi, and a daughter, Asia, with writer Anna Dubosc. He currently is in a relationship with creative director and former model Amanda Wall. He splits his time between Los Angeles and Paris.\n\n"}

Martins was a principal dancer with the Royal Danish Ballet and with the New York City Ballet, where he joined George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and John Taras as balletmaster in 1981. He retired from dancing in 1983, having achieved the rank of danseur noble, becoming Co-Ballet Master-In-Chief with Robbins. From 1990 until January 2018, he was solely responsible for artistic leadership of City Ballet. \n\nIn December 2017, Martins took a leave of absence from the New York City Ballet following an allegation of sexual misconduct made against him. Five City Ballet dancers later told the \"New York Times\" that Martins had verbally or physical abused them; Martins denied engaging in any misconduct. Martins retired from the City Ballet on January 1, 2018. A subsequent joint inquiry commissioned by the City Ballet and its School of American Ballet \"did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence\" made against Martins.\n\nMartins was born and raised in Copenhagen, Denmark. His parents were Børge Martins, an engineer, and Tove Christa Ornberg, a pianist. His maternal aunt and uncle, Leif and Elna Ornberg, members of the Royal Danish Ballet, started teaching him ballroom combinations when he was five years of age; when he applied to ballet school, however, he was the subject of discrimination because his aunt and uncle had been Nazi sympathizers. It was his older sisters who originally tried-out for the Royal Ballet of Denmark at the age of seven. When they did, he was sitting in the waiting room reading a Donald Duck comic book. They were denied admittance. The asked Peter to \"point his foot\". He did especially well and was admitted.\n\nMartins began his ballet training in 1953 with the Royal Danish Ballet. He joined the corps de ballet in 1965, and was promoted to soloist in 1967. \n\nMartins left Denmark in 1970 and became a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet (NYCB), though he had been performing as a guest artist since 1967. Martins danced a wide variety of roles, but is most known for the titular role in \"Apollo\" and the Cavalier in Balanchine's \"Nutcracker\". He danced frequently with Suzanne Farrell. However, he terminated her employment with the NYCB in 1993; she went on to found her own company, which disbanded in 2017.\n\nMartins retired from dancing in 1983, becoming Co-Ballet Master-In-Chief alongside Jerome Robbins, and assumed the job of sole Balletmaster-in-Chief in 1990. Martins was Balanchine's personal choice of successor. However, early in his career as balletmaster, Martins faced criticism for perceived deviations from Balanchine's style. Martins also served as the artistic director and chairman of faculty of the School of American Ballet, the training division of the NYCB and the venue through which it receives most of its dancers. From 1990 until January 2018, he was solely responsible for artistic leadership of City Ballet. He was the subject of the 1991 documentary \"Peter Martins: A Dancer\". In 2005 his salary was $619,000, and in 2008 he received $699,000 in pay and benefits.\n\nMartins regularly choreographed new works for both companies. His first piece was \"Calcium Light Night\", set to music by Charles Ives, which premiered in 1977. His more recent pieces include \"Octet\", \"Friandises\", Stabat Mater and the full-length ballets \"The Sleeping Beauty\", \"Swan Lake\", and \"Romeo \"+\" Juliet\". He also choreographed the Barbie movies \"Barbie in the Nutcracker\" and \"Barbie of Swan Lake\". In 2000, Martins, along with talent scout Irene Diamond, founded the New York Choreographic Institute. \n\nIn December 2017, an investigation was announced by New York City Ballet into accusations by dancers within the company of physical and sexual assault by Martins, and using his power to obtain sexual favors, dating back to 1983. One of his accusers, Wilhelmina Frankfurt, a former New York City Ballet ballerina and later a dance educator, said: \"Am I a victim of Martins abuse? Yes. Was it sexual? Yes. Was it consensual? No [...] It was scary. One incident that occurred [...] He [...] pulled me into his dressing room and, exposed himself to me. [And one incident is] so big I don’t think I can talk about it.\"\n\nMartins took a leave of absence that month from both the New York City Ballet and its School of the American Ballet, after the allegations came to light, and in January 2018 he retired. Martins denied any misconduct. A two-month investigation of the New York City Ballet and its School of the American Ballet \"did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence both made in the anonymous letter and reported in the media regarding Mr. Martins\". This was not a criminal investigation and was conducted by NYCB, Inc.'s own attorneys.\n\nHe received a Dance Magazine Award and Cue's Golden Apple Award in 1977. An Award for Arts and Culture, City of New York, 1981. The title of Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1983. An award of Merit, Philadelphia Art Alliance, 1985. And a Liberty Award, 1986. He was nominated for the 1986 Tony Award for Best Choreographer for \"Song & Dance\". Martins is a champion of contemporary music, working often with composer John Adams. His autobiography, \"Far From Denmark\" was published in 1982. Martins was named Man of the Year by the Danish American Society, 1980. His exercise regimen, titled \"NYCB Workout\" and designed with the New York Sports Club, first appeared in book form in 1997, with a DVD and a sequel produced later. Martins was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nMartins had a longterm romantic relationship with Heather Watts during her career as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet. John Clifford, a principal dancer and choreographer under George Balanchine, recalled \"I saw him pick her up and slam her into a cement wall.\" In ballerina Gelsey Kirkland's book \"Dancing on My Grave\" (1986), she describes Martins dragging Watts up and down a flight of stairs.\n\nHe was first married to Lisa La Cour, a ballerina he danced with at the Royal Ballet of Denmark. He had a child with her, Nilas. They met while they were both with the Royal Ballet of Denmark and after their divorce, he was a guest-artist with the New York City Ballet and eventually defected to America to dance with the latter company full-time. Nilas eventually followed his father to America, to New York City and to the New York City Ballet. \n\nIn July 1992, Martins was arrested and held for five hours after his 28-year-old wife of seven months, New York City Ballet principal ballerina Darci Kistler, phoned the police for help. His wife filed an affidavit accusing him of assaulting her, pushing and slapping her, and cutting and bruising her arms and legs and continuing to hit her after she fell under his attack. He was charged with third-degree assault (a misdemeanor). Kistler dropped the charges a few days later, saying she preferred to resolve the matter without the court's intervention. When she next performed in a ballet two days later, she reportedly wore heavy makeup to conceal bruises she had suffered. Several people who knew the two well claimed it wasn't the first time Martins had hit her. Peter Wolff, a member of the school’s board of directors, said that the assault charge was \"a personal matter\", would not affect Martins’ career, and that it had \"nothing to do with his competency or his support in the ballet community.\"\n\nIn 2011, Martins was charged with DWI in Yonkers. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of driving while impaired. In December 2017, Martins was arrested after a three-car crash and charged with drunk driving, refusal to take a breath test, and backing unsafely. He pleaded not guilty in Ardsley Village Court, and his license was suspended. \n\nKistler and Martins have one daughter, Talicia Tove Martins, born June 13, 1996. He has a son, Nilas Martins, who also was a member of NYCB before himself retiring. \n\nIn July 2007, his 40-year-old son Nilas was arrested for possession of cocaine. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to 40 hours of community service, to undergo drug and alcohol evaluation, and was fined $295. \n\nIn July 2017, his 21-year-old daughter Talicia was arrested for committing burglaries at several businesses in Maine with her 20-year-old friend Jacob Flanagan, stealing thousands of dollars, and for being under the influence of drugs and alcohol. She had already been arrested in June 2017 for drug possession in New York, where she was caught with crack cocaine, heroin and a hypodermic needle in her parents’ Manhattan apartment on West End Avenue. Talicia was presented as a debutante at Le Bal des Débutantes, a debutante ball in Paris, in 2012.\n\n"}

{"id": "8784196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8784196", "title": "Samuel Soal", "text": "Samuel Soal\n\nSamuel George Soal (1889–1975) — known as S.G. Soal — was a British mathematician and parapsychologist. He was charged with fraudulent production of data in his work in parapsychology.\n\nSoal graduated with first class honours in mathematics from Queen Mary College (then East London College) in 1910. After service in World War I, in which he suffered shelling at the Battle of the Somme, he lectured in mathematics at Oxford in the Army School of Education, before returning as a lecturer to Queen Mary College, University of London. In 1944, he was awarded the D.Sc. from Queen Mary College, where he continued to lecture in mathematics until his retirement in 1954. In 1947, he presented the Ninth Myers Memorial Lecture to the Society for Psychical Research, largely on the topic of the card-guessing experiments he had been recently conducting. He served as president of the Society for the years 1950-1952. He was a Fulbright Scholar in 1951, for which he journeyed to the USA to work with J. G. Pratt at Duke University. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship in Psychology at Birkbeck College, University of London for the years 1954-1958. Thereafter, he moved permanently to Caernarvonshire, Wales, where he had routinely holidayed for each year over the past few decades, and where he died in 1975.\n\nDuring this time, Soal demonstrated a personal as well as scientific interest in psychical research, becoming a member of the Society for Psychical Research in October 1922. He was partly moved to make his first parapsychological studies following the death of one of his brothers in the First World War. Like many of the bereaved at the time, he made enquiries of mediums concerning communication with the departed; but conducted his observations with a scientific approach. His observations surprised conventional understanding even within psychical research. Most especially, he reported a case of apparently precognitive telepathy of a situation yet to occur for a long-forgotten, but still living, friend of his, Gordon Davis. This suggested, in line with earlier speculations, that the statements of mediums had nothing to do with \"spirits of the departed,\" but only knowledge gained - by telepathy, if need be - from the sitters themselves. What was particularly surprising was that this information was yet to be learned by Soal himself. \n\nSoal himself practised automatic writing at this time, and pseudonymously authored a much-discussed paper on the scripts he produced, which purported to be authored by the deceased Oscar Wilde. He later himself declaimed the evidentiality of these scripts, and considered that they were largely the product of cryptomnesia. \n\nSoal moved to a more statistical and controlled approach, firstly by conducting an experiment in which up to a few hundred persons participated at one time. This involved Soal and a small group of agents enacting a scenario, playing with a certain object, reciting a poem, and so on, which the participants, situated across Great Britain and other countries, were required, at the same time, to attempt to imaginally perceive. The French psychical researcher Rene Warcollier contributed some trials to this research, via his pool of selected participants. While some striking correspondences were obtained, these did not hold up to Soal's statistical scrutiny, and the report of the research commenced with the note that the findings were \"entirely negative\".\n\nFollowing popular and academic reports of extra-sensory perception by card-guessing, Soal again changed his research processes and commenced a series of card-guessing experiments in telepathy, including trials canvassed over radio and via the literary magazine \"John O'London's Weekly\". From 1936-1941, he performed over 120,000 trials of card-guessing with 160 participants without ever being able to report a significant finding. In review, he scathingly offered the opinion that telepathy was a merely American phenomenon; he was described by the US researcher, J. B. Rhine, as one of his most harsh and unfair critics.\n\nNext however, upon the hypothesis of Whately Carington, a fellow researcher within the Society for Psychical Research, Soal was able to report a significant displacement effect in his data for two of his earlier participants. Carington and Soal co-authored a paper on the effect, published in \"Nature\" in 1940. Soal thereupon sought to confirm these observations with new studies with these participants: Basil Shackleton (a celebrated London portrait photographer, later to become associated with the \"Grape Cure\" for cancer) and Gloria Stewart.\n\nThese studies, conducted in collaboration with K. M. Goldney and F. Bateman, were widely reviewed as among the most challenging proofs of precognition and telepathy. Not only were the significances of the studies - in terms of the correspondence between ESP guesses and random targets - extraordinary, the procedures appeared to allow no alternative hypothesis. There was also the testimony of 21 prominent observers who, individually, monitored Soal's work with Shackleton, that they were satisfied with the conditions, and could conceive of no means by which the results could be obtained by normal means other than ESP. Many leading academics, including C. D. Broad and Sir Cyril Burt, were persuaded, largely or partly on the basis of these reports, to lend academic support to psi-related ideas and research.\n\nArguments against Soal's data have, however, been raised ever since their publication. These proposed \"unconscious whispering\" (from the experimenter to the ‘agent,’ and then from the ‘agent’ to the ‘percipient’); the inapplicability of probability theory to science (as offered by George Spencer-Brown); and collusion between the ‘agent’ to the ‘percipient’. Outright fraud was also advanced (by George R. Price) and prominently canvassed in the American journal \"Science\". Soal attempted to rebut the critiques.\n\nIn 1978, it was reported that Soal evidently appeared to reuse some target sequences from an earlier test in a later one, often reversing, omitting or inserting one or more digits into the sequence before reusing them. It was considered suspicious that a disproportionate number of \"hits\" occurred on the digits that appeared to interrupt some of the reused sequences. Betty Marwick discovered that Soal had not used the method of random selection of numbers as he had claimed. Marwick showed that there had been manipulation of the score sheets \"all the experiments reported by Soal had thereby been discredited.\" \n\nFor two of the 40 sessions with Shackleton, it was claimed that it was \"virtually conclusive\" that this practice amounted to fraud; and fraud in another six sessions was considered to be \"suggestive only\". Soal was not able to replicate his earlier work while continuing to conduct telepathy experiments, at the University of London, after his retirement, from 1954 to 1958. During these years, however, he conducted a long series of apparently successful experiments with a pair of young brothers, as participants, in Northern Wales. This work was immediately and severely criticised on methodological grounds; simulations of the study suggesting that the boys, with their family, could have been successfully undetected in using a code in association with an ultrasonic whistle, perhaps blown by a secreted pump.\n\nIt was not until the 1970s, when Soal was already senile and no longer able to respond, that his data were finally deemed insupportable by his fellow parapsychologists. These concerned largely statistical challenges offered by members of the SPR on the basis of several novel analyses they conducted by computer searches of the data from the 1941-1943 study with Shackleton.\n\nThe psychologist C. E. M. Hansel has documented the fraud of Soal and the flaws in his experiments.\n\nDistinguished at this time for his contribution to studies of mediumship, Soal was the chosen author for a survey of \"Spiritualism\", in 55 pages, for the first 1935 publication of the \"Dictionary of the Occult\".\n\nDuring 1921-1922 Soal carried out a series of séances with the medium Blanche Cooper who claimed to have contacted the spirit of a soldier Gordon Davis and revealed the house he had lived in. In 1925, his report about these séances was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. However, it was discovered that fraud was involved with the case. Davis was alive and Soal altered the records of the sittings after checking out the house. Researcher Melvin Harris noted that:\n\nAccording to magician Bob Couttie, Soal's co-workers knew that he had fiddled the results but were kept quiet with threats of libel suits.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23645587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23645587", "title": "School speech (First Amendment)", "text": "School speech (First Amendment)\n\nThe issue of school speech or curricular speech as it relates to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution has been the center of controversy and litigation since the mid-20th century. The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech applies to students in the public schools. In the landmark decision \"Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\", the U.S. Supreme Court formally recognized that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate\".\n\nThe core principles of \"Tinker\" remain unaltered, but are tempered by several important decisions, including \"Bethel School District v. Fraser, Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier\", and \"Morse v. Frederick\". Despite respect for the legitimate educational interests of school officials, the Supreme Court has not abandoned Tinker; it continues to recognize the basis precept of \"Tinker\" that viewpoint-specific speech restrictions are an egregious violation of the First Amendment. In \"Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia\", the Supreme Court declared: \"Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional\". \"Rosenberger\" held that denial of funds to a student organization on the sole basis that the funds were used to publish a religiously oriented student newspaper was an unconstitutional violation of the right of free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. Accordingly, for other on-campus speech that is neither obscene, vulgar, lewd, indecent, or plainly offensive under \"Fraser\" nor school-sponsored under \"Hazelwood\" nor advocating illegal drugs at a school-sponsored event under \"Frederick\", Tinker applies limiting the authority of schools to regulate the speech, whether on or off-campus, unless it would materially and substantially disrupt classwork and discipline in the school.\n\nIn \"Tinker\", several students were suspended for wearing black armbands that protested against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn \"Fraser\", a high school student was disciplined following his speech to a school assembly at which he nominated a fellow student for a student elective office. The speech contained sexual innuendos, but not obscenities. The Supreme Court found that school officials could discipline the student. In doing so, it recognized that \"the process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not confined to books, the curriculum, and the civics class; schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized social order\". Recognizing that one of the important purposes of public education is to inculcate the habits and manners of civility as valued conducive both to happiness and to the practice of self-government, the Supreme Court emphasized that \"consciously or otherwise, teachers—and indeed the older students—demonstrate the appropriate form of civil discourse and political expression by their conduct and deportment in and out of class\". Under the \"Fraser\" standard, school officials look not merely to the reasonable risk of disruption—the \"Tinker\" standard—but would also balance the freedom of a student's speech rights against the school's interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior. Schools have discretion to curtail not only obscene speech, but speech that is vulgar, lewd, indecent, or plainly offensive. \n\nThe Hazelwood School District case applies the principles set forth in Fraser to curricular matters. In \"Hazelwood\", the Supreme Court upheld a school's decision to censor certain articles in the school newspaper which was produced as part of the school's journalism curriculum. Echoing \"Fraser\", the Supreme Court observed that \"[a] school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with 'its basic educational mission'...even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school\". School authorities and educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\"\"\n\n\"Morse v. Frederick\" blends \"Fraser\" and \"Hazelwood\", applying them to a school-sanctioned event or activity. While students were along a public street in front of school watching the Olympic Torch Relay pass through, Frederick unfurled a banner bearing the phrase: \"BONG 4 JESUS\". The banner was in plain view of other students. The high school principal seized the banner and suspended Frederick because the banner was perceived to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The Supreme Court held that a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. Not only was a school activity involved, but the banner's promotion of illegal drugs was contrary to the school's policy or mission to prevent student drug abuse.\n\nThe right of free speech is not itself absolute: the Court has consistently upheld regulations as to time, place, and manner of speech, provided that they are \"reasonable\". In applying this \"reasonableness\" test to regulations limiting student expression, the Court has recognized that the age and maturity of students is an important factor to be considered.\n\nIn the school context, the United States Supreme Court has identified three major relevant considerations:\n\nEach of these considerations has given rise to a separate mode of analysis, and in \"Morse v. Frederick\" the Court implied that any one of these may serve as an independent basis for restricting student speech.\n\nThe problem of disruption is perhaps the most fundamental issue addressed by the courts in student free speech cases.\n\nThe second major question addressed by the courts is closely related to, but nevertheless distinct from, the question of disruption. This is the question of speech which is offensive to prevailing community standards by reason of being vulgar, lewd, or indecent speech. Courts have held that offensiveness is a question of whether speech is plainly offensive in terms of sexual content or implication, rather than simply expressing ideas and beliefs considered offensive by some or most students or members of the community. \"See Saxe v. State College Area School District\". In \"Bethel School District v. Fraser\", the Supreme Court recognized the special responsibility of the public schools to inculcate moral values and to teach students the boundaries of socially acceptable behavior. It therefore permitted a public school to discipline a student for making sexually suggestive remarks in an address to a school assembly, even though the remarks were not \"obscene\" in the traditional sense.\n\nThe ability to regulate \"inappropriate\" speech has been found to be especially important in situations where the student speech may have the appearance of being sponsored or endorsed by the school.\n\nIn \"Bethel\", the Court held that the offensiveness test does not apply to off-campus speech. \n\nThe third major area of concern addressed in student free speech cases is whether a particular instance of student speech may be viewed as impairing the school's ability to carry out its educational mission. This concern arises where the speech in question occurs in connection with a school-sponsored or school-controlled activity but is inconsistent with a legitimate pedagogical concern. In such circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has found that student speech may be regulated. For example, in \"Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier\", it held that a school may exercise control over the content of a student newspaper when it attempts to address issues of divorce and teenage pregnancy; in \"Morse v. Frederick\", it permitted a school to exercise control over the words displayed on a large banner at a school-sponsored event, when those words convey a message promoting the use of illegal drugs.\n\nOne of these factors is whether the activity sought to be controlled is \"pure speech\", or sufficiently related to the expression of ideas to fall under the umbrella of the First Amendment. \"Pure speech\" does not need to involve words but is generally represented by symbols or actions.\n\nThe focus of the protected speech activity, whether \"pure speech\" or not, may affect the propriety of regulation by school officials.\n\n"}

Having used spaced repetition software such as Anki in the past, they created a website that allowed students to write crowdsourced quizzes in a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) format.\n\nAs of 2015, Synap had no revenues, but the founders were exploring adding a premium version for paying users.\n\nThe first incarnation of Synap operated under the name 'MyCQs', which was released as a native iOS application and website in 2012, and initially gained popularity amongst UK medical students\n\nDuring this time, CEO James Gupta was recruited as the Chief Technology Officer for JumpIn, a student-focused taxi booking and sharing app. The company was acquired by taxi firm Addison Lee in 2014, after which James returned to focus on MyCQs.\n\nIn 2014, MyCQs received funding and mentoring from Jisc, an education technology charity, and received a scholarship from The University of Leeds.\n\nIn 2015, the team shifted focus by integrating more algorithms based on educational psychology research, and started to describe itself as a 'personalised learning' platform. This also led to the company being renamed Synap\n\nIn August 2015, Synap launched an equity crowdfunding campaign on Crowdcube.\n\nSynap uses the concept of spaced repetition to send new content to users based on what they need to practice the most. In this sense, Synap is similar to existing spaced repetition platforms such as Anki and SuperMemo, though notably it does not support the creation of flashcards, which are more commonly associated with spaced repetition.\nSynap was originally developed on Facebook's Parse platform. In January 2016, Facebook announced that Parse would be closing down, and advised developers to migrate their apps to other services. As of March 2016, Synap has been hosted on Amazon Web Services, using the newly open-sourced Parse Server, which itself uses Node.js. The website is developed in Ember.js, and uses a MongoDB database, making Synap an example of full stack JavaScript development.\n\nSynap has been featured in The Oxford Public Health Magazine.\n\nIn December 2015, Synap was listed as one of 10 British AI companies to look out for, by Business Insider.\n\n\n"}

TV Pendidikan was fully owned, produced and operated by the Educational Technology Division of the Ministry of Education of Malaysia and it showed programmes for various school subjects. The motto for TV Pendidikan was \"Teknologi Untuk Pendidikan Bestari\" (Technology For Smart Education).\n\nDuring its heyday, TV Pendidikan does not air advertisements during programme break times, it is only aired after the end of programmes. Advertising aired on TVP were primarily from government agencies. Prior to airing on TV9, the network was previously aired on RTM from 1972 to 1999 and on Astro from 2000 to 2006.\n\nIn October 2018, Education Minister Maszlee Malik announced that TV Pendidikan would be relaunched after 10 years of absence.\n\nTV Pendidikan was officially launched on 19 June 1972 by the Second Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak. It was later expanded to Sabah and Sarawak on 30 August 1976. On April 1998, the then Information Minister, Mohamed Rahmat announced the privatization of TV Pendidikan.\n\nFrom 3 January 2007 until 31 December 2008, TV Pendidikan was aired on Malaysia's terrestrial channel, TV9. Previously, TV Pendidikan was aired through Astro's Channel 28 (from 2000 to 2002), Channel 13 (from 2002 to 2006) and Malaysia's terrestrial television station RTM TV1 and RTM TV2 from 1972 to 1999.\n\nTV Pendidikan was on RTM TV1 from Monday to Thursday in two sessions; i.e. from 7:20 am to 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Daytime transmissions on TV1 and TV3 which was introduced in 1994 has caused it to broadcast only on TV2. Also, the closing time was moved to 3:00 pm.\n\nWhen TV Pendidikan moved to Astro in 2000, Astro's Channel 28 aired two separate networks. TV Pendidikan aired from Monday to Thursday 9.00 am to 5.00 pm. while Animal Planet occupied the rest of the time. As of January 2012, Animal Planet airs on Astro Channel 556.\n\nTV Pendidikan moved to Channel 13 in January 2002 where they aired two separate networks, which was TV Pendidikan itself and TechTV, a channel that features news and shows about computer, technology and the Internet. TV Pendidikan broadcast times were not changed, i.e., Monday to Thursday from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm., while TechTV occupied the rest of the time.\n\nSince 1 March 2006, all G4techTV (which is now known as only G4) programmes were shown on Astro TVIQ, Astro's educational channel while channel 13 only shows educational programmes. After some time, G4 programmes were no longer airing on Astro TVIQ. Astro also no longer carries TV Pendidikan on its platform since 1 January 2007.\n\nTV Pendidikan's broadcasting hour was from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every Monday to Thursday for every week of the year, except during public holidays. The programme's episodes are changed every two weeks. For a time since 2007, TV Pendidikan placed a permanent logo at the top-left of the screen and aired simultaneously with the TV9 logo at the top-right only during 4 hours of programming.\n\nTV Pendidikan ceased broadcasting on 31 December 2008. It was later replaced by EDUWEBTV.\n\nEduwebTV is the official webtv of the Ministry of Education, Malaysia which has been introduced since 1 March 2008. It's the first project of its kind in the world! Bridging the digital divide is perhaps the most important factor in ensuring that education reaches every fraction of society. EduwebTV is consist of 4 channels, which are Berita (news), Rancangan Khas (special programme), Kurikulum (curriculum) and Panduan (guidances). The ministry embarked on EduwebTV to replace and to improve the delivery of TV Pendidikan, which was broadcast on TV. It is aimed at addressing the limitation of using educational TV where teachers are unable to fit in the school period.\n\nTeachers nowadays are able to apply relevant video clippings to reinforce their lessons in the classroom. This can make the learning process are more exciting and up to date with current circumstances instead of make students understand more about the knowledge content as they can see it.\n\nEduwebTV also promotes self-learning among students. Students can access the videos and the day's homework from the website by logging on with a password created by the teacher. The students can hand over their homeworks via email or using conventional exercise book.\n\nThe channel covers nine subjects for secondary school:\n\nFor primary school, the program covers:\n\nIn addition, TV Pendidikan also broadcast special shows such as:\n\nDuring its time at TV9, it had also presented its programmes for TV Pendidikan, such as:\n\n\n"}

The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath.\n\nThe department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK. Since then, like many information science departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in cheminformatics, educational informatics, health informatics, information retrieval, information systems, knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the \"Journal of Information Science\" devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs.\n\nThe school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every Research Assessment Exercise since the running of the first exercise in 1986.

Before moving to Las Vegas, Damania was a practicing hospitalist (internal medicine physician specializing in patients admitted to the hospital) at Stanford University for 10 years. He also has been writing and performing comedic raps as ZDoggMD, an internet celebrity known for his music videos, parodies, and comedy sketches about medical issues as well as systemic issues with healthcare.\n\nDamania grew up in Clovis, California, with his parents, both Parsi doctors who immigrated from India, and two siblings. He attended Clovis West High School before going on to receive an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, where he studied music and molecular biology. While there he completed a research thesis in a genetics lab on integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesion pathways in the \"Drosophila melanogaster\" model with James Fristrom.\n\nDamania attended medical school at UCSF and graduated in 1999. His time in school was marked by a series of pursuits that combined comedy and medicine: he streamed medical comedy routines for a startup called Medschool.com, and performed medical based standup routines for drug companies, hospitals and other medical organizations. He also gave the commencement speech at UCSF at his graduation, which has had tens of thousands of views on YouTube, and made NPR's list of top commencement speeches of all time.\n\nOne of two graduating students chosen to speak at the commencement ceremony he delivered a satirical speech to an audience that included Nobel Prize winner J. Michael Bishop, and that has since garnered tens of thousands of views on YouTube.\n\nAfter completing his residency at Stanford University, Damania stayed on at Palo Alto Medical Foundation for ten years as a hospitalist, where he received the Russell Lee Award for Clinical Teaching while simultaneously maintaining a side hobby performing stand-up comedy for medical audiences worldwide.\n\nDisheartened by the traditional fee for service model on which the American medical system is based, Damania became increasingly frustrated with his work. With the encouragement of Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos.com, Damania began writing, performing and filming musical parodies about the frustrations of work as a doctor, posting them on YouTube to immediate success. He developed a persona called ZDoggMD fashioned as a gangsta rapper who was upset about popular misconceptions of healthcare in the US.\n\nDamania gave a presentation called \"Are Zombie Doctors Taking Over America?\" at TEDMED 2013. In it he outlines the lingering problems of the US healthcare system and how he has re-conceived it at Turntable Health into a patient-centered organization dedicated to preventative care. His speech was called one of the best of the conference. US News and World Report called his critique of American healthcare \"scalpel-sharp\" and \"at once discomfiting and comic\".\n\nSince beginning work on the clinic, Damania has been named one of the \"top 14 people to watch in 2014\" by \"Las Vegas Weekly\", and has been profiled in \"The Atlantic Monthly\", Xconomy, \"Wired\", Venture Beat, Gizmodo, MSNBC and USA Today. Turntable Health was also named \"by far the most exciting healthcare startup\" and \"revolutionary\" by The Next Web.\n\nZDoggMD is an alias of Damania, and under the name he makes music videos, parodies, and comedy sketches about contemporary medical issues and working in the medical field.\n\nZdoggMD has been featured or interviewed in several medical-based, and other types of well-known publications including The Atlantic Monthly, TechCrunch, Radio Rounds, The Guardian, Mental floss, ReachMD, ScienceBlogs, ACP Hospitalist, and Today's Hospitalist, among others.\n\nHis website won the 2010 Best New Medical Weblog at the 2010 Medical Weblog Awards sponsored by Epocrates and Lenovo. His videos feature a rotating cast of several characters, also practicing doctors, including, most often, Dr. Harry, a pediatrician, and Doc Quixote, Dr. Diego and others. He often collaborates musically with Southern California DJ and Producer samix, who produced the album Midriff Music by Josh Martinez which won the category \"Best Rap Recording\" award at the 2005 Western Canadian Music Awards. He is also currently collaborating with Devin Moore, a composer, bassist in the band “Rabbit!” and member of Downtown Project’s music development team in Las Vegas.\n\nZdoggMD's work has been called \"entertainment that might save your life\", he has been labeled \"the jolliest doctor on the West Coast\", and \"a genuine doctor who uses YouTube as a creativity outlet to teach people about things like safe sex, delivering bad news, stayin' healthy on vacation and hemorrhoids.\" His videos cover topics such as ulcers, testicular exams, Caribbean medical schools, stool transplants, overworked doctors, the role of hospitalists in medicine versus other specialists, vaccine controversies, healthcare in the US, CPR, television doctors, and being on call during the holidays.\n\nIn 2012 Tony Hsieh invited Damania to visit Las Vegas, where Hsieh was in the process of investing $350 million of his own money in a project he hoped would revitalize Downtown Las Vegas (The Downtown Project). He was successful in convincing Damania to quit his job as Physician at Stanford and move his family to Nevada. Hsieh tasked Damania with \"fixing Healthcare in Vegas\". Once in Las Vegas, Damania continued to produce videos both as ZDoggMD and himself while working on opening Turntable Health.\n\nWhile conceiving of the idea for Turntable Health, Damania met Rushika Fernandopulle, co-founder and CEO of a Boston-based startup called Iora Health, who had become well known for his vision to rebuild healthcare by removing fee-for-service episodic payments from primary care, focusing on prevention, and using a membership model. The two forged a partnership.\n\nTurntable Health, a direct primary care clinic in Downtown Las Vegas, was the result of their collaboration. It was based on a patient focused, preventative model that subscribers could either pay a monthly fee for, or have as part of their coverage in some cases. The clinic opened in December, 2013, and was an integral part of Hsieh’s Downtown Project of revitalizing Las Vegas and re-visualizing urban spaces. Turntable Health shut down as of January 31, 2017.\n\n"}
