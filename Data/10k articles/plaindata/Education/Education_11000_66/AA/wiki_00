He was a senior lecturer in the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) and is a visiting fellow at the University of Buckingham.\n\nPeiser established the Cambridge Conference Network in 1997. Peiser acknowledges that he is \"not a climate scientist\" and has \"never claimed to be one.\" His interest as a social anthropologist, is in \"how climate change is portrayed as a potential disaster and how we respond to that.\"\n\nAs an outspoken climate change sceptic, Peiser became director of the newly established UK lobbying group Global Warming Policy Foundation in 2009. He serves as co-editor of the journal, \"Energy & Environment\" and is a regular contributor to Canada's \"National Post\".\n\nBorn of German parents in Haifa, Israel, in 1957, Peiser's family soon returned to Germany. He grew up in Frankfurt and \"spent the first 35 years of his life\" in Germany.\n\nPeiser studied political science, English, and sports science at Frankfurt University, receiving a doctorate in cultural studies (\"Kulturwissenschaften\") from that institution in 1993, for an examination of the history, archaeology and natural history of Greek problems at the time of the ancient Olympic Games.\n\nDrawn by \"concerns about nuclear energy and its waste\", he reportedly was involved with the German Green Party while a student.\n\nUpon completing his doctoral degree, Peiser moved to Liverpool, England, to take up a position as lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University.\n\nPeiser was previously employed as an historian of ancient sport at the University of Frankfurt. He listed his research interests at LJMU as the effects of environmental change and catastrophic events on contemporary thought and societal evolution; climate change and science communication; international climate policy; the risks posed by near-Earth objects and satellites and the environmental and socio-economic impacts of physical activity.\n\nIn 1997 Peiser established the Cambridge Conference Network, an email-based discussion group for a conference of the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies about Bronze Age catastrophes. Over time the network began to focus on discussion on climate change and was renamed CCNet (active from 1997 to 2006), to provide a platform for \"the minority of people who are climate (change) sceptics or have doubts about the prevailing views.\"\n\nPeiser acknowledges that he is \"not a climate scientist\" and has \"never claimed to be one.\" His interest as a social anthropologist, is in \"how climate change is portrayed as a potential disaster and how we respond to that.\"\n\nPeiser argued that he is against alarmist, hysterical doomsday scenarios and catastrophic apocalyptic cult thinking but is not \"a climate-change sceptic (2008).\" \"Most scientists do seem to accept that there is an effect of CO2 on climate; the big question is how large and dangerous it will be in future. Personally, I'm also sceptical about the doomsday scenarios.\"\n\nAmerican astrophysicist and science communicator, Neil deGrasse Tyson described (2008) the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet) as a \"widely read, UK-based Internet chat group\" \"moderated\" by Benny Peiser with a primary interest in \"open discussion of asteroids, comets, and their risk to life on Earth\" but open to many other news subjects. In 2001 Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the New York's museum's Hayden Planetarium, displayed only eight (not nine) planets with Pluto reclassified as a dwarf planet. Tyson recounted the heated on-line debate on CCNet chat group following Peiser's renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status. Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and Boston Globe spawned from an article in \"The New York Times\" entitled \"Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York\". Tyson's decision resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.\n\nIn 11–13 July 1997, Benny Peiser and co-editors introduced the Second Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Cambridge Conference held at Fitzwilliam College, by outlining the background of neo-catastrophism by examining the astronomical and meteoritic background for catastrophic thinking, for example near-earth objects, cometary catastrophes and ecological disasters. The presentations by historians, classicists -researchers in areas such as Chinese studies, mythology, art, religion, literature and ancient civilisations – met with geologists, astrophysics, and a science correspondent for London's Sunday Telegraph, were later compiled in a publication entitled \"Natural Catastrophes during Bronze Age Civilisations\".\n\nDuring a debate at the Oxford Union in 2005, Peiser stated, \"The lack of a balanced approach to the issue of global warming has led to an extremely one-sided and alarmist perception of risk... Climate alarmists habitually ignore the potential economic and health benefits of warming temperatures. While magnifying the probable risks to health and mortality as a result of warmer temperatures, many underrate or simply discount the possible health benefits of moderate warming.\"\n\nIn an interview in Local Transport Today in 2006, Peiser argued that environmental concerns in general and concern about global warming in particular had reached a level of \"near hysteria\" and was \"poisonous for rational policy making\".\n\nPhysicist Laurence I. Gould from the University of Hartford, in his editorial entitled 'Global Warming from a Critical Perspective' (2007) included Benny Peiser's argument in favour of the Oxford Union debate proposition entitled \"This House believes that alarmism has replaced science in the global warming debate.\"\n\nIn 2009, in response to a prediction by James E. Hansen from NASA that sea levels could rise by 60 cm, he said, \"The predictions come in thick and fast, but we take them all with a pinch of salt. We look out of the window and it's very cold, it doesn't seem to be warming.\"\n\nIn May 2013 Benny Peiser spoke to a group of 200 at the 10th annual Calgary, Alberta Friends of Science, a Canadian non-profit advocacy organisation who dispute the value of the Kyoto Protocol and believe \"the Sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change\", rather than human activity. Peiser compared the apocalyptic statements surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline and oil sands climate change debate, to centuries of catastrophic, apocalyptic cult thinking in the Bronze Age for example. Peiser argued that the European Union's climate policies have failed. Licia Corbella, columnist and editorial page editor, with the Calgary Herald and a (former) longtime editor/columnist with the Sun Media organisation, described him as a social anthropologist, a visiting fellow at the University of Buckingham, and a \"British climate policy expert\" director of the non-partisan, not for profit Global Warming Policy Foundation.\n\nBenny Peiser is director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) and has described the climate change debate as being \"near hysteria\". The GWPF, headquartered in a room rented from the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining, was created in part in response to the 2009 Climatic Research Unit email controversy, a series of emails from the University of East Anglia (UEA).\n\nBob Ward who has served as policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics argued that some of the names of members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation are \"straight from the Who's Who of current climate change skeptics.\" Ward was concerned that the GWPF would pump material that was not scrutinised through peer-reviewed into the climate change debate. The Global Warming Policy Foundation's board of trustees includes Lord Barnett, who voted against the Climate Change Bill, and the Bishop of Chester, \"who has argued there was no consensus among climate change scientists that carbon dioxide levels are the key determinant\". Professor Ian Plimer, a member of the GWPF's academic advisory council, \"argues volcanoes produce more CO2 than humans.\" At its launch in 2009 it was described as a \"new high-powered all-party think-tank\" by global warming critic, Lord Lawson of Blaby, the former Conservative Chancellor, in an interview with \"The Times\"s journalist David Aaronovitch.\n\nThe Guardian article cast doubt on the idea that an upsurge in scepticism was underway, noting that \"in (the US) Congress, even the most determined opponents of climate change legislation now frame their arguments in economic terms rather than on the science\".\nFred Pearce wrote in \"The Guardian\" (2010) that the three inquiries Global Warming Policy Foundation looked into were all badly flawed, and that \"The Climategate Inquiries\" report ably dissects their failures. He writes that the report, \"for all its sharp—and in many cases justified—rejoinders to the official inquiries ... is likely to be ignored in some quarters for its brazen hypocrisy.\" Pearce argued that one of the criticisms of the three inquiries was that no climate sceptics were on the inquiry teams, and now the critics themselves have produced a review of the reviews that included no one not already supportive of the sceptical position. But, Pearce wrote, Montford \"has landed some good blows here.\"\n\nIn 2004, a paper was published in the journal \"Science\" by Naomi Oreskes titled \"Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change\". It researched the hypothesis that legitimate dissenting opinions on anthropogenic climate change might be downplayed in scientific papers and concluded that 75% of the examined abstracts either explicitly or implicitly backed the consensus view, none directly dissenting from it. The essay received a great deal of media attention from around the world and has been cited by many prominent people including as Al Gore in the movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\", the Royal Society and former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, Prof Sir David King.\n\nPeiser identified an error in this paper in that keywords used in the ISI database search were in fact \"global climate change\" and not \"climate change\" as originally stated, which resulted in a correction being published by \"Science\".\n\nNoticing that the original research had limited itself to articles in peer-reviewed publications, Peiser then performed a similar survey that included non-scientific, non-peer-reviewed, publications and wrote a letter to \"Science\" claiming that only 29% of such papers agreed with the consensus viewpoint, 3% explicitly disagreeing. \"Science\" chose not to publish Peiser's letter saying that the basic contents of his letter were not novel enough to be published, as they were \"widely dispersed on the internet.\"\n\nIn an article in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Peiser claimed that leading scientific journals were 'censoring debate on global warming' and that \"Science \"has a duty to publish [his research]\".\n\nOne of his main points of criticism is that the vast majority of the abstracts referred to in the study do not mention anthropogenic climate change, and only 13 of the 928 abstracts explicitly endorse what Oreskes called the \"consensus view\". Peiser later admitted that it was a mistake to include one of the papers in his survey and said that his main criticism of Oreskes' essay its \"claim of a unanimous consensus on anthropogenic global warming (APG) (as opposed to a majority consensus) is tenuous\" and that it still was valid. \"I accept that it was a mistake to include the abstract you mentioned.\"\n\nIn a 2006, letter to Australia's \"Media Watch\", Peiser explained that he had retracted 97% of his original critique and elaborated on some of his comments: \"I do not think anyone is questioning that we are in a period of global warming. Neither do I doubt that the overwhelming majority of climatologists is agreed that the current warming period is mostly due to human impact. However, this majority consensus is far from unanimous.\"\n\nPeiser is a member of Spaceguard UK, and a German libertarian blog, \"Achse des Guten\" (\"Axis of Good\"). A 10 km-wide asteroid, Minor Planet (7107) Peiser, is named in his honour by the International Astronomical Union.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "365443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365443", "title": "Cartesian diver", "text": "Cartesian diver\n\nA Cartesian diver or Cartesian devil is a classic science experiment, named for René Descartes, which demonstrates the principle of buoyancy (Archimedes’ principle) and the ideal gas law. René Descartes is said to have invented the toy. However the first written description of this device is due to Raffaello Magiotti, in his book \"Renitenza certissima dell'acqua alla compressione\" (Very firm resistance of water to compression) published in 1648.\n\nThe experiment requires a large water-filled bottle inside which is a \"diver\" — a small, rigid tube, open at one end, very similar to an eyedropper with just enough air so that it is nearly neutrally buoyant, but still buoyant enough that it floats at the top while being almost completely submerged. Two alternative 'divers' can be constructed. One sealed but a flexible bulb, and the other a sealed glass bulb (flashlight minus metal base) with wool threads trailing below. The flexible one will compress reducing volume, and the solid glass one will not change, but air bubbles will be trapped in the fibres, and be exposed to the pressure - thus will change volume.\n\nThe \"diving\" occurs when the flexible part of the larger container is pressed inwards, increasing the pressure inside the larger container, causing the \"diver\" to sink to the bottom until the pressure is released, when it rises back to the surface. If the container is rigid, as with a glass bottle, the cork sealing the bottle would be pressed inwards or drawn outwards.\nThere is just enough air in the diver to make it positively buoyant. Therefore, the diver floats at the water's surface. As a result of Pascal's law, squeezing the airtight container increases the pressure of the air, part of which pressure is exerted against the water that constitutes one \"wall\" of the airtight container. This water in turn exerts additional pressure on the air bubble inside the diver; because the air inside the diver is compressible but the water is an incompressible fluid, the air's volume is decreased but the water's volume does not expand, such that the pressure external to the diver \"a\") forces the water already in the diver further inward and \"b\") drives water from outside the diver into the diver. Once the air bubble becomes smaller and more water enters the diver, the diver displaces a weight of water that is less than its own weight, so it becomes negatively buoyant and sinks in accordance with Archimedes’ principle. When the pressure on the container is released, the air expands again, increasing the weight of water displaced and the diver again becomes positively buoyant and floats.\nIt might be thought that if the weight of displaced water exactly matched the weight of the diver, it would neither rise nor sink, but float in the middle of the container, however, this does not occur in practice. Assuming such a state were to exist at some point, any departure of the diver from its current depth, however small, will alter the pressure exerted on the bubble in the diver due to the change in the weight of the water above it in the vessel. It is an unstable equilibrium. If the diver rises, by even the most minuscule amount, the pressure on the bubble will decrease, it will expand, it will displace more water, and the diver will become more positively buoyant, rising still more quickly. Conversely, should the diver drop by the smallest amount, the pressure will increase, the bubble contract, additional water enter, the diver will become less buoyant, and the rate of the drop will accelerate as the pressure from the water rises still further. This positive reinforcement will amplify any departure from equilibrium, even that due to random thermal fluctuations in the system. A range of constant applied pressures exists that will allow the diver either to float at the surface, or sink to the bottom, but to have it float within the body of the liquid for an extended period would require continuous manipulation of the applied pressure.\n\nDivers inside an oval plastic bottle acquire new interesting properties. Indeed, an oval bottle can increase in volume when it is compressed, and if this happens, the drowned diver can ascend.\n\nIn addition, the principle is used to make small toys often called \"water dancers\" or \"water devils\". The principle is the same, but the eyedropper is instead replaced with a decorative object with the same properties which is a tube of near-neutral buoyancy, for example, a blown-glass bubble. If the tail of the glass bubble is given a twist, the flow of the water into and out of the glass bubble creates spin. This causes the toy to spin as it sinks and rises. An example of such a toy is the red \"devil\" shown here. \nThe device also has a practical use for measuring the pressure of a liquid.\n\nPlastic divers were given away in British cereal boxes as free gifts in the 1950s, and \"Diving Tony,\" a version of the toy modeled after Kellogg's Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger, was made available in the 1980s. Another use would be to use as a science class experiment to teach density, buoyancy, and pressure.\n\n"}

It is characterized by its extraordinary ability to promote the cultural and generational encounter between the vanguard and tradition. It was established with Juan José Arreola as its founding director and is located in the Woods of Chapultepec, a traditional Sunday walk area for the inhabitants of the capital.\n\nIn each of the artistic disciplines, that have taken place in this multifaceted enclosure, the originality and experimentation have gathered together and allowed the creators to show how the contemporary is not incompatible with the large popular audience that visit it, turn it into an emblematic place in the cultural scene of the city.\n\nAs in the beginning, half a century ago, Casa del Lago, opens its doors to young, national and foreign artists with original and controversial proposals, with a cultural offering where emerging expressions are significant. Intense work is done in the field of visual arts, which provides the necessary means and space for artists of different ages to develop their ideas and their quality curatorial projects. It has also promoted the theatrical work of the younger generation of directors and actors. Dance has brought together the most diverse choreographic styles, all in unconventional spaces.\n\nAlternative and emergent music has been present in diverse groups and soloists playing rock, jazz, tango, flamenco, new song, and new trends of the genres. Chess, driven by Juan José Arreola, is maintained through the various tournaments that are held annually. The Cinema Club has promoted the documentary form in a permanent way through its participation in festivals (Ambulante and DOCSDF) and has opened its spaces to young filmmakers in different film debate cycles. The program of courses and workshops has increased in over 30 disciplines, many with new and critical vision.\n\nIt revived, from a contemporary perspective, what initially was known as Poetry Out Loud, just a few years after the inauguration of this university forum in Chapultepec, through a festival that seeks to reclaim this tradition that called thinkers, intellectuals and artist of the time. It links national and international artists of today with prominent poets from different oral traditions, as the “decimistas jarochos”, indigenous poets, and the recent generation of young Mexican artists, from new literary currents, where the new musical technologies are also present, the writing in relation to sound, rhythm and the lyric skills of the artist.\n\nCasa del Lago has multiplied its cultural offers in the same way that the university community and the creators and public communities have increased, keeping alive that “dialogue between history and present as a basis of their identity”, making permanent that spirit of risk, of its vocation in the search for the experimental, emergent and purposeful, becoming an alternative art site, ideal meeting place for young people and for the people, by their tastes and training.\nFor example, from 27 August 2009 to 6 September 2009 Caso del Lago staged an exhibition of avante-garde installation art in its grounds featuring \"¿Olvida usted algo? – ¡Ojalá!\" by artist Susana Rodríguez and \"Gloria Desierta\" by Emanuel Tovar.\n\nAmong alumni of the Case del Lago is painter Eva Laura Moraga.\n\nThe construction of the building began in 1906, but it was inaugurated as the headquarters of the first Automobile Club in Mexico until April 30, 1908. In 1929, it was home to the Biological Studies Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Development (la Dirección de Estudios Biológicos de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Fomento). University autonomy definitely influenced the fate of Casa del Lago joining it to the National University and housing the new Institute for Biology, until 1959 when it moved to the new facilities created in Ciudad Universitaria (University City). On 10 May 1959 the enclosure opened its doors as a center for the promotion and dissemination of culture, but the official opening took place on September 15 of the same year.\n\nBy agreement of the rector Juan Ramón de la Fuente 31 January 2002 it was given the name of its founding director: Juan José Arreola, who turned it into the model of the national cultural centre with deep roots and prestige in Latin America, and where, over the past 50 years, representatives of the artistic vanguard of the country have gathered.\n\nSince 1959, the University has undertaken, with extraordinary energy, the avant-garde, the experimentation and the renewal of many of the anachronistic criteria that had been adapted to culture. A new generation began at Casa del Lago when notorious figures such as José Luis Ibáñez, Leonora Carrington, Juan Soriano, Octavio Paz and even Juan José Arreola, who along with Miguel Gonzalez Avelar, to name a few, began to promote Poetry Out Loud, Chess Tournaments and the Philatelic Club.\n\nTomás Segovia, successor of Arreola, poet and essayist, created an extraordinary group of young writers, among whom Juan García Ponce, short story writer, novelist and playwright, stands out; thanks to his essays and notes about visual arts, he examined and promoted artists like: Vicente Rojo, Lilia Carrillo, José Luis Cuevas, Fernando García Ponce, Alberto Gironella and Manuel Felguerez; giving also a huge boost to the music of young artists through the program Nueva Música en México (New Music in Mexico), which got together people like Joaquín Gutiérrez Heras, Rocío Sanz and other leading artists and composers.\n\nOther figures that embodied the spirit of Casa del Lago were: Juan Vicente Melo and Juan José Gurrola. Melo dermatologist and music critic replace Segovia and develop a remarkable task: Conference Cycles of literary authors and composers, small exhibitions of the mentioned artists and plays that renewed the scenic work and vanguard music concerts. Juan José Gurrola bright and bold, who began as an actor in Poetry Out Loud, always proposed avant-garde attitudes in his staging. It was an extraordinary period for Casa del Lago, awarded by the Association of Theatre and Music Critics for giving room to the artistic compositions of the twentieth century, positioning itself as one of the most renowned cultural centers in the capital of the country.\n\nIn 1982 the group called Los Estridentistas attracted public attention due to the confusion created by an exhibition about this literary group of the 20s. The exhibition at the time was the appropriate framework to exhibit the work of 80 sculptors as part of the meeting of sculptors, where they discussed issues related to sculpture and other disciplines.\n\nCasa del Lago also gave shelter to the artists called “the rupture generation” when in 1989 they made an important exhibition in which works that once were rejected by commercial galleries were included. The Documentary Cinema Club gained special significance as a unique space of its kind in the capital.\n\nThe evening walks along the Bosque de Chapultepec (Woods of Chapultepec), with the collaboration of the Directorate of the Forest, since 1999 to date, has been a project that the university community and the population have received with great interest, since it has contributed to the rescue of the historical and artistic values of the largest urban park in Latin America.\n\nPromotion of culture by nature, Casa del Lago has always been the ideal platform for experimentation in arts and to encourage the new generation of creators.\n\nIt is located in the heart of the Woods of Chapultepec, where significant work in the diffusion of culture has been done in the last fifty years. It is an emblematic space of Mexico City, where the representatives of the country's cultural vanguard have gathered and which endorses the mission of promoting culture as essential in the integral formation of young university students and the large audience who visit it.\n\nIt has developed an intense program of activities including expositions, rock concerts and alternative music, conferences, courses and workshops, Festival of Poetry Out Loud and everything related to emerging and experimental arts.\n"}

It usually includes universities derived from traditional ones. A more precise term is \"Universidades del Consejo de Rectores\" (Universities of the Rectors' Council).\n\nIt is not a very specific term since it reflects only the history of a given university and is not a valid description of the university itself or of the way that university is organized. For example, even though the Universidad Católica refers to itself as a \"traditional university\", it is more correctly described as a \"private Catholic university\" (e.g., the Catholic University of Leuven), as the government, and the people in extension, do not intervene in the governance of the university.\n\nThis distinction (which is not found in most countries) was needed because the Pinochet regime changed the higher education system, effectively dismembering public universities (like the Universidad de Chile or the Universidad Técnica del Estado) and Catholic universities. This decision, which can be seen as a punitive action against highly \"unstable\" institutions, or as a mean for better control, also included the opening of the education market, effectively allowing any private citizen to establish a higher education institution. Several small private universities arose after this, most of them directly linked to the dictatorship government members.\n\nThese \"traditional\" universities receive state financial support through many means—even though many of these universities are not public—receiving as they do most of the better students and making most of the research undertaken by Chilean universities.\n\nThese universities can be divided into two groups:\n\n\nCurrently, there are three types of universities, classified according to characteristics:\n\nTwenty-five traditional universities are today grouped in the \"Consejo de Rectores\" (Rectors' Council). Since the 1970s, these universities have managed a common higher education admissions test known as the \"Prueba de Aptitud Académica\" (\"scholastic-aptitude test\") and, since 2003, as the \"Prueba de Selección Universitaria\" (PSU, \"university-selection test\"). Some of the more academically accomplished and/or ambitious new private universities, dating from the 1980s and chiefly set up by political groupings, Catholic sects or entrepreneurs, subscribe to PSU for all undergraduate admissions.\n\n"}

The model integrates child development practices of tribal peoples and the findings of modern youth development research.\n\nThe Circle of Courage model portrays four growth needs of all children: Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity. This philosophy emerged from collaboration of Martin Brokenleg, a professor of Native American Studies, and Larry Brendtro, a professor in children's behavior disorders.

{"id": "6267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6267", "title": "Cultural imperialism", "text": "Cultural imperialism\n\nCultural imperialism comprises the cultural aspects of imperialism. Imperialism here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between civilizations, favoring the more powerful civilization. Thus, cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture, usually that of a politically powerful nation, over a less powerful society; in other words, the cultural hegemony of industrialized or economically influential countries which determine general cultural values and standardize civilizations throughout the world. The term is employed especially in the fields of history, cultural studies, and postcolonial theory. It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. Cultural imperialism can take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action, insofar as it reinforces cultural hegemony.\n\nAlthough the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has a 1921 reference to the \"cultural imperialism of the Russians\", John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s. Terms such as \"media imperialism\", \"structural imperialism\", \"cultural dependency and domination\", \"cultural synchronization\", \"electronic colonialism\", \"ideological imperialism\", and \"economic imperialism\" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.\n\nVarious academics give various definitions of the term. American media critic Herbert Schiller wrote: \"The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting.\"\n\nTom McPhail defined \"Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that vicariously establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes.\" Sui-Nam Lee observed that \"communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture.\" Ogan saw \"media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home.\"\n\nDowning and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: \"Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of colonialism, (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World.\"\nNeedless to say, all these authors agree that cultural imperialism promotes the interests of certain circles within the imperial powers, often to the detriment of the target societies.\n\nThe issue of cultural imperialism emerged largely from communication studies. However, cultural imperialism has been used as a framework by scholars to explain phenomena in the areas of international relations, anthropology, education, science, history, literature, and sports.\n\nMany of today's academics that employ the term, \"cultural imperialism,\" are heavily informed by the work of Foucault, Derrida, Said, and other poststructuralist and postcolonialist theorists. Within the realm of postcolonial discourse, \"cultural imperialism\" can be seen as the cultural legacy of colonialism, or forms of social action contributing to the continuation of Western hegemony. To some outside of the realm of this discourse, the term is critiqued as being unclear, unfocused, and/or contradictory in nature.\n\nThe work of French philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault has heavily influenced use of the term \"cultural imperialism,\" particularly his philosophical interpretation of power and his concept of governmentality.\n\nFollowing an interpretation of power similar to that of Machiavelli, Foucault defines power as immaterial, as a \"certain type of relation between individuals\" that has to do with complex strategic social positions that relate to the subject's ability to control its environment and influence those around itself. According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of truth. \"Truth\", as he defines it, is a \"system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements\" which has a \"circular relation\" with systems of power. Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always \"truth\", which is culturally specific, inseparable from ideology which often coincides with various forms of hegemony. \"Cultural imperialism\" may be an example of this.\n\nFoucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure. In his lectures at the Collège de France, Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of \"governing\", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing \"a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family\". This relates directly back to Machiavelli's The Prince, and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of truth and power. (i.e. various subjectivities are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as neoliberal governmentality.)\n\nInformed by the works of Noam Chomsky, Foucault, and Antonio Gramsci, Edward Saïd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book \"Orientalism\" (1978), a humanist critique of The Enlightenment, which criticizes Western knowledge of \"The East\"—specifically the English and the French constructions of what is and what is not \"Oriental\". Whereby said \"knowledge\" then led to cultural tendencies towards a binary opposition of the Orient vs. the Occident, wherein one concept is defined in opposition to the other concept, and from which they emerge as of unequal value. In \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993), the sequel to \"Orientalism\", Saïd proposes that, despite the formal end of the “age of empire” after the Second World War (1939–45), colonial imperialism left a cultural legacy to the (previously) colonized peoples, which remains in their contemporary civilizations; and that said \"cultural imperialism\" is very influential in the international systems of power.\n\nA self-described \"practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist\" Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has published a number of works challenging the \"legacy of colonialism\" including \"A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present\" (1999), \"Other Asias\" (2005), and \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (1988).\n\nIn \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" Spivak critiques common representations in the West of the Sati, as being controlled by authors other than the participants (specifically English colonizers and Hindu leaders). Because of this, Spivak argues that the subaltern, referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.\n\nThroughout \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\", Spivak cites the works of Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Edward Said, among others.\n\nIn \"A critique of Postcolonial Reason\", Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.\n\n\"Cultural imperialism\" can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will. Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.\n\nCultural influence can be seen by the \"receiving\" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its cultural identity. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.\n\nThe imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as consumerism). According to one argument, the \"receiving\" culture does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as \"\"banal imperialism\".\" For example, it is argued that while \"American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers\", \"cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy\", a process which \"may sound appealing\" but which \"masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America\".\n\nSome believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology. This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called \"soft power\". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from Viacom, Time-Warner, Disney, News Corp, to Google and Microsoft with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.\n\nOne of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of cultural diversity, a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of ecological diversity. Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.\n\nOf all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive \"age of imperialism\" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonization in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and epistemologies, particularly through neocolonization of public education. This, arguably has led to uneven development, and further informal forms of social control having to do with culture and imperialism. A variety of factors, scholars argue, lead to the elimination of cultures, worldviews, and epistemologies, such as \"de-linguicization\" (replacing native African languages with European ones), devaluing ontologies that are not explicitly individualistic, and at times going as far as to not only define Western culture itself as science, but that non-Western approaches to science, the Arts, indigenous culture, etc. are not even knowledge. One scholar, Ali A. Abdi, claims that imperialism inherently \"involve[s] extensively interactive regimes and heavy contexts of identity deformation, misrecognition, loss of self-esteem, and individual and social doubt in self-efficacy.\"(2000: 12) Therefore, all imperialism would always, already be cultural.\n\nNeoliberalism is often critiqued by sociologists, anthropologists, and cultural studies scholars as being culturally imperialistic. Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism. Other Scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that neoliberalism requires and creates its own form of governmentality.\n\nIn Dunn's work, \"Privatizing Poland\", she argues that the expansion of the multinational corporation, Gerber, into Poland in the 1990s imposed Western, neoliberal governmentality, ideologies, and epistemologies upon the post-soviet persons hired. Cultural conflicts occurred most notably the company's inherent individualistic policies, such as promoting competition among workers rather than cooperation, and in its strong opposition to what the company owners claimed was bribery.\n\nIn Elyachar's work, \"Markets of Dispossession\", she focuses on ways in which, in Cairo, NGOs along with INGOs and the state promoted neoliberal governmentality through schemas of economic development that relied upon \"youth microentrepreneurs.\" Youth microentrepreneurs would receive small loans to build their own businesses, similar to the way that microfinance supposedly operates. Elyachar argues though, that these programs not only were a failure, but that they shifted cultural opinions of value (personal and cultural) in a way that favored Western ways of thinking and being.\n\nOften, methods of promoting development and social justice to are critiqued as being imperialistic, in a cultural sense. For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western feminism, claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the \"third world woman\" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance. Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the \"white man\" saving the \"brown woman\" from the \"brown man.\" Other, more radical critiques of development studies, have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to \"develop\" the Global South were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.\n\nThe core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book \"Critical Studies in Mass Communication\" (1991), claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognizes both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. \nThe first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases. \nAnother context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviors remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the “liberation” of women with exposure to Western media and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.\n\nCritics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. \"Cultural imperialism\" is a term that is only used in discussions where cultural relativism and constructivism are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, \"cultural imperialism\" on those terms.\n\nJohn Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book \"Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction\", he delves into the much debated “media imperialism” theory. Summarizing research on the Third World’s reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society. He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticizing the concept that Americanization is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.\n\nOther major critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that \"cultural imperialism\" is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of colonialism is not always true.\n\nDavid Rothkopf, managing director of Kissinger Associates and an adjunct professor of international affairs at Columbia University (who also served as a senior US Commerce Department official in the Clinton Administration), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled \"In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?\" in the summer 1997 issue of \"Foreign Policy\" magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace \"cultural imperialism\" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of tolerance and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the English language and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that globalization and the Internet are accelerating the process of cultural influence.\n\nCulture is sometimes used by the organizers of society—politicians, theologians, academics, and families—to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's genocides. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.\n\nRothkopf then cites genocide and s in Armenia, Russia, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda and East Timor as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of \"political culture\" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the Inquisition, \"and during the expansion of virtually every empire.\".The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:\n\nCultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people. The British settlers tried to biologically alter the skin colour of the Australian Aboriginal people through mixed breeding with white people. The policy also made attempts to forcefully conform the Aborigines to western ideas of dress and education.\n\nAlthough the term was popularized in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.\n\nThe Roman Empire has been seen as an early example of cultural imperialism.\n\nEarly Rome, in its conquest of Italy, assimilated the people of Etruria by replacing the Etruscan language with Latin, which led to the demise of that language and many aspects of Etruscan civilization.\n\nCultural Romanization was imposed on many parts of Rome's empire by \"many regions receiving Roman culture unwillingly, as a form of cultural imperialism.\" For example, when Greece was conquered by the Roman armies, Rome set about altering the culture of Greece to conform with Roman ideals. For instance, the Greek habit of stripping naked, in public, for exercise, was looked on askance by Roman writers, who considered the practice to be a cause of the Greeks' effeminacy and enslavement. The Roman example has been linked to modern instances of European imperialism in African countries, bridging the two instances with Slavoj Zizek's discussions of 'empty signifiers'\n\nThe Pax Romana was secured in the empire, in part, by the \"forced acculturation of the culturally diverse populations that Rome had conquered.\"\n\nBritish worldwide expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries was an economic and political phenomenon. However, \"there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which Rudyard Kipling termed the 'white man's burden'.\" One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the London Missionary Society, which was \"an agent of British cultural imperialism.\" Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an \"imperial curriculum\". Morag Bell writes, \"The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism\". This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that \"Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis.\"\n\nThe analysis of cultural imperialism carried out by Edward Said drew principally from a study of the British Empire. According to Danilo Raponi, the cultural imperialism of the British in the 19th century had a much wider effect than only in the British Empire. He writes, \"To paraphrase Said, I see cultural imperialism as a complex cultural hegemony of a country, Great Britain, that in the 19th century had no rivals in terms of its ability to project its power across the world and to influence the cultural, political and commercial affairs of most countries. It is the 'cultural hegemony' of a country whose power to export the most fundamental ideas and concepts at the basis of its understanding of 'civilisation' knew practically no bounds.\" In this, for example, Raponi includes Italy.\n\nThe New Cambridge Modern History writes about the cultural imperialism of Napoleonic France. Napoleon used the Institut de France \"as an instrument for transmuting French universalism into cultural imperialism.\" Members of the Institute (who included Napoleon), descended upon Egypt in 1798. \"Upon arrival they organised themselves into an Institute of Cairo. The Rosetta Stone is their most famous find. The science of Egyptology is their legacy.\"\n\nAfter the First World War, Germans were worried about the extent of French influence in the annexed Rhineland, with the French occupation of the Ruhr Valley in 1923. An early use of the term appeared in an essay by Paul Ruhlmann (as \"Peter Hartmann\") at that date, entitled \"French Cultural Imperialism on the Rhine\".\n\n\"Cultural imperialism\" has also been used in connection with the expansion of German influence under the Nazis in the middle of the twentieth century. Alan Steinweis and Daniel Rogers note that even before the Nazis came to power, \"Already in the Weimar Republic, German academic specialists on eastern Europe had contributed through their publications and teaching to the legitimization of German territorial revanchism and cultural imperialism. These scholars operated primarily in the disciplines Of history, economics, geography, and literature.\"\n\nIn the area of music, Michael Kater writes that during the WWII German occupation of France, Hans Rosbaud, a German conductor based by the Nazi regime in Strasbourg, became \"at least nominally, a servant of Nazi cultural imperialism directed against the French.\"\n\nIn Italy during the war, Germany pursued \"a European cultural front that gravitates around German culture\". The Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels set up the European Union of Writers, \"one of Goebbels's most ambitious projects for Nazi cultural hegemony. Presumably a means of gathering authors from Germany, Italy, and the occupied countries to plan the literary life of the new Europe, the union soon emerged as a vehicle of German cultural imperialism.\"\n\nFor other parts of Europe, Robert Gerwarth, writing about cultural imperialism and Reinhard Heydrich, states that the \"Nazis' Germanization project was based on a historically unprecedented programme of racial stock-taking, theft, expulsion and murder.\" Also, \"The full integration of the [Czech] Protectorate into this New Order required the complete Germanization of the Protectorate's cultural life and the eradication of indigenous Czech and Jewish culture.\"\n\nThe actions by Nazi Germany reflect on the notion of race and culture playing a significant role in imperialism. The idea that there is a distinction between the Germans and the Jews has created the illusion of Germans believing they were superior to the Jewish inferiors, the notion of us/them and self/others.\n\n\"See Americanization and Cocacolonization.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Dulcie Howes (1908-1993), a ballet dancer, choreographer and teacher, established the University of Cape Town Ballet School in 1934. Among her most promising students during the 1940s were Johaar Mosaval and Doyle. After some years' study with her, and performing under her direction in the University of Cape Town Ballet, both of them went to London to continue their training at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School.\n\nIn 1951, Doyle was accepted into the Sadler's Wells Ballet, under the direction of Ninette de Valois, and was promoted to soloist in 1953. During his years with the company, renamed the Royal Ballet in 1956, he created roles in a number of new ballets by Frederick Ashton, Kenneth MacMillan, and John Cranko. MacMillan often cast him in \"cruel, overbearing roles because of his height and narrow face, as lethal as a knife blade.\" He was not always villainous, however. He danced many roles in classical and romantic works already in the active repertory, including \"Les Sylphides, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, Coppélia,\" and \"Sylvia\", and took prominent roles in such important ballets as de Valois's \"The Rake's Progress\", Ashton's 'Symphonic Variations\", and Alfred Rodrigues's \"The Miraculous Mandarin\".

They had two children, Philip and Anthony, and five grandchildren who live in Brazil. He died in the seacoast municipality of Maricá, Brazil, in 1991, at the age of fifty-nine. His reason for being in Maricá, a small city about forty miles north of Rio de Janeiro, is not known. If he had traveled from Cape Town, directly across the South Atlantic from Brazil, he had possibly gone there in search of work.\n"}

{"id": "306090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306090", "title": "Educational game", "text": "Educational game\n\nEducational games are games explicitly designed with educational purposes, or which have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are games that are designed to help people to learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include board, card, and video games.\nAn educational game is a game designed to teach humans about a specific subject and to teach them a skill. As educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits of gaming have on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teach us goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy our fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.\n\nWith the increase and availability of technological devices, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional board games. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as \"a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context\". The goal of such play spaces is to have the \"gamer\" engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates \"empathetic embodiment\" which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).\n\nGame-based learning (GBL) is a type of game play that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game-based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain, and apply said subject matter to the real world. Children tend to spend hours playing hide and seek, learning the steps of digital games, such as chess, and engaging in creative games. Therefore, it can be said that play and learning are synonymous, leading to cognitive and emotional development inside a social and cultural context. For instance, the game of hide and seek. Good hiders need visual and spatial perspective to define the best hiding places, while seekers must be skilled at searching for cues from the surroundings and choosing the most probable location for the hider among various possible places. A systematic review investigated the effects of educational games for mental health students:\n\nIn his classical essay, \"Upon the Aesthetic Education of Man\", Friedrich Schiller discusses play as a force of civilization, which helps humans rise above their instincts and become members of enlightened communities. He states that \"humans are only fully human when they play\". While the text is limited by the author's beliefs in concepts such as freedom and beauty, it nevertheless sets the stage for Johan Huizinga's classical study, \"Homo Ludens\".\n\nGames have long been employed as a means of education. Using the ancient game of chess, noblemen of the Middle Ages learned strategies of war. During the Civil War, volunteers from Rhode Island played American Kriegsspiel, which had originally been created in 1812 for training Prussian officers-of-war. Then, in the early 19th century, came the creation of Kindergarten by Friedrich Fröbel, which was based on learning through play. Children delighted in his Fröbel Gifts, simple educational toys such as blocks, sewing kits, clay, and weaving materials.\n\nAccording to Richard N. Van Eck, there are three main approaches to creating software that stimulates cognitive growth in the gamer. These three approaches are: building games from scratch created by educators and programmers; integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS); and creating games from scratch by the students. The most time- and cost-effective approach to designing these educational games is to incorporate COTS games into the classroom with the understanding of the learning outcomes the instructor has for the course. This requires the teacher to buy into the positive results of using digital games for education. It also requires teachers to have adequate self-efficacy concerning the use of these games and their technology. The students usually have high amounts of self-efficacy in usage of digital games, while the lack of confidence teachers have in incorporating the digital games usually results in less effective educational use of the games. However, Gerber and Price (2013) have found that teachers' inexperience with digital games does not preclude them from the desire to incorporate them in class instruction, but districts must have in place support through regular professional development, supportive learning communities with their colleagues, and adequate financial support to implement game-based learning in their class instruction.\n\nGames often have a fantasy element that engages players in a learning activity through narrative or storylines. Educational video games can motivate children and allow them to develop an awareness of consequentiality. Children are allowed to express themselves as individuals while learning and engaging in social issues. Today's games are more social, with most teens playing games with others at least some of the time and can incorporate many aspects of civic and political life. In classrooms, social game-based learning platforms are increasing in popularity, as they purport to enable students to reinforce knowledge and develop social and leadership skills.\n\nThe success of game-based learning strategies owes to active participation and interaction being at the center of the experience, and signals that current educational methods are not engaging students enough. Experience with and affinity for games as learning tools is an increasingly universal characteristic among those entering higher education and the workforce. Game-based learning is an expansive category, ranging from simple paper-and-pencil games like word searches all the way up to complex, massively multiplayer online (MMO) and role-playing games. The use of collaborative game-based role-play for learning provides an opportunity\nfor learners to apply acquired knowledge and to experiment and get feedback in the form of consequences or rewards, thus getting the experiences in the \"safe virtual world\".\n\nThe built-in learning process of games is what makes a game enjoyable. The progress a player makes in a game is through learning. It is the process of the human mind grasping and coming to understand a new system. The progress of understanding a new concept through gaming makes an individual feel a sense of reward whether the game is considered entertainment (\"Call of Duty\") or serious (FAA-approved flight simulator). Well-designed games that motivate players are what make them ideal learning environments. Real-world challenges are easier faced within a game containing effective, interactive experiences that actively engage people in the learning process. In a successful game-based learning environment, choosing actions, experiencing consequences, and working toward goals allows players to make mistakes through experimentation in a risk-free environment. Games have rules and structure and goals that inspire motivation. Games are interactive and provide outcomes and feedback. Most games also have problem solving situations that spark creativity.\n\nIdentification with the character within the video game is an important factor in the learning potential of the gamer. Some of the electronic games allow the gamer to create an avatar that is designed and “owned” by the gamer. This character is an expression of the human creating the virtual character. This has opened a new set of scientific possibilities. The virtual world can be used as a laboratory. The relationships and space within the games can simulate complex societies and relationships without having to truly participate. This application of an avatar in not limited to simulation exercises. According to Bainbridge, interviews and ethnographic research could be conducted within the reality of the game space. This could include experiments in social psychology and cognitive science. The fact that game creators and gamers are wanting new experiences within the games, the introduction of “experiments” could increase the level of play and engagement. There are also some special games for children with developmental disabilities. Such example includes Otsimo.\n\nTraditionally, technology used in school operates usually to solve problems in a fun way, particularly in mathematics. They usually make up case studies designed to introduce students to certain technologies in an effort to prepare them for a future major assignment that requires the aforementioned technology. They have also been developed to work in the virtual world. More recently educational egames have been developed for Higher Education students, combining real-world case studies in a virtual environment for students to have a consistent, 24/7 educational 'virtual' experience. In some public schools implementing Common Core Standards, game-based learning programs are utilized by educators to supplement their teaching programs. According to a recent case study by an ed tech-based nonprofit organization, teachers find some digital learning games help address issues with alignment in Common Core.\n\nIn the future, technology and games are expected to be used in simulation environments to simulate real world issues. In the professional sector, such as flight training, simulations are already used in an effort to prepare pilots for training before actually going out into planes. These training sessions are used to replicate real life stresses without the risk factor associated with flying. Simulation-games are used in other professional areas as well; a spy-themed learning game has been used to improve sales skills at Avaya and a 3D simulation game has been used to train New York City emergency responders.\n\nBefore deciding how to use game-based learning, the trainer must first determine what they would like the trainees to learn. A trainer that fails to focus training around a central idea runs the risk of using a game that fails to connect with the learners. To prevent this, tailor the material to the demographic(age group, familiarity, educational pre-text)so that the material is neither too difficult for, nor too familiar to the learner. Gathering ideas from children early in the design process has yielded useful insights into what children want in technology in general or in a specific type of application. Children's early involvement in requirements gathering has revealed clues about gender differences in preferences related to technology, children's navigation skills, ways of presenting textual information, application-specific content-related preferences, the variety of elements to be included in user interfaces and their structures, and children's desire to personalize their applications. Multiplayer role playing games (MMO’s) provide opportunities for players to improve such skills as, “complex learning, thinking, and social practices”. MMO`s also provide a social network which can favor collaborative gaming and learning and contribute to the formation of teams, communication within a group and help strengthen individual and communal identities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14777", "title": "International Olympiad in Informatics", "text": "International Olympiad in Informatics\n\nThe International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students. It is the second largest olympiad, after International Mathematical Olympiad, in terms of number of participating countries (83 at IOI 2017). The first IOI was held in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria.\n\nThe contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving of algorithmic nature. To deal with problems involving very large amounts of data, it is necessary to have not only programmers, \"but also creative coders, who can dream up what it is that the programmers need to tell the computer to do. The hard part isn't the programming, but the mathematics underneath it.\" Students at the IOI compete on an individual basis, with up to four students competing from each participating country (with 81 countries in 2012). Students in the national teams are selected through national computing contests, such as the Australian Informatics Olympiad, British Informatics Olympiad, Indian Computing Olympiad or Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (Germany).\n\nThe International Olympiad in Informatics is one of the most prestigious computer science competitions in the world. UNESCO and IFIP are patrons.\n\nOn each of the two competition days, the students are typically given three problems which they have to solve in five hours. Each student works on his/her own, with only a computer and no other help allowed, specifically no communication with other contestants, books etc. Usually to solve a task the contestant has to write a computer program (in C, C++, Pascal, or Java) and submit it before the five-hour competition time ends. The program is graded by being run with secret test data. From IOI 2010, tasks are divided into subtasks with graduated difficulty, and points are awarded only when all tests for a particular subtask yield correct results, within specific time and memory limits. In some cases, the contestant's program has to interact with a secret computer library, which allows problems where the input is not fixed, but depends on the program's actions – for example in game problems. Another type of problem has known inputs which are publicly available already during the five hours of the contest. For these, the contestants have to submit an output file instead of a program, and it is up to them whether they obtain the output files by writing a program (possibly exploiting special characteristics of the input), or by hand, or by a combination of these means. Pascal will have been removed as an available programming language by 2019.\n\nIOI 2010 for the first time had a live web scoreboard with real-time provisional results. Submissions will be scored as soon as possible during the contest, and the results posted. Contestants will be aware of their scores, but not others', and may resubmit to improve their scores. Starting from 2012, IOI has been using the Contest Management System (CMS) for developing and monitoring the contest.\n\nThe scores from the two competition days and all problems are summed up separately for each contestant. At the awarding ceremony, contestants are awarded medals depending on their relative total score. The top 50% of the contestants are awarded medals, such that the relative number of gold : silver : bronze : no medal is approximately 1:2:3:6 (thus 1/12 of the contestants get a gold medal).\n\nPrior to IOI 2010, students who did not receive medals did not have their scores published, making it impossible for a country to be ranked by adding together scores of its competitors unless each wins a medal. From IOI 2010, although the scores of students who did not receive medals are still not available in the official results, they are known from the live web scoreboard. In IOI 2012 the top 3 nations ranked by aggregate score (Russia, China and USA) were subsequently awarded during the closing ceremony.\n\nAnalysis of female performance shows 77.9 % of women obtain no medal, while 49.2 % of men obtain no medal. \"The average female participation was 4.4% in 1989–1994 and 2.2% in 1996–2014.\" It also suggests women participate much more on the national level, claiming sometimes a double-digit percentage of women participate on the first stage. President of the IOI, Richard Forster, says the competition has difficulty attracting women and that in spite of trying to solve it, \"none of us have hit on quite what the problem is, let alone the solution.\"\n\nIn IOI 2017 held in Iran, due to not being able to participate in Iran, the Israeli students participated in an offsite competition organized by IOI in Russia. Due to visa issues, the full USA team was unable to attend, although one contestant Zhezheng Luo was able to attend by traveling with the Chinese team and winning gold medal and 3rd place in standings.\n\nThe following is a list of the top performers in the history of the IOI. The sign indicates a perfect score, a rare achievement in IOI history. The sign indicates an unofficial participation, where a contestant participated in a host's second team. Also, first (I), second (II) and third (III) places among gold medalists are indicated where appropriate.

{"id": "38474093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38474093", "title": "Jakob Gapp", "text": "Jakob Gapp\n\nBlessed Jakob Gapp (26 July 1897 – 13 August 1943) was an Austrian Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Marianists. Gapp first served as a soldier on the Italian front during World War I at a point in his life where his religious convictions were not of high importance though his return home from a prisoner of war camp saw him develop socialist views that soon bought him into contact with the Marianists whom he later joined. He studied with them and became a member while later being ordained and assigned across Austria as a teacher where he became noted for his vehement opposition to the Nazi regime; he deemed Nazism as being some warped political tool to create division which was also incompatible with the faith.\n\nHis bold activism against the Nazi regime saw him flee when it was clear his life was endangering himself and his colleagues and he settled in both France and Spain before returning to France after being duped into accepting two Jewish people who fled from Berlin. These two men were instead the Gestapo who arrested him and transferred him to Berlin where he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. His interrogation transcripts reveal how he deemed Nazism and Roman Catholicism to be incompatible and his strong adherence to his faith even prompted Heinrich Himmler and others to refuse his relations to retrieve his remains for it would result in veneration and silent rebellion.\n\nThe beatification process for the late priest culminated after Pope John Paul II beatified him on 24 November 1996 in Saint Peter's Square.\n\nJakob Gapp was born on 26 July 1897 in Wattens as the seventh child to Martin Gapp and Antonia Wach; he received his baptism on 27 July in the local parish church of Saint Lawrence. His niece was Marianne Oberauer. He received a basic education in his hometown and later entered the high school that the Order of Friars Minor ran at Hall in 1910.\n\nHe served as a soldier on the Italian front from May 1915 until 1916 when he was wounded during a battle; he received the Silver Medal of Courage Second Class as a result of his actions on the battlefield. On 4 November 1918 he became a prisoner of war in Riva del Garda and was later released from his internment on 18 August 1919 but became a prisoner of war due to a miscommunication on the ceasefire agreement that was to commence 5 November but never did. Gapp later entered the Marianists at Greisinghof on 13 August 1920 for a formation program and began his novitiate on 26 September before being assigned to Graz as a teacher and sacristan from 1921 until 1925. He joined that order after learning about them from a relative. He made his profession in Antony in France on 27 August 1925. He began his studies for the priesthood in September 1925 at Fribourg in Switzerland and later received his ordination as such from Bishop Marius Besson at the Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Fribourg on 5 April 1930.\n\nThe new priest served as a teacher and chaplain at several Marianist schools until 1938. He often gave up his own heating coal to the poor and collected food and other necessities for them. He preached against the errors of Nazism and how it was incompatible with fundamental Christian ethics and he said himself that it was \"irreconcilable with the Catholic faith\" thus to be discouraged. Gapp was forced to flee Graz in March 1938 when German troops entered into Austria. Gapp's superiors sent him to Tyrol in September 1938 believing he would be in danger if he was not moved and it was there that he served as an assistant pastor at Breitenwant-Reutte until October 1938 when the Gestapo ordered him not to teach religion. He refused to wear a swastika badge and to greet people with the 'Heil Hitler' out of conscience and once in public rebuked a fellow teacher who told their students to \"hate and kill Czechs and Jews\".\n\nGapp also taught his students that love for all people irrespective of race or religion was crucial to fellowship and taught that people ought to be worshipping God and not Adolf Hitler; this got him suspended. On 11 December 1938 he gave a sermon in which he defended Pope Pius XI from Nazi smears and directed the faithful to read Christian literature and not that which the Nazis propagated; one such document he directed others to and spoke about was Mit brennender Sorge that Pius XI issued in 1937. He was also advised to flee Austria in January 1939 so travelled to Bordeaux in France where he worked as both a chaplain and librarian. In May 1939 he headed for Spain and served at Marianist communities in Valencia as well as Cádiz and San Sebastian. While in Valencia in 1942 he went to the British consulate hoping to gain a visa to go to England but this attempt failed so settled for reading British newspapers in order to find uncensored news that would tell him the truth about World War II; he also learned of the Holocaust genocide at the same time. He read The Tablet which was a Christian British newspaper.\n\nBut Gapp was never free from the Nazis for the Gestapo followed his movements and in 1942 devised a devious plot to draw Gapp out from Spain into their arms along the French border. In 1942 he received word of two Jewish males who fled from Berlin and were at the French border desiring his assistance after learning of him. Gapp further learned these two were brothers who wanted baptism so left Spain to go and retrieve them. The three went on a picnic close to the border where he found that the two were not Jews but disguised Nazis who abducted him and arrested him in Hendaye on 9 November 1942; he was then sent to Berlin for incarceration. It was decided that he would not be sent to the Dachau concentration camp because Gapp was seen to be dangerous to the extent where he needed special surveillance. His resolve while being interrogated prompted Heinrich Himmler to review all interrogation transcripts and even comment on his steadfast dedication to Catholicism. Himmler said if the Nazis had one Gapp dedicated to the cause as the priest was to the faith the Nazis would have won the war at that stage. On 2 July 1943 he was condemned to death for speaking out against the Third Reich after a two hour court session and was remanded pending his formal execution – the judgment was condemning: \"He will forever be without honor\". The burial of his remains was also denied during those proceedings for the Nazis feared that he would be venerated and his grave site would become the site of rebellion and silent demonstration.\n\nIn the afternoon on 13 August 1943 at 1:00pm he was advised that he would be executed that evening so in preparation wrote two farewell letters. He was beheaded at 7:08pm and his remains were used for research at the Anatomical-Biological Institute at the Berlin college. In 1996 the death sentence against him was lifted in a Berlin court on a posthumous level. His surviving remains were moved to Innsbruck in 2002.\n\nThe beatification process opened in Vienna in a diocesan process that opened under Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër on 26 June 1987 and concluded its business on 20 October 1987 in which Gapp was titled as a Servant of God; a total of 37 witnesses were interviewed including Gapp's niece Marianne. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process on 7 April 1989 and later received the Positio from the postulation in 1992 for assessment. Theologians issued their approval to the cause on 31 January 1995 while the bishop and cardinal members of the C.C.S. approved the cause too on 4 April 1995.\n\nHis cause received approval from Pope John Paul II on 6 April 1995 after the pope determined that the late Marianist priest was killed \"in odium fidei\" or \"in hatred of the faith\". John Paul II beatified Gapp in Saint Peter's Square on 24 November 1996.\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is the Marianist priest Antonio Gascón Aranda.\n\nAmong the range of things Gapp has said in his sermons or in other forms:\n\n"}

Italy was a case brought before the European Court of Human Rights, which, on 18 March 2011, ruled that the requirement in Italian law that crucifixes be displayed in classrooms of schools does not violate the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe case stemmed from a request of Mrs Soile Lautsi, citizen of Finland and of Italy, against the School Council of a school in Abano Terme (province of Padua). When the School Council decided not to comply, Lautsi applied to the Veneto Administrative Court. The administrative Court decided, on 17 March 2005, that the presence of crucifixes in State-school classrooms did not offend the principle of secularism. Lautsi appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Veneto Court's decision reasoning that in Italy the crucifix symbolized the religious origin of values (tolerance, mutual respect, valorization of the person, affirmation of one's rights, consideration for one's freedom, the autonomy of one's moral conscience vis-à-vis authority, human solidarity and the refusal of any form of discrimination) which characterized Italian civilization and that keeping the Crucifix did not have any religious connotations.\n\nLautsi then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on 27 July 2006. On 3 November 2009, a Chamber of the Second Section of the Court declared that there had been a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. This decision caused uproar in Italy. Lautsi declared that she had received threats and had been a victim of vandalism, and complained about statements by politicians. The Chamber that considered the case decided that Italy was in violation of Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Article 2 of the first Protocol to the Convention, reasoning that among the plurality of meanings the crucifix might have, the religious meaning was predominant. The Chamber argued that 'the \"negative\" freedom of religion was not limited to the absence of religious services or religious education: it extended to practices and symbols expressing, in particular or in general, a belief, a religion or atheism. It added that this \"negative right\" deserved special protection if it was the State which expressed a belief and dissenters were placed in a situation from which they could not extract themselves if not by making disproportionate efforts and sacrifices.'\n\nOn 28 January 2010, the Italian government lodged an appeal to the Grand Chamber of the Court. Its position was supported by the governments of Lithuania, Slovakia and Poland: \"Lithuania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds that the use of crucifixes in public in Catholic countries reflects the European Christian tradition and should not be regarded as a restriction on the freedom of religion\", stated its spokesperson By July 2010, twenty countries had officially expressed their support for Italy's appeal against the ruling.\n\nThe decision of the Chamber of the Court was also deplored by the Orthodox Church of Greece.\n\nIn the European Parliament, two motions for resolutions were proposed: one by S&D group, calling for \"recognition of [...] the freedom of Member States to exhibit any religious symbol in public\", another by GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups, stating belief that \"only states based on the principle of the separation of church and state – as opposed to theocratic states – can find the proper solutions to safeguard everybody's right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to education and the prohibition of discrimination\" and \"it should not be compulsory to display religious symbols in premises used by public authorities\"\n\nIn March 2010, the case was referred to Court's Grand Chamber. Ten countries, 33 MEPs (jointly) and several NGOs were authorised as third parties to present written observations, several others were refused. On 30 June 2010, a hearing was held by the Grand Chamber, which on 18 March 2011 announced its decision, reached by 15 votes to 2, to overturn the ruling of the lower Chamber. It granted that, \"by prescribing the presence of crucifixes in State-schools classrooms - a sign which, whether or not it is accorded in addition a secular symbolic value, undoubtedly refers to Christianity - the regulations confer on the country's majority religion preponderant visibility in the school environment.\" But it declared: \"That is not in itself sufficient, however, to denote a process of indoctrination on the respondent State's part and establish a breach of the requirements of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1\". It added that \"a crucifix on a wall is an essentially passive symbol and [...] cannot be deemed to have an influence on pupils comparable to that of didactic speech or participation in religious activities\".\n\n\n"}

Students attend the school from age 14 to age 18.\n\nThe predecessor of the school, Ranolder Institute was founded by Ranolder János, the bishop of Veszprém at the time, in order to give Ferencváros, which was mainly inhabited by German natives in those days, an institute to educate women in Hungarian. The school in charge of the Daughters of Charity was gradually growing receiving girls with the intention to study from all over the country. After the nationalisation in 1948/49 the school became a training (secondary) school for primary school teachers, then taking up the name Leövey Klára in 1955, it was turned into a high school.\nIn the regular department the students between the age of 14 and 18 take part in a 4 and 5 year school course/education.\n\nThis is a school of „the second chance” too, because at the department of adult education there is a chance for youngsters or young adults who for some reason could not obtain a secondary education certificate, are given the chance to get it within a night school or correspondent course system without giving up their jobs and starting a regular (daytime) secondary school course.\n\nThe school also offers a practice-oriented 1- or 2- year-long course based on the requirements of the secondary education certificate which gives a qualification to those who do not wish to or temporarily cannot continue their studies at a further education college or university.\n\nIn the school year 2008/2009 there are 650 students attending the regular and 210 students the adult department of the school.\n\nThis school has been a member of the Network of European Innovative Schools since June 2003. This gives the opportunity of trying out new pedagogical methods and tools and of joining/participating international programs.\n\nIn the educational work environmental education has a prominent role. Students learn about the importance of environmental protection at elective extra lessons, through doing project work and educational trips. A new project on environmental protection, which is on the way to be state-credited, is being tested at the moment at this school. \n\nThe European Language Portfolio which help students to keep track of their language learning process was introduced in 2003. The Portfolio is in accordance with the Common European Framework and \n\nThe school was one of the first high schools in Hungary to introduce the teaching of the subject ’Introduction to Economics in’ its curriculum as an elective extra lesson. Within the scope of the subject students could join a student enterprise program called Young Enterprise to gain experience on running a business. From the school year 2005/2006 students have the opportunity of receiving the renowned Unified European Economic Certificate (EBC*L).\n\nAs the result of the development made in the last few years the teaching of the subject ’Moving picture and Media’ has been introduced as an elective course and for students specialising in it, within the framework of which the students get to know the basics of analysing moving pictures and current phenomena of the media. \nThis school is a pioneer in using information and communication technologies. In this field traditions go back to 1983. These technologies are used in the background work of both teachers and students and in projects work as well.\n\nWith the coordination of the European schoolnet the school has been participating in the e-learning research and development work of the Celebrate project which has been going on since 2002 with nine Hungarian schools (including Leovey Klara High School) taking part in it. Teachers have been creating and testing e-learning resource materials to be used through the Internet. \nThe school is part of the Sulinet Digital Knowledge Base the aim of which is to integrate informatics, learning and teaching materials into the process of school learning.\nThe SCALE project is an EU sponsored project with 6 countries participating. It aims at developing an Internet-based method which can help to develop students’ argumentative skills in discussions and introduce the method of learning with the help of discussions to them.\nWithin the ZORKA 2004 project, with the other schools involved in the Innovative School Network, the school has been developing digital teaching and learning resource materials to be used in teaching natural sciences.\nIn the school year 2005/2006 the ESZTER project was organised by Sulinet Program Office (Programiroda), with innovative schools taking part, within which students were exploring the ethnic, language, religious and cultural heterogeneity of the EU countries. \nWith the HEFOP 3.1.3. project the school can take part in the development program entitled ’Preparation for Competence-based Teaching’. All the 9-form students in this school are involved in it. \nThe participation in the Socrates/Comenius school development program financed by the European Committee gives students the chance to improve their sense of solidarity and empathy. It also helps them to explore and respect the heterogeneity of European Culture and social traditions. This institute is the coordinator for 6 schools in the 3-year project entitled “For a European School of Solidarity” which aims at helping the participants to learn and cohabit with heterogeneity.\n\nStudents in the 9th and 10th form learn the subjects of their own interest, which they specialise in, in a higher number of lessons. At the beginning of the 11th form they can revise their former choice and make a new one choosing another elective subject to orient themselves towards another aim in their future career. \nBesides the modern pedagogical methods used in the school, the students are attracted by the friendly atmosphere of the institution as well. The extra curricular activities also have an important role to contribute to this good atmosphere.\nIt is not only the cultural programs which are of great interest to students but they show interest in acting, sports activities and hiking as well.\nThe students’ self-government operates within a special independent framework.\nThe excellent atmosphere of the school is also due to the most modern way of keeping contact between parents and the school as well as students and teachers through the internet. This new type of “interpersonal” contact is operated through the Moodle framework and it makes the educational and pedagogical work of teachers much more effective.\nThe school has owned a certificate of quality management based on the QPSA model since 1999. For the sake of the permanent improvement the school is continuously processing the feedback (measurements, competition results, data of enrolment, final exam results) and survey the indicators of the level of satisfaction of partners (of parents and students)in the educational and pedagogical process. \nAs the appreciation of the high quality of the work, the name of the school gets referred to more and more frequently in the leading organs of pedagogical literature.\n\n"}

His efforts to develop a compensatory education program in New York City served as a predecessor to the national Head Start program. He developed early intervention programs with what he called a \"therapeutic curriculum\", which aimed to specifically address the deficient experiences of children living in deprived environments. He believed that such environments put children at a disadvantage with respect to beginning school and acquiring basic literacy skills.\n\nBorn in New York City, Deutsch was educated at Columbia University (B.A., 1943; M.A., 1947; Ph.D., 1951). In 1958, he and his wife founded the Institute for Developmental Studies at New York University, where he became a professor in 1960. He remained director of the Institute for Developmental Studies for the rest of his career. He was the president of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues in 1969. He died of renal failure on June 26, 2002 at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1962, Deutsch began a pilot early childhood education program in Harlem for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds. In the program, Deutsch aimed to give children early exposures to experiences in which they had been lacking, such as music and books. In the short term, the program aimed to equip children with the skills they would need for formal education; in the long term, it was intended to improve participants' communication and learning skills, thereby benefiting them in adult life. A 1964 article in \"Life\" described the program as \"the first scientific and concerted attempt by any public school system to confront the problem of educating poor preschool children. \n\nDeutsch was an early critic of Arthur Jensen's controversial essay \"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?\", published in the \"Harvard Educational Review\" in 1969. In a subsequent issue of the same journal, Deutsch criticized Jensen's essay for allegedly supporting racism, and claimed that the essay contained \"many erroneous statements, misinterpretations, and misunderstandings\". In 1973, he debated Richard Herrnstein over the relative importance of genetics and environment in determining human intelligence. The debate was held at the Carnegie Center in Manhattan and sponsored by the magazine \"Social Policy\".\n"}
{"id": "685077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=685077", "title": "Marty Klein", "text": "Marty Klein\n\nMarty Ralph Klein (born 1950) is an American sex therapist, author, educator and public policy analyst. Klein has spent his career supporting the healthy sexual expression of men, women and couples in a wide range of ways. He is critical of censorship, the concepts of sex addiction and porn addiction, as well as the anti-pornography movement. He believes that public policy relating to sexuality should be driven by scientific data rather than emotion, \"tradition\" or popular but untrue myths. He has been a participant in various state, federal and international court cases dealing with the First Amendment, obscenity, censorship and \"harmful to minors\" laws.\n\nKlein grew up in Brooklyn, New York. While still in elementary school he began to play the recorder and to collect stamps, interests he has continued throughout his life. Collecting stamps led to a lifelong interest in geography and history. He later wrote on these topics frequently when he began to lecture and travel internationally.\n\nAfter graduating from Stuyvesant High School in 1967 he attended the State University of New York at Stony Brook. There he developed a passion for sociology and went on to attend PhD programs in sociology at Indiana University and the University of California.\n\nKlein was trained in the doctoral programs of two different branches of sociology: the first was survey research, the use of statistical analysis to gather data about human behavior in order to understand, correlate and predict it; the second was ethnomethodology, which is the study of how people create meaning as a prelude to creating orderly social interactions and predictable social institutions.\n\nWhile at the University of California, Klein worked at the local weekly newspaper the \"Santa Barbara News & Review\", his first job was a writer. In 1976 the \"Los Angeles Times\" published his op-ed piece on contraceptive advertising; together these two outlets began his career as a professional writer.\n\nFirst as a volunteer and then as a staff member, Klein worked for the Santa Barbara branch of Planned Parenthood (1976-1980). While there he became intrigued with the recurring experience of women returning for pregnancy tests multiple times despite being prescribed or given various types of contraception. These women's explanations surprised him: they didn't want to use birth control because they were afraid their partner would think they were a slut, or that they had actually planned to have sex with a stranger they'd just met at a bar.\n\nPlanned Parenthood then asked him to run a group for the male partners of women coming to the birth control clinic. He also received a grant from the state Office of Family Planning relating to male sexuality. His interest already piqued by his experiences at the clinic, he began his career in human sexuality. \n\nKlein is best known for promoting changes in personal and social attitudes toward sex and sexuality. He has given several media interviews and written blog posts about his views on topics such sexuality in the media, pornography, and children and sexuality.\n\nKlein has been outspoken about the way sexuality is discussed in media outlets. For example, a 2005 \"New York Times\" article on the phenomenon of self-help books about sexual positions, sex fantasies and increasingly edgy materials stated that the genre is big business, aimed at women and promoting the idea that \"It is a woman's role to ensure that the couple's sex life remains satisfying.\" Klein disagrees that the promises that these books make about improving sex with oral, anal and fetishistic techniques and information are not what most couples really need to make them happy. \"A book called 'How to Get Your Wife to Hug You a Little Bit More' or 'How to Get Your Husband to Slow Down and Caress Your Hair and Love Doing It,' now those are books that would change people's lives,\" says Klein. Communication is the key to satisfying relationships; things like new positions or removing pornography from a home without your partner's consent is generally not helpful. Klein told the \"Commonwealth Club\" that what most adults want out of sex is a combination of \"pleasure and closeness,\" and he encourages people to pay more attention to these, rather than to performance anxiety or how they look.\n\nKlein has criticized the mass media for talking about sexuality in what he claims is an exploitative manner. He calls this the \"Oprah-ization\" factor, where talk shows like \"Oprah\" and \"Dr. Phil\" will, for example, put teen prostitutes on stage and talk about how awful it is. What they are really doing, according to Klein, is showing teen girls in skimpy clothing talking about sex, which results in voyeuristic viewers. \"If the American media really thought these stories were so terrible it wouldn't give them so much air time ... The key message in American culture is that sex is dangerous. But sex isn't dangerous, bad sexual decision making is dangerous.\" In an interview with Chip August for \"Personal Life Media\" Klein stated, \"I think Oprah has single-handedly launched the victim industry in this country,\" adding that society is now infantilizing women by saying that they are unable to make decisions for themselves, that they are tricked into drinking at parties, that they can't control whether they get drunk or create circumstances of vulnerability. \"It's demeaning to people to say that even though you're an adult, we're not going to hold you accountable for your own decision-making,\" he says.\n\nKlein has criticized as unproven the theory of \"secondary effects\", which posits that people involved with various forms of commercial sexual expression (such as escorts, strip clubs or pornography) will inevitably get involved with other, non-sexual illegal activity such as burglary, vandalism, or assault. He states that there is no evidence for this, but the idea appeals intuitively to many people. Thus instead of looking at the actual causal factors of crime, they seek to ban pornography, strip clubs and other outlets to reduce it. On 20/20 Klein told host John Stossel that 150 years ago most people got married as soon as they reached puberty, which was about 14 or 15 years old. Now most Americans reach puberty around ages 10–12 but they delay marriage into their late 20s. \"Telling people to not have sex is like telling a depressed person to have a nice day and expecting that to lift their depression.\"<ref name=\"20/20\"></ref>\n\nIn December 2016, Klein was a return guest on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" talking about his book \"His Porn, Her Pain: Confronting America's Porn Panic with Honest Talk about Sex\". He explained that he wrote this book in response to Broadband internet making porn more available - and the accompanying increase in women complaining about their men viewing porn, as well as to help improve sexual literacy of both adults and minors. Host Steven Novella asked Klein if anti-pornography groups are trying to justify their opposition by citing health concerns or were just confused about the science. Klein responded that both are true. \"The junk science is there for anyone who wants to use it,\" he said, noting that the common claims that pornography leads to various social problems lack evidence to support them, as rates of sexual violence, divorce, teen pregnancy and child molestation have all gone down since Broadband pornography became common. He observed that couples that don't have sex anymore are quicker to fight about pornography rather than have a meaningful conversation about problems in their sexual relationships. Cara Santa Maria asked if porn leads to unrealistic expectations by men. \"Absolutely yes!\" Klein answered. \"Some people think porn is a documentary, showing real people in real situations... porn is usually unusual bodies, doing unusual things in unusual circumstances.\" \"Pornography leaves out so much that we value in sex. Kissing, hugging ... whispering... because if you watch people hug, after about 2 seconds it gets real boring.\" In addition, he explained that consumer products based on fantasy are mostly about what people want to see, not necessarily what they want to do or experience, as both men and woman fantasize about things they would not do even if given the chance.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with \"Your Tango\", Klein stated that in America, children are raised to have negative feelings about sex and their sexuality. In Europe most beaches are clothing optional, yet in America nudity on beaches is a crime. \"When children in the United States grow up learning that their sexuality is bad, when every institution that children have contact with reminds them that their sexuality is bad or dirty or shameful or dangerous — when those kids grow up to be adults, they carry those lessons with them. And one of the things those kids decide when they are adults is that 'if there's something wrong with my sexuality, there must be something wrong with everyone else's sexuality. And, therefore, it's not only my sexuality that I need to repress, it's other people's sexuality that I need to be concerned about, too.\" This is, Klein says, one of the roots of censorship in America. Further, he has been critical of laws which make it risky for parents to take photos of their children in the bathtub, or for teenagers to take sexual photos of themselves for their own private use. In addition, he has spoken out against the way he sees teens being treated as a sexually repressed minority, such as the criminalization and punishment of teen \"sexting,\" and the deliberate withholding of sexual information and sexual health products from them.\n\nIn a 2015 \"New York Times\" interview, Klein was asked how best to talk to children about sex. He responded that it depends on the child, since a younger child will probably not notice the conversation, and older children will need additional information and it is best for parents to respond honestly in a way that reflects their values. A teenager will need to understand what is real and what is fictional entertainment. In all cases, Klein said, it is important to listen, remain calm and make sure the child knows they are not a bad person for having sex questions and that they can ask the parent anything. '\"There’s a technical word for the conversations that adults have with their kids when the parents are uncomfortable'\" said Klein '\"parenting.'\"\n\nKlein has also noted that children are learning about sex despite \"anti-sex crusaders\" and other societal forces trying to keep it from them: \"The truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not. Children don't need our help to think about sex ...There are groups of people out there who are devoted to scaring the heck out of Americans about sexuality ...It makes some people feel good because they say, 'Aha, there's the enemy and if only we could do something about that, everything would be better.' \" It's a parenting issue, Klein told NPR, when children are viewing something that is made for adults. Parents need to educate their children and increase their sexual literacy, so that they understand that what they are seeing on the Internet is fantasy.\n\nWhen the expression \"sex addiction\" was coined in the mid-1980s by Patrick Carnes, Klein began to lecture and write against this idea. Klein believed then - and continues to believe - that the concept of \"sex addiction\" is primarily a set of moralistic judgements dressed up as clinical theory. He has written that the concept is a simplistic explanation of poor sexual decision-making that demonizes sexuality. He says it ignores the roles of culture, religion and the psychological means of sex for individuals while portraying sexual desires as dangerous, often unhealthy and in need of strict control channeled into the one proper form of sexual expression. Klein has reservations that sex-addiction exists and believes that an addiction movement whose agenda is based on false assumptions is harmful to patients and to society, namely: that sexual desires are dangerous, controlling, and not healthy, and that there is only one way to express sexuality.\n\nIt is unknown, according to Klein, if the sex addiction movement realized that its ideas would become politically exploited. Regardless of their intentions, this is what activists, government and the media have done in order to discredit the profession of sexology. Issues such as culture, religion, age and disorders must be taken into account. He states that society needs to come up with \"sex-positive\" models of \"sexual health\". These models should reflect good education for children as well as for adults, while being sensitive across different cultures. Klein's concerns with the concept of sexual addiction are that it appears to lend scientific credibility to it and implies that \"sex is dangerous.\" Twelve-step programs for sex addiction are of limited value because they are typically self-referred for a problem that any lay person can diagnose. There is no serious evaluation, just \"Hello Joe, welcome to the group\". Joe may suffer from other problems that will not be helped by a twelve-step program, and may in fact be made worse. Klein told NPR that the idea that going to strip clubs or \"watching porn movies can actually be addictive in the same way that heroin is addictive is just silly.\"\n\nMichigan passed a law in 1999 criminalizing the distribution of \"sexually explicit\" material on the Internet fearing it could fall into the hands of minors. Plaintiffs, which included Marty Klein, challenged the law arguing that it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and it was ruled unconstitutional in June 2001.\n\nIn April 2000 Arizona Governor Jane Hull signed law H.B. 2428 which added the Internet to the \"harmful to minors\" statute. Plaintiffs including Klein sought to have the Internet removed, claiming the law was far too broad contrary to the First Amendment. After reaching the 9th Circuit in June 2002, the Court struck down the law as unconstitutional in \"American Civil Liberties Union v. Goddard\".\nIn early 2010 an addition was proposed to Massachusetts Senate Bill 997 adding \"electronic media\" to traditional media in its \"harmful to minors\" law. This would have criminalized any material posted on the Internet that might be considered harmful if viewed by a minor. The plaintiffs argued that this could \"potentially ban constitutionally protected speech about art, literature, sexual health and other topics.\" The case was heard in October 2010, and in April 2011 the Bill was signed into law, but with the stipulation that it could only be enforced if the \"harmful material\" was knowingly distributed to a minor. Marty Klein was the only individual among the various institutional plaintiffs.\n\nAccording to lead attorney Michael Bamberger in 2010, the \"harmful to minors\" law is too broad and will harm adults that have a constitutional right to content on the Internet, '\"(T)he injunction was necessary to ensure that all Internet communications were not reduced to the level of what is appropriate for children.\"' Plaintiffs were concerned that fines of up to $10,000 and five years in prison would have a chilling effect on booksellers as websites have no way to determine the age of an Internet user, and it is not possible to block only users located in Massachusetts. Thus the law would threaten Internet users nationwide and even worldwide.\n\nKlein has been an expert witness, consultant, or invited plaintiff in many state, federal, and international censorship, internet, and obscenity cases.\n\nKlein is an extensive traveler and maintains a travel blog for his various trips, including India (2007), Azerbaijan (2009), Viet Nam (2010), Ukraine (2010), China (2011), Brazil (2011), Poland (2012), Myanmar (2013), Italy (2014), Hong Kong (2015), Japan (2015) and Greece (2016). All the photos on his blog are his own.\n\nKlein has been honored by the following professional associations: \n\nKlein has authored seven books on sexuality. His book \"America's War on Sex\" with a forward by ACLU President Nadine Strosse was honored as 2006's Best Sexuality Book by AASECT. It documents how the issue of sexual regulation is being used by the Religious Right to undermine secular democracy. Klein details what he describes as a well-coordinated, deeply funded war on sexuality which is being fought on many fronts. Klein explores what he sees as the U.S.'s deep-seated anxiety about sexuality and the lengths to which the U.S. government is willing to go to keep its citizens sexually repressed. Klein challenges American society's (and psychotherapy's) assumptions about sexuality; he is particularly critical of what he calls the \"Sexual Disaster Industry\" and the \"Oprah-ization\" of psychotherapy and medicine.\n\n\n\n\n"}

PAS is one of the ten career and technical student organizations that has been approved by the United States Department of Education as an integral part of career and technical education also referred to as vocational education. PAS is a member of the Consortium of Collegiate Agricultural Organizations.\n\nPAS was originally organized for postsecondary programs awarding associate degrees or certificates and has since expanded to include baccalaureate degree programs. The Illinois PAS has all four of that state's agricultural universities involved in PAS and Iowa PAS has their state land grant of Iowa State University in PAS. This shift allows students who then transfer to a 4-year university to continue their direct involvement in PAS, provides the opportunities of PAS to university students and further deepens connections between 2 and 4 year agricultural institutions.\n\nThe national organization was organized in March 1979 under Draft Bylaws. PAS was officially founded in March 1980 in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThe history of PAS begins with the expansion of vocational-technical education at the postsecondary level. With state and federal legislation in the 60’s and 70’s, the agricultural education movement expanded greatly with more and more postsecondary agricultural programs. This movement started the creation of many local college student agricultural organizations at the two-year institutions.\n\nOn the national level, the formation of PAS began with a National Seminar in 1966 at SUNY Cobleskill, Cobleskill, New York. A Committee on “Youth Organizations and Activities for Two-Year Post High School Students in Agriculture\" was created. It was decided that PAS should be separate from the National FFA Organization. It also recommended that the organizations begin first with the local, then state, and proceed to a national organization.\n\nSome states had developed equivalent organizations that proceeded the formation of the National PAS Organization. In Illinois, some 12 community college agriculture students, their advisors, and guests gathered on February 28, 1974, at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in Springfield for the purpose of forming a statewide organization. Copies of the Students With Agriculture Purposes (SWAP) Constitution and Bylaws were revised and developed into a state constitution and bylaws. Seeing the need for a different name for the organization, the Illinois Association of Community College Agriculturists (IACCA) was passed unanimously to replace SWAP. The IACCA Constitution and Bylaws were officially adopted on April 19, 1974. On February 25, 1989, at the 15th Annual Conference when the 16 delegates assembled voted to change the name from “IACCA” to “PAS” so that Illinois would be aligned with the National PAS Organization.\n\nThe idea of a National Organization was again reviewed at the National Agricultural Education Seminar held in Muscatine, Iowa in 1969. However, there was not enough interest in forming a national organization at that time.\n\nIn 1973 a National Standards conference hosted by the state of Minnesota recognized the potential need for a student organization. A NPASO Development Committee was formed and was to meet each year at the American Vocational Association (AVA) convention.\n\nIn 1976 the committee held a brainstorming conference in the Quad Cities. Some of the major decisions included (1) the terminology of “Agriculture and Related Occupations for students enrolled in two-year institutions; (2) that the organization would be independent of the National FFA Organization and the FFA Alumni; and (3) the development of a procedure for funding and obtaining industry support.\n\nIn 1977 with a grant from White Farm Equipment Company, an ad hoc committee met at the National FFA Center to develop the strategies for a national postsecondary student organization. The purpose was to verify the need for and feasibility of organizing an organization.\n\nIn 1978, as a continuation of the White Farm Equipment Company grant, a National Seminar for Educators in Postsecondary Institutions was held in Kansas City, Missouri. The seminar concluded with acceptance of six reports including the acceptance and endorsement of the need for a National Postsecondary Student Organization for Agriculture/Agribusiness and Natural Resources students and the need to proceed immediately to finalize the organization.\n\nThe first national conference for the National Postsecondary Agricultural Student Organization was held in April 1979.\n\nNational PAS membership now totals some 1,115 members from 56 chapters located in 18 states. Membership is available to students in agriculture, agribusiness and natural resources postsecondary programs in approximately 550 institutions in all 50 states. \n\nPAS Associates is an organization of former members of the National Postsecondary Agriculture Students Organization. Advisors, administrators, industry representatives, parents, and other PAS supporters are also welcomed to become members. Despite a generally open membership the PAS Associates has had minimal activity and has been faced with financial issues.\n\nPAS Associates was officially organized at the 10th reunion National Conference in Kansas City, Mo., in March 1988.\n\nUniting Education & Industry in Agriculture \n\n"}

It was developed by John Gage (then-chief science officer at Sun Microsystems) and activist Michael Kaufman. They approached Delaine Eastin, California's State Superintendent of Public Instruction, to put together the first event in California. The first official NetDay was held in 1996.\n\nIn 2005, NetDay merged with\" Project Tomorrow\" (\"tomorrow.org\"), a California nonprofit involved with math and science education. The organization is continuing to work with schools to improve the use of technology in education.\n\nNetDay was established to take place over the course of one Saturday, whereby designated schools would receive full connection to the Internet. Activities were coordinated at the website \"netday.org\". The HTML Writers Guild (quoting the NetDay FAQ) defined the day as an:\n\nSome argued that access to the Internet should not be a priority when schools lack even basic resources like library books (although in many cases the project added needed materials and efforts to computing projects already underway).\n\nThe first NetDay was held on March 9, 1996. NetDay '96 created considerable excitement amongst participating schools. The day was organized via the website \"netday96.com\". 20,000 volunteers helped to wire 20 percent of California schools to the Internet. 2,500 wiring kits were donated by telephone companies. Of the first event, John Gage commented, \"NetDay96 is a demonstration of what can happen when people coalesce around a community project [...] In one day, we can begin to reverse California's abysmal record of putting technology into its classrooms.\"\n\nPresident Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were also involved with NetDay '96, spending the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his challenge the previous September to \"Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway by the end of this school year\" was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of \"absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen\". Clinton acknowledged the support of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis, Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative George Miller.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was \"to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century.\" Gore also stated that the administration planned \"to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000\".\n\nAnother NetDay was held that same year in October in Silicon Valley, involving 80 companies and approximately 3500 volunteers helping to network 172 schools. The campaign was called Smart Schools NetDay II and was coordinated by Smart Valley, Inc., a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, part of the initiatives at Joint Venture: Silicon Valley.\n\nOn April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and \"who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country\" via \"an interactive online session with children across the country.\" Volunteers continued to play a central role in NetDay school wiring activities, and by the end of 2001, NetDay events were held in 40 states and engaged more than 500,000 volunteers to wire more than 75,000 classrooms across the USA. Archived versions of the NetDay Web site, netday.org, say that NetDay events were planned for March 20, 1999, April 8, 2000, October 28, 2000, March 31, 2001 and October 27, 2001.\n\nIn its last four years of operation, NetDay changed its focus from one or two days a year to wire schools to the Internet. Its new events and activities included collaborating with Join Hands Day in 2002, and three new initiatives: NetDay TechDay, NetDay Speakup Day and TESS - Technology Enhancing Student Success.\n\nIn February 2006, NetDay merged with Project Tomorrow, a national education nonprofit organization.\n\n\n"}

It is aimed at children aged 10 and up.\n\nPlayers create, direct, and perform mystery plays in a lifelike theatre, featuring The Children's Theatre Company actors in period costumes. They do this by manipulating multimedia including 40 actors, 100 sets, and 300 props to create stories. Lighting, music, and sound effects can be later added. To access an item, players first choose the Category Viewer to choose the category, then next the Item Viewer to choose the item. Double-clicking on the item places it onto the stage. The game was curriculum-driven; it aimed to allow students to use their creativity to write scripts and create plays for assessments, and to use their imagination.\n\nA timer helps synchronise actions, while the recorder is used to capture action. Text-to-speech technology allows the player to hear the character say what they have written; however if words are mispronounced they are encouraged to type the words out phonetically instead. \"Star Tribune\" commented that the dialogue can either appear at the bottom of the screen like movie subtitles, or spoken in a \"Stephen Hawking monotone\".\n\nThe actors were added by first being filmed or photographed then digitized into the game, in a similar vein to \"Mortal Kombat\".\n\nA bonus expansion pack named \"Opening Night Behind the Scenes\" was released in 1995 on Windows 3.1 and Macintosh. It was developed in cooperation with The Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis and published by MECC. The disk illustrated how the game was made and showed how a theatre operates. Players could watch interviews by industry professionals from The Children's Theatre Company and look up terms in a glossary. The CD also include Quicktime movies showing tours of different aspects of the theatre.\n\nDale LaFrenz, MECC president and chief executive officer, commented that she expected \"Opening Night\", alongside \"MayaQuest\" and \"Math Munchers Deluxe\", to be released in time for the pre-holiday selling season of 1995.\n\nThe game was the 73rd best-selling title during the November–December 1995 period (holiday season).\n\n\"Star Tribune\" positively compared MECC's \"Opening Night\" (1995) to The Learning Company's \"The American Girls Premiere\" (1997), which the newspaper considered to be a mere repackaging of the MECC video game. While \"The American Girls Premiere\" offered players the ability to record their own voices, \"Star Tribune\" otherwise considered it to be redundant to the earlier game, and thought \"Opening Night\"'s fans would find the newer title unnecessary. \"The Washington Post\" thought the game would only appeal to fully-fledged theatre enthusiasts, while turning off more casual creative types. \"Macs For Teachers\" described the product as \"very cool\".\n\nWilliam T. Yates of \"The School House Review\" and \"World Village\" gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, commenting that the game would increase players' interest in and love of the theatre. Anne Bubnic of \"Pep Holiday Hits\" thought the game was for \"aspiring actors and actresses\", and chose it as one of the best picks for the holiday season. \"Gamervescent\", for which \"Opening Night\" was their first video game, wrote retrospectively that over time they learnt that the title unleashed the \"greatest unintentional hilarity of all time\". \"Theatre in Cyberspace\" wrote that the game was elegant and that it could be more directly applied to the classroom. \n\nA series of plays from the game have been uploaded to YouTube.\n\n"}

Where a person has a specific budget allocated to pay for their social care, this portfolio of person centred thinking tools (a 'person centred description') can also be extremely useful as a basis to write a support plan, which explains how they will use this budget to meet what is important to and for them.\n\nPerson centred thinking was first developed by a group of people practicing Essential Lifestyle Planning in the US (now known as 'The Learning Community for Person Centred Practices). These planners realised that while many plans were being written, many of these were not leading to real change in peoples lives. This group decided that person centred planning was something a small group of people needed to know, but that for planning to work, a much wider group of people need skills around listening for what's important to people and how to best support people. Michael Smull who is a leading figure in this group describes Person centred thinking as \"something that virtually everyone who touches a person needs to know\" because change was most powerful when all staff were using person centred thinking tools in their roles, rather than relying solely on person centred planning facilitators to create plans. To enable these tools to be shared at scale, Essential Lifestyle Planning was 'deconstructed' into a range of person centred thinking tools, that enable staff to participate with the person in a cycle of listening, learning and action by building up a set of tools recording this process to form a person centred description of the person.\n\nPerson Centred Thinking, like other person centred approaches is based in the values of independence and rights, coproduction, choice and control and inclusive and competent communities.\n\n"}

Depending on the particular certification, qualifications may include completing a course of study, proof of professional accomplishments, achieving a specified grade on an examination. The intention is to establish that an individual holding a certification is technically qualified to hold certain types of position within the field.\n\nCertifications, generally, need to be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period (e.g. the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continual learning — often termed continuing education — or earning continuing education units (CEU). Certification is often used in the professions of information technology industry.\n\nSome certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and are managed by the vendors of these technologies. These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.\n\n\nThird-party commercial organizations, trade associations, and vendor-neutral interest groups that sponsor certifications include:\n\nGeneral certification of software practitioners has struggled. The ACM had a professional certification program in the early 1980s, which was discontinued due to lack of interest. Today, the IEEE is certifying software professionals, but only about 500 people have passed the exam .\n\nIn an information systems environment that requires formal security accreditation, \"Certification\" refers to the comprehensive evaluation of the technical and non-technical security features of an information system.\n\nCertification is formally defined by Krutz and Vines as:\n\nThe current proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained) has led some technologists to question their value. Advanced training content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise beyond the certification material. Certifying agencies have responded in various ways: some now incorporate hands-on elements, anti-cheating methodologies or have expanded their content. Others have expired and restructured their certificate programs, and/or raised their fees to deter abuse.\n\nResearch on college students and high school students has been done to determine whether relevant Information Technology industry certification is an asset to the teaching profession as they appear to be in the business world.\n\nThe studies investigated CIS/IT student perceptions and outcomes of certified and non-certified instructors. As observed by Adelman, many post-secondary CIS/IT faculty were unconcerned about the emergence in the 1990s of “a new, parallel universe of postsecondary credentials”, Anderson and Reimers found that CIS/IT students were keenly aware if their instructors had them. For example, certain certifications DOD 8570.1M are the only commercial certifications that the Department of Defense will accept towards meeting their Information Assurance hiring requirements.\n\nThe studies found a significant difference in learning outcomes between technology courses taught by certified and non-certified instructors; students whose instructors held IT industry certifications had higher levels of achievement than their non-certified peers and that college undergraduate students showed a significantly greater perception of their instructor’s effectiveness, teaching skills, professor technical expertise, and their own engagement in their classes with certified professors. Randall & Zirrkle (2005) noted a distinction between high school students and college students result benefit and the type of certification (vendor neutral and vendor-specific).\n\nIT Certifications are considered as a standard of IT knowledge by most of the giant technology companies around the world. Best knowledge of up to date technologies is ensured by continuously updating the versions of certifications by the specific vendors.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense Directive 8570.1, signed in August 2004, requires every full- and part-time military service member, defense contractor, civilian and foreign employee with privileged access to a DoD system, regardless of job series or occupational specialty, to obtain a commercial certification credential that has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n8570.1 established certification requirements in 3 levels: Level I, II, and III was categorized into IAM - Information Assurance Management and IAT - Information Assurance Technician. Since its implementation the IT enterprise landscape has changed dramatically with the implementation of mobility, cloud computing, and cybersecurity areas of increased emphasis.\n\nAs a result, the NICE - National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education was established to form the NICCS portal - National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies. This initiative was a public/private collaboration and resulted in the publishing of The Framework 1.0. Since the initial framework has established it has been enhanced and published as The Framework 2.0 and has morphed into the DoD 8140 Directive which is anticipated to be in full implementation by December 2015. This framework breaks down into seven (7) categories and establishes 31 KSA's (Key Specialty Areas), which fundamentally are silos within the IT landscape.\n\n"}

This company was called firstly the \"Roy Hart Actor Singers\", and then the Roy Hart Theatre.\n\nUnder the direction of Roy Hart, the Roy Hart Theatre evolved into a group of performers who devised and presented experimental performances noted for the way the members utilized extended vocal technique to create verbal and nonverbal drama and music, which had a substantial influence on the work of notable contemporaries of the European avant garde, including Peter Brook who subsequently incorporated extended vocal technique into his productions, Jerzy Grotowski, who made vocal expression a central feature to his rehearsal techniques and performances, Karlheinz Stockhausen who adapted works for Hart, and Peter Maxwell Davies who composed \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\" especially for Roy Hart's voice. Roose-Evans\n\nRoy Hart died in 1974, shortly after the Roy Hart Theatre moved permanently from London to Malérargues, Southern France. However, the remaining members continued the work begun by Alfred Wolfsohn and extended by Hart, through teaching extended vocal technique and staging dramatic and musical performances that utilized a vocal range and flexibility greater than that commonly heard in speech and song. The Roy Hart Theatre centre in Malérargues is still active today.\n\nAlfred Wolfsohn was a Jewish German who suffered auditory hallucinations of screaming soldiers, whom he had witnessed dying whilst serving as a stretcher bearer in the trenches of World War I. He was subsequently diagnosed with shell shock, and after failing to benefit from psychiatry, hypnosis, and medication, cured himself by vocalizing the extreme sounds he had heard and later hallucinated, before developing an approach to singing lessons intended to be therapeutic for his students.\n\nWolfsohn developed and taught techniques that were originally intended as psychotherapeutic, to a regular group of students, some of whom studied with him for almost twenty years, at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre in Berlin from 1935 - 1939 and in London from 1943 until 1962 when he died. Among these students was Roy Hart, who began studying with Wolfsohn in 1947.\n\nAs a consequence of Wolfsohn's extended vocal technique, his students developed highly flexible and expressive voices, some of them in excess of five octaves.\n\nDuring the three years prior to Wolfsohn's death, this group of students began to demonstrate the artistic use of their vocal expressiveness in vocal music, poetry, and drama, to invited guests. After Alfred Wolfsohn died, Roy Hart expanded upon this tradition, acting as stage director and performer in theatre productions that used a range of vocal expression beyond that employed in most Western drama and music performances of that time.\n\nRoy Hart studied English and Psychology at the Witwatersrand University, Johannesburg before coming to England to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He records:\n\nI came to England from South Africa…I won a scholarship to RADA and was told I had a good voice and stage personality. Yet I had known for some time that my voice was not rooted, not literally embodied... On leaving RADA I was immediately offered a most promising opening in the Theatre…I made an extraordinary choice. I turned down the proffered 'big chance' in order to research into the nature and meaning of the human voice.\n\nRoy Hart began taking lessons with Alfred Wolfsohn in 1947. Upon his teacher's death in 1962 the long-standing attendants of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre divided with Hart taking leadership of one group who were joined by students of Hart's acting lessons whilst the other group continued their attempts to maintain the centre and its therapeutic focus.\n\nThe work of both the Roy Hart Theatre and the Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre was documented in writing, film, photographs, and phonograph recordings by author, film maker, and archivist Leslie Shepard.\n\nThis documentation was used as the primary material upon which to base written papers that Hart read in 1963 at the Jung Institute in London; in 1964 at the Sixth International Congress for Psychotherapy in London; in 1967 at the Seventh International Congress for Psychotherapy in Wiesbaden; in 1968 at the Third International Congress of Psychodrama in Vienna; in 1970 at the Sixth International Conference for Psychodrama in Zagreb; and in 1972 at the Seventh International Congress of Psychodrama in Tokyo.\n\nThe papers presented by Hart made two fundamental points.\n\nFor the first few years following Wolfsohn's death, Hart continued seeking to gain recognition of nonverbal vocalization, drama, and experimental vocal music as an efficacious form of psychotherapy, and in 1965, members of the Roy Hart Theatre began working with patients at Shenley Psychiatric Hospital, St. Albans in Hertfordshire. However, during the ten years after Wolfsohn's death, the emphasis of the Roy Hart Theatre shifted substantially towards performing arts, and the potential therapeutic benefits of singing and vocalizing became subsidiary and secondary to the work and vision of Hart's company.\n\nIn 1985 Paul Newham began vocal training with Roy Hart Theatre member Enrique Pardo, learning techniques derived from Wolfsohn and Hart. Newham subsequently collaborated with Leslie Sheppard in analysing the written, phonographic, and photographic documentation that the archivist had curated at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre.\n\nNewham later reformulated and expanded some of the techniques established by Alfred Wolfsohn and furthered by Hart, proposing the foundations for a form of expressive therapy based on the use of song, prayer, and other forms of vocal expression. Newham's expansion upon Wolfsohn's and Hart's work was to some degree appropriated into the expressive therapies, but the use of song in mainstream therapeutic practice remains marginal. At the time of Wolfsohn's, Hart's and Newham's work, there was scant scientific research into the clinical use of singing, whist today there is some evidence to indicate the possible rehabilitative and therapeutic application of nonverbal musical vocalization with some populations. Nonetheless, this field of inquiry is in its infancy even now, and in the face of little opportunity to further Wolfsohn's original vision of 'singing as therapy', Hart steered the group towards artistic application of extended vocal technique.\n\nWhen Hart began teaching acting classes in London, he appropriated adaptations of Wolfsohn's extended vocal technique and also introduced and developed his own physical exercises that involved extensive bodily movement. These exercises became part of the training and rehearsal process undertaken by Roy Hart's theatre company, leading to performances that were often described as an example of physical theatre.\nIn 1965 the Roy Hart Theatre company began rehearsing a performance of the \"Bacchae\", and having met Philip Vellacott, used his translation. Initial presentations of the \"Bacchae\" were attended by Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, R.D. Laing, Irene Worth, Jean Louis Barrault, and Peter Maxwell Davies.\n\nMaxwell Davies subsequently composed a full length piece for Roy Hart called \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\". The world premier of this piece was performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 22 April 1969, with subsequent performances given internationally. In a review of \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\" in the newspaper \"Die Welt\", Heinz Joachim said:\n\nRoy Hart is an artist who commands not only all the voices of the human register – ranging from the deepest bass to the highest soprano, but also (incredibly enough) the ability to produce several sounds simultaneously; added to which he gives an acting performance which stretches from the most tender allusiveness to the most macabre realism. All this is (as banal as the formulation may sound) simply phenomenal, unique, sensational. Yet it lay beyond all 'sensation'. It was so deeply stamped by immediate experience; it was the art of presentation which, at every moment, uses the means available in a conscious way, and yet never transgresses the borderline that leads to trash...the solo part is specifically written for Roy Hart. Probably no other artist could realise this part so penetratingly.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1974, Roy Hart presented the world premier of a work composed especially for him by Hans Werner Henze entitled \"Versuch über Schweine\", performed with the English Chamber Orchestra at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. He also performed a piece by Karlheinz Stockhausen called \"Spiral\", which the composer adapted for Hart's voice. In addition, the entire group, under the name the Roy Hart Theatre, performed pieces they devised themselves using vocal techniques derived from Alfred Wolfsohn combined with voice and movement exercises developed by Hart, which were performed at The Place and the Round House theatres in London. Reviewing a performance at the Round House, Herbert Kretzmer wrote in the \"Daily Express\" newspaper:\n\nOn an enormous poster on the walls of the Round House are painted the words: 'Language is dead. Long live the voice.' Inside the building about two dozen dedicated and mostly very young people celebrate and explore and bend the human voice…Watching this is like chancing upon a group therapy session in full cry. Rejecting the repressive and limiting cadences of traditional languages, they croak, scream, cry like seagulls, sing sweetly, and shout hoarsely. The impact and the insight are sometimes stunning. I have never seen actors giving quite so much of themselves. \n\nIn addition to London-based performances, Roy Hart performed pieces at festivals and venues in Spain, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Some were solo performances by Hart, others used the whole Roy Hart Theatre troupe, including \"Mariage de Lux\" by Serge Béhar, and \"Ich Bin\" by Paul Pörtner, both works especially written for the group. The Roy Hart Theatre also collaborated with some of the actors from Peter Brook's troupe in a devised performance.\n\nIn \"Lettres Françaises\" under the title of \"Voice and Madness – Echo of the Origin of Man\", Catherine Clément described her experience of witnessing a performance by the Roy Hart Theatre as like being in the presence of the unconscious. \nIn the summer of 1974, the group of performers known as The Roy Hart Theatre, which included some who like Hart had worked with Alfred Wolfsohn for many years, as well as others who had studied acting with Hart, moved to the Chateau de Malérargues, in Thoiras, near Saint-Jean-du-Gard, in southern France intending to establish a permanent rehearsal studio, theatre, and training school to explore further the artistic application of the extended vocal technique.\n\nA year later, Roy Hart, along with his wife and a third member of the troupe, died in a car accident. However, the group retained the name Roy Hart Theatre, and continued to perform locally, nationally, and internationally, as well as teaching extended vocal technique to actors and singers.\n\n"}
{"id": "382594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382594", "title": "Suzuki method", "text": "Suzuki method\n\nThe Suzuki method is an internationally known music curriculum and teaching philosophy dating from the mid-20th century, created by Japanese violinist and pedagogue Shinichi Suzuki (1898–1998). The method aims to create an environment for learning music which parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good moral character.\n\nThe Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Suzuki, a Japanese violinist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of World War II. As a skilled violinist but a beginner at the German language who struggled to learn it, Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, and even dialects adults consider \"difficult\" to learn are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their native language, they have the necessary ability to become proficient on a musical instrument. \n\nHe pioneered the idea that preschool age children could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body. He modeled his method, which he called , after his theories of natural language acquisition. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with \"noble hearts\" (as opposed to creating famous musical prodigies).\n\nThe central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their environment. The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the \"right environment\" for learning music (he believed that this positive environment would also help to foster excellent character in every student). These components include:\n\n\nThe method discourages competitive attitudes between players, and advocates collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level. However, this does not mean the elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.\n\nThe parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day, instead of leaving the child to practice alone between lessons, and to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively. This element of the method is so prominent that a newspaper article once dubbed it \"The Mom-Centric Method.\"\n\nAlthough Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a \"school of violin playing\" (like the French or the Russian schools of playing) whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin. However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of \"tonalization\", were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method. Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each discipline.\n\n\nThe core Suzuki literature is published on audio recordings and in sheet music books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading. One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make quality recordings of the beginners' pieces widely available, performed by professional musicians. Many traditional (non-Suzuki trained) music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire, often to supplement their curriculum, and they adapt the music to their own philosophies of teaching.\n\nAnother innovation of Suzuki was to deliberately leave out the large amount of technical instructions and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day. He favored a focus on melodic song-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises. Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.\n\nSuzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide, and although it focuses on Western European \"classical\" music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers: one does not have to share the ethnic or national origin of the composers in order to learn or share the music. Suzuki created a series of rhythmic variations on the theme \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\", using rhythms from more advanced literature in units small enough for a beginner to grasp quickly. Although these variations were created for violin, most of the instruments use them as a starting point for their repertoire.\n\nThe violin method was compiled and edited by Suzuki. In ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki's Variations on \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" and ending with two Mozart concertos. The first 3 books are mostly graded arrangements of music not originally written for solo violin, although book 1 contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin & piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as Bach, Telemann, Dvořák, Beethoven, Schubert, Handel, Paganini, Boccherini and Brahms. Books 4–10 continue the graded selection by incorporating 'standard' or 'traditional' student violin solos by Seitz, Vivaldi, Bach, Veracini, Corelli, Dittersdorf, Rameau, Handel, Mozart, Fiocco, and others. The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in books 6-8. The SAA supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by Bach, Kreisler, Elgar, Bartok, Shostakovich, Copland, and others (Suggested Supplementary Repertoire, 2013, and Preucil, 1985).\n\nAudio recordings for books 1–4 are available in separate albums by artists such as David Nadien, David Cerone, Yukari Tate and Shin'ichi Suzuki. More recent recordings of volumes 1–4 by William Preucil, Jr. were released in 2007, along with revised versions of the first 4 books. Recordings for books 5–8 have been made by Koji Toyoda, although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artist's albums. In 2008 Takako Nishizaki made a complete set of recordings of Books 1-8 for Naxos Records. There are no official recordings of books 9 and 10 but these books, simply being Mozart's A major and D major violin concertos, have readily available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the Bruch and Mendelssohn concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as Paradis,\nMozart, and Kreisler.\n\nThe viola repertoire is in nine volumes, compiled and edited by Doris Preucil. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the Baroque period. The first 3 volumes have been arranged (or transposed) almost directly from the first 3 violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature. The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Viola volumes 4-8 include works by Telemann, Casadesus, Bach, Mendelssohn, Vivaldi, Leclair, Hummel,and Bruch. Books 1–4 have been recorded on two albums by William Preucil, and the rest are available in separate albums.\n\nThe cello repertoire is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes, and the first distinct piece (the second) being \"French Folk Song\". Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi performs volumes 1 through 4. Volumes 4–10 contain works by: Vivaldi, Saint-Saëns, Popper, Breval, Goltermann, Squire, Bach, Paradis, Eccles, Fauré, von Goens, Sammartini, Haydn, and Boccherini.\n\nThe piano repertoire is composed of seven volumes. The first book begins with Variations on \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second book, there are pieces written by romantic, classical and baroque composers, such as Robert Schumann, Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Sebastian Bach. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with Minuet 1, Minuet 2 and the Gigue from Partita in B by J.S. Bach. The fifth book begins with the famous \"Für Elise\" by Beethoven and includes Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn. The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major, K.545 by W.A. Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major by Mozart. This book also includes \"The Harmonious Blacksmith\" by Handel and Romanian Folk Dances by Béla Bartók. There are also many minuets in the second book. The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published. The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been shifted to another volume. The book/CD combo for Revised Books 4-7 is now available, and was performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.\n\nCurrently there are five printed volumes in the double bass series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). Volume 1 and 2 contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by Handel, Gossec, Beethoven, Bach, Webster, Saint-Saëns, and Dvořák. Famous pieces include: The Elephant from Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, Ode to Joy by Beethoven, and Largo from the New World Symphony by Dvořák.\n\nThe flute repertoire is compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi. In fourteen volumes, beginning with Mary Had a Little Lamb and ending in the Flute Concerto by Otaka. Also included are concerti by Mozart, Cimarosa, Ibert and Quantz. Students also study music by Bach, Handel, Blavet, Fauré and other major composers.\n\nThere are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder. The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\", several Bach Minuets, etc. Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.\n\nThe classical guitar repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay. The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the lute in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by Sanz, Vivaldi, Bach, Carcassi, Giuliani, Sor, Tarrega, Albéniz, Mudarra, and Yocoh's Sakura Variations. Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown. George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and William Kanengiser recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of Recuerdos de la Alhambra in book 9, which was recorded by Scott Tennant.\n\nThe harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes. This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique. Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note. Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.\n\nThe voice repertoire is in five Levels. Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.\n\nThe pipe organ repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998. Currently Volumes 1-4 have been published, Volumes 5 & 6 will be published shortly, and material for Volumes 7 & 8 is being researched. (Suzuki Organ website, 2010). As of 2011, an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of Newcastle.\n\nThe application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.\n\nAlthough early childhood education (ECE) is not an instrument, a curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE has been developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O'Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI). Also, a \"modified\" Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes & string orchestras in schools.\n\nTrumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association's list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).\n\nSupplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, duets, trios, string orchestra, and string quartet arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Japan's borders were opened to trade with the outside world, and in particular to the importation of Western Culture. As a result of this, Suzuki's father, who owned a company which had manufactured the Shamisen, began to manufacture violins instead. (\"Nurture by Love\" Documentary) In his youth, Shin'ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a phonograph recording of Franz Schubert's Ave Maria, as played on violin by Mischa Elman. Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father's factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument \"by ear\". His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son's social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument. At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him. Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, \"Nurtured by Love\")\n\nAt age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies. While there, he studied privately with Karl Klingler, but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma. He met and became friends with Albert Einstein, who encouraged him in learning classical music. He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud.(Suzuki, \"Nurtured by Love\")\n\nIn 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in Matsumoto, Japan shortly after the end of World War II. Raising children with \"noble hearts\" (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and \"nurtured by love\" in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. (Hermann, 1981)\n\nEventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto. TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees). Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers. These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in Africa), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).\n\nJohn D. Kendall of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (\"Nurtured by Love\" Documentary). Vilem Sokol of the Seattle Youth Symphony hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system. Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include Roland and Almita Vamos, Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, Betty Haag, Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1435769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1435769", "title": "Target tug", "text": "Target tug\n\nA target tug is an aircraft which tows an unmanned drone, a fabric drogue or other kind of target, for the purposes of gun or missile target practice. Target tugs are often conversions of transport and utility aircraft, as well as obsolescent combat types. Some, such as the Miles Martinet, were specially designed for the role. It was, and is, a relatively hazardous job, as live fire is typically employed and the people doing the shooting are usually still in training.\n\nPrior to and during World War II target tugs were typically operated by the air arms on behalf of which they flew, and were usually conversions of aircraft that had failed in combat or that were otherwise unsuitable or obsolete in their design roles (see Fairey Battle and Short Sturgeon). These aircraft typically trailed a drogue fabric sleeve at the end of a several-thousand metre long cable. Student fighter pilots or air gunners would shoot at the target from other aircraft using painted bullets so that hits could be recorded and later analysed.\n\nIn the RAF, Miles Master IIs were used for this purpose as part of the Target Towing Flight at the Central Gunnery School whilst the School was based at RAF Sutton Bridge from April 1942 to March 1944. Other aircraft used in this role were the Hawker Henley, the Boulton Paul Defiant and the Westland Lysander, although the RAF was by no means the only air arm to use target tugs. They were used by most air forces. The USAAF used older aircraft such as the TBD Devastator as target tugs, and the Luftwaffe and the VVS (Red Army) also used them.\n\nThe chief modifications to the aircraft were a station for the drogue operator and a winch to reel in the cable prior to landing. The winch was typically powered by a small wind-turbine on the outside of the aircraft, driven by the airflow and attached to the winch via a clutch. Such devices are still used by some aerial refueling tankers to retract the refueling hose after the operation is completed. The drogue would often be jettisoned at some location convenient for recovery prior to the aircraft's landing. The drogue itself caused a great deal of drag and could be dangerous, particularly to less-powerful aircraft. If the engine failed, the drag from the drogue could be enough to reduce the airspeed of the aircraft below stall speed before the drogue could be jettisoned (see Hawker Henley).\n\nThe use of such aircraft continued post-war, although a trend developed whereby ex-military aircraft were purchased, modified and operated by civilian companies under contract. Deutsche-Luftfahrt Beratungsdienst of West Germany and Svensk Flygtjänst AB of Sweden were two notable companies in the field in the post-war years, operating such types as the Hawker Sea Fury, Fairey Firefly and Douglas Skyraider. Many air arms however continued to operate target tugs on their own behalf.\n\nIn later years the use of civilian companies expanded significantly worldwide, with many companies forming or entering the field in the 1960s and 1970s. The trend was still to use ex-military aircraft, for example Fawcett Aviation in Australia used two ex-RAAF CAC Mustangs from 1960 until the latter part of the 1970s. Flight Systems Inc. commenced operations at Mojave, California with Canadair Sabres converted as QF-86E missile targets, the first aircraft making its first unmanned flight in April 1975; this company later also operated Sabres as target tugs. Flight Systems Inc was later purchased by Tracor and these operations are still performed by BAE Systems Flight Systems with Douglas Skyhawks. The practice of using ex-military aircraft as target tugs (and of air arms retaining older aircraft themselves for such use) resulted in them surviving into an era where such aircraft became desirable as Warbirds; many former target tugs are now to be found on the airshow circuit or under restoration to fly, and in aviation museums.\n\nToday, more air arms have turned to civilian companies for provision of target towing services. Many companies operating in this field today do so using modified corporate jet aircraft instead of ex-military aircraft. Advantages of operating civil aircraft types include ease of registration (it being difficult in many countries to register ex-military jets as civil aircraft), ease of maintenance and lower operating costs when compared to ex-military aircraft. Companies active in 2007 providing target towing services include FR Aviation Services Ltd. in the UK and associated companies AVdef (in France) and Falcon Special Air Services (in Malaysia) using Falcon 20s; Pel-Air in Australia using Learjets and (in something of a reversal of recent trends) EIS Aircraft Gmbh in Germany using Pilatus PC-9 aircraft.\n\nTarget towing operations are not without risk. On September 17, 1994 a Golden Eagle Aviation Lear 35A was accidentally shot down by a ship of the Taiwanese Navy during a live-fire exercise. In 2014, another Lear 35A crashed in Germany with an Eurofighter Typhoon during a training exercise with the Luftwaffe.\n\n"}

{"id": "24943907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24943907", "title": "Uganda Rural Fund", "text": "Uganda Rural Fund\n\nUganda Rural Fund (URF) is a grassroots non-governmental organization working in Southwestern Uganda, primarily in the Masaka and Rakai Districts. URF states that its mission is to “to empower orphans, impoverished youth, and women to fight poverty in Uganda’s rural communities, through the creation of educational and sustainable development opportunities.” URF attempts to give community members the tools and resources to better their own lives and the lives of those around them.\n\nUganda Rural Fund began in 2005, when John Mary Lugemwa, OSB, Peter Francis Luswata, and Rev. Mike Lillpopp discussed setting up an organization to help rural Ugandans, They brainstormed ways to help. With the support of contacts across the globe, they created the organization. The organization began with two branches, one in Uganda and one in the United States. It briefly expanded to a third branch in Canada.,\n\nURF's initial project was to build a school on land donated by the Waliggo family, in the small village of Molubere, near Kyetume village, in the Masaka District. From its groundbreaking in January 2006 to its opening on May 26, 2008, Hope Integrated Academy relied volunteers both in Uganda and throughout the world., Volunteers fundraised, worked to install wells and a water purifying system, improved the electric system, and helped in numerous other ways. URF created drafts for future extensions to the campus.\n\nAs the construction of Hope Academy continued, URF branched out to other projects regarding education, community development, and health. Volunteers provided support for the projects., URF also sought to partner with compatible organizations, such as Engineers Without Borders, Architecture for Humanity, and Uganda Cares.,\n\nURF attempted to find sustainable methods and on-going solutions to community needs. Following this aim, URF changed paradigms in 2011 to let the communities served, rather than people associated with URF, identify needs and to have URF play a supporting role,\n\nURF-Uganda, which is a registered community-based organization (CBO), serves as the home base for URF and is responsible for most of the on-the-ground aspects of the organization. This branch is the most directly involved in all of URF's activities.\n\nThe Kampala Chapter is a group of \"young professionals and university students\" who support URF's mission, both directly and indirectly.\n\nURF-USA is a registered 501(c)3 organization. It was incorporated in the state of Massachusetts in 2005, but has groups all over the United States. The functions of this branch are of a more supportive nature. This branch helps raise awareness, raises funding, and coordinates volunteers.\n\nURF-Canada no longer exists., It also took a supporting role to URF-Uganda.\n\nURF’s initial project, Hope Integrated Academy is a secondary school and vocational school. Students receive instruction in accordance with the guidelines set out by Uganda's Ministry of Education (see education in Uganda for more information). These classes are supplemented with extra life-skill and business-skill courses. \nHope Integrated Academy was intended to serve orphans, especially those whose parents had died from the complications of AIDS, as well as youth who could not afford to attend school., Some students pay tuition fees and others’ costs are covered by sponsors.\n\nURF provides other educational services. Hope Integrated Academy offers an after school program with both instructional and recreational activities., URF holds adult literacy classes and computer classes.,\n\nThe school houses a small library and a computing center., Although much of these resources are geared towards the students attending Hope, they are also open to the public.,\n\nURF has several community development projects. These projects include a number of youth clubs and programs, Women’s groups, and Men’s groups. The organization puts on various workshops. It also provides such things as village banking services and microfinance.\n\nURF has also assisted Nazareth Children's home, a nearby orphanage, and provided support services to child-headed families—families in which older children care for younger siblings after the parents have died.\n\nURF sponsors a number of agricultural programs that promote sustainability. Most of them function similarly to Heifer International in that individuals and families are provided with an animal or bit of seeds and are then expected to pass on some of the offspring or resulting seeds to other community members.\n\nDuring the March 2010 mudslides in Uganda, URF helped provide emergency supplies. Some of the orphans collected food door-to-door. This type of disaster care was relatively new to Ugandan culture.\n\nWith the new Community Participatory Development Model, URF encouraged local villagers to identify and prioritize needs.,\n\nAs possible, URF provides health services to the community. Services include health education, direct care, and transportation to a hospital, URF, in partnership with Uganda Cares, has offered \"free HIV testing and counseling\". URF worked to reduce the threat of Malaria. For example, part of the reason for building a new dormitory at Nazareth Children's home was that the existing building did not keep out mosquitoes, which contributed to the spread of Malaria. The organization also distributed mosquito nets.\n\n"}
{"id": "32760471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32760471", "title": "Undergraduate real estate programs", "text": "Undergraduate real estate programs\n\nThe study of real estate at the undergraduate level is commonly contained as a degree of Bachelor of Science in Real Estate or a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in real estate. A very limited number of universities offer a full \"Bachelor of Science in Real Estate\" and have \"Real Estate\" departments in their respective Colleges within the University. With the maturity of Master of Real Estate Development programs, universities are now looking at also offering specialized undergraduate education in real estate.\n\nMany of the programs ranked by \"U.S. News and World Report\" are Bachelor of Business Administration or Bachelor of Science programs though some, such as University of Florida, Cornell University, and University of Illinois, only offer minors in Real Estate or majors in Finance \"with emphasis in Real Estate\". While business schools continue to attract future real estate professionals, many critics of business education have many complaints. Some say the schools have become too scientific, too detached from real-world issues. Others say students are taught to come up with hasty solutions to complicated problems. Another group contends that schools give students a limited and distorted view of their role - that they graduate with a focus on maximizing shareholder value and only a limited understanding of ethical and social considerations essential to business leadership. Such shortcomings may have left business school graduates inadequately prepared to make the decisions that, taken together, might have helped mitigate the financial and real estate crisis, critics say. An alternative course of study to an undergraduate degree in business or real estate is the liberal arts, such as economics, public administration, urban planning, or geography. An aspiring real estate professional may supplement his education with a Master of Real Estate Development degree, a common prerequisite for many institutional and corporate real estate firms.\n\nThe U.S. News and World Report ranks the top 13 undergraduate programs which offer a study in real estate. However, many schools on the U.S. News and World Reports list (University of Florida and Cornell University, for example) do not actually offer undergraduate degrees (majors) in Real Estate, and alternatively run a \"focus\" or \"minor\" in Real Estate under their Finance departments. Additionally there are many non-business schools that offer other real estate related degrees.

It offers both pre-professional training and general education in the departments of chemistry, earth system science, mathematics, and physics and astronomy. The school enrolls 1,400 undergraduate and graduate students and is one of the top schools in the nation in the number of degrees it confers in the area of physical sciences. It also offers specializations such as biochemistry, statistics, math for economics, applied and computational mathematics, astrophysics, applied physics, biomedical physics, and education.\nIn 1995, the school gained international prominence when Frank Sherwood Rowland, a professor in chemistry and Frederick Reines, a professor in physics, won the Nobel Prize in their respective fields. It was the first time two people won the prize in the same year in two different fields at the same public university.\n\nThe School of Physical Sciences was established in 1965, as one of the founding schools of the University of California, Irvine.\n\n\nThere were 1208 Undergraduate students and 516 Graduate students as of Fall 2014.\n\nAll four departments confer Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees.\n\nThe school possesses 5 undergraduate majors, each providing either a bachelor of science degree or a bachelor of arts degree. The majors that are available are Chemistry, Earth System Science, Environmental Science, Mathematics, and Physics.\n\nThe School of Physical Sciences provides 1 masters level graduate program in Chemistry and 4 doctorate level graduate programs, including programs in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and Earth System Science.\n\nThe Department of Chemistry offers Ph.D. degrees in all major sub-disciplines of chemistry, along with several interdisciplinary programs. These programs include Analytical Chemistry, Atmospheric Chemistry, Chemical Biology, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Theoretical Chemistry, Chemicals and Materials Physics, and Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology. As of Fall 2014, there were about 40 faculty members, 240 graduate students, and 50 postdoctoral fellows in the chemistry program. There is also a master's degree program in Chemistry offered, along with a master's degree program in Chemistry with a Teaching Credential.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics offers a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics as well as a master's degree in Mathematics.

It provides academic and career guidance to undergraduates, as well as opportunities to meet and interact with guests or professors from the field of Chemistry.\n\nThe \"Anteaters Mathematics Club\" is the student-run Mathematics Club at UCI. It provides weekly guest lectures from professors, graduate students, or others in the field of Mathematics. The \"Anteaters Math Club\" also provides a quarterly panel with Mathematics professionals for a Q&A with students.\n\nThe \"UCI Earth System Club\" is a student-run club based on Earth System Science. The club provides students with information regarding the Earth System Science major as well as networking opportunities.\n\nThe \"Society of Physics Students at UC Irvine\" is UCI's chapter of the Society of Physics Students. The club conducts and organizes events to help students develop interest in physics, as well as providing areas for study.\n\nThe \"Astronomy Club at UCI\" is a student-run club based on Astronomy. The club provies students with opportunities to meet other students interested in Astronomy, and often utilizes the UCI Observatory as well as the grounds of Aldrich Park for stargazing.\n\nFrank Sherwood Rowland was one of the original professors for the University of California, Irvine and became the first Chairman of the Chemistry Department in August 1964. He eventually retired from his Chairman position five years later, but by 1973 Rowland changed his research focus from radiochemistry to atmospheric chemistry. In 1995, Atmospheric Chemist F. Sherwood Rowland, along with his colleague Mario Molina both predicted and proved that the ozone layer was being depleted by chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), which was a common compound found in aerosol sprays. They both were awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery since then continued to research on the chemical effects towards the environment.\n\nDr.Frederick Reines began his research to prove the existence of the neutrino, one of the smallest subatomic particle structures, in 1918. When he came to serve as the founding Dean of Physical Sciences of the University of California, Irvine in 1966 he brought his research along with him. However, by 1974, Reines stepped down as the Dean in order to focus on his research and teaching as a professor. Eventually, Dr. Reined along with his colleague Clyde Cowan developed a method to detect the neutrino. This led him to receive his 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics. As a faculty member for UCI he received the Distinguished Faculty Lecturer Award in 1979 and the Medal for Outstanding Research in 1985, predating his Nobel Prize.\n\nIrwin Rose was a researcher within the School of Medicine but did extensive collaboration with the School of Physical Sciences. In 1997, Rose moved to the facilities in UCI while sharing a space with Ralph Bradshaw. Dr. Rose, along with colleagues at the Israel Institute of Technology discovered a major pathway in the body which proteins are regulated by degradation. Because ubiquitin is an important molecule that impacts cell growth and division, malfunctions or improper breakdowns of ubiquitin causes diseases such as cancer and cystic fibrosis. In 2004, Dr. Rose received a Nobel Prize in the field of Chemistry for his discoveries. Since then, he received the Nobel Laureate Parking Permit at UCI, which gives him free parking for a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Act provides for the establishment or designation of bodies to safeguard the academic standards of the university and to regulate the conduct of its affairs. The Act also grants the university the right and the power to award degrees (including research and honorary degrees), diplomas and certificates. The university curriculum portfolio specialises in areas that build on place and partnerships, with a focus on professional engagement and recognition of regional research policy and practice needs, as well as, the building of local capability. In addition, the university has the objective of contributing to Gibraltarian identity, history, current affairs and its role in the future economic, social and sustainable development of Gibraltar.\n\nThe University of Gibraltar follows the UK model of education and governance. It appointed Professor Daniella Tilbury as its inaugural Vice-Chancellor and CEO in March 2015. Lord Luce was appointed as the inaugural Chancellor in Sept 2015. The University of Gibraltar Act 2015 explicitly defines the academic freedom and institutional autonomy of the university. It conferred degree and research degree awarding powers - making it the only institution on the Rock that can award degrees. The Act outlines the responsibilities of the Vice Chancellor and defines the faculties and core areas of specialism of the institution which include business, sports, health, tourism and hospitality as well as environment and life sciences, Gibraltar and Mediterranean studies. It defines the role of the Board of Governors. The university follows UK standards of provision and has adopted the UK Quality Code for Higher Education (QAA) as its framework.\n\nThe idea for the University of Gibraltar came about after the formation of the new Government of Gibraltar by the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party in 2011. Plans for the University were officially launched in October 2014, including its location on Europa Point.\n\nThe University of Gibraltar was formally established in July 2015, at a cost of approximately £10 million to build. The goal was to develop the campus during the first term of office. The campus was opened on 21 September 2015 by the Hon Min Licudi, Minister for Education and Hon Fabian Picardo, Chief Minister. The university officially opened in September 2015, also hosting the International Calpe Conference the same month. At its opening, it became the first degree-granting university in Gibraltar.\n\nIn 2015, the university's Vice Chancellor, Professor Daniella Tilbury, represented the university along with Dr Liesl Mesilio-Torres at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference.\n\nIn early 2016 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) set up a Centre of Excellence at the University of Gibraltar,[8] conducting training, analysis and research in customs and international trade.\nThe University also hosted The University Educators for Sustainable Development (UE4SD) international conference. This event brought together 55 partners in 33 countries, aimed to change University education so that it can prepare students, regardless of course or specialisation, to understand and apply global responsibility.\n\nDuring the same year, the University of Gibraltar brought together a number of groups, organisations and individuals to help identify the professional needs of various industries and groups in the community. These Key Advisory Groups (KAGs) which comprise professionals in each sector are tasked with contributing to shaping the academic and professional portfolio of the University. Current KAGs include Business, Law, Tourism and Hospitality, and Sport. The University also convenes a Silver Education KAG that advises on the learning aspirations of those aged over 55 years. \nThe Sports Key Advisory Group chaired by Reagan Lima, CEO of Gibraltar Sports and Leisure Authority was established to guide decisions regarding programme and short courses which could be offered in this area. The group explores opportunities regarding formal degrees, professional body qualifications, practical skills and specialist training as well as leadership development offerings in the sports sector.\nTwo Government of Gibraltar Departments (Department of the Environment and Climate Change and Department of Education) and the University of Gibraltar, have partnered together to advance the transition to a low carbon economy and support innovative practice in local schools. The project is funded by the European Commission under the INTERREG programme.\n\nGibraltar Regulatory Authority (“the GRA”) appointed as the regulator of the University of Gibraltar \n\nOpen day showcases University of Gibraltar offering and saw members of the public enquire about studying at the University with a series of talks held outlining the different courses on offer.\n\nUniversity of Gibraltar is building an institution for student success and Ellucian Quercus Technology is at the core.\n\nThe University of Gibraltar has appointed Professor Catherine Bachleda as Acting Vice-Chancellor. Professor Bachleda was formerly the Deputy Vice-Chancellor. Her appointment comes after Professor Daniella Tilbury left her post as the University's Vice Chancellor & CEO; she's become the Government's first Commissioner for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe University of Gibraltar uses the UK model of education and offers programmes in four faculties:\n\nThe university's faculties are developed from internationally recognised as well as locally developed courses. It also has classes for qualifications in Gibraltar Tax and Gibraltar Law and includes a centre for research and an Institute of Professional Development and Continuing Education. The university also provides classes for English as a foreign or business language. The university is an approved and accredited centre for professional bodies including the Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) and the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx).\n\nThe University of Gibraltar offers Master's level programme:\n\nMaster’s in Marine Science and Climate change\n\nThe University offers two doctoral routes; by research and by publicationresearch programme.\n\nStudents can propose any Gibraltar and Mediterranean related subject with priority given to specified research themes:\nNeanderthals; Culture, Ecology and Extinction; Species, Climate Change and Conservation; Education for Sustainability and Energy Efficiency; The Constitutional Development of Gibraltar; Gambling and Responsible Behaviour; The Impact of Sport in Small Nations; Urban-Adapted Wildlife Species in Gibraltar; Marine Protected Species and Conservation; Education: Developing Pedagogies; Cultures and Identities of the Mediterranean; Archaeology of the Fortress town of Gibraltar and Gibraltar and Brexit; Challenges and Opportunities\n\nPhD by publication is aimed at individuals who, during the course of their lives, have made a significant authoritative contribution to the body of knowledge in a Gibraltar and/or Mediterranean-related specific subject area and have peer-reviewed published works. \n\nThe university delivers professional body qualifications courses and continuing professional development for graduates and working professionals in the following courses:\n\nIn June 2016 the university announced a postgraduate bursary scheme supported by the UK-based Friends of Gibraltar Heritage Society. The bursary scheme was created to support the work of any postgraduate student of the University who is undertaking history (including natural history) and heritage-related study and research. This annual bursary is open to students studying across a range of disciplines. The first bursary of £1,000 was awarded in March 2017.\n\nThe University of Gibraltar offers a Commonwealth Scholarship which is funded by HM Government of Gibraltar. Launched in April 2017, this Scholarship provides an opportunity for researchers who are citizens of the Commonwealth to study at the University. It aims to support excellence in higher education, enhance individual teaching and research capacity, leading to increased institutional capacity in academic and other sectors in Commonwealth countries, and to contribute to Gibraltar's higher education and research, by attracting international candidates and encouraging links and collaboration. Candidates must demonstrate leadership as well as academic potential. \n\nThe University of Gibraltar's library houses the new Gibraltar Repository. This repository is a collection of Gibraltar-related material that is currently being collated. It is intended that the Repository will eventually represent the sum total of published material on Gibraltar or by Gibraltarians.\n\nThe University established the Gibraltar Libraries Forum in 2016. The Forum includes nine libraries and information holding institutions to which all students have access:\n\nGarrison Library; Gibraltar Botanic Gardens and GONHS Library; Gibraltar Health Authority Library; Gibraltar Heritage Trust; Gibraltar Museum; Gibraltar National Archives; John Mackintosh Hall Library; University of Gibraltar Library\n\nThe forum is seeking to adopt the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 & 2013 which will effectively make it a legal requirement that a copy of any material published on Gibraltar is deposited with the Library Forum. It will mean that the Forum would act as a legal depository in the same way as the British Library does in the UK.\n\nA UNCTAD Centre of Excellence was established at the University of Gibraltar in 2016. The Gibraltar Centre of Excellence provides specialist training programmes for high level international governmental and private sector officials on Customs related matters. It also organises international events related to the following:\n\nThe Centre also offers integration of solutions for the implementation of international conventions and works closely with the following organisations:\n\nThe University of Gibraltar is located further south than any other in Europe with a clear sight of five lighthouses in three countries: Gibraltar, Morocco and Spain and two continents, Europe and Africa. The Europa Point campus is based in two military buildings dating back to the 19thcentury, including the original fort (the Bomb-house) with its brick-vaulted ceiling. The later Defensible Barracks were designed as accommodation for the soldiers and now hosts most of the University's teaching spaces. Both structures are now joined by a purpose-built modern atrium. The campus is in close proximity to both a mosque and a Catholic church\n\nThe University of Gibraltar has developed five Associate Campuses that support research programmes: the Gibraltar Museum; the Gibraltar Health Authority; the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens; the HMGOG Department for Environment and Climate Change; and the Garrison Library. \nResearch students are able to access collections that include: bibliographic, historical, archaeological, museological, natural historical and other additional support facilities via these Associate Campuses.\n\nThe university has two research institutes: the Institute for Gibraltar and Mediterranean Studies (IGMS) and the Institute of Life and Earth Sciences (ILES). \n\nFocuses on areas such as colonial and postcolonial studies exploring identity, ethnicity, self-determination and nationalism, as well as, the historic convergence of three separate and intertwined cultures: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, in Gibraltar and the region. \n\nFocuses on biology, geology and the environmental sciences and connected disciplines such as ecology, evolution, palaeontology and geomorphology.\n\nThe main areas of activity of the Institutes include interdisciplinary research in themes closely wedded to Gibraltar and the surrounding region; the supervision of students; engagement with other research associations; seeking funding and projecting the University of Gibraltar's research presence internationally.\n\nThe University hosts a weekly Gibraltar History Lecture Series. Some of the topics covered by the different speakers to date include: the Northern Defences; Treaty of Utrecht; and Painting the Great Siege. In 2016, the University launched the Beacon Lecture Series with the objective of bringing speakers from the worlds of academia, business, arts and civil society to share their thoughts, ideas and experiences. \n\nThe motto of the University of Gibraltar is \"Scientia est Clavis ad Successum\", which means “knowledge is the key to success”. The use of the metaphorical \"Clavis\" echoes the historical interpretation of Gibraltar as the key to the Mediterranean – as symbolised by the key that hangs from the castle in Gibraltar's flag. The castle and key are also depicted in the university's coat of arms.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1450744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1450744", "title": "University of Kerala", "text": "University of Kerala\n\nUniversity of Kerala (UoK), formerly the University of Travancore, is an affiliating university located in Thiruvananthapuram, capital of the south Indian state of Kerala, India. It was established in 1937, long before the birth of the state of Kerala in India, by a promulgation of the Maharajah of Travancore, Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma who was also the first Chancellor of the university. C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the then Diwan (Prime Minister) of Travancore, was the first Vice-Chancellor.\n\nOne of the first 16 Universities in India and the first in the state of Kerala, the University of Kerala was founded as the University of Travancore in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (now southern part of Kerala and some neighboring parts of state of Tamil Nadu) in 1937. During the 7 decades since the University of Kerala grew and shrunk physically and transformed itself in many ways.\n\nThe earliest origins of the University may be traced back to two institutions of modern learning in Kerala, the University College, Thiruvananthapuram and the Trivandrum Observatory. The University College was initially founded as the Maharaja's Free School by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal in 1834, with Mr John Roberts. A Christian Missionary as Headmaster, and soon grew into a college in 1866, affiliated to the Madras University. When the University of Travancore was founded, the Departments of the college became the University Departments, only to switch back again when the transformation to University of Kerala happened in 1957. The University College still retains its connection with the University as an affiliated college. The Trivandrum Observatory was founded in 1838 and had an internationally reputed scientist, John Caldecott FRS as its first Director. It became a part of the Travancore University, but for some time was administered as an independent government institution. It is now the oldest institution under the Kerala University.\n\nThe University of Travancore was established in 1937 by a promulgation of the Maharajah of Travancore, Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma who was also the first Chancellor of the University. Sir C. P Ramaswamy Ayyar, the then Diwan (Prime minister) of the State was the first Vice-Chancellor. He was an eminent scholar and an able administrator. It is said the Government made an unsuccessful attempt to invite Albert Einstein to be the first Vice-Chancellor. The University was modelled after the best Universities of the United Kingdom, and even today retains some of these features. The affiliating system of the University however evolved to be different from the college system in British Universities.\n\nOnly ten colleges within the State of Travancore, which were at that time affiliated to the Madras University, became the affiliated colleges of the University of Travancore. In 1954, the unified state of Kerala came into being with most of Travancore and whole of state of Cochin and Malabar area of Madras presidency becoming part of it. The Kerala University Act (Act 14 of 1957) was brought into force and the University of Travancore was renamed University of Kerala. The University had three campuses located in three different parts of the State viz. Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode. The number of affiliated colleges grew phenomenally. However, in 1968, the University Centre at Kozhikode became a full-fledged University, the University of Calicut, affiliating the colleges located in Thrissur, Palakkad, Kozhikode and Kannur districts of Kerala and transforming the Kozhikkode Centre into University Departments. The Cochin University of Science and Technology - CUSAT -(1971), Kerala Agricultural University (1971) and Mahatma Gandhi University (1983) were subsequently established, with CUSAT taking over the University's centre at Cochin. These developments have shrunk the jurisdiction of the University of Kerala to Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha Districts and some parts of Pathanamthitta District.\n\nAt present, the University has sixteen faculties and forty one departments of teaching and research in addition to study centres and other departments. Teaching, Research and Knowledge extension are the mandate of the Departments. They primarily focus on post-graduate (masters) programmes, MPhil programmes (1-year research degree) and doctoral research. In 2007, the University awarded over 100 PhDs. (University's research activities are also going on in select affiliated colleges and other recognised research centres in and outside the state). The University has had in its faculties eminent scholars who were trained under legendary figures (Sir C V Raman's student in Dept of Physics, Prof S R Ranganathan's student in Library Science and Prof Benjamin Bloom's student in Dept of Education). Some of the faculty members themselves were legends, such as famous poet K Ayyappa Panciker, Oriental scholar T Ganapathi Sasthri etc.\n\nThe University has also a number of study centres in specialised areas such as Nano-technology, Kerala Studies, Bioinformatics, Women's Studies, Learning Difficulties, Sree Narayana Studies, Gandhian Studies etc. Some of these centres have taught programmes (Certificate/Diploma/Masters/Mphil) and many offer PhD programmes. The University has also established 10 University College of Teacher Education (UTEC) and 8 University Institute of Technologies (UIT) both of which offer under-graduate programmes (BEd in UTECs and BSc Computer Science/IT, Electronics/BBA in UITs), although masters programmes are available in select UITs. The University College of Engineering at Karyavattom offers Engineering Education at Undergraduate level.\n\nThe University has over 150 affiliated colleges. The role of the University is in prescribing courses of study and conducting examinations and issuing certificates. The day-to-day administration of these institutions is not under the purview of the University. However, these institutions form a major part of the University. Of these 60 are Arts and Science colleges. There are 2 Law colleges, 17 Engineering Colleges, 9 MBA/MCA Colleges, 37 Teacher Training Colleges, 4 Medical Colleges, 4 Ayurveda colleges, 2 Homeopathy Colleges, one Siddha Medical College, 3 Dental colleges, 10 Nursing Colleges, 4 Pharmacy Colleges, 2 Fine Arts Colleges, and a Music College. The University also has a National College of Physical Education affiliated to it. The total number of students in these colleges crosses 84,000.\n\nUniversity of Kerala was ranked 801-1000 in the world by the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" of 2018 and 251-300 in Asia. It was ranked 47 in India overall by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2018 and 30 among universities.\n\n"}
{"id": "1468867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1468867", "title": "Varendra Research Museum", "text": "Varendra Research Museum\n\nVarendra Museum () is a museum, research centre, and popular visitor attraction at the heart of Rajshahi town and maintained by Rajshahi University in Bangladesh. It is considered the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It was the first museum to be established in East Bengal in 1910. The museum started out as the collection for Varendra Anushandan Samiti (or Varendra Investigation Society) and got its current name in 1919. The Rajahs of Rajshahi and Natore, notably prince Sharat Kumar Ray, donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. Varendra refers to an ancient Janapada roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.\n\nVarendra (or Barind) was a region of Bengal, now in Bangladesh. It included the Pundravardhana or Pundra Kingdom region. According to Cunningham the boundary of Varendra was the Ganges and the Mahananda on the west, the Karatoya on the east, the Padma on the south, and the land between Koochbihar and the Terai on the north. The Varendra Brahmins originated from this region.\n\nAncient Bengal did not have any Brahmins in its community. It is popularly believed that Brahmins were brought in to preach Hindutva, though really not the Vedic Hinduism as it is commonly believed, but more of the Pouranik Hinduism type, which evolved after Buddhism flourished. This Pouranik Hinduism is what we know as Brahmanism. Varendra (Barendra) Bhumi, i.e., modern-day North Bengal, had its Brahminism awakening soon after the south got its share. Shyamal Varma, a Kshatriya King brought five Brahmanas from Kanouj — Sanaka, Bhardwaja, Savarna, Sandilya, and Vasistha. The Bhatariya, Maitreya, Satar, Baghshree and Laheria villages soon gave birth to the Brahmin clans of Bhaduri, Moitra, Sanyal, Bagchi and Lahiri. These came to be known as the Varendra (Barendra) Brahmins.\n\nThe settlement of Varendra, spoken as Janakabhu (fatherland), was one of the most flourishing territories of the ancient Indian sub-continent. Literary and epigraphic evidence show that a separate school of artisans earned wide reputation here at the reign of Pala dynasty and the streams of art making were uninterrupted until the Sena dynasty.\n\nSome of the leading and enlightened citizens of Rajshahi felt the necessity and justification of establishing such an institution that would explore the precious past of this region. Henceforth, 'The Varendra Research Society' was established in 1910. The founder of the society, Kumar Sarat Kumar Ray, the scion of the Dighapatiya Royal family accompanied by Aksaya Kumar Maitreya, a leading lawyer and renowned historian; Ramaprasad Chanda, a reputed scholar in history, art and archaeology; and others explored archaeological and historical artefacts excavated in villages of Rajshahi.\n\nThe conviction grew in Kumar's mind if a centre of archaeological research was to be established at Rajshahi, the finds should be preserved there as the nucleus of a local museum. Accordingly, to collect, preserve, study and research the history and culture of ancient and medieval Bangal in general, and of Varendra region in particular, three worthy sons of the soil mentioned above took the effort to establish a museum.\n\nThe Varendra Research Society and Museum was set up at Rajshahi in 1910. It is the premier institution of its kind and the splendid accomplishment of its organisation in Bangladesh. The role of the society concerning the museum was that of proprietor and caretaker. However, this was formally inaugurated on 27 September 1910 and was registered in 1914 in accordance with the Indian Society Act, 1860.\n\nVarendra Museum was the first museum to be established in erstwhile East Bengal in 1910. It started as the collection for \"Varendra Anushandhan Samiti\" or \"Varendra Investigation Society\" and got its current name in 1919. The Rajahs of Rajshahi and Natore (notably Prince Sharat Kumar Ray) donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. \"Varendra\" refers to an ancient \"Janapada\" roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.\n\nExcavation at Sompur Bihara was started by the society along with the University of Calcutta in 1923. In 1964, the museum became a part of Rajshahi University.\n\n\nIn the existing site, three main structures were found. The front part is the Varendra Research Museum and the structural system is load-bearing brick wall. The linear rectangular building has two major functions: Administration and the Library. There is a Residential Block for officers and staff with a limited number of curators and the director. These structures have been constructed with brick. There is a garden in front of the director's residence with large old trees scattered among the entire site.\n\nServices:\nGas, Water, Electricity is available with Internet, Postal, Cable and Phone Services.\n\nSurrounding built form:\nNorth: Hatem Kha boro mosque.\nSouth: Chest disease hospital Jadhughor mor, Choto kutir, Boro kutir and Padma river\nEast: Rajshahi Govt. Hospital, Shaheb bazar road and Rajshahi Railway Station\nWest: Residential zone, shops.\n\nVarenda Research Museum was built in 1910 with the support of Maharaja of Dighapatia. The museum has historical significance and is also a heritage site of Bangladesh. The century-old museum demands restoration and the existing gallery space is not adequate to preserve and display all the artefacts. Also the Archaeological sites were found recently and the artefacts are increasing day by day. The restoration program of existing museum has already begun. With the rise in number of artefacts in its inventory throughout the recent years and its added functional demand, the extension of this project has become inevitable to protect the old museum and to preserve the artefacts that has helped us learn more about our very own past.\n\n"}
