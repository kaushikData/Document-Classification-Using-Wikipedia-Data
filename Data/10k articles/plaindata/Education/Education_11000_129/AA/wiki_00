The town is an hour's drive from Kumasi, the Ashanti regional capital.\n\nAgona-Akrofonso is a town in the Sekyere South District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana, West Africa. Agona-Akrofonso is approximately north-east of the Ashanti Regional capital, Kumasi, off the Kumasi-Mampong highway. The population of Agona-Akrofonso is estimated to be about 1,600 inhabitants.\nThe geographic coordinates for Agona-Akrofonso in the Sekyere South District of the Ashanti Regions are latitude 6°55'15.045\"N and longitude 1°28'11.9634\"W.\n\nThe people of Agona-Akrofonso are Ashantis, belonging to the Akan clan of Ghana, although other Akan people are found as far away as the Ivory Coast, to the west of Ghana. The people of Akrofonso speak the Twi language, although the language of business, commerce and instruction in educational institutions is English, as in all of Ghana.\n\nAgona-Akrofonso is one of only a few places in the old Ashanti Kingdom where Okomfo Anokye, the legendary Chief High Priest and advisor to the King of the Ashanti Nation, visited during the late 17th century, at the height of the Great Wars with the Denkyira people. According to legend, the People of Akrofonso relocated from the original settlement approx. from Kumasi, to the current existing core of the town where there still exist historic buildings needing rehabilitation and preservation. The historic center of Akrofonso was planned in a grid fashion from the start, as has been documented in other cases from historical literature concerned with town planning and urbanization. Other town planning principles can be observed in Akrofonso, at large, including a waste-water collection system, public places of convenience, school buildings that double as community health centers, and protected lands. \n\nSince the 1980s, development of Akrofonso has progressed at a faster pace. The housing stock has increased well beyond the historic core, accompanied by an increase in population and urbanization. Efforts to map out the current geographic extent of Akrofonso is needed as part of a desirable town planning effort, for any town of its size and stature. \n\nThe Akrofosohene Stool (seat of Chieftaincy of Akrofonso) is rightly one of the significant Akan stools from the Ekuona clan and family. Reportedly, the patriarch of the Ekuona is Nana Asante Gyima of Adanse and their totem is the Buffalo (Ekuo), symbolising honesty and uprightness.\n\nThere are several pending infrastructure, development plans and projects currently being considered or under construction in Akrofonso, including a potable water tank with a capacity of over . To travel to Agona-Akrofonso from Kumasi, take the Kumasi-Mampong toll road, going north. At the main intersection at Agona market, near the lorry park, take the road going east to Asamang. The Akrofonso water tower is approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the intersection. The public primary school is to the right of the water tower tank, and the old historic part of town is to the west. \n\nThere are several public water wells all around Akrofonso that are available to the people for a low fee, per bucket. However, many homes have private water wells, and the same applies to toilets. The water tower is being developed through private enterprise and is expected to be completed before June 2012, giving all residents access to a central water source and a potentially better quality/safer water source.\n\nAgona-Akrofonso also had a soccer club known as Multi Stars which once played in the third division of the Ghanaian league hierarchy but couldn't advance and collapsed since then. It started with notable players in the name of Ofori Christian, Brother, Kwabena Bresiamah, R.K, and their first coach was Boadi Nyamekye popularly known as Kapitulate.\n\nThe local government runs a kindergarten in Agona-Akrofonso that is not always fully attended by all eligible children. There are many reasons for poor attendance, including poor health or parents' inability to provide supplies, such as shoes, and the need for children to remain at home to help their parents. In addition, there is a primary and middle school called Junior High School. The school's buildings were built in 1942, and have received few upgrades. On graduating from the Junior High School, children typically attend one of the secondary schools, called senior high schools, in Sekyere South District, although many leave the area entirely to attend school in Kumasi, Accra, or other big cities and towns in Ghana. Highly recognized schools such as Adisadel College, Prempeh College, Opoku-ware School and St. Louis School are a few to mention. Tertiary-level education in the town is also progressive. After senior high school, some of the students proceed to universities, polytechnics, nursing and teacher training colleges across the globe. Other students may end their educational careers and become farmers, or join an apprentice trades company/group (such as for masons, carpenters, roofers, plumbers, etc.) to learn a trade. \n\nEarly in 2012, citizens and supporters of Akrofonso began developing plans to develop the town, focusing in part on the Junior High School. Some long-delayed school improvements are now needed to replace the roof, repair load-bearing columns, repair windows, doors, and book shelves, and paint the interior and exterior of the building. In addition, furniture (chairs and tables) is needed. Future phases will address potable water needs, hand-washing stations and a new school fence. \n\nIn 2016, the Chief of Akrofonso, Nana Owusu Achiaw with help from the community renoveted the only Junior high school which has run for the Akrofonso-man ages ago. The renovation mainly catered for the roofs, paint and filling in and around the building which give it a very good look. From the benefits of the District common fund, the District Chief Executive, Mr. Ayakwah has put up a new structure to replace the old JHS but it's yet to be commissioned.\n\nIn other cases, young people who leave Akrofonso travel overseas to countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, etc. Consequently, there is a growing number of native Ghanaian diasporans from Agona-Akrofonso all over the world. Many make frequent financial and other remittances to family members, and often visit. This allows for individuals and their families to maintain crucial contacts, including business and educational relations, and sponsorship of construction projects all over Akrofonso and in the nearby towns (Agona, Asamang, Jamasi, etc.).\n\nAgona-Akrofonso is on the Ghana National Electricity Grid, and many homes have electricity. Cocoa production is the primary occupation. However, the production of food commodities (yams, cassava, poultry, plantains, cocoyams, fruits, etc.) is also important to the local economy. Starting from 2012, some of the local teenagers also are involved in mining activities across mining centers in the country.\n\n"}

AIMS was a standards-based assessment aligned with the Arizona Academic Content Standards. In November, 2014, the Arizona State Board of Education voted to replace AIMS with a new test called AzMERIT (Arizona's Measurement of Educational Readiness to Inform Teaching.)\n\nThe content of AIMS varied by grade level, but it usually featured three reading and mathematics sections, as well as a writing portion, where students were assigned to write an essay based on a prompt given to them. For some grade levels, the test included a science portion in lieu of a writing section.\n\nTo graduate from an Arizona public high school, a student had to meet the AIMS High School Graduation Requirement. The most common way to meet this requirement was to pass the writing, reading, and mathematics content areas of the AIMS HS test. High school students had multiple opportunities to take and pass these content areas. For students who did not pass all three required content areas of the AIMS HS test, there were alternative methods for meeting the AIMS High School Graduation requirement. This requirement was dropped after the test was replaced by the AzMERIT test.\n\nAdditionally, starting with the class of 2006, high-school students in Arizona who exceeded all three standards in reading, writing, and math may have been eligible for a scholarship to any of the three public state universities if they also met certain other criteria. Students must have completed all 16 core competency courses (4 units English, 4 units Math, 3 units Lab Science, 2 units Social Science, 2 units Foreign Language, and 1 unit Fine Arts) by graduation with a B or better in each course. Students must have also met at least one of the following academic requirements: A cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher on an unweighted 4.0 scale, or rank in the top 5% of their graduating class.\n\nIf a student did not exceed standards on all three tests, they may have still qualified for a scholarship if they exceeded standards on two of the AIMS sections and met standards on the other section. Additionally, they would have either needed to receive at least a score of 3 on two Advanced Placement tests or at least a score of 4 on two International Baccalaureate exams.\n\nQualified students would receive a full state university tuition waiver valid for one year following graduation from high school. The scholarship was renewable for four years based upon university-determined criteria. The actual dollar amount of the scholarship varied based upon the tuition charged by the state university in which they enrolled.\n\nOn September 23, 2010, the Arizona Board of Regents voted 9-1 to cut AIMS scholarships to just 25% of freshman year tuition, stating that the scholarship was too easy to earn. Students also hade to have an ACT score of at least 28 or an SAT-1 score of at least 1300 (i.e. the reading and mathematics scores must have been at least 1300). The changes in AIMS scholarships applied beginning with the graduating class of 2013.\n\nIn 2007, the AIMS Test began to report out Lexile measures for students in grades 3-8 and 10. A Lexile measure can be used to match readers with targeted text and monitor growth in reading ability.\n\n"}

Membership is open to all professional educators working in the early childhood, school, and tertiary education sectors, as well as to education researchers and managers. The College advocates for its members in seeking improvements in the status of the education profession. The present national President is the Honourable Bronwyn Pike, former secondary school teacher and Minister for Education in the Brumby Government in Victoria.\n\nThe College was established in 1959 as the Australian College of Education at a conference held at Geelong Grammar School at the instigation of the then-headmaster James Darling. It was renamed as the Australian College of Educators in 2002. Darling was the first National President of the ACE and was knighted for his services to education and broadcasting in 1968. The Buntine Oration, a biennial invited presentation made at the ACE conference and is held alternately with the speech of the outgoing National President, was established in 1960 by the four then-surviving children of Walter Murray Buntine (1866–1953) in his memory.\n\nThe College has been based in Victoria for most of its existence; it did move to Canberra in 1988, though it has since returned to Melbourne and is presently based at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education. The first Jean Blackburn Oration was held their in 2014, given by David Gonski, author of the Gonski Report which was an important election issue in the 2013 and 2016 federal elections.\n\nWalter Buntine had a significant role in the development of education in Victoria from his position as headmaster of Caulfield Grammar School (1896–1932) and his descendants have continued to be actively involved in education. His son, M. Arnold Buntine (1898–1975), earned a PhD in education from the University of Edinburgh and was headmaster of Camberwell Grammar School in Victoria and later the Hale School in Western Australia prior to World War II after the war as headmaster of Geelong College. Arnold was married to Gladys (Jim) Buntine (1901–1992), who was an educator in her role as Chief Commissioner of the Australian Girl Guides and their son, Robert Buntine (1929–2014) had leadership roles at The King's School and Newington College in Sydney. Professor Mark Buntine of Curtin University of Technology is the most current of the Buntine family of educators.\n\nThe inaugural oration was given by Peter Karmel in 1962 at the third annual ACE conference. The oration has been given by a series of high-profile people, including Sir Paul Hasluck (Minister for External Affairs at the time, later the Governor-General of Australia), Sir Zelman Cowan (while he was Governor-General of Australia), Sir Michael Somare (then-Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea and becoming the inaugural Prime Minister on independence), Peter Doherty (Nobel Laureate in Medicine 1996 and Australian of the Year in 1997), Michael Kirby (then President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and later a Justice of the High Court of Australia) and Robert French (then the Chancellor of Edith Cowan University and later the Chief Justice of the High Court). Inaugural ACE National President Sir James Darling gave the 1972 oration of responsibility; Barry McGaw is the only other National President to have been so honoured.\n\nAt the national level, the College awards Fellowships to \"highly valued and exemplary educators\" and also gives a writing award to students of education and teaching. The most prestigious award from the ACE is the College Medal, awarded to one individual annually, \"to acknowledge significant and distinctive contributions to the advancement of Australian education in any field, level or sector.\" Various awards are given by individual states and regions.\n\n"}
{"id": "5015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5015", "title": "Bjørn Lomborg", "text": "Bjørn Lomborg\n\nBjørn Lomborg (; born 6 January 1965) is a Danish author and President of his think tank, Copenhagen Consensus Center. He is former director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI) in Copenhagen. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" (2001), in which he argues that many of the costly measures and actions adopted by scientists and policy makers to meet the challenges of global warming will ultimately have minimal impact on the world's rising temperature.\n\nIn 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus, a project-based conference where prominent economists sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of welfare economics.\n\nIn 2009, \"Business Insider\" cited Lomborg as one of \"The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics\". While Lomborg campaigned against the Kyoto Protocol and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, he argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions. His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) to meet the challenges of that climate change. He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition. In his critique of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Lomborg stated: \"Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat.\" In 2011, and 2012, Lomborg was named a \"Top 100 Global Thinker\" by Foreign Policy \"for looking more right than ever on the politics of climate change\".\n\nLomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the University of Georgia, earned an M.A. degree in political science at the University of Aarhus in 1991, and a Ph.D. degree in political science at the University of Copenhagen in 1994.\n\nLomborg lectured in statistics in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an assistant professor (1994–1996) and associate professor (1997–2005). He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an adjunct professor in Policy-making, Scientific Knowledge and the Role of Experts at the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy, Copenhagen Business School.\n\nEarly in his career, his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in collective action dilemmas, simulation of party behavior in proportional voting systems, and the use of surveys in public administration. In 1996, Lomborg's paper, \"Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\", was published in the academic journal, \"American Sociological Review\".\n\nLater, Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the environmental arena. In 1998, Lomborg published four essays about the state of the environment in the leading Danish newspaper \"Politiken\", which according to him \"resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers.\" This led to the \"Skeptical Environmentalist\", whose English translation was published as a work in environmental economics by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited \"Global Crises, Global Solutions\", which presented the first conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus, published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled \".\"\n\nIn March 2002, the newly elected center-right prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.\n\nLomborg has created several short videos for the educational website Prager University, a US-based conservative think tank founded by talk show host Dennis Prager. His videos focus on environmental science.\n\nLomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus in 2002, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government and was co-sponsored by \"The Economist\". A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, \"Global Crises, Global Solutions\", edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn 2006, Lomborg became director of the newly established Copenhagen Consensus Center, a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the EAI, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference. Denmark withdrew its funding in 2012 and the Center faced imminent closure. Lomborg left the country and reconstituted the Center as a non-profit organization in the United States. The Center was based out of a \"Neighborhood Parcel Shipping Center\" in Lowell, Massachusetts, though Lomborg himself was based in Prague in the Czech Republic. In 2015, Lomborg described the Center's funding as \"a little more than $1m a year...from private donations\", of which Lomborg himself was paid $775,000 in 2012.\n\nIn April 2015, it was announced that an alliance between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the University of Western Australia would see the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre, a new policy research center at the UWA Business School. The University described the Center's goals as a \"focus on applying an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritizing those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent.\". This appointment came under intense scrutiny, particularly when leaked documents revealed that the Australian government had approached UWA and offered to fund the Consensus Centre, information subsequently confirmed by a senior UWA lecturer. Reports indicated that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office was directly responsible for Lomborg's elevation. $4 million of the total funding for the Center was to be provided by the Australian federal government, with UWA not contributing any funding for the centre.\n\nOn 8 May 2015, UWA cancelled the contract for hosting the Australian Consensus Centre as \"the proposed centre was untenable and lacked academic support\". The Australian federal education minister, Christopher Pyne, said that he would find another university to host the ACC.\n\nIn July 2015, Flinders University senior management began quietly canvassing its staff about a plan to host the renamed Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. A week later the story was broken on Twitter by the NTEU (National Tertiary Education Union) and Scott Ludlam. The story appeared the next day in The Australian, but described as \"academic conversations\" with no mention of Bjorn Lomborg's involvement and portrayed as a grassroots desire for the Centre by the University. The following week, a story appeared in the Guardian quoting two Flinders University academics and an internal document demonstrating staff's withering rejection of the idea. Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg, citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition and 350.org launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, education minister Simon Birmingham told a senate committee the offered funding had been withdrawn. It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre to cover the costs incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.\n\nSeveral of Bjørn Lomborg's articles in newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The Telegraph have been checked by Climate Feedback, a worldwide network of scientists who collectively assess the credibility of influential climate change media coverage. The Climate Feedback reviewers assessed that the scientific credibility ranged between \"low\" and \"very low\". The Climate Feedback reviewers come to the conclusion that in one case Lomborg \"practices cherry-picking\", in a second case he \"had reached his conclusions through cherry-picking from a small subset of the evidence, misrepresenting the results of existing studies, and relying on flawed reasoning\", in a third case \"[his] article [is in] blatant disagreement with available scientific evidence, while the author does not offer adequate evidence to support his statements\", and, in a fourth case, \"The author, Bjorn Lomborg, cherry-picks this specific piece of research and uses it in support of a broad argument against the value of climate policy. He also misrepresents the Paris Agreement to downplay its potential to curb future climate change.\"\n\nIn 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\", a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.\n\nIn the chapter on climate change in \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\", he states: \"This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible\". Cost–benefit analyses, calculated by the Copenhagen Consensus, ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004. In a 2010 interview with the \"New Statesman\", Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: \"Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.\"\n\nAfter the publication of \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\", Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD), a body under Denmark's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a \"debate\" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed. The charges claimed that \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.\n\nIn January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question. That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.\n\nThe original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a petition signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD for evaluating the book as a work of science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and natural sciences community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.\n\nThe alumni network of the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL) voted \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.\n\nThe rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003–2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.\n\n\"The Lomborg Deception\", a book by Howard Friel, claims to offer a \"careful analysis\" of the ways in which Lomborg has \"selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence\", and that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book; Lomborg has denied these claims in a public response. Lomborg has provided a 27-page argument-by-argument response. Friel has written a reply to this response, in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.\n\nA group of scientists, Arthur Rörsch, Thomas Frello, Ray Soper and Adriaan De Lange published an article in 2005 in the \"Journal of Information Ethics\", in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.\n\nThe claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of \"Journal of Information Ethics\" by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called \"the Galileo hypothesis\", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called \"a history of misrepresenting\" climate science.\n\nIn 2014, the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4 million to establish a \"consensus centre\" with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed the decision and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution. On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn. (For further details see the \"Copenhagen Consensus\" sub-section of the \"Career\" section, above.)\n\nLomborg's approach evolved in directions more compatible with action to restrain climate change. In April 2015 he gained further attention when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that \"a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich\"...making fossil fuel so \"inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming\". In publications such as the \"Wall Street Journal\" he argued that the most productive use of resources would be a massive increase in funding for research to make renewable energy economically competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nLomborg is gay and a vegetarian. As a public figure he has been a participant in information campaigns in Denmark about homosexuality, and states that \"Being a public gay is to my view a civic responsibility. It's important to show that the width of the gay world cannot be described by a tired stereotype, but goes from leather gays on parade-wagons to suit-and-tie yuppies on the direction floor, as well as everything in between\".\n\n\nAfter the release of \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the media, where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international mass media. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and print media around the world. He is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2005.\n\n\nBjørn Lomborg released a documentary feature film, \"Cool It\", on 12 November 2010 in the US. The film in part explicitly challenged Al Gore's 2006 Oscar-winning environmental awareness documentary, \"An Inconvenient Truth\", and was frequently presented by the media in that light, as in the \"Wall Street Journal\" headline, \"Controversial ‘Cool It’ Documentary Takes on 'An Inconvenient Truth'.\" The film received a media critic collective rating of 51% from Rotten Tomatoes and 61% from Metacritic. \"The Atlantic\" review described it as \"An urgent, intelligent, and entertaining account of the climate policy debate, with a strong focus on cost-effective solutions.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The game is supposed to teach players how to write programming languages by having them do so in a 3D world.\n\nThe game drew controversy following its Kickstarter campaign, when the studio ran out of funds, missed release deadlines and funding rewards, and communicated little with the community. Some financial backers threatened legal action following long periods of no communication. \n\nThe Code Hero website was offline for an extended period in 2014, and Peake has not commented publicly about the state of this project since 2013. From May 2015 the website was again inactive, however it resurfaced in August 2016.\n\nThe main aim of \"Code Hero\" is to teach players how to write programming languages in an engaging way. Players use a gun which can copy code and place it in other areas of the level in order to create a full program in a language such as JavaScript and UnityScript whilst moving around a 3D world from a first-person perspective. Players start in a world called \"Gamebridge Unityversity's API\" from which they can choose a series of levels which teach basics of the programming languages; after this they move to the \"Humantheon\", from which the player moves on to the rest of the game world, led by a robotic Ada Lovelace.\n\nDevelopment on \"Code Hero\" began in January 2011, and in 2012 Peake started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $100,000 USD to fund further development of the game over the next six months. The Kickstarter concluded in February having raised $170,000 USD, at which point $30,000 USD had been raised through their website alongside this.\n\nPeake hired a development team, and in March 2012, they began working in space provided by IGN Indie Open House in San Francisco. The project experienced staff turnover, and by October 2012, ran out of money.\n\nAfter failing to deliver the backing rewards by the original date, and not updating the website or Twitter accounts for months at a time, backers began to demand refunds and became concerned that the project was not sufficiently funded. The original release date of August 31, 2012, at PAX Prime, was missed, with an update a few days later saying it would be released within days, a date which was also missed. When supporter Dustin Deckard began organising to seek legal action after another stretch of no communication, Alex Peake released a statement saying that the game was still being worked on and that Primer Labs was “committed to finishing this game.” The raised funds covered the costs of development until October 2012, after which many of the game's developers became volunteers. Two alpha builds of \"Code Hero\" were released during 2012 for those who had pre-ordered the game.\n\nIn August 2013 a beta version of the game became available for download on Primer Labs website after being down for a period of weeks. An announcement dated April 22, 2014 indicated that version 0.5 was forthcoming. However, the Primer Labs website again went down later in 2014. The company's Facebook and Twitter accounts have been inactive since 2012.\n\nOn November 6, 2015, Primer Labs website re-opened and was being updated, with weekly updates posted during December. The next planned version (0.5) was set for December 1, 2015, but was never made available.\n\nThe game was updated in 2017.\n\n"}

Creating an assessment in a context can help to guide the teacher to replicate a real world experiences and make necessary inclusive design decisions. Contextual learning can be used as a form of formative assessment and can help give educators a stronger profile on how the intended learning goals, standards and benchmarks fit the curriculum. It is essential to establish and align the intended learning goals of the contextual task at the beginning to create a shared understanding of what success looks like. Self-directed theory states that humans by nature seek purpose and the desire to make a contribution and to be part of a cause greater and more enduring then oneself. Contextual learning can help bring relevance and meaning to the learning, helping students relate to the world they live in. \n\n"}

{"id": "30684151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30684151", "title": "Disney College Program", "text": "Disney College Program\n\nThe Disney College Program is a U.S. national internship program operated by The Walt Disney Company, located at the Walt Disney World Resort and the Disneyland Resort. The Disney College Program recruits students (18 years and older) and all majors for a semester-long paid internship program working at the Walt Disney World Resort or Disneyland Resort.\n\nThe first Disney College Program began in 1981. In the early days, the College Program consisted of just over 200 students from 20 schools working in only one theme park, the Magic Kingdom. At that time it was known as The Magic Kingdom College Program (MKCP). In October 1982, program participants could work at Epcot as well as the Magic Kingdom and the program was known as The Walt Disney World College Program, employing approximately 500 college students each spring, summer and fall session. From the beginning of the program until 1988, almost all program participants stayed in an off-property mobile home park called Snow White Village Campground (the remainder in Lake Vista Village apartments) in nearby Kissimmee, Florida. 1987 saw the opening of Vista Way apartments, which were much closer to the participants' employment. Following the resort's massive growth in the 1990s and the widespread popularity of the internet, the College Program has grown substantially, seeing three new participant housing complexes built and many more colleges represented. As of 2005, 8,000 students have participated each year, representing at least 301 colleges and universities with an average of 4,000 students at any given time.\n\nIn the Autumn of 2004, student opportunities at Disneyland were combined with the opportunities available at Walt Disney World. The program was renamed to the Disney Theme Parks and Resorts College Program. Currently, the program is being promoted as, simply, the Disney College Program.\n\nThere are specific requirements a student must meet before applying for the Disney College Program. All students must be of 18 years or older before the expected day of arrival. Students must be enrolled in an accredited university or college as a full-time or part-time student, and actively taking classes. Students may also participate in the semester immediately following graduation. Students must complete at least one semester of university or college before entering the Disney College Program, but can apply during their first semester for participation in the program during their second semester. In the case of schools with additional requirement criteria, a student must meet all of those eligibilities before being considered by the program.\n\nStudents who apply to the program are given the option of one of several program seasons throughout the year, each usually lasting between five and seven months, though the culinary session length is dependent upon the student's school schedule.\n\nAfter the general application is filed, students may be selected to participate in a web-based interview. This can happen immediately or months later. Students who are selected to proceed beyond the web-based interview then go through a second round over the phone. Here the students clarify with recruiters which of the roles they would be receptive to while attending the program. Some of these roles (or positions) are food and beverage, attractions, custodial, hospitality, merchandise, and entertainment. If a student chooses to apply for an entertainment role, he or she must attend one of several regional auditions. At one point, there was a required viewing of a presentation, however, as of the Fall 2013 application period that is no longer a requirement.\n\nFinal notification of the applicant's status (accepted, pending, or no longer in consideration) is usually sent out about 3 weeks after the phone interview, but it can take several months.\n\nAt the beginning of the program in the early 1980s, three \"experiences\" were emphasized: \"The Learning Experience\", which involved participation in Disney's \"Leisure Time Business Management Studies\", \"The Work Experience\" which included work in 4 major areas of the resort, and \"The Recreational Experience\" which emphasized recreational activities and Disney-sponsored events. Since that time, the experiences have changed slightly to \"living\", \"learning\" and \"earning\".\n\nThe \"Living\" experience is similar to the original program's \"Recreational\" experience. Once the student has accepted their position with Disney, they can stay in one of four company sponsored housing units near Walt Disney World Resort during the duration of the program: Vista Way, Chatham Square, Patterson Court, and The Commons (which houses mainly international Cast Members). At the Disneyland Resort, participants stay in the Carnegie Plaza building approximately two miles north of the resort. Each participant can choose to live in a one, two, three, or four bedroom apartment with two to three people per bedroom. In addition to these options, the Disneyland housing offers a limited number of studio-style apartments.\n\nThe cost of housing is deducted automatically from the student’s weekly salary. The cost of housing varies depending on the housing location. There are fees the student must pay upfront upon acceptance into the program based on housing, and these too vary between locations. In Florida there is a nonrefundable program assessment fee of $100 as well as a housing and administration fee for $200, which covers 2 weeks' rent. In California the program assessment fee is $100, with a refundable security deposit of $200 as well as $560 in housing and assessment fees which covers 4 weeks' rent.\n\nStudents are expected to follow certain guidelines in the housing complexes. Roommates are assigned by gender and age, except in the case of a married couple. If a student is under the age of 21 they automatically are placed in a “Wellness Apartment”, or one that is deemed alcohol-free. For students located in Florida, the Disney Company provides transportation to and from the theme parks. Transportation is not provided for students located in California. Those students are encouraged to bring their own cars. They are also given free bus passes for the OCTA public transportation system, and earn $1 each day the pass is used.\n\nThe \"Learning\" experience began in the early 80s as a group of 9 seminars on the \"philosophies and operating practices\" of the various sections of their resort's business. It has grown to include 8 different courses, each focusing on a Disney topic, rather than a business area. The Students are required to do textbook readings, write term papers and participate on projects. Additionally, there are now Disney Exploration Series courses, which are more focused on business areas as they relate to Disney. Participants, just like every Cast Member, attend Traditions, which is a 4 hour long orientation that demonstrates everything about the Resort of employment and the company in general. The Disney Look is required for attendance at Traditions, which is the participants' first official day of work. The program also offers \"job shadowing\" for participants on days they are not working - the participant can follow Disney Cast Members whose careers are in fields similar to the student's major.<nowiki> Most of the courses are approved by the American Council on Education and offer participants the possibility to earn college credit during their program, subject to a decision by the participant's college or university.</nowiki> The classes approved meet once a week, for most of the program (with breaks during peak seasons) and are four hours long.\n\nThe \"Earning\" experience consists of students working within their resort. At the program's inception, students are expected to work in one of 4 \"major operating areas\": Food, Merchandise, Attractions, and Custodial. Currently, Disney College Program students work in more than 20 different roles.\n\nDepending on the requirements of a student's school, internship credit may be earned.\n\n\n"}

December 1739), daughter of Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs.\n\nHe was educated at St Andrews, at Edinburgh, and at Leiden. In 1730 he graduated with a degree of Doctor of Physic at the last-named university, where he was an intimate friend of Gerard van Swieten and Albrecht von Haller.\n\nHe settled in Edinburgh at first as a physician, but between 1733 and 1744 was also Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University.\n\nIn 1742 he became physician to the Earl of Stair, then commanding the British army in Flanders. About the time of the battle of Dettingen in Bavaria in June 1743, when the British army was encamped at Aschaffenburg, Pringle, through the Earl of Stair, brought about an agreement with the Marshal of Noailles, the French commander, that military hospitals on both sides be considered as neutral, immune sanctuaries for the sick and wounded, and should be mutually protected. The International Red Cross, as constituted by the modern Geneva Conventions, developed from this conception and agreement.\n\nIn 1744 he was appointed by the Duke of Cumberland physician-general to the forces in the Low Countries. In 1749, having settled in a smart house in Pall Mall, London, he was made physician in ordinary to the Duke of Cumberland.\n\nOn 1 April 1752 he married Charlotte (d. Dec 1753) second daughter of Dr William Oliver (1695–1764) of Bath, the inventor of Bath Oliver biscuits, but they had no issue.\n\nIn 1760, he wrote an appreciation of the Life of General James Wolfe.\n\nOn 5 June 1766 John Pringle was created a baronet, and in 1774 he was appointed Physician to His Majesty King George III.\n\nHe was also a frequent travelling companion to Benjamin Franklin. The successful London bookseller Andrew Millar noted Pringle and Franklin as dinner guests at his home.\n\nHis first book, \"Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers\", was published in 1750, and in the same year he contributed to the \"Philosophical Transactions\" of the Royal Society three papers on \"Experiments on Septic and Antiseptic Substances\", which gained him the Copley Medal. Two years later he published his important work, \"Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison\", which entitles him to be regarded as the founder of modern military medicine.\n\nIn November 1772 he was elected President of the Royal Society, a position he held until 1778. In this capacity he delivered six discourses, which were afterwards collected into a single volume (1783).\n\nIn 1735, Pringle became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.\n\nPringle was a regular correspondent and friend of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, the Scottish philosopher. Monboddo was an important thinker in pre-evolutionary theory, and some scholars actually credit him with the concept of evolution; however, Monboddo was also quite eccentric, which was one reason for Monboddo's not receiving credit for the evolution concepts. It was in a letter to Pringle in 1773 that Monboddo revealed he did not really hold to a belief of men being born with tails, which was the chief point of his ridicule.\n\nAt the age of 73 he went, briefly, to Edinburgh in 1780, but returned to London in September 1781, and died in the following year.\n\nThere is a monument to Pringle in Westminster Abbey, executed by Joseph Nollekens. At Sir John's death his baronetcy became extinct.\n\nAfter a legal case in 2004, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh was able to open the Pringle papers it holds to the public.\n\n\n"}

My mother and my sister had made it a rule always to be prepared for unexpected guests, with coffee, cake, and slivovitz.

{"id": "819526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=819526", "title": "Juku", "text": "Juku\n\nGakushū juku (; see cram school) are private, fee-paying schools that offer supplementary classes often in preparation for key school and university entrance exams. The term is primarily used to characterize such schools in Japan. Juku’s typically operate after regular school hours, on weekends, and during school vacations.\n\nJuku attendance rose from the 1970s through the mid-1980s; participation rates increased at every grade level throughout the compulsory education years. This phenomenon was a source of great concern to the Ministry of Education, which issued directives to the regular schools that it hoped would reduce the need for after-school lessons, but these directives had little practical effect. Some juku have branches in the United States and other countries to help children living abroad catch up with students in Japan.\n\nWhile new media have been introduced into juku as instructional and delivery methods, traditional teaching is increasingly shifting to individual tutoring. This shift is partly a response by the supplementary education industry to declining numbers of children in Japan and the threat this decline poses to their industry.\n\nThere are two types of juku, academic and nonacademic.\n\nAcademic juku can be roughly divided into categories.\n\n\nAs of 2011, almost one in five children in their first year of primary school attended after-class instruction, rising to nearly all university-bound high schoolers. The fees are around ¥260,000 ($3,300) annually.\n\nAcademic juku offer instruction in the five required subjects: mathematics, Japanese language, science, English, and social studies. They are best known and most widely publicized for their role as \"cram schools\", where children (sent by concerned parents) can study to improve scores on upper-secondary school entrance examinations. However, as seen above, there are also juku that provide supplementary education, whether remedial courses to help children falling behind in their studies, refresher courses to explain material in further detail, or courses that cover material on a higher level and thus appeal to children bored by the standardized class structure.\n\nMany other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic juku for piano lessons, art instruction, swimming, and abacus (soroban) lessons.\n\nJuku also play a social role, and children in Japan say they like going to juku because they are able to make new friends. Many children ask to be sent because their friends attend. Some children seem to like juku because of the closer personal contact they have with their teachers and, for students in crowded spaces like Tokyo in particular, the relief jukus can provide from small homes, family, television, Internet, and other distractions.\n\nTo some observers, juku represent an attempt by parents to exercise a meaningful measure of choice in Japanese education, particularly for children attending public schools.\n\nBecause of the commercial nature of most juku, some critics argue that they have profit rather than education at heart. Shares in five juku chains are traded publicly, and 25 others were as of 1992 ready to issue stock as well.\n\nNot all students can afford to attend juku, but school and university test scores rise in direct proportion to spending on juku. The average fee is $160 a month for elementary school and $175 a month for junior high school, but the best ones are several times that amount. Japan spent $10.9 billion on tutoring and cram schools in 1991 alone, including $9 billion on juku for students in the ninth grade or below \"almost double the figure spent [in 1985].\" With poor students therefore at risk of falling behind, the social and economic inequality in what had been a relatively egalitarian approach to education, at least in public schools through ninth grade, is why Japan's powerful teachers' union does not support the juku institution.\n\nIn response to these accusations,\n\n\"juku teachers and administrators say that since their schools are profit-making enterprises, they have to guarantee results to succeed. The results are easy to measure since they depend on how many graduates pass the examinations for private school. The profit motive, in other words, provides an incentive to create an atmosphere in which students want to learn.\"\n\"The rise of juku is praised as a secret of Japanese success, a healthy reflection of a system of advancement based on merit. It is also criticized as forcing a new generation to surrender its childhood out of an obsession with status and getting ahead. 'Juku are harmful to Japanese education and to children,' said Ikuo Amano, professor of sociology at the University of Tokyo. 'It's not healthy for kids to have so little free time. It is not healthy to become completely caught up in competition and status at such a young age.'\"\n\nFor some, \"the schools are also seen as reinforcing a tradition of rote learning over ingenuity.\"\n\nIn many ways, juku compensate for the formal education system's inability or unwillingness to address particular individual problems. \"In a 2008 government survey, two-thirds of parents attributed the growing role of juku to shortcomings in public education,\" such as the abolition of Saturday schooling (which therefore reduces the number of hours available to cover course material) and the reduction of curricular content (see Yutori education).\n\nJuku offer a more personalized service \"and many encourage individual inquisitiveness when the public system treats everyone alike. 'The juku are succeeding in ways that the schools are not,' an OECD report says.\"\n\n\n"}

Pictures and The Vitaphone Corporation. It premiered at the famed Carthay Circle Theatre at Los Angeles on July 1, 1939 - three days before Independence Day.\n\nThe uniquely serious Schlesinger-produced cartoon retells the origins of the United States of America. Porky Pig plays a child attempting to learn the Pledge of Allegiance. He becomes quickly bored and falls asleep. In his dream, Uncle Sam (voiced by John Deering) comes to life and teaches Porky about history from Colonial America through the midnight ride of Paul Revere (voiced by Shepperd Strudwick) and the American Revolutionary War to the expansion of the American Old West, briefly alluding to Abraham Lincoln. Upon awakening, Porky snaps into a salute and recites the pledge as the Flag of the United States waves overhead and the words \"The End\" pan over the waving flag. There are no Merrie Melodies rings at the end, as in other shorts, or the words \"That's All, Folks!\"\nThe ending card reads \"Merrie Melodies, Reg. U.S. Pat. Off,\" \"The End\" \"Produced by Leon Schlesinger\" , and \"Released by Warner Bros. Pictures Incorporated\".\n\nThe animation in \"Old Glory\" is realistic and heavily rotoscoped, different from the usual Warner Bros. style. Director Chuck Jones was known for his Disney-like style during this period, and Schlesinger assigned him to make this cartoon for that reason. The scene with Patrick Henry (voiced by John Litel) saying his \"Give Me Liberty\" speech was rotoscoped from the Warner Bros. color 2-reel historical short, \"Give Me Liberty\". That short won the Academy Award for Best Short Subject - Color of 1936. Also rotoscoped were scenes from the live-action short Declaration of Independence (1938).\n\nThere were many different tones of colored inks used on the film. Uncle Sam has different tones on his hat, beard, face, and clothes. All the other characters were treated in a similar manner. There were many cels depicting the Flag of the United States in its stars and stripes.\n\nDue to the existence of more footage than usual, the short ran for 9 minutes. The average length of a Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies entry was 6 or 7 minutes.\n\nThe film was produced during a heat wave in Los Angeles. Due to the lack of air conditioning at the studio, the production staff initially relied on two large fans to keep cool. They had to be pointed at the ceiling so that they did not blow cels and drawings across the room. Eventually production moved to night time, since the temperature dropped at night.\n\nMost Leon Schlesinger animated shorts were first screened at the Warner Bros. Theater at the Hollywood Boulevard. This film was instead screened at the more prestigious Carthay Circle Theatre. All animation studio employees were invited to attend. The film was screened alongside the live-action \"Dark Victory\".\n\nThe original ending was cut when the cartoon was reissued twice as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies short, in 1945 and 1953. A version with a restored ending can be found on the \"\", Disc 3, \"\", Disc 1 and \"Porky Pig 101\", Disc 3. This copy retains the Blue Ribbon opening, as well as the original opening shot of the flag and its music cue.\n\n\"Old Glory\" is Jones's first short to feature Porky Pig. It is also Porky's first appearance in a colour Merrie Melody since his debut in 1935's I Haven't Got a Hat, and his first short in three-strip Technicolor.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, \"Old Glory\" was regularly screened between rock acts at the Fillmore in San Francisco. Many of the Fillmore's patrons drew great amusement from a pig saluting the American flag, as \"pig\" in 1960s slang was a derogatory term for a police officer and his saluting the flag was a symbol of the kind of America most people were against at the time: the kind that slavishly followed the government and didn't care for the rights of others.\n"}
{"id": "47156854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47156854", "title": "Paul Zarifopol", "text": "Paul Zarifopol\n\nPaul Zarifopol (November 30, 1874 – May 1, 1934) was a Romanian literary and social critic, essayist, and literary historian. The scion of an aristocratic family, formally trained in both philology and the sociology of literature, he emerged in the 1910s as a rebel, highly distinctive, voice among the Romanian press and book reviewers. He was a confidant and publisher of the Romanian writer Ion Luca Caragiale, building his theories on Caragiale's already trenchant appraisals of Romanian society and culture. Zarifopol defended art for art's sake even against the Marxism of his father-in-law, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, and the Poporanism of his friend, Garabet Ibrăileanu. He was also a noted censurer of neoclassical trends, of philistinism, and of inauthentic customs, advocating renewal, but not revolution. A skeptic reviewer of modernist literature, he reemerged during the interwar as its dedicated promoter, but his preference for literary entertainment over substance and many of his literary bets were shortly dismissed by other experts of the day.\n\nZarifopol endures in cultural memory as an eccentric—not just because he tackled and derided the literary establishment, but also because he refused to publish most of his work in book form, or take up employment in academia. Having lost a considerable fortune, he lived withdrawn from the public eye, surviving on his revenues as a literary columnist, mostly for Ibrăileanu's \"Viața Românească\". Shortly before his death, he set up his own successful magazine, \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\". In such venues, Zarifopol defended his cosmopolitan philosophy against other philologists, but also against the emerging neotraditionalists at \"Gândirea\" journal. Zarifopol viewed modern traditionalism as a fabrication and, with his essays, came out as a non-traditionalist and anti-totalitarian conservative thinker.\n\nThe future critic was born in Iași to Paul (Pavel) Zarifopol, or \"Zarifopoulo\", and his wife Elena (\"née\" Culiano). His paternal family had attested Greek, and more generically \"southern\" or Balkan, roots. Originally horse traders and assignees for Ottoman Turks settled in Moldavia, they were elevated into the Moldavian boyar nobility after 1850.\n\nOn his mother's Culiano side, Paul was related to prestigious literary and political figures. One of Elena's brothers was Nicolae Culianu, the boyar, astronomer, and doyen of \"Junimea\" literary society, great-grandfather of the religious scholar-novelist Ioan Petru Culianu. His other maternal uncle, who remained closest to Elena, was jurist Ștefan \"Nei\" Stamatiu-Culianu, also a \"Junimea\" man. A sister of theirs, Maria Nanu, was the wife of landowner Gheorghe Nanu—making Paul Jr a first cousin of poet D. Nanu.\n\nThe elder Zarifopol managed the estates of Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza in Cristești. It was there that he and Elena met. According to scholar Elena Vulcănescu, it is possible that Paul Jr was not his natural son, but born to Elena from a liaison with General Grigore Sturdza, heir to the Sturdza estate. Zarifopol eventually bought for himself the baroque manor and Sturdza property at Cârligi, near Roman, then a townhouse in Iași, where he and Stamatiu-Culianu managed Borta Rece tavern. His brothers George and Ștefan Zarifopol both had careers in local politics—the former, a Paris-trained agronomist, as a Prefect, the latter as a delegate to Chamber. Paul Sr was the great-uncle of poet Dimitrie Anghel; another of his nephews, Alexandru Zarifopol, was the adoptive father of writer Alexandru Paleologu.\n\nPaul Sr died in 1881, leaving Stamatiu in charge of family affairs. Their family fortune helped finance both sides of the family, and the Culianu children were all educated abroad. Paul Jr himself graduated from \"Junimea\"s \"Institutele-Unite\" private high school, followed by the literature faculty of Iași University, from 1892 to 1898. He made his published debut in Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol's \"Arhiva\" in 1897, with a review of a historiographical work by Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville. In 1899, he wrote a short story, \"Povestea Moșului\" (\"The Tale of the Old Man\"). Well-liked by his literary friends Gheorghe T. Kirileanu and Paul Bujor, it was published in \"Carmen Sylva\" magazine under the pen name of \"Z.\".\n\nIn 1902, Zarifopol's professor, Alexandru Philippide, took him on as an assistant and considered him for a likely successor; Zarifopol excused himself, and recommended the Jewish intellectual Heimann Hariton Tiktin for that position. As he noted, Tiktin was more qualified, despite being targeted by a \"rather violent antisemitic current\". Instead, Zarifopol left for Germany to specialize in philology (under Hermann Suchier), and philosophy, as a student of Alois Riehl's objectivist worldview. He took a doctorate at the University of Halle in 1904, with a dissertation on trouvère Richard de Fournival.\n\nOn April 25, 1903, at Berlin, Zarifopol married Ștefania (Fany) Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the daughter of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Zarifopol was an atheist; Fany was Jewish, and, like Zarifopol, a religious nonconformist. The couple turned up at the marriage registrar in street clothes and neither held a church wedding nor baptized their children; all this outraged his mother, a strict Romanian Orthodox. Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a literary critic, and his son Alexandru were also Marxist doctrinaires; Alexandru's daughter, also called Fany, was married to Ion Luca Caragiale's son Luca (Luki). While visiting his in-laws, Zarifopol met various figures of international socialism, including revolutionist Karl Radek.\n\nThe Zarifopols had two children: daughter Sonia (born 1904), and son Paul (born 1905). Selling their Cârligi home in 1906, the new family settled in Leipzig, where Paul developed a friendship with Caragiale the elder, who frequently visited from Berlin; with Dimitrie Gusti and Panait Cerna, he is described by Caragiale biographers as the comedic writer's closest Romanian friends in old age, or even, with an affinity in \"sneering spirits\", as his one true friend. The relationship proved decisive in Zarifopol's evolution as a critic, but also left a trace on Caragiale's style: Zarifopol introduced him to the work of Anatole France. Until Caragiale's death in 1912, he and Zarifopol pursued a steady correspondence. Sometimes involving kitsch postcards they each collected for their involuntary humor, such exchanges were noted for witticisms and ridicule of traditional writers. They also shed light on Caragiale's intellectual, psychological, and artistic evolution, making Zarifopol a prime reference in that field.\nFrom 1908 to 1911, Zarifopol contributed to the Munich-based \"Süddeutsche Monatshefte\". Also a correspondent for the Romanian literary press, his writing broke with the older canons of Romanian literary criticism and brought him to the attention of Dobrogeanu-Gherea disciple Garabet Ibrăileanu. Co-opted by the latter to write for \"Viața Românească\", Zarifopol made himself known for sarcastic comments about modernist literature, describing Proust, Gide, and Cocteau as difficult \"boys and children\". Instead, he persuaded Ibrăileanu to publish there a novel written in collaborations by two of his brothers-in-law, Luki and Ionel Gherea. Together with the latter, he also supervised the debut of a female novelist, Lucia Demetrius.\n\nIn 1915, Zarifopol and his family returned to Romania. By then, World War I had broken out, with Romania settled in uneasy neutrality until 1916. For much of that interval, Zarifopol was a literary contributor for Tudor Arghezi's \"Cronica\", but did not necessarily share the magazine's radical stances, nor its anti-war \"Germanophilia\". During the campaigns of 1916–1917, Zarifopol and his family remained in Iași; all of southern Romania fell to the Germans. For a while, accepting Ibrăileanu's offer, he returned to his alma mater as a substitute professor, replacing C. Fedeleș (presumed missing in action). Upon Fedeleș's unexpected return, Zarifopol was sacked. In late 1916, the family took refuge in Russia, settling for a while in Moscow, but were driven out by the October Revolution.\n\nDescribed by historian Lucian Nastasă as a withdrawn, \"neurasthenic\" and \"very impractical\" person, Zarifopol was financially ruined in the monetary devaluation that took place after the war. He supported himself by turning to regular journalism, but still had trouble making ends meet (though he did not admit to it), and made efforts to keep away from the centers of culture, living mostly in provincial Sinaia.\n\nZarifopol, sometimes using the pen names \"PZ\" and \"Anton Gherman\", returned as one of the main columnists at \"Viața Românească\" and its satellite, \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\". Despite his material difficulties, Zarifopol categorically refused Ibrăileanu and Petre Andrei's offers to take a professorate at Iași. In early 1920, he complained that the \"endless infirmities of my children, my wife, and myself\" prevented him from publishing his cultural journalism as an academic volume, which would have qualified him for the office. In 1924, Zarifopol informed his protectors that he now had \"a holy terror of officialdom\", and that he resented Iași for its support for the National-Christian Defense League, a form of \"nationalist imbecility and charlatanry\". As he noted: \"all things considered, I can make a living from journalism alone.\"\n\nA guest writer at Camil Petrescu's \"Săptămâna Intelectuală și Artistică\" in 1924, and, in 1925, at \"Cuvântul Liber\", Zarifopol became more deeply involved in the cultural debates of Greater Romania. This was the time of his explicit emancipation from Dobrogeanu-Gherea's left-wing didacticism and from Ibrăileanu's Poporanism. Didactic and social art, Zarifopol contended, had no real artistic value, and politics were irrelevant in assessing the quality of artistic endeavor. Revising some of his earlier pronouncements on modernism, he now believed in art for art's sake, illustrated by such qualities as \"pleasure\", \"amusement\", \"life\", \"drama\", \"color\", \"strange sensibilities\", or \"childish delirium\". His refusal of didactic art aimed higher, showing up in his celebrated essay on Tolstoy's \"Kreutzer Sonata\". Working from Sinaia, Zarifopol translated and prefaced an anthology of fantasy short stories, published in 1924 as \"Vedenii\" (\"Visions\"). Part of his essays were published as \"Din registrul ideilor gingașe\" (\"A Register of Tender Ideas\", 1926), \"Despre stil\" (\"On Style\", 1928), \"Artiști și idei literare române\" (\"Artists and Ideas in Romanian Literature\", 1930), and \"Încercări de precizie literară\" (\"Essays in Literary Precision\", 1931).\n\nZarifopol's dissidence was admonished by other \"Viața Românească\" veterans Ibrăileanu and Mihai Ralea. Ibrăileanu took in some of Zarifopol's criticism, but argued that some of Poporanism's theories were rehabilitated in psychologism or social determinism, without which \"an artwork can never hope to be fully understood\". The magazine's literary columnists even accused Zarifopol of committing a \"crime\" against taste at \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", where Zarifopol was introducing aestheticist guidelines, albeit with contributions that remained \"interesting and profound\". Nonetheless, Zarifopol's derision of traditionalism and mysticism showed lasting similarities with Ralea's philosophical stances. In 1928, Ralea, Zarifopol, D. I. Suchianu, Felix Aderca and other literati were lumped together as the \"irresponsible malcontents\", in a neotraditionalist pamphlet put out by Petre Pandrea and \"Gândirea\" magazine.\n\nIn his replies, Zarifopol noted that he did not reject mysticism as a cultural phenomenon, only objecting to the \"career mysticism\" of traditionalist ideologues. Contested by young and old critics alike, Zarifopol found himself a follower with Mihail Sebastian, who honored him as \"a lucid man in a time of visionaries\", \"a sober teetotaler during a raging drinking bout\". Zarifopol's cultural role, Sebastian wrote, was that of a \"policeman\", a \"reactionary\", who would curb the excesses of mysticism, \"Trăirism\", and nationalism.\n\nZarifopol eventually moved to Bucharest in 1928, taking up residence on Strada Spătarului, Moșilor. Slowly discarding social and literary criticism in favor of philology, he worked on a critical edition of Caragiale's works; he put out the first three volumes (1930, 1931, 1932), winning a prize from the Romanian Writers' Society. In March 1929, together with Gala Galaction, Nicolae L. Lupu and others, he put out the monthly magazine \"Hanul Samariteanului\", which only published a single issue. Later that year, he became a writer for Isac Ludo's mainly Jewish review, \"Adam\", and, in \"Viața Românească\", published his review of Immanuel Kant's aesthetics (\"Kant și estetica\"). His other contributions appeared in various new magazines and newspapers, including \"Adevărul\" (which in 1927 hosted his humorous memoir of a meeting with Radek), \"Dreptatea\", \"Kalende\", \"Lamura\", \"Gazeta Fălticenilor\", and \"Ancheta\".\n\nHe carried on with his lampoons of traditionalism, publishing, in 1932, an especially mordant portrait of historian Vasile Pârvan, \"Plicticoase fantome\" (\"Tedious Apparitions\"). He was also involved with \"Criterion\", a debate club for political and cultural factions, one of the \"old men\" who were called upon as both arbiters and active participants. He and Ralea were thus present when the debates about Gide, Lenin, Sigmund Freud, and Charlie Chaplin either degenerated into squabbles or were broken up by the far-right Defense League.\n\nIn 1933, Zarifopol was named editor-in-chief of \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\", the official literary magazine, which was largely conceived by him. In February 1934, he was involved with \"Convorbiri Literare\" in round-table talks that were supposed to revive \"Criterion\". These projects ended abruptly when Zarifopol died of a heart attack on May 1, at 12 AM, allegedly while visiting his mistress, musicologist Lisette Georgescu. His body was cremated on May 3, with Camil Petrescu succeeding him at \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\".\n\nHis most important work as a literary critic appeared posthumously in 1934; called \"Pentru arta literară\" (\"For Literary Art\"), it was praised by Sebastian as \"a model of precise understanding of values and of their order\". In 1935, Șerban Cioculescu put out a critical edition of the Caragiale–Zarifopol correspondence, while editing new volumes from the Caragiale corpus, which Zarifopol had begun publishing.\n\nOnce settled in his role as art for art's sake advocate, Zarifopol created himself a confrontational niche, earning both respect and bewilderment from his readers. A traditionalist adversary, Nicolae Iorga, recognized Zarifopol as a \"refined and daring thinker\", while his \"Viața Românească\" partner Ralea called him \"charming and irritating\". Ralea identified in him \"a freethinker\" with \"the courage of looking truth in the face\", but essentially a \"freezing intelligence\" of \"destructive anarchism\", a man \"alone within his sarcasm\". A more virulent review came from classicist George Călinescu, who proposed that Zarifopol's one original note was \"continuous and systematic persiflage, to the point of annoyance\". He attributed such traits to Zarifopol's familiarity with \"two sophistic races\", Greeks and Jews, his claim in turn criticized by Ralea and philosopher Mircea Florian for its racialist undertones. Florian also discussed the constructive side of Zarifopol's work, arguing that accusations of \"bourgeois anarchism\" and \"iconoclasm\" were prejudiced. Another sympathetic reviewer, Andreea Grinea Mironescu, sees Călinescu's pronouncements as \"minimizing and petty.\"\n\nEugen Lovinescu, the modernist literary theorist, shared Zarifopol's overall aesthetic goals, but not his methods: Zarifopol, he writes, was an unlikely follower of Titu Maiorescu's non-didactic school of \"aesthetic autonomy\" and authenticity, which had emerged at \"Junimea\" in the 1860s, and had also influenced Caragiale. In 1941, Nicolae Bagdasar identified in Zarifopol \"a vastly cultured critic, of a rare subtlety and fine irony\", lamenting that his work \"remains scattered in so many magazines\". However, as argued by colleague Pompiliu Constantinescu, this improvidence was a fundamental trait and shortcoming of Zarifopol's literary contribution: his was a \"newspaperman's critique\" of \"spontaneous impression, quick analysis, and incomplete assessment, meaning that he could never embrace a creator in all their complexity.\" The same was noted by Călinescu, who argues that Zarifopol's \"journalistic method\" relied on explicit appeals to popularity and spurious accuracy.\n\nLovinescu assessed that Zarifopol's criticism \"lingers in the paradox\", always placing itself \"at the antipodes of common sense\": denying merit to prestigious figures such as Renan or Maupassant, but praising Ion Minulescu as an outstanding novelist. His \"practical\" verdicts, Lovinescu notes, remain \"disoriented\", \"regrettable\". He acknowledges Zarifopol's \"stylistic rigor\", but concludes that his is \"an equation in which the unknown is better left unknown\", something \"virtually alien to the rhythms of our literary movement.\" The same was argued decades later by Lovinescu disciple Nicolae Manolescu.\n\nAccording to Ralea, Zarifopol should be read as a Romanian counterpart of anti-populist \"lone travelers\", from Barbey d'Aurevilly and Edgar Allan Poe to Hanns Heinz Ewers, often applauding causes that were \"at odds with the establishment\". Thus, responding to the established literary canons, Zarifopol fashioned himself an alternative one, comprising Caragiale, Minulescu, Proust and Cocteau, but also Joseph Delteil, Henri de Régnier, Adrian Maniu, Păstorel Teodoreanu, and Dragoș Protopopescu. Călinescu believes that Zarifopol was most \"intelligent\" in his essays on Proust and Gustave Flaubert, where he overcame his usual \"journalistic banality\".\n\nZarifopol's rejection of neoclassicism, from Goethe to Dimitrie Bolintineanu, but also his friend Panait Cerna, had to do with both its \"mechanic\" use of poetic imagery and its communication of \"bland truths\". He preferred archaic Moldavian forms, that he found resonating in the poetry of Dosoftei and Vasile Alecsandri. Călinescu was especially critical of Zarifopol literal and \"negativist\" reading of Alexandru Vlahuță's \"Din prag\", which ridiculed the poet's presentment of death eternal.\n\nSuch a sustained attack, equated by comparatist Nicolae Balotă with \"a holocaust of poetry\", nevertheless impressed Lovinescu. The latter declared himself in agreement with the thesis that ancient models were perishable, and that traditionalist art was implicitly false. Seen by Alexandru Paleologu as a more radical anti-classicist than Zarifopol ever was, Lovinescu noted in 1943: \"as modernism or synchronism, I have been supporting those same ideas these past twenty years.\" Zarifopol's revolt was more contextual, and bound by his own debt to the classics: Ralea sees him as a classical rationalist in the manner of Voltaire, Sainte-Beuve, and Anatole France, and Călinescu as a \"cultured academic, for all his freethinking airs\", copying his style from Caragiale and Tudor Arghezi, without \"a sense of the sublime\". Balotă also finds Zarifopol a \"suppressed scholar\", \"in denial of his formative background\".\n\nCălinescu sees Zarifopol a man of little classical culture, his \"obviously German method\" being more akin to the sociology of literature. Such verdicts were nuanced by another literary historian, Alexandru Dima, who suggests that Zarifopol did have contribution to the scholarly study of aesthetics, one which \"imposes itself even against his own wish.\" Zarifopol's rejection of scientism and historicism had deep roots in \"Junimism\" and Neo-Kantianism, but Zarifopol also criticized Kantian assumptions about the sublime, finding them too indebted to ethical imperatives. As noted by Dima, his attachment to phenomenology was \"at the very least formal\". According to Balotă, his applications of the art for art's sake principle show that, despite his own claims to the contrary, Zarifopol borrowed his poetics from Henri Brémond, Paul Valéry, and Stéphane Mallarmé.\n\nRevisiting Zarifopol's moralizing essays in 2007, critic Henri Zalis found him to be \"chaste and meticulous, and in this unmatched.\" \"Din registrul ideilor gingașe\", is, according to Lovinescu, an \"interesting intellectual spectacle of deliberate originality\". This is one of several essays containing Zarifopol's \"Junimea\"-like satire of inauthentic \"mofturi\" (\"trifles\" or \"coquetries\", a term echoing Caragiale), including wholesale borrowings of foreign customs that respond to bourgeois tastes. The eponymous \"tender ideas\" were defined by Zarifopol as \"those which should be familiar to any man wishing to pass for cultured, and also those that said man must be careful to speak about just so, lest he insult the views of society\"; the book was addressed to those skeptics who, rejecting cultural crazes, \"still value consistency\". As Ralea notes, Zarifopol's anti-ideological critique, continuing the work of Caragiale, was specifically deriding philosophers and philosophies that were the height of fashion: mystical, Bergsonian, Japonist; other such hobbyhorses were Nietzscheism and psychoanalysis.\n\nCălinescu was unimpressed by Zarifopol's \"rather belated\" satire of bourgeois mores, since \"the bourgeois is no longer that ridiculous conservative figure\". Yet, Zarifopol was not entirely anti-middle class: he believed his type of \"cold lucidity\" was primarily an in-built antidote to the decay of the \"colossal civilization\" that was liberal society. He issued what Florian calls a \"passionate call to order of the bourgeoisie, [which is] still a bearer of cultural values.\" Himself a conservative, Zarifopol expressed his nostalgia for old-regime social differentiation and division of labor, against \"the political type\", and for the nuclear family of patriarchy, against the \"neutralization\" of fathers in modern society. He criticizes both Francophilia and Germanophilia, noting that, although competing, they each supported deindividuation: the former, through corporatism; the latter, through militarism. While targeting philistinism, \"Din registrul...\" is itself an antiintellectualist manifesto. Zarifopol contended that intellectuals were an illusory social class (no economic interest bound together \"a lawyer with a novelist\"), but still collectively responsible for the failures of a society such as Romania's.\n\nZarifopol took distance from more radical antiintelectualist stances, communist as well as Christian; but also noted that natural disunity between intellectuals meant that communist terrorism was itself an intellectuals' affair. Both \"Din registrul...\" an other writings show him as an anti-Soviet in line with Nikolai Berdyaev, and believed that Leninism was a somewhat worrisome, but generally puerile, non-philosophy. Like fascism and, historically, Bonapartism, it stood for a \"simplistic autocratic drive\" and \"stupefied blindness\". Moreover, Zarifopol rejected Marxist literary criticism, with its discourse of base and superstructure, seeing it as the source of modernist kitsch.\n\nIn 2014, posthumously reviewing Zarifiopol's anticommunist notes, scholar Vladimir Tismăneanu described him as a diagnostician of \"totalitarian reflexes\", displaying \"urbanity, civility, moderation and firmness\". Evidence also exists that, beyond this public persona, Zarifopol was more illiberal. Prolonging his antihumanist tendencies, he expressed in private his reserves for the \"deplorable\" literature of \"the oppressed\", including Jews, social climbers, and especially women; according to Nastasă, he was an antifeminist, and perhaps also a misogynist. In 1932, writer Barbu Brezianu suggested that Zarifopol was on the \"far-right\" of Romanian literature, in the \"grand conservative party\" of D. Nanu, Cincinat Pavelescu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Al. T. Stamatiad.\n\nFany Zarifopol, born in 1876, lived until 1945. Paul Jr spent seventeen years as a political prisoner under the communist regime, being released with a general amnesty in 1964. Officially designating him a \"bourgeois idealist\", communist censorship prevented Zarifopol's essays from being either reprinted or quoted before the mid 1960s liberalization. When they were finally returned to circulation, large parts of his work were still being bracketed out.\n\nSonia Zarifopol, who never married, was a lover of literature and, in the 1930s, a discreet presence at Lovinescu's \"Sburătorul\" society. She kept her father's entire collection of manuscripts and documents, now housed at the Museum of Romanian Literature. She died in 1981, and her brother three years later; neither had children of their own. George Zarifopol's son, Constantin Radu \"Dinu\", was a published novelist. His daughter Ilinca, marginalized at home for her aristocratic descent, emigrated to the United States in 1977. A linguist and comparatist, she taught at Indiana University Bloomington, marrying Anglicist Kenneth R. Johnston. She was joined there by her sister Christina Zarifopol-Illias, who organized the Bloomington Romanian Studies Program.\n\nThe critical reappraisal of Zarifopol, begun by Eugen Simion in 1956, was taken up in the 1980s by Paleologu and Marin Mincu. In underground culture, his memory was cultivated by the essayist Nicolae Steinhardt. Although a fervent Orthodox, he viewed the non-believers Zarifopol and Ralea as intellectual standards, praising their \"quick wit\". From 1971, Al. Săndulescu was allowed to publish selections of Zarifopol's literary prose, and, in 1987, Zarifopol's correspondence (at Editura Minerva, with samples in \"Manuscriptum\" magazine). A more thorough recovery came after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, when more complete anthologies first emerged, and Zarifopol monographs were published by Alex. Cistelecan. In 1992, his formerly censored critique of socialism was issued by Editura Albatros as a standalone book, \"Marxism amuzant\" (\"Amusing Marxism\"). His Bucharest home was not fitted with a memorial plaque—the new owners having reportedly refused to allow it.\n\n"}

He is remembered chiefly for his scientific writings and his collections of music of the old masters. Perhaps his most valuable work is his \"Raccolta di Musica Sacra\" in seven large volumes, a reprint of the sixteenth-century church music, mostly by Palestrina, which was supplemented by later and smaller collections, such as \"Excerpta ex celebrioribus de musicâ viris\" (Rome, 1840), and \"Raccolta di Motetti\" (Rome, 1841). On plain chant he published \"Accompagnamento coll' organo\" (Rome, 1840); \"Ristabilmento del canto e della musica ecclesiastica\" (Rome, 1843); \"Saggio storico del canto Gregoriano\" (Rome 1845); \"Prodromo sulla restaurazione de' libri di canto Gregoriano\" (Rome, 1857). He also translated into Italian Catel's \"Traité d'harmonie\" and contributed to the \"Gazzetta musicale di Milano\" and other periodicals many articles on church music of great value to the student.\n"}

{"id": "28760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28760", "title": "SimCity (1989 video game)", "text": "SimCity (1989 video game)\n\nSimCity (later renamed SimCity Classic) is a city-building simulation video game, designed by Will Wright, published by Maxis, and released on 2 February 1989, it is the first game in the \"SimCity\" series. The game focuses on players operating as a mayor whose task is to build up a city, providing basic transit links, power, and simplistic service needs for their residents, while watching out for problems and dealing with a multitude of disasters, most of which are based on real-life disasters. Alongside the option to make a city from scratch, the game also features scenarios that task players to oversee a pre-built city and deal with specific issues that it faces, most of which require the player to rebuild after a disaster.\n\nReleased initially for the Macintosh computer, the game was ported onto various gaming platforms. \"SimCity\" received critical acclaim upon release, becoming a commercial success and establishing the title as one of the all-time greats in city-building simulation games, spawning several sequels as a result - \"SimCity 2000\" in 1993, \"SimCity 3000\" in 1999, \"SimCity 4\" in 2003, \"SimCity DS\", \"SimCity Societies\" in 2007, and \"SimCity\" in 2013. The game became the best-selling Maxis title on PC, until the eventual release of the series spin-off \"The Sims\" in 2000.\n\nThe objective of \"SimCity\" is to build and design a city, without specific goals to achieve. The player can mark land as being zoned as commercial, industrial, or residential, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take many other actions, in order to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as \"Sims\", may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light or heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, adequate electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings—for example, residential areas next to a power plant will seldom appreciate to the highest grade of housing. In the Super NES version and later, the player can also build rewards when they are given to them, such as a mayor's mansion or a casino.\n\nThe player may face disasters including flooding, tornadoes, fires (often from air disasters or shipwrecks), earthquakes and attacks by monsters. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger train crashes by running into passing trains.\n\n\"SimCity\" includes goal-centered, timed scenarios that could be won or lost depending on the performance of the player. The scenarios were an addition suggested by Brøderbund in order to make \"SimCity\" more like a game. The original cities were based on real world cities and attempted to re-create their general layout. While most scenarios either take place in a fictional timeline or have a city under siege by a fictional disaster, a handful of available scenarios are based on actual historical events.\n\n\"SimCity\" was developed by game designer Will Wright. While working on the game \"Raid on Bungeling Bay\", in which the player flies a helicopter dropping bombs on islands, Wright found he enjoyed designing the islands in the level editor more than playing the actual game. This led him to develop increasingly sophisticated level editors. At the same time, Wright was cultivating a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning and acknowledges the influence of System Dynamics which was developed by Jay Wright Forrester and whose book on the subject laid the foundations for what would become \"SimCity\". In addition, Wright also was inspired by reading \"The Seventh Sally\", a short story from \"The Cyberiad\" by Stanisław Lem, in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant, and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress. The game reflected Wright's approval of mass transit and disapproval of nuclear power; Maxis president Jeff Braun stated \"We're pushing political agendas\".\n\nThe first version of the game was developed for the Commodore 64 in 1985; it was not published for another four years. The original working title of SimCity was \"Micropolis\". The game was unusual in that it could neither be won nor lost; as a result, game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully. Brøderbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, Braun, founder of the tiny software company Maxis, agreed to publish \"SimCity\" as one of two initial games for the company.\n\nWright and Braun returned to Brøderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when \"SimCity\" was near completion. After Brøderbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw \"SimCity\", they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, \"SimCity\" was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms, followed by the IBM PC and Commodore 64 later in 1989.\n\n\"SimCity\" was originally released for home computers, including the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS-based IBM PC. After its success it was converted for several other computer platforms and video game consoles, specifically the Macintosh, Acorn Archimedes, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which was later released on Virtual Console), EPOC32, mobile phone, Internet, Windows, FM-Towns, OLPC XO-1 and NeWS HyperLook on Sun Unix. The game is available as a multiplayer version for X11 TCL/Tk on various Unix, Linux, DESQview and OS/2 operating systems. Certain versions have been re-released with various add-ons, including extra scenarios. An additional extra add on for the Windows version of \"SimCity Classic\" was a level editor. This editor could be opened without use of the disc. The level editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create grasslands, dirt land, and water portions.\n\nA version was developed in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\"SimCity\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by Nintendo, the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, Bowser of the \"Super Mario\" series becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a Mario statue that is placeable in the city. The Super NES port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, such as casinos, large parks, amusement parks, and expo centers; some of which would be incorporated into \"SimCity 2000\". A bank can be built which will allow a loan of $10,000 to be taken, but it must be paid back before another loan can be taken out. The game includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player; instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis at 100,000 people. It has some of the same pre-set scenarios in the PC and Mac versions and two new ones. One is in Las Vegas under attack by aliens and another called Freeland. Freeland has no water and no rewards buildings are given. Also unique to the Super NES version is a character named \"Dr. Wright\" (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. The soundtrack was composed by Soyo Oka. The edition is featured as Nintendo's Player's Choice as a million seller.\n\nIn August 1996 a version of the game entitled \"BS Sim City Machizukuri Taikai\" was broadcast to Japanese players via the Super Famicom's Satellaview subsystem. Later, a sequel titled \"SimCity 64\" was released for Nintendo 64DD, the Japan-only Nintendo 64 add-on\n\n\n\"SimCity\" was a financial success, selling one million copies by late 1992. In the United States, it was the ninth best-selling computer game from 1993 to 1999, with another 830,000 units sold. It was critically acclaimed and received significant recognition within a year after its initial release. As of December 1990 the game was reported to have won the following awards:\n\nIn addition, \"SimCity\" won the Origins Award for \"Best Military or Strategy Computer Game\" of 1989 in 1990, was named to \"Computer Gaming World\"s Hall of Fame for games readers highly rated over time, and the multiplayer X11 version of the game was also nominated in 1992 as the Best Product of the Year in \"Unix World\". \"SimCity\" was named #4 \"Ten Greatest PC Game Ever\" by PC World in 2009. It was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiele, a German technology and games trade show, in 2007. Sid Meier in 2008 named \"SimCity\" as one of the three most important innovations in videogame history, as it led to other games that encouraged players to create, not destroy. It was named #11 on IGN's 2009 \"Top 25 PC Games of All Time\" list.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game an B+.\n\nIn 1991, \"PC Format\" named \"SimCity\" one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors called it \"a town planner's dream\".\n\nThe University of Southern California and University of Arizona used \"SimCity\" in urban planning and political science classes. In 1990 The \"Providence Journal\" invited five candidates for Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island to manage a \"SimCity\" town resembling the city; former mayor Buddy Cianci, who was the most successful, won election that year. Chuck Moss of \"The Detroit News\" found that Godzilla attacking the city in the 1972 Detroit scenario caused less destruction than the mayoralty of Coleman Young.\n\nThe \"SimCity Terrain Editor\" was reviewed in 1989 in \"Dragon\" #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the expansion 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nThe ZX Spectrum version was voted number 4 in the \"Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time\".\n\nOn March 12, 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"SimCity\" was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including \"SimCity\".\n\n\"SimCity\" yielded several sequels. \"Sim\" games of many types were developedwith Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including \"SimEarth\", \"SimFarm\", \"SimTown\", \"Streets of SimCity\", \"SimCopter\", \"SimAnt\", \"SimLife\", \"\", \"SimTower\", \"SimPark\", \"SimSafari\", and \"The Sims\", as well as the unreleased \"SimsVille\" and \"SimMars.\" They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as \"SimTower\" and \"Let's Take The A-Train\" (released as \"A-Train\" outside Japan). In 2000 \"The Sims\" was released, which spawned its own series. \"Spore\", released in 2008, was originally going to be titled \"SimEverything\"a name that Will Wright thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve.\n\n\"SimCity\" inspired a new genre of video games. \"Software toys\" that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate \"SimCity\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success. The most successful was most definitely Wright's own \"The Sims\", which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in \"SimCity\" have been incorporated into real-world applications as well. For example, VisitorVille simulates a city based on website statistics.\n\nThe series also spawned a \"\" collectible card game, produced by Mayfair Games.\n\nDr. Wright from the Super NES version has made appearances in several video games. He is a non-player character in \"\", and an assist trophy in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39249519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39249519", "title": "South African Museums Association", "text": "South African Museums Association\n\nThe South African Museums Association (SAMA), a professional body for museums and museum personnel, was founded at a meeting of museum representatives held in the ‘Chinese Room’, Kimberley Public Library, in Kimberley, South Africa, on 23 April 1936. Convened by Mr C.J. Swierstra, an entomologist who was director of the Transvaal Museum, it was established to improve and extend a museum service in South Africa; to encourage interaction between kindred institutions and interested persons; and to generate and communicate museological knowledge in the South African context. Twenty two individuals representing 19 institutions were present at the inaugural meeting of the association.\n\nThe association has fulfilled its goals in part through convening regular annual conferences and workshops, held throughout South Africa, with conference papers being made available through its Bulletin, SAMAB, and via less formal communications in national and branch newsletters.\n\nAs the association grew, so provincial and local branches were formed, in the Western Cape (1975), Transvaal (1982), Eastern Cape (1982), Kwa-Zulu Natal (1984) and SAMA Central, serving the Free State and Northern Cape (1991). After 1994 further branches were formed in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West Province.\n\nSAMA’s geographical scope was sub-continental, not restricted solely to South Africa, with membership open to museum personnel beyond South Africa’s borders. To emphasize this, SAMA officially changed its name to Southern African Museums Association (1975 to 1995), continuing to make its services accessible to members north of the Limpopo.\n\nThe association clashed with the state in the 1980s over the apartheid government’s “general affairs”/”own affairs” policies, which impacted on the administration of museums. SAMA’s stance was strongly affirmed in its 1987 Pietermaritzburg Declaration for South African museums. Concurrently the association embarked on its own process of democratization, amending its constitution in 1990 to strengthen branch representation on council and spelling out its aims to encourage museological research, to promote use of museums, and enhancement of professional training.\n\n"}

It was released on March 16, 2007. A 7 episode series was later produced, telling what happens after the initial movie. The series was called Class: Life After (, which can also be translated as \"Class: Life after\").\n\nJoosep Raak (Pärt Uusberg) is an Estonian teenager who is being bullied by his entire high school class, the ring leader of them all is Anders (Lauri Pedaja), his accomplice Paul (Mikk Mägi) and three other friends Toomas (Joonas Paas), Tiit (Virgo Ernits) and Olav (Karl Sakrits). Anders encourages the class to continually beat up Joosep, and harass him in other ways as well, such as fully undressing him and then pushing him in the girls' changing room. However classmate Kaspar Kordes (Vallo Kirs) decides to go into a matter of loyalty by going against Anders and the others entertainment of harassing Joosep by defending him, such as giving him a spare pair of shoes when Paul had torn them, which does not sit well with the whole class and so Kaspar becomes separated from the whole group the class had formed. Kaspar's love interest Thea (Paula Solvak) becomes distant to him and this begins to worry him but continues to defend Joosep. \n\nJoosep's tutor Laine (Laine Mägi) becomes aware of Joosep receiving harassment and sends Paul to the headmistresses office and so he frames Kaspar of the whole harassment where they believe in him due to being unaware of his true actions, which leads to the school contacting Joosep's parents. Joosep's Father Margus (Margus Prangel) a militarist fascinated with guns and insists on Joosep being a \"real man\" encounters him about the accusation of Kaspar bullying him and so Joosep dismissively reveals that is the whole class which angers Margus and tells Joosep to fight the ringleader of the crowd as he believes it is the only way to stop and scare somebody from bullying him. The next day when Anders and his four friends go to attack Joosep, the restrained Kaspar breaks free and attempts to hit Anders with a chair, which Anders manages to dodge. Anders then claims that Kaspar has \"gone crazy\".\n\nAnders asks Kaspar to meet him in the school playground after class. Upon meeting up with an expected fight, Kaspar tells Anders that he will accept the fact that he will not be a \"normal guy\", where then Paul, Toomas, Tiit and Olav appear with a restrained Joosep and lock Kaspar in a burned down shed where they force him to watch as they take turns to hit Joosep, to the point where he can't breathe anymore. Before leaving off Anders tells Kaspar that if he continues to defend Joosep then it will only earn Joosep worser beatings. Joosep goes to Kaspar's apartment complex where they meet up and he informs Kaspar that he wishes for him to stop defending him, a concerned Kaspar asks what Joosep will do and suggests that he could shoot them by referencing a God's law, Joosep believes that it will be best if he simply let's it go on until he has completely finished school so he will never see them again and be free.\n\nThea becomes saddened and angered when the class starts believing that in a homophobic atmosphere Joosep and Kaspar are ridiculed for supposedly having gay feelings for each other and so she is having love interests in Kaspar. Kaspar becomes stressed by this and tries to talk Thea down about it but she starts believing that Kaspar cares more about Joosep then her and leaves him, meanwhile Joosep is being beaten in class.\n\nWhen returning home, Joosep's Mother Liina (Tiina Rebane) discovers heavy bruises on his chest as well as a cut on his chin, she then becomes heavily worried that he had been fighting and demands to know what is happening but he refuses to tell and Margus supports him on the claim. Liina informs the school administration and at last the class as a whole is rightly blamed. When Laine confronts the class about the claim, Joosep runs home fearing the worst and angered, upon entering his home crying only to encounter Margus who learns that Liina called the school, tries to encourage his son to fight back and demonstrates a fighting technique by giving the boy an additional punch. \n\nOut of revenge, the class assembles on a beach, calling both Kaspar and Joosep there by writing emails to them showing each other as fake sender. Once there, they make Thea confess to Kaspar that she is no longer with him in front of the whole crowd which sets him off and beats Anders to the ground only to have a knife pulled on him, they all then force Kaspar to fellate Joosep at knife point and photograph the sexual act without showing the knife. Kaspar throws up afterwards.\n\nThe boys decide to avenge themselves. Joosep steals Margus's two pistols, a bolt-action rifle and ammunition from his gun safe whilst asleep, and the two proceed to school the next morning. As they proceed, students and teachers notice the guns in their hands, when a teacher encounters them about it they simply walk past and Joosep tells her to call the police. Before entering the cafeteria to shoot their bullies, Kerli (Triin Tenso), a gothic girl from the class who also witnessed the incident at the beach, decides to let the two have their revenge and goes past them. They begin the massacre on the students responsible for their torment. Joosep shoots Tiit at close range and then shoots Olav in the head. Joosep then shoots and kills Thea's best friend Riina (Riina Ries). To their regret, Kaspar accidentally shoots an eighth grade female student from another class while trying to shoot Anders. Toomas tries to grab the gun from Joosep but ends up getting shot in the abdomen, then Anders and Paul manage to restrain him and take his rifle, however Kaspar saves Joosep by shooting Paul in the head, just before Anders could reach the exit and escape he is shot in the shoulder and is executed by Joosep. Joosep then goes over to finish off Thea but Kaspar stops him and decides to spare her. Finally Joosep and Kaspar, facing one another, each aim a gun at their own head, decide to commit suicide together after counting to three. Joosep pulls the trigger and dies, but the film ends with Kaspar still standing there with his gun aiming at his head.\n\n\nIt currently holds an 89% approval rating among users on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIn 2007, the movie received an award from Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and Warsaw International Film Festival. The movie was also the official Estonian submission to the Best Foreign Language Film Category of the 80th Academy Awards.\n\nSince the movie was released, two school shootings have taken place in nearby Finland — the Jokela school shooting and the Kauhajoki school shooting. In analysis of both events, the movie has been raised as an illustration by columnists and other media pundits.\n\n"}

{"id": "1524959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1524959", "title": "University and college admission", "text": "University and college admission\n\nUniversity admission or college admission is the process through which students enter tertiary education at universities and colleges. Systems vary widely from country to country, and sometimes from institution to institution. In India almost all top private colleges and universities are having separate seats for management quota. Education diary plays a vital role in college and universities admission for all Undergraduate and postgraduate programs. \n\nIn many countries, prospective university students apply for admission during their last year of high school or community college. In some countries, there are independent organizations or government agencies to centralize the administration of standardized admission exams and the processing of applications.\n\nAs Australia uses a Federal system of government, responsibility for education, and admission to Technical and Further Education colleges and undergraduate degrees at universities for domestic students, are in the domain of state and territory government (see Education in Australia). All states except Tasmania have centralized processing units for admission to undergraduate degrees for citizens of Australia and New Zealand, and for Australian permanent residents; however applications for international and postgraduate students are usually accepted by individual universities. The Australian government operates the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (This has been replaced by the very similar HECS-HELP - Higher Education Loan Program) for undergraduate students, so admission is rarely limited by prospective students' ability to pay up-front. All states use a system that awards the recipient with an ATAR, and the award of an International Baccalaureate meets the minimum requirements for admission in every state. ATARs are awarded based on the level of attainment in each State's individual secondary schooling exams (such as the NSW HSC). For individuals without an ATAR, or recent secondary schooling certificate, the Special Tertiary Admissions Test is used as the standard test to provide an ATAR. The maximum possible ATAR is 99.95, indicating that the student has achieved better than 99.95% of their peers.\n\nThe Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) processes applications for admission to most undergraduate courses at participating institutions, mainly in NSW and the ACT.\n\nIt also:\n\nThe South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre accepts applications for Northern Territory tertiary institutions. Year 12 students are awarded the Northern Territory Certificate of Education and must meet course requirements.\n\nThe Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre accepts applications for Queensland tertiary institutions. Year 12 students are awarded an Overall Position, based on their performance in class subjects and their school's average result in the Queensland Core Skills Test, as well as meeting course requirements.\n\nThe South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre accepts applications for South Australian tertiary institutions. Year 12 students are awarded the South Australian Certificate of Education, and must meet course requirements. Their year 12 results are compared with students from the same year to determine their Australian Tertiary Admission Rank.\n\nTasmanian school leavers applying for entrance at the University of Tasmania need to apply directly to the university. Tasmanian school students receive a Tertiary Entrance Rank on successful completion of the Tasmanian Certificate of Education. Students from interstate wishing to study at UTas may apply through either the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre, or directly through the University.\n\nThe Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre accepts applications for Victorian tertiary institutions. Applications consist of standardized test results and meeting institutional requirements. The standard certification for school-leavers is the Victorian Certificate of Education.\n\nThe Tertiary Institutions Service Centre accepts applications for Western Australian tertiary institutions. The standardised test for school-leavers is the Tertiary Entrance Examination.\n\nAustria, Switzerland, and Belgium probably have the most liberal system of university admission anywhere in the world, since anyone who has passed the Matura may enroll in any subject field (or even several at no additional cost) at a public university. In Belgium as well, the only prerequisite for enrolling in university studies is to have obtained a high-school diploma. In both Switzerland and Belgium, medical studies are an exception, which have a numerus clausus system due to overcrowding. This liberal admission practice led to overcrowding and high dropout rates in the more popular fields of study like psychology and journalism, as well as high failure rates on examinations which are unofficially used to filter out the less-capable students. Following a ruling by the European Court of Justice issued on July 7, 2005, which forces Austria to accept nationals of other EU Member States under the same conditions as students who took their Matura in Austria, a law was passed on June 8 allowing universities to impose measures to select students in those fields which are subject to numerus clausus in Germany. Starting in 2006, the three medical universities (in Vienna, Innsbruck and Graz) did introduce entrance exams. There are no intentions to introduce a numerus clausus in any subject field.\n\nIn order to enter university in Brazil, candidates must undergo a public open examination called \"Vestibular\", which lasts about 1 week and takes place once a year. Some universities may run Vestibular twice a year, for two yearly intakes instead of only one. This option is popular with private universities, while public universities usually run Vestibular only once every year (in November, December or January). Universities offer a limited number of places, and the best ranked candidates according to their overall Vestibular grade are selected for admission. Although the Vestibular format changes from university to university, it typically consists of a week-long examination on compulsory high school subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Portuguese language and literature, and a foreign language (usually English). Private universities usually \"condense\" this week-long examinations into a couple of days, but some public universities still require a week-long marathon.\n\nSince public universities are completely tuition-free, competition at the Vestibular is usually fierce for a place in a public university. Due to high number of applicants, the Vestibular at some public universities may include a preliminary elimination phase (known as \"\"Primeira Fase\"), typically consisting of multiple-choice questions and held between one and two months before the subject exams. A minimum cutoff score is normally required at the elimination phase to advance to the second part of the Vestibular.\n\nIn recent years, university admission criteria have been considerably changed by the introduction by the federal government of a new national secondary school exam known as ENEM (\"Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio\") and the creation of a unified, national university application system known as SISU (\"Sistema de Seleção Unificada\"). Candidates in any Brazilian state can now apply for admission into courses available in the SISU system, even if the course of interest is offered by an out-of-state university. Places in any given course within the system are then filled based on the ranking of the applicants in descending order according to their overall grade in the ENEM. The application process is divided into three stages and candidates who fail to get a place in their course/university of interest in a given stage may re-apply either to the same or to a different course/university in subsequent stages.\n\nIn theory, any Brazilian university, either public or private, is free to join the SISU system and select their incoming freshman class based on ENEM marks. As of today, most public universities have joined SISU, but a few of them, most notably some of the most prestigious federal universities (e.g. UNIFESP, UFRJ, UFMG, UFRGS) have retained their own independent Vestibular exams, on top of the national ENEM, either for admission into all or part of their undergraduate courses.\n\nSometimes the ENEM replaces the old elimination Part I (\"primeira fase\"\") of the Vestibular. Alternatively, ENEM results may be used as part of the final overall grade in the Vestibular. More rarely, a few public universities have decided not to use ENEM grades at all and continue to base their admission criteria on the Vestibular only. Notable examples in the latter group include the highly prestigious federal military schools like ITA and IME and, as of 2010, the prestigious state research universities in the state of São Paulo (USP and UNICAMP). Resistance to the ENEM among some top public universities comes mostly from the perception that the national federal exam is less selective/rigorous than the older independent Vestibular.\n\nAnother important recent development in university admissions in Brazil has been the introduction in most federal universities of a quota system where a certain number of places are reserved a priori to applicants of a certain racial/ethnic background who have completed their pre-university studies in a public (i.e. state-funded) school. Candidates who qualify may apply to a course of interest under the quota system either through the national SISU system or directly at their university of choice ( in case that university uses both its independent Vestibular and the national ENEM exam to select applicants). Again as a notable exception, the selective federal military schools and the state universities in São Paulo have so far refused to use any quota system based on race or schooling background. USP and UNICAMP, however, have instituted a race-blind \"social inclusion program\" that gives a bonus in the final Vestibular mgrade to candidates who come from the public secondary schools, thus boosting their chances of securing a place in certain university courses of interest without necessarily using a pre-determined quota.\n\nIn Canada, students applying from high school generally hear word back from a college or university between late March and late May, though offers of admission may be extended to high achievers (through GPA or other submissions) as early as November–January. Internationals/US applicants are likely to receive an offer or rejection by early April, depending on the original submission of documents. In some cases, an institution may offer admission in a high schoolers Grade 11 year, if monetary fees are sent in early.\n\nMany Canadian universities offer dual admission to students upon completion of their graduation requirements.\n\nFor example, grade 11 and 12 students at Columbia International College can apply for dual admission at Canadian universities such as York University, University of Alberta, Brock University and Cape Breton University.\n\nAcceptance to a Canadian university or college often requires completion of a high school diploma (or equivalent). Some colleges or universities accept applicants based on other outcomes, such as the General Educational Development test, age and life experience, admissions testing, or other criteria.\n\nIn Canada, the difference between college and university is significantly different from the typical interpretation in the United States or even United Kingdom. A Canadian college is more similar to an American community college. In contrast, a Canadian university is comparable to an American university, and virtually all Canadian universities have endowments over $20 million, most frequently above $100 million. It should be noted that almost all Canadian post-secondary institutions are publicly funded (that is, government subsidized). The few private institutions that are not government-supported are not widely known at all, have generally only been established since the 1980s, and are mostly located in British Columbia.\n\nIn the Canadian education system, which varies from province to province, colleges are geared for individuals seeking more specific technical careers, such as graphic design or animation whereas universities are geared to individuals seeking more academic careers where a university degree is a prerequisite for entrance, such as medicine or law. There are other systems in place for students to enter traditional trades (called \"skilled trades\" in Canada), and some provinces have unique preparatory systems or schools, such as Quebec's pre-university college level.\n\nAdmission to colleges and universities in Canada has been a straightforward process since the 1970s. Students generally rank their chosen institutions in order of preference and submit their transcript to the institution or provincial application service for evaluation. In the majority of cases, acceptance is based entirely on marks, with potential for elevation depending on what province an applicant may be from. Applicants in-province may have less stringent grade requirements than out-of-province applicants. For instance, a student applying from an Ontario high school to a university in Alberta or Quebec is likely to require marginally elevated grades as opposed to applying to any school in Ontario itself, where universities and colleges may have lower requirements for their own province's high school graduates.\n\nIn most cases, Canadian universities require students' high school transcript along with an application for admission. Applications for admission outline additional academic and extra curricular achievements that cannot be expressed through a students' transcript. Generally, universities require that students have taken a university-prep grade 12 English course. Additionally, programs involving mathematics and/or natural science often require students to take a university-prep grade 12 calculus course, as well as university-prep grade 12 biology, chemistry, and physics. Overall, universities base admission around a pupil's academic performance in university/advanced level courses in their grade 11 and 12 years. Also, most universities establish GPA cut offs for admission. This cut off is established based on the competitiveness of individual programs at specific universities. A more competitive program could have a cut off average of 90 percent or higher, while most prestigious programs maintain cut offs around 80 percent. Universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 percent. Students must take university/advanced level courses in grades 11 and 12 in order to apply for university.\n\nCollege requirements vary more significantly, though none have entrance requirements above 85 percent from a Canadian high school. In general though, many colleges (such as George Brown College, and Mohawk College) accept a very high proportion of students with averages above 70 percent, although they may place no limiting minimum for acceptance, and consequently take students with averages below 60 percent. Unlike universities, colleges do not have admission cut offs and as long as students have a passing average and the necessary courses, they can gain admission to most colleges. Incidentally, even the newest Canadian universities have larger endowments than any Canadian college, with no Canadian college having an endowment above $10 million. See List of Canadian universities by endowment.\n\nIn addition, many education systems in Canada have established different courses with varying intensity in order to curtail to a pupil's desired future. Ontario has gone the furthest with this idea, establishing two different streams in their secondary education system. The university stream includes courses that will prepare students for future studies at university, while the college stream is more applied and less intense, preparing individuals for the future pursuit of a college degree. Universities require these advanced courses for admission, while colleges will admit pupils from either stream.\n\nStudents with an IB Diploma can generally enter either college or university more easily than other Canadian high schoolers, due to the material covered in the program. Like students with AP credits, they may also clip courses in university with faculty consent.\n\nIn the case of more select university programs, and for almost all international students, an essay, statement of intent or personal statement of experience must be submitted directly to the faculty being applied for. Additionally, letters of reference, examples of extracurricular involvement, additional community service endeavours, athletic participation, awards and scholarships won and more may all be required for acceptance to some of Canada's top programs.\n\nThere is an array of highly competitive programs within Canadian institutions, on par with some mid- to top-tier programs in the United States. Institutions like the University of Toronto, the University of British Columbia, and McGill University find themselves ranked among the world's top universities. In addition, a large portion (upwards of 30%) of university graduates in Canada continue on to pursue further education beyond an undergraduate degree.\n\nPost-graduate schools in Canada are, as with other parts of the world, restricted to universities (i.e. One cannot get a master's degree from a Canadian college). Admission to any post-graduate program in Canada is difficult, with many universities having world-renowned programs, and Canadian graduate schools being the sites for many famous inventions and discoveries.\n\n\nIn Chile university admission as a freshman are based on the Prueba de Selección Universitaria, PSU, scores and ranking of the applicant. Chilean Traditional Universities tend to put a strong emphasis on Prueba de Selección Universitaria while the majority of the private universities use their own test or handle PSU scores in a different way than the Chilean Traditional Universities. Architecture, theatre, psychology and some medical schools do also often give high value to special tests.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the National College Entrance Examination (高考, \"gaokao\") is given each summer and required for each student. The exam covers common school topics such as math, language, history, science, etc. Better institutions require higher scores for admittance. The required score also varies by province: students in more competitive provinces, like Jiangsu, need higher scores than students from less competitive areas such as Tibet. Conversely, wealthier cities have more universities per capita and hence lower university entrance standards than some poorer provinces such as Anhui. In 2006 for example, the minimum score to enter a key university for applicants from Beijing is 516 but the minimum score for applicants from Henan is 591.\n\nA popular trend in recent years is for students to forfeit the National College Entrance Examination for Western education programs in order to better prepare them for admissions into US universities.\n\nFor Finland, \"see Numerus clausus in Finland\"\n\nSome fields of study explicitly encourage applicants to judge their chances realistically. For example, a student may apply to only one medical school per year. Therefore, choosing to apply to the more competitive medical schools is risky, if the student is not sure about their strength.\n\nFor universities of technology, there is a similar, but less strict mechanism. The students gain extra priority points, which may increase their points for the first choice by up to 12.5%. If a student is admitted to several programs, he can't accept any other than the one with the highest priority.\n\nIn Germany prospective students who have passed the Abitur may decide freely what subjects to enroll in. Recently, however, in some of the most popular and most desired subject fields students have to pass a certain numerus clausus — that is, they cannot enroll unless they have scored a minimum grade point average on their Abitur.\n\nThere are two types of higher education institutions in Germany, the universities (including\" Technische Hochschulen\") and the\" Fachhochschulen\" (polytechnics). A prospective student who has passed the Abitur is qualified for admission to every German university, with the exception of very few new degree programs, for which additional entrance examinations were recently introduced. A Fachhochschule, in contrast, often requires the student to complete an internship to qualify for admission.\n\nThere is also a second German school leaving exam, which qualifies prospective students for admission to higher education in Germany, the \"Fachhochschulreife\", often called \"Fachabitur\" in colloquial usage. An internship is already part of the Fachhochschulreife itself, therefore a Fachhochschule requires no additional internship from the student. However, most universities do not accept this qualification for admission. An exception are universities in the German state of Hesse, who accept this qualification since 2004 for admission to Bachelor's degree courses, but not to the traditional German Diplom degree courses. But with Fachhochschulreife (university of applied sciences entrance qualification) you can visit any Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences) in Germany. You can see the difference between a University / Technische Hochschule and a Fachoberschule very quickly: A Fachhochschule has often the words \"University of Applied Science\" next to its name.\n\nIn Greece there are panhellenic examinations (\"πανελλήνιες\", \"panelinies\") after a student completes likio.\n\nAll public universities in Hong Kong admit local students under the Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS).\n\nThe major criterion of selection is HKALE result, and to a smaller extent HKCEE result and interview performance.\n\nThe major criterion of selection is HKDSE result. To a smaller extent interview performances and to an even smaller extent secondary school performances.\n\nBoth public and private universities in Iceland handle their own admissions. Students apply for a specific course of study and each programme has its own requirements. These are usually a matriculation exam but sometimes a minimum number of credits in certain subjects in gymnasium or even passing an entry test is needed. Foreign students must apply half a year prior to the first semester but the time limit for Nordic citizens is not as strict.\n\nMost Indian universities participate in one or another centralized admission procedure. In summer 2011, an Indian institution was expecting 100% score for gaining admission, highlighting the crisis of confidence in quality of higher education in general and also limitations of admissions process. 2013 National tests and interviews are organized by an independent body composed of members of the participating organizations. Little weight is given to applicants’ past academic record and more to their exam results. Applicants are ranked by exam grades, and submit their preference of universities/programs based on their rank and choice. Some such common entrance tests are:\n\nHowever, Things have now changed and the AIEEE is converted into JEE (MAIN). And the earlier JEE for IITs has converted into JEE (Advanced).\nAll students first have to qualify JEE (MAIN) to be able to appear in JEE (Advanced) under certain criterion.\nStudents need to be in the 20 percentile of their respective boards. Their score of JEE (MAIN) will be formulated by combining the 40% score of their BOARD Examination and 60% of their JEE (MAIN) paper's score.\nOnly the pure JEE (ADVANCED) score will be considered for selection in IITs.\nJEE (Main) will be on the same pattern as earlier AIEEE.\nJEE (ADVANCED) will be on the same pattern as earlier JEE.\nChanges in system take place from 2012.\n\nStates have their own admissions exams and policies. For example, the state of Maharashtra uses the HSC test as a prerequisite for entering Degree level college and uses the SSC test as a prerequisite for entering Junior Level college as well as Diploma Level College. Apart from that 15% reserved for NRI / Foreign students.\nRecently the medical exam known as PMT was dropped with introduction of a nationalised exam known as NEET.\n\nIn Indonesia, University and College Admission is dependent on the University or College Status. Generally, Public Universities conduct their admission in unified system of two as of 2017. Public Nationwide admissions to Public universities are subsidied by the government and students who succeed to enter university from one of the two schemes will enjoy lower to free university program fees. The first alternative is SNMPTN (Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified National Public Universities Admission). SNMPTN is a university admission scheme based on academic performances during the years of Senior High School. This selection system is designed only for students graduating during that respective year only. SNMPTN selection considers a few criteria such as student's academic grades and performances, achievements, stream or type of class (sciene or social, AP or Regular) and originating high school. However, not all senior students can apply, usually only 50% of the graduating class may apply for an 'A' accredited school and lower quotas for other accreditations. According to the law of the Ministry of Higher Education, the total holding admission into a public university should at least be 30% from SNMPTN; each university may allocate more. The second alternative is SBMPTN (Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified Public Universities Admission Examination). SBMPTN is a university admission where you take two or three tests (aptitude test, natural science test, and/or social science test), applicants will also be required to submit into a practical session if the chosen major is art, music, or physical education. You also choose 3 different majors and/or universities. This examination is held nationwide once a year and unlike SNMPTN, is open to high school graduates of the last 3 years. Many students repeat or take gap years to retake the SBMPTN to get into their wanted university. According to the Ministry of Higher Education, minimum 30% of the entire public university quota should admit from SBMPTN. However, most public universities allocate 60% and above for SBMPTN due to the constantly high success rate of students who were accepted from this scheme. SBMPTN is known for its very difficult questions and challenging time-management difficulties. The exam is also held CBT (Computer-Based) starting of last year. Most universities are conducting independent selection mechanism on their own beside SNMPTN and SBMPTN such as SIMAK or PPKB from Universitas Indonesia or UTUL from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). These are called special programs as they tend to be more expensive due to the incentive that these programs are not under government subsidies. Meanwhile, Private Universities usually do their admission before and after Public Universities Admission. They sometimes do several admissions. Governmental Agency Institutions does their admission independently (not included in Unified National Public Universities Admission) and will usually have their own scheme for selection.\n\nIn Ireland, students in their final year of secondary education apply to the Central Applications Office, listing several courses at any of the third-level institutions in order of preference. Students then receive points based on their Leaving Certificate, and places on courses are offered to those who applied who received the highest points.\n\nIn Israel there is a test called The Psychometric Entrance Test (PET). The PET covers three areas: mathematics, verbal reasoning and the English language. It is administered by the Israeli National Institute for Testing and Evaluation (NITE). University admissions are typically based on a weighted average (the \"mit'am\") of the PET score and the GPA of the Bagrut (High School Completion Examination). In addition, some programs in science and engineering require that the applicant's bagrut includes the maximum number of units (\"5 units\") for mathematics.\n\nSome programs have two cutoffs for the mit'am, a higher one for \"guaranteed admission\" and a lower one for \"automatic rejection\". Mit'am scores between the two cutoffs may be admitted on a space-available basis.\n\nIn Palestine there is a National Center for Examinations and Evaluation.\n\nIn Palestine, students are required to undergo the Tawjihi examinations, which then allow the universities (In the West Bank) to consider each pupil.\n\nIn Japan, there are at least three methods for controlling university admissions: the AO method (involving recommendation letters for students who have performed reasonably well and have shown commitment and skill in relation to sports or other extracurricular activities), a centralised multiple choice examination known as the National Center Test for University Admissions, and entrance examinations set by each of the universities. A combination of methods may also be used. For public universities, the Center Test is often used as an initial filtering stage to determine eligibility to take the more difficult examinations set by each individual university. Public national universities usually require candidates to sit examinations across a wide range of subjects, whilst private ones allow a focus on arts and humanities or sciences, reducing the burden of preparation. However, public national universities are popular due to prestige and lower fees, although some private universities are more prestigious than certain public national universities. There is usually no limit on the number of colleges to which a student may apply but public national universities tend to hold their examinations on one of two days, which means that students must in practice choose two preferred public national universities and also correctly estimate their own ability to avoid picking a university examination that is too difficult or that is too easy. To assist with this, private companies run a number of mock examinations throughout the year, enabling candidates to gauge where they rank in comparison to other candidates nationwide. Based on this they will decide which examinations they should realistically be able to attempt. Reforms are to be inplemented to the Center examination in future, with extended answer questions being introduced in addition to multiple choice questions, and with official internationally recognised standardised tests in English being used to replace individual university exams in English.\n\nIn Korea there is national center for test which happens every year around November called su-neung. Many student prepares this test from beginning of middle school throughout their highschool. Very big thing in Korea, and you can choose which subject you are taking the test for.\n\nIn Malta entrance is done after performing well in examinations which are a local version equivalent to the General Certificate of Education.\n\nIn the Netherlands, prospective students have to choose, two years before graduation, for a graduation type (e.g. natural science graduation type). Subjects at Dutch universities freely accept all students who have chosen the correct graduation type (e.g. to enroll in physics, the graduation type 'natural sciences' is required). All other students have to pass an exam to be enrolled (this is the exception). Popular subjects, such as medicine or dental medicine have a numerus fixus, meaning that a limited number of students may enroll for this subject at a particular university. To decide who is allowed, a lottery is held in which ones grades influence chances of being chosen (an indirect and incomplete numerus clausus).\n\nIn Nigeria, undergraduate admissions into universities, polytechnics, monotechnics, and colleges of education and agriculture is administered by a centralized federal government agency known as the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB. The body conducts Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) for prospective university, polytechnics, monotechnics, and colleges of education and agriculture students seeking entrance into tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Students who obtain the minimum cut off mark of 180 in the JAMB_UME are invited by their institution of choice for a second entrance examination called the Post-UTME aptitude test which is conducted by individual tertiary institutions.\n\nIn Norway candidates are admitted to entry-level programs through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service, that ranks qualified students based on a point scheme, that is based on grades and the degree of specialization and choice of study at upper secondary school, as well as age. At Master level admission is based on the grade average at the Bachelor level.\n\nIn Pakistan, public and private universities hold entrance tests for admission in undergraduate and postgraduate degrees either conducted by the university itself or by NTS. The Quota System in Pakistan is also used to give preference to students from backward areas.\n\nFor admission in engineering and medical degrees, ECAT and MDCAT are taken respectively. The appearance in these exams is mandatory for every student to pursue his degree in these disciplines in public sector universities.\n\nIn Portugal admission to higher education level studies requires the secondary school credential, \"Diploma de Ensino Secundário\", which is achieved after completing the first twelve study years. Students must have studied the subjects for which they are entering to be prepared for the entrance exams. Also they are required to be previously specialised in a specific area at the secondary school, one of the following four: Science and Technologies, Economics, Languages or Arts. Students sit for one or more entrance exams, \"Concurso nacional\" for public institutions or \"Concurso local\" for private institutions. In addition to passing entrance exams, students must fulfil particular prerequisites for the chosen course. Enrollment is limited; each year the institution establishes the number of places available. For the public institutions the exam scores count for the final evaluation, which includes the secondary school average marks. Then the students have to choose six institutions/courses they prefer to attend, in preferential order. The ones, who reach the marks needed to attend the desired institution/course, given the attributed vacant, will be admitted. Some public university courses demands generally higher admission marks than most similar courses at some polytechnical institutes or private institutions. (\"see also Education in Portugal\")\n\nTraditionally, the universities and institutes conducted their own admissions tests regardless of the applicants' school record. There were no uniform measure of graduates' abilities; marks issued by high schools were perceived as incompatible due to grading variances between schools and regions. In 2003 the Ministry of Education launched the Unified state examination (USE) program. The set of standardized tests for high school graduates, issued uniformly throughout the country and rated independent of the student's schoolmasters, akin to North American SAT, was supposed to replace entrance exams to state universities. Thus, the reformers reasoned, the USE will empower talented graduates from remote locations to compete for admissions at the universities of their choice, at the same time eliminating admission-related bribery, then estimated at 1 billion US dollars annually. In 2003, 858 university and college workers were indicted for bribery, admission \"fee\" in MGIMO allegedly reached 30,000 US dollars.\n\nUniversity heads, notably Moscow State University rector Viktor Sadovnichiy, resisted the novelty, arguing that their schools cannot survive without charging the applicants with their own entrance hurdles. Nevertheless, the legislators enacted USE in February 2007. In 2008 it was mandatory for the students and optional for the universities; it is fully mandatory since 2009. A few higher education establishments are still allowed to introduce their own entrance tests in addition to USE scoring; such tests must be publicized in advance.(\"see also Education in Russia\")\n\nAdmission to colleges in Saudi Arabia depends on the high school grade as well as the scores of some standardized tests called Qiyas Tests prepared by \"the National Center for Assessment in Higher Education\".\n\nAdmission in Sweden requires completion of secondary education, along with the proper specific qualifications (e.g. science in high school to study science in college). Prospective students are admitted based on their grade point average or SAT, although majors such as theatre and architecture may require some extra work.\n\nIn general, Thailand uses the centralized admission system. In this system, student hoping to finish secondary school or its equivalent is expected to sit many examinations. The one required for nearly all universities is the Ordinary National Education Test (O-NET) aiming to test basic knowledge across the following subjects required under the Thai law:\nStudents then may use the O-NET test score to apply to particular university through the direct admission system by taking tests conducted by particular university. However, most students still use the centralized admission system. In this system, they are expected to take another two aptitude tests, aiming at testing their ability to succeed in university. The first one is General Aptitude Test (GAT). GAT tests the reasoning ability and English proficiency of the candidates. It asks students to link and identity relationships between events. The English section is comparable to the TOEFL test, but is completely objective in nature. Both O-NET and GAT examinations are scored by computer.\n\nThe second examination is the Professional Aptitude Test (PAT). Students may choose to take the tests that are required by the program they are applying to. Therefore, they don't have to take all tests like the O-NET. The subjects offered are as follow:\n\nThe students are responsible to report all scores to the central admission system. They are required to choose a program or faculty that they want to study in. After that, different mathematical formula is used to weighed students' scores for that program. For instance, Pharmacology requires high scores on Sciences, while Economics requires high score in Mathematics. After the score is weighed, students are offered decision only according to their scores. Some exception might occur in program, such fine and applied arts as students are required to submit portfolio for consideration.\n\nThe only exception to centralized admission system and direct admission system is Medicine and Dentistry, which have their own admission system. Students will need to take the following tests to be eligible for consideration:\n\nStudents' scores are also weighed, and admission decision is made accordingly.\n\nIn Turkey, the \"Student Selection and Placement Center\" ÖSYM is the responsible body for organizing ÖSS, the national level university admission examination.\n\nIn the United Kingdom there are separate admission processes for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. There is also The Open University which has an \"open door policy\".\n\nThe United Kingdom has a centralised system of admissions to higher education at undergraduate level, UCAS. In general, students are not admitted to universities and colleges as a whole, but to particular courses of study.\n\nDuring the first few months (September to December) of the final year of school or sixth form college (age 17/18) or after having left school, applicants register on the UCAS website and select five courses at higher education institutes (fewer choices are permitted for the more competitive subjects such as medicine and veterinary medicine). If the applicant is still at school, his or her teachers will give him or her predicted grades for their A-level, Highers or IB subjects, which are then used for the application. If the applicant has already left school, he or she applies with results already obtained. The applicant must provide a personal statement describing in their own words why they want to study that particular subject and why they would be a committed student, and their school must provide an academic reference. Some universities (e.g. Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Imperial College, King's College London or University College London) and some disciplines (e.g. medicine) routinely require shortlisted candidates to attend an interview and/or complete special admissions tests before deciding whether to make an offer. In the absence of tests and interviews, the personal statement and reference can be decisive, as many students are likely to apply to competitive courses with similar predicted and actual grades.\n\nIn general, applications must be received mid-January for courses that start the following Autumn. However the deadline is three months earlier, in mid-October, where the application includes a medical, dentistry or veterinary course, or any course at Oxbridge.\n\nFor each course applied for, the applicant receives a response from the institution: rejection, conditional offer or unconditional offer. If a conditional offer is received, the student can only take up the place on the course if they later fulfil the stated conditions: normally the achievement of specific grades in their forthcoming exams. If no offers are received following the initial application, or the applicant does not wish to take up any of their offers, UCAS+ can be used. Applicants can then apply to one course at a time in order to try to find a suitable offer.\n\nFollowing the receipt of offers, whether after the initial application, or through UCAS+, the applicant chooses two courses for which offers have been made: a first choice and a second choice. If the conditions of the first choice offer are later met, the applicant may attend this course. If the applicant does not fulfil the conditions of their first choice, but does fulfil the conditions of their second \"insurance\" choice, they can attend their second choice course. If they fail to meet the conditions of both offers, they may choose to go through \"clearing\". This involves ringing up or sending their application to different universities in the hope of finding a place on another course. Many students do successfully find places through this route.\n\nWhether to admit an applicant to a course is entirely the decision of each individual university. They will base their decision on a variety of factors, but primarily the grades predicted or already received in school leaver examinations. As more and more applicants are attaining higher and higher grades in the A level examinations, most universities also use secondary admissions criteria. These may include results at GCSE or Standard grade examinations (or equivalent), the references provided on the application and the information provided on the personal statement. The personal statement can often be the deciding factor between two similar candidates so a small industry has sprung up offering false personal statements for a fee. UCAS uses \"similarity detection\" software to detect personal statements that have been written by third parties or copied from other sources, and universities can reject applications for this reason.\n\nThe personal statements generally describe why the applicant wants to study the subject they have applied for, what makes them suitable to study that subject, what makes them suitable to study at degree level generally, any work experience they have gained, their extracurricular activities and any other factors. This is the only way admissions tutors can normally get an impression of what a candidate is really like and assess the applicant's commitment to the subject.\n\nIn addition to the information provided on the UCAS form, some universities ask candidates to attend an interview. Oxford and Cambridge almost always interview applicants, unless, based on the UCAS form and/or admissions tests, they do not believe the applicant has any chance of admission. Other universities may choose to interview, though only in some subjects and on a much smaller scale, having already filtered out the majority of candidates. The interview gives the admissions tutors another chance to assess the candidate's suitability for the course.\n\nUniversities are increasingly being put under pressure from central Government to admit people from a wider range of social backgrounds. Social background can only be assessed by the type of school attended, as no information about income or background is otherwise required on the UCAS form.\n\nAnother important determinant of whether an offer is to be made is the amount of competition for admission to that course. The more competitive the course, the less likely an offer will be made and, therefore, the stronger the application must be. Applicants for medicine are often expected to have undertaken extensive work experience in a relevant field in order to show their commitment to the course. For the most competitive courses, less than 10% of applications may result in admission, whereas at the less competitive universities, practically all applicants may receive an offer of admission.\n\nUltimately, however, no matter how many extra-curricular activities and work experience have been undertaken, if the admissions tutor does not believe, based on the submitted exam results, the candidate is academically capable of completing the course, he or she will not be admitted.\n\nA well qualified candidate applying under UCAS for five competitive courses to each of which only 10% of well qualified candidates could be accepted would have only a 40% chance of receiving at least one offer of acceptance.\nAlternatively, if five less competitive courses each having a 33% acceptance rate are chosen, the chance of receiving at least one offer is more than 85%.\nThis implies that a strategy for improving the chance of receiving at least one offer, to perhaps 70%, is indicated even to well qualified candidates.\nIt is right to know that in order to get admitted in a university in the United Kingdom, admission tests are not identified as the most important as the main factors that determine a college admission. Surveys show that strong grades in college-prep classes are important factors that can help you get in universities in easier way.\n\nAll applications are made directly to the university or college, with no limit on the number of courses that can be applied for.\n\nIn the United States of America, high school students apply to four-year colleges and universities, where undergraduate students may earn a Bachelor's degree. Others attend community colleges or a two-year institution. These students may acquire a technical degree, a two-year Associate degree, and/or prepare for transfer to four-year institutions. Non-traditional students are usually students over the age of 22 who pursue studies in higher education. Students may apply to many institutions using the Common Application. However, as of 2015-2016 the common application only offered applications to 644 of the United States 3,039 four year colleges. Despite this an average of 94% of students applied online for the fall of 2014.There is no limit to the number of colleges or universities to which a student may apply, though an application must be submitted for each. Fees are generally charged for each admissions application, but can be waived based on financial need. \n\nStudents apply to one or more colleges or universities by submitting an application which each college evaluates using its own criteria. The college then decides whether or not to extend an offer of admission (and possibly financial aid) to the student. The majority of colleges admit students to the college as a whole, and not to a particular academic major, although this may not be the case in some specialized programs such as engineering and architecture and maybe more impacted in certain majors. The system is decentralized: each college has its own criteria for admission, even when using a common application form. \n\nCommon criteria include ACT or SAT scores, extracurricular activities, GPA, demonstrated integrity, and a general college admissions essay. Further criteria, used to varying degrees, include athletic ability, interest the student demonstrates in the college, legacy preferences (family members having attended the school), race, ability to pay full tuition, potential to donate money to the school (development case), desired class composition (especially diversity, which includes racial diversity, geographical and national diversity, and diversity of interests in the class), perceived fit, subjective evaluation of student character (based on essays or interviews), and general discretion by the admissions office. The importance of the various factors varies between universities, and selectiveness varies significantly, as measured by admissions rate (which depends both on selectiveness and number and type of applicants). The admissions rate can range from 100% (schools that accept everyone with a high school diploma) to under 10%.\n\n\n"}

There are over 500 opportunities available at 33 federal agencies, and many of the opportunities are looking for more than one intern. Interns can be enrolled in a class or classes at any tertiary institution, but they must be American citizens. All work is virtual, and background clearances are not required. These opportunities are unpaid, but offer real work experience, sometimes involving foreign languages.\n\nThe Virtual Student Federal Service was announced by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in May 2009 as one of several programs in Clinton’s 21st Century Statecraft initiative. Twenty-first Century Statecraft is defined as, “[t]he complementing of traditional foreign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft that fully leverage the networks, technologies, and demographics of our interconnected world.” VSFS partners with U.S. diplomatic posts overseas and State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), NASA, and many other federal agencies to provide virtual internship opportunities.\n\nThe first virtual internship year coincided with the 2009–2010 academic year.\n\nInternships begin in the Fall and end in the Spring, with an application open period in July. Students commit for the academic year, contributing 10 hours a week for the virtual internship. Students communicate with their supervisors often through email, telephone, and Skype. The nature of work varies depending on what the agency needs. The work may be research-based, where the student is required to contribute to reports on issues such as economics, the environment, and human rights, or the work may be technology-focused, such as creating blogs and producing electronic journals. Language skills are sometimes required.\n\nUnited States Department of State: Help build a successful partnership among Department of State bureaus and offices to improve the way employees worldwide use data and knowledge to accomplish their missions.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID): Help connect, support, and promote the work of the Higher Education Solutions Network (HESN) at USAID, a global network of universities that harnesses science, technology, and innovation to solve development challenges.\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA): We seek an intern who can assist in identifying best practices from academia (e.g. cognitive/behavioral science, business/management theory), government, and the private sector so that we may apply this research toward internal programs.\n\nSmithsonian Institution: Help millions of National Zoo visitors plan their visits by designing and building a cutting edge \"plan your day\" tool.\n\nNational Park Service: Display and interpret three large fossil specimens in a permanent Visitor Center installation. This project will include designing an interpretive panel, sign or wall display that tells the story of these fossils, while offering the visitor with some context for the significance of these artifacts.\n\nUnited States Department of Defense: Analyze open-source online data to map and draw conclusions on insurgent activity and international force response in conflict areas in Africa.\n\nNASA: Facilitate agency-wide virtual events and teach employees how to effectively use multimedia platforms; additionally, you will be responsible for coaching NASA employees on the logistics of running a virtual event.\n\nThe competitive process starts with students applying through the USAJobs.gov website. In the application, students may choose from a list of available projects, selecting three in their order of preference. e-Interns must be U.S. citizens.\n\n"}

He has contributed to numerous fields of research: learning science in learning communities, coteaching, authentic school science education, cultural-historical activity theory, social studies of science, gesture studies, qualitative research methods, embodied cognition, situated cognition, and the role of language in learning science and mathematics.\n\nRoth received a master's degree of physics from the University of Wuerzburg and completed a doctorate in the College of Science and Technology at the University of Southern Mississippi (Hattiesburg, Mississippi) with concentrations in cognition, statistics, and physical chemistry. He began to establish himself as a researcher while teaching at Appleby College (Oakville, Ontario). There, he did the research for what became one of the first research articles on the social construction of knowledge in science classrooms: \"The social construction of scientific concepts or The concept map as conscription device and tool for social thinking in high school science.\" There he also conducted the work that would lead to \"Authentic School Science\", in which he provides evidence for how high school students learn science when provided with opportunities to frame their own research questions, which they then answer by designing and conducting experiments. They write up their results, which they have to be able to defend within their learning community. In 1992, he joined Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, British Columbia), where he was mainly responsible for teaching statistics in the Faculty of Education. In his research, he initially focused on learning in science classrooms, but soon expanded his work to learning mathematics and science among future teachers, research scientists, and designers of computer software. In 1997, he was appointed \"Lansdowne Professor of Applied Cognitive Science\" at the University of Victoria. There he further expanded his research on the learning of mathematics and science, for example, on the use of graphs in scientific research and in technical professions.\n\nAlthough he worked within a neo-Piagetian (information processing oriented) paradigm during his doctoral research, using statistical methods, his subsequent work was initially based in school science classrooms and later extended to mathematics and science in fish hatcheries, environmental activism, field ecology, scientific laboratories, dental practice, water technicians, construction sites, and in local communities.\n\nPsychologist tend to theorize graphing, as all other forms of representing activity, as a faculty of the mind. Based on his ethnographic studies of mathematics among scientists, Roth proposes to view graphing as a social practice that humans learn \"in relation with others\"; the relation \"is\" what we subsequently attribute to the mind. Because graphing is a \"social\" fact, it can be studied using anthropological methods, which is precisely what Roth proposes in \"Towards an Anthropology of Graphing\" and in a comprehensive review of the literature.\n\nGestures constitute an integral aspect of knowing and learning. Arising from his studies of learning in high school science laboratories and hands-on elementary school activities, Roth showed how students' scientific knowledge arises from what initially are simply manipulative movements and hand movements to explore and learn about the natural world. These movements later become symbolic movements, that is, gestures, which encode the earliest forms of knowing that can be observed prior to verbal forms. In the main review journal of educational research he published a summary of the work in psychology, anthropology, and linguistics.\n\nWhereas in many professions, practitioner learn while working with others, teachers have to figure out much of their knowledge on their own. Using it initially as a form of staff development, Roth, subsequently working with Ken Tobin, developed coteaching as a form learning to teach while teaching. Together they published \"At the Elbow of Another\", in which they lay out the foundation of this approach. In this model, supervision and evaluation of teaching and research on teaching have to be conducted by teaching together with the resident teachers.\n\nRoth has contributed to this field especially by theorizing school-related processes in terms of a version of this theory that was popularized in the Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research. He proposed a fourth generation of this theory, which takes into account emotion. Together with Yew Jin Lee, he wrote a review of the literature on this \"neglected legacy\" of the work of Lev S. Vygotsky.\n\nMost recently, Roth has been working on questions of embodied cognition, which is in fact a misnomer, for all cognition inherently is embodied. Following the French philosophers Maine de Biran and Michel Henry he conceives of the emergence of signification from the auto-affection of the flesh. All perception, all knowing, all communication therefore arises from forms of movement. In a number of publications, he develops this way of understanding knowing with data from geometry in second-grade classrooms.\n\n\n\n"}
