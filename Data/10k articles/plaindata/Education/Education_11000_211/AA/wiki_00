Baby videos can be used for helping babies learn important educational skills, comprehension, introduction to the environment, as well as music. Some parents use baby videos to help develop their children's motor skills and open their young minds to the world. Certain preschools, educators and caregivers find baby videos to be a useful tool, but medical professionals have yet to determine whether or not baby videos are beneficial to children or not.\n\nSeveral baby videos are available on the market today. They include videos which introduce letters, music videos, or videos that teach babies to communicate when they are young such as signing videos.\n\nThe biggest benefit of digital media on children is the ability to expose children to the world during their “Why?” phase. Digital media will help explain things to children that parents may not have the ability to.\n\nThe earliest forms of entertainment for children were usually meant to be educational. The very first television program that was tailored to children specifically was the BBC’s \"Children’s Hour\"\",\" which was first broadcast in 1946 The United States followed suit in 1947 by airing \"Kukla, Fran, and Ollie,\" a show featuring puppets which ran for 10 years\". Howdy Doody\" and \"Captain Kangaroo\" soon followed, and both ran for over 12 years. The shows that were being broadcast for children were successful, but not necessarily educational. Later on in the 1960’s and 1970’s, television shows for children began to change pace. Not only were the shows being released entertaining and loved by children, but they were also educational. Shows like \"Sesame Street,\" \"Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood\"\",\" and \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" began to gain popularity. These shows’ target audiences were intended to be children in general without a specific age group.\n\nIn 1997 the Baby Einstein Company released its first video \"Baby Einstein\". This was the first educational video targeted specifically to infants. The release of this particular brand of educational videos was very successful, and impactful. The New York Times published in 2003 that 32% of all new babies born in the United States owned a \"Baby Einstein\" video.  There was a surge of educational media targeted towards infants and babies after the initial release of \"Baby Einstein\". Television shows such as \"Teletubbies\" and \"Classical Baby\" were introduced. An entire television network dedicated to infant education called Baby First TV was also created.\n\nThousands of baby oriented educational videos can be found on Youtube, teaching lessons about shapes, colors, numbers, etc. to babies specifically. Mother Goose Club is a Youtube channel devoted to educating infants and toddlers through the use of nursery rhymes. Mobile app developers have also seen the profitability of infant oriented media, and there are now hundreds of mobile applications specifically tailored to educate infants.  \n\nThe educational videos babies are exposed to could actually be harming them. Exposing babies to screens, could take away time that could be used for other things like exploring, interacting, playing, and actively learning . During the first two years, babies are beginning to develop intellectual, social, and emotional skills that are needed in life. If used correctly, these videos could possibly benefit a child’s development. Babies are also learning language during the first two years which is a vital part of childhood development. Children could develop language skills by watching videos as they will begin to mimic the TV characters who talk to them.\n\nSome researchers say that babies rarely benefit from digital media exposure while others say it’s beneficial for their development. In some cases, babies show higher vocabulary from media. It’s difficult for parents to determine how much their child is actually learning from the videos.\n\nThe use of baby videos is not without criticism. Frederick Zimmerman and Dr. Dimitri Christakis of the University of Washington published a study in 2007 that called the positive learning effect of the videos questionable, and say that they may in fact limit the language learning abilities of toddlers.  They claim babies are drawn to the videos due to the rapid scene changes causing an orienting reflex.\n\nStudies have “found that children exposed to educational programs were more aggressive in their interactions.” Educational programs are not only introducing young children to pro-education and pro-social goals, but the conflict between characters is often depicted with characters being unkind to each other or using aggressive actions with each other . The research claims that educational programs are by extension teaching these aggressive tendencies that are being shown in conflict development and that the young children are absorbing this information. This means while teaching them conflict resolution the shows are also teaching children how to behave while in a conflict, which in most cases is harsh and unkind.\n\nAnother aspect of educational programs focuses on how it takes away from the communicating opportunities between child and parent. A study shows the uses of book reading, toy playing, and co-tv viewing to study how well communication between parents and children were conducted. “Although not better than books, toy playing was significantly better than shared TV viewing at encouraging communication”. The study found that tv did not allow for much communication, but when there was communication it was relatively unrelated to what the toddler had asked or said. This is seen as a hindrance to the child’s chance to learn. Educational programs are seen as a hindrance to young children in the aspect of learning due to the poor communication that is had between parent and child.\n\nOne study states that “until about age 2, studies show that young children can’t cognitively comprehend what’s being said and retain that information”. “Television-viewing also fosters less parent-child interaction, cutting down on what experts call “talk time,” in which a child hears lots of vocabulary words that in turn help develop their language abilities”. With no educational value being learned before the age of two and the lack of “talk time” that comes with educational programs this research shows the underside of educational television.\n\n"}

The camp is located on approximately 1200 acres in the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. It can host 4500 5th through 12th grade students across several 12-day sessions each summer. It operates FM radio stations locally and in Grand Rapids that are National Public Radio affiliates. For Central campers, several options for fine arts are offered, including theater, band, choir, art, dance, and many others.\n\nBlue Lake also offers adult camp programs. Rather than the rustic cabins of the camp, adult musicians find accommodation at local hotels. Like the youth programs, adult campers take part in daily instruction on their instrument as well as ensemble rehearsals. Access to the camp’s recreational, elective instructional, and regular concert programs is available to all ages as well.\n\nBlue Lake hosts international exchange students in the arts as well as organizing several ensembles of American students to travel to Europe and perform each year. These ensembles include, but are not limited to, concert band, jazz band, orchestra, and choir. These exchanges serve to expose students to other cultures and have been cited as “outstanding representatives of the United States”. The camp has also initiated such experiments in multi-cultural cooperation as the \"Blue Lake in Bavaria\" concert band which was formed out of a mixture of American and European junior and senior high school students to rehearse and perform together over the course of a month.\n\nPrior to the founding of Blue Lake, Leonard Falcone, baritone virtuoso and Director of Bands at Michigan State University, had conducted many \"Youth Music at Michigan State\" summer camps in conjunction with, and support of, the Michigan School Band and Orchestra Association. At the urging of Fritz Stansell, Falcone shifted his focus to aiding the program at Blue Lake and became a regular staff member/artist in residence. Falcone would be joined later by other notables of the music education and concert band world, such as composers John Barnes Chance and Václav Nelhýbel.\n\nFollowing Falcone’s death in 1985, Blue Lake became home to the new Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival and competition created by his students in his memory and held at Blue Lake every year.

She was also active as an instructor at the \"Dramatens elevskola\". She was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music and a \"Hovsångare\".\n\nShe was born as Caroline Halle, was known in Denmark as \"Caroline Walther\" (1774–80, during her first marriage) and known in Sweden as Caroline Müller (from 1780, after her second marriage).\n\nShe was the illegitimate daughter of the ensign Christian Frederik Halle and Johanne Christine Hansdatter. She was the half sister of the actor Ferdinand Lindgreen.\n\nHer stepfather Thomas Jespersen was a machinist at the Royal Danish Theatre, and had her enrolled as a student in the Royal Danish Ballet in 1761, at the age of six. Soon, she was also assigned small children's parts at the theater. The theater had not yet an organized theater school, but she was tutored in declamation by Dorothea Biehl and drama by Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose.\n\nShe debuted as an actress at the age of thirteen in the role of Pernille in Ludvig Holberg's \"Den Stundesløse\" in the season of 1768-69. She made a success and soon became the leading soubrette actress of the theater. In 1771, she made a debut as an opera singer in the main female part of \"Tronfølgen i Sidon\" by Giuseppe Sarti. In 1773, the theater organized an opera school, and she was successfully educated in opera singing by Michel Angelo Potenza.\n\nIn 1773 she left her abusive mother and the following year, she married the music director and secretary Thomas Christian Walther (1749-1788): the marriage ended in 1775 when he left Denmark, but she was thereafter known as Caroline Walther.\n\nShe performed over 124 roles at the opera theater: as a soubrette and tragedienne in theater productions, and in the female leads of the opera. As an opera singer, she also participated in concerts at the royal Danish court. She is considered to have had a great impact on the great age of Danish opera in the 1770s and has been referred to as the \"perhaps greatest female stage artist\" in Denmark at that time. She was painted by Jens Juel, praised by the poet Johannes Ewald and the \"Det norske Selskab\", and the critic Peder Rosenstand-Goiske wrote: \"The fire and emotion, that she understands to give her action, reveal the great genius of her mind.\"\n\nIn 1777, general H. H. von Eickstedt became director of the Royal Danish Theatre. von Eickstedt reportedly undermined her position because her wished to benefit the career of his lover, Catharine Frydendahl, and it is noted how he gave the role in \"Ewalds Fiskerne\", which was written for her, to Frydendahl. The conflict culminated when von Eickstedt refused to give Caroline's lover, the German violinist Christian Friedrich Müller (1752-1827), a position in the theater, ordered him exiled from Denmark and delayed Caroline's divorce. Reportedly, the theater direction feared that they would loose her if she married a foreigner. In 1780, not long after Caroline had finally been granted her divorce, Christian Friedrich Müller left Denmark for Sweden, and soon after, Caroline left Denmark in the guise of a man after her performance as Louise in \"Desertøren\" and reunited with him in Gothenburg in Sweden, where they married. They had one child, Caroline (1791).\n\nIn 1780, Caroline Müller was engaged at the Royal Swedish Opera in Bollhuset in Stockholm, where she debuted in \"Alceste\" by Glück. Despite her Danish accent, she made a success, and Johan Henric Kellgren wrote: \"Yesterday I cried for two hours at the opera, when Alceste was played for the first time: Mrs Müller made her debut. One might say that there had been no performance or an actress in Sweden before.\"\n\nIn 1782, as she was scheduled to perform in the inauguration performance of the new building of the Royal Swedish Opera, Caroline Müller and her spouse suddenly left her contract in Sweden and left for London to escape her creditors. In London, she became the first Danish opera singer to perform outside of the Nordic countries. In 1783, she returned to the Royal Swedish Opera when King Gustav III of Sweden offered her an immunity against her contract crime and raised her salary, and her husband was given a position at the \"Kungliga Hovkapellet\".\n\nWhen Elisabeth Olin retired in 1784, Müller effectively replaced her as the prima donna of the Royal Swedish Opera, performing in productions written by Italian, French, German and Swedish composers, some of which written by the king, Gustav III. Among her most celebrated parts where \"Armida\" and \"Iphigenie de Thauride\" by Glück. Her most famous part was arguably the role of Christina Gyllenstierna in \"Gustav Wasa\" by Johann Gottlieb Naumann with text by Kellgren and Gustav III and which was referred to as the national opera if Sweden. Her last performance was as Christina Gyllenstierna in \"Gustav Wasa\" for the newly elected crown prince Carl Johan Bernadotte in 1810. She was sculptured by J.T. Sergel and a friend of Edvard du Puy and Carl Michael Bellman.\n\nIn 1791, she visited Denmark and was present at a performance given to the benefit of her mentor, Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose.\n\nCaroline Müller also took students, and Lars Hjortsberg was among her students. From 1812 to 1815, she was the principal of the acting school \"Dramatens elevskola\" in succession to Sofia Lovisa Gråå, which was a period of expansion and development of the school.\n\nCaroline Müller was appointed \"Hovsångare\" and inducted into the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1788 (her spouse was also inducted the same year).\n\nShe played the title role in \"Alceste\" by Gluck with Carl Stenborg and Kristofer Kristian Karsten (season 1780–81); Anguelique in \"Roland\" by Philippe Quinault with Stenborg and Karsten (1781–82); Iphigenie in \"Iphigénie en Tauride\" by Gluck with Stenborg and Karsten; Christina Gyllenstierna in \"Gustaf Vasa\" by Gustav II composed by Naumann with Stenborg and Karsten (1785–86); Armide in \"Armide\" by Quinault with Stenborg and Karsten (1786–87); Christina of Holstein-Gottorp in \"Gustaf Adolf och Ebba Brahe\" (Gustav Adolf and Ebba Brahe) by Gustav III with Franziska Stading, Stenborg and Karsten (1787–88); Prosper in \"Azémia\" by Nicolas Dalayrac with Abraham de Broen and Karsten (1792–93); Aretea in \"Alcides inräde in världen\" (Alcides arrival into the world) by Haeffner with Carl Fredrik Fernstedt and Marie Louise Marcadet; Georgino in \"La soirée orageuse\" by Dalayrac with Abraham de Broen and Kjell Waltman; Josef in \"Les deux petits savoyards\" by Dalayrac with Kristofer Kristian Karsten and Marie Louise Marcadet (1793–94); Malena in \"De gamla friarna\" (The old Suitors) by Dalayrac with Kjell Waltman, Carl Magnus Craelius, Maria Franck and Inga Åberg; Lisette in \"Renaud d'Ast\" by Dalayrac with Karsten (1795–96); Colombine in \"Le tableau parlant\" by André Grétry with Carolina Kuhlman (1798–99); and Dido in \"Aeneas in Carthago\" (Aeneas in Carthage) with Stenborg and Karsten (1799–1800).\n\nGustav Löwenhielm mentioned her importance in Swedish theater and opera history in the 19th century, during a discussion about the employment of foreign artists, when he pointed out that several of the artists during the foundation of the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre had been foreigners: \"Is it impossible to engage Mr Berg and Miss Schoultz? - Generally, I can not see how we can elude the employment of half grown foreigners. Gustav III's \"Swedish\" national theatre started with the \"Danish\" Mrs Müller, the \"French\" Mrs Marcadet, the \"German\" Mamsell Stading, the \"German\" Mrs Augusti and the \"Polish\" Mrs Karsten. These ladies occupied our stage and kept it from the foundation of the opera and the premature departure of Mrs Olin in the beginning of the 1780s, until the year of 1800, when the school of Mrs Desguillons had created Mamsell Wässelia cum celeris.\"\n\n"}

Epple is a US American economist and currently the Thomas Lord University Professor of Economics at Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business. He belongs to the leading scholars in the fields of the economics of education, and urban and real estate economics.\n\nDennis Epple earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering from Purdue University in 1968, whereafter he briefly worked as an engineer for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (1968-69). Epple subsequently changed to the social sciences, earning a Master of Public Affairs from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1971 as well as a M.S. and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton in 1973 and 1975. Since 1974, Epple has worked at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), first as an assistant professor of economics (1974-78), then as associate professor (1978-83), and finally as full professor (since 1983). Following a short position as Gary A. Rosenberg Professor of Real Estate, Finance, and Economics and Director of the Center for Real Estate Research at Northwestern University (1994-95), Epple was made the Thomas Lord Professor of Economics in 1996 and a University Professor in 2013. Moreover, he briefly worked as a fellow at the Hoover Institution and maintains a courtesy affiliation with the H.J. Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management at CMU. In terms of professional service, Epple repeatedly served as Head of Economics (1980-84, 2005-14) at CMU and performed editorial functions with the \"American Economic Review\", \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" and \"Journal of Public Economics\", among others. In 2003, Epple's contributions to economic research were rewarded with a fellowship of the Econometric Society.\n\nDennis Epple's research focuses on political economics, the economics of education, and public finance. More specifically, influenced by the Tiebout hypothesis, Epple has extensively published on the public decision-making, financing and provision of private and public goods and services in local settings, e.g. on fiscal decentralization. Since the late 1990s, this research has branched out into extensive work on topics related to the economics of education (generally together with Richard Romano) such as peer effects, charter schools or school vouchers. Additionally, in the 1990s, Epple published a series of influential articles on the topic of learning curves in industrial organisations (with Linda Argote) and product differentiation. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Epple belongs to the top 2% of most cited economists worldwide.\n\nAfter an early interest in environmental economics, research on the Tiebout hypothesis, led Dennis Epple to adopt a perspective framed by competition between different localities; this perspective is present in much of his research on public and political economics, including school competition. In further research on interjurisdictional competition with Thomas Romer and Radu Filimon, Epple has explored the conditions under which there is an equilibrium between mobile consumers' choices in terms of housing location and public goods provision and how much scope for local redistribution there is if taxpayers are mobile or differ in preferences and incomes. In research with Holger Sieg (and Thomas Romer) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Epple has further investigated the estimation of structural general equilibrium models of interjurisdictional competition. Corresponding applications, e.g. in the Boston Metropolitan Area, have found evidence of sophisticated voting behaviour in line with households' sorting into communities with similar public spending preferences and rejected myopic voting. Finally, in work with Richard Romano during the mid-1990s, Epple has studied how the presence of private alternatives affects public service provision in theory, finding (among else) that the public provision of services without restrictions on privately purchased supplements will be preferred by a majority of households relative to purely market or government-based provision systems, would maximize public and private expenditure on the public good, and be opposed by both poor and rich households.\n\nIn the 1990s, Dennis Epple and Linda Argote contributed substantially to the theory of organizational learning. While Epple and Argote observe learning curves in many manufacturing organisations, they also observe considerable variation in the extent to which organisations' productivity increases in production, which they attribute to differences between organizations \"memories\", employee turnover, economies of scale and knowledge transfers from other products and organisations. \n\nIn 1998, Epple and Richard Romano developed a seminal model of competition between tuition-financed private schools, tax-financed, tuition-free public schools and students that differ in terms of ability and income. The model predicts that private schools will attempt to vary tuition to attract relatively able students through tuition discounts as less able yet wealthy students benefit from the educational peer effects due to their more talented but poorer peers. With regard to public and private schools, these predictions are borne out by later work with David Figlio, which moreover asserts that students' income plays a stronger role in determining placement in the hierarchy of private schools the more public school expenditure falls. In an extension, Epple, Romano and Elizabeth Newlon study the effect of student tracking on school competition and predict that tracking would increase the share of high ability students in public schools but also push wealthy, low-ability students into private education, which attracts the wealthiest and most talented students. These findings have led Epple and Romano to caution that the introduction of municipal school choice programmes may drive wealthy households out of the city centers into the suburbs. To prevent private schools from \"skimming off\" the wealthiest and most talented students, they argue in favour of sophisticated combinations of tuition floors and ceilings, which allow school vouchers to provide the benefits of school competition without making participation in the voucher system compulsory or abiding very high levels of educational stratification. Finally, Epple's and Romano's work on the impact of educational peer effects on student sorting into private and public education has also been applied (together with Holger Sieg) to higher education, which also witnesses the emergence of a hierarchy of schools in terms of quality that is associated with corresponding stratification among students by income and ability.\n\n"}

He is well known for his works on metaphysics and philosophical anthropology. A close associate of Karl Rahner, Coreth is a renowned neo-Thomist of 20th century. He was the Rector of the University of Innsbruck and the Provincial of the Austrian Province of the Society of Jesus.\n\nCoreth specialises in metaphysics, philosophical anthropology, and history of philosophy. He is considered one of the philosophers who sought the creative recovery of Thomas Aquinas' metaphysics through the transcendental method introduced by Joseph Marechal. Particularly, Coreth and other theologians attempted to revive the metaphysics of realism (Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics) by addressing the failure of Kantian philosophy using its presuppositions. One of Coreth's most important works was \"Metaphysik\" where he wrote about the Christian metaphysics of Being so that it presented a completely transcendentally reformulated version. This book also refuted critics such as Etienne Gilson, who argued that transcendental turn among Thomists can only lead to phenomenalism or idealism. \n\nCoreth maintained that instead of having an objective, metaphysics only has a subjective function. Here, metaphysics loses its foundation in being but Coreth said that \"our a priori knowledge is metaphysical knowledge of being, which opens for us the absolute horizon of being as such.\" \n\n\n"}

It is the only public agricultural high school for boys in Australia.\n\nEstablished in 1939, Farrer is one of the few agricultural secondary schools catering for both boarding and day students. The school currently enrols approximately 610 students from Years 7 to 12, including 360 boarders, making it the third largest boarding school in the State. Being a public high School, tuition is free, and the school charges the lowest boarding fees in New South Wales.\n\nWhile an emphasis is placed on the agricultural curriculum, but a broad curriculum is also on offer for students from rural NSW who do not wish to return to the land or gain employment in an agricultural field. Other areas of emphasis at Farrer include sport and student welfare.\n\nFarrer embodies a conservative culture with a high degree of inclusiveness of Ethnicity and Disabilities. School uniform is compulsory and is traditional in style, including blazer, tie and wide-brimmed hat. The school marches each week as part of the school assembly, and a prefect system is in place, playing an important role in the welfare and supervision of students.\n\nFarrer Memorial High School was founded in 1939 by Sir Addison Craig as an agricultural high school for boarders, particularly those who are isolated and day students from the Tamworth region.\n\nThe school was named in memory of William James Farrer (1845–1906), a leading Australian agronomist and wheat breeder, best known for developing the \"Federation\" breed of wheat. His work led to significant increases in the Australian wheat crop for decades to come, and economic prosperity for the wheat industry.\n\nThe Farrer campus is in size, and is located on the outskirts of rural Tamworth, on prime Peel Valley farmland.\n\nThe school's facilities include computer rooms, TAS workshops, a 200-seat auditorium, Old Boys museum and multiple facilities to teach practical agriculture, such as a farm, horticultural centre and piggery. The dairy cattle, White Suffolk Flock and Angus stud are run as profitable business ventures, turning over in excess of A$140,000 at the Bull Sale in 2005.\n\nThe school's sporting facilities include a gymnasium, swimming pool, weights room, tennis courts, basketball courts, football fields and a cricket oval with practice nets. The school also makes use of the city's sporting facilities, including the synthetic hockey surface and athletics track.\n\nStudents at Farrer have the opportunity to undertake study in a number of areas from their School Certificate in Years 9 and 10, through to their Higher School Certificate (HSC) in Years 11 and 12. Some of these subject areas on offer include: Industrial Tech Metal, Industrial Tech Wood, Electronics, Information and Software Technology, Art, Music, Drama, Software Design and Development, Beef production, Sheep production, sport science and Journalism.\n\nAgricultural opportunities include Beef cattle, Sheep, Dairy cattle, Wool husbandry, Horticulture, Pig Production, Egg\nGrowing, Dry land and Irrigated cropping.\n\nAgriculture at Farrer is mandatory for years 7 to 10.\n\nIn years past, a \"sack\" was a student in lower years, particularly years 7–10. Such students were at the beck and call of students in higher years, particularly year 12, to labour at menial tasks such as shining boots, fetching food or creating confetti with a paper hole punch. The name \"sack\" was said to be derived from the idea that younger years were a load to carry, as a sack.\n\nThe power was not restricted to year 12. Students of any year higher than another were empowered to issue such commands. For example, a year 8 boy could make demands of a year 7 boy. In this respect, the sack system may differ from the English practice of Fagging.\n\nFailure to comply on the part of a \"sack\" was often disciplined with corporal punishment from the year 12 students. This punishment commonly took the form of being struck on the backside with a broom, occasionally without pants. Active resistance to the system was met with ongoing intimidation, assault and bullying from many members of the school community, including the principal.\n\nThis punishment resulted in the interesting linguistic twist of the word broom being used as a verb. For example, \"Tell that sack to get on with it or he's going to get broomed\".\n\nThe school has now admitted in court that this system existed and that it failed to implement adequate control.\n\nAlumni of Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School are known as Old Boys, and may elect to join the school's alumni association, the Farrer Old Boys' Association. The Old Boys network totals approximately 4000 members across NSW, Australia and the world. Some notable Farrer Old Boys include:\n\n\n\n\nNeville West - Australian Walkley Award winning investigative journalist.\n\n\n\n"}

The publication seeks to contribute to mutual understanding and dialogue between cultures and civilizations. This series seeks to illustrate the encounters between cultures across history and their respective contributions to the general progress of humankind. This is done through the promotion of a pluralist vision of history.\n\nThe Caribbean is understood to encompass the islands in the Caribbean sea and also the coastal part of South America, from Colombia to the Guyanas and the riverine zones of Central America. Despite the varieties of different languages and customs in this region, many cultural commonalities exist among the populations due to shared experiences and histories.\n\nIn an attempt to promote the preservation of cultural identities and greater understanding among peoples through intercultural dialogue and exchange, UNESCO has promoted and supported the exploration of the history of Caribbean peoples. The project brought together various scholars and researchers at universities and explores civilization, development, and culture in this region. The collection addresses indigenous communities, slave societies, the influx of settlement with people from Asia, and movements towards autonomy and independence.\n\nThe General History of the Caribbean is published in six volumes and seeks to provide an historical account of the area from the perspective of those who live there, highlighting the richness and diversity of these cultures. It seeks to integrate the historical experience of its peoples and societies from the earliest times to the present to highlight the common heritage and destiny of Creole populations and societies in the region. The collection highlights the population of the Caribbean not as an object of history, but rather actors of their own history.\n\nThe first and second volumes of the General History of the Caribbean begin with analyses and discussions of the indigenous peoples of the region, including hunter-gatherers as well as cultivators associated with the beginnings of village life – the first of the populations to be enslaved. The major struggles that occurred during this period as a result of excessive inhumanity and disease, are studied. The numbers of these populations significantly dwindled and in the eighteenth century, those resisting colonial powers were transported to the coast of Belize, where they established communities that continue to exist today.\n\nVolume III of this history entitled The Slave Societies constitutes a central point of reference. In examining the creation of new societies, full account is taken of slavery, the terrible toll of human life and suffering it exacted and its pervasive impact on the psyche of the Caribbean people, both white and black. Resistance to slavery took many forms, of which marronnage in Haiti, Jamaica and Suriname, where the numbers were large, has received the most attention. Revolts and rebellions persisted throughout the region from the seventeenth century, although the best known is understandably that which led to Haiti’s independence at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The abolition of the British slave trade left slavery itself intact, until it gradually succumbed in the decades of the nineteenth century, first to the creed of the French Revolution, then to the combination of slave rebellions in the islands and the determined protestations of humanitarians and free traders in Europe.\n\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, the disputes between estate owners and the emancipated field labourers, referred to in Volumes I and IV, opened the way for the influx of people from Asia, predominantly from India, thus adding a new element to the Creole societies which had gradually been formed since the sixteenth century. To avoid this supply of new labour for sugar estates becoming the restoration of slavery in a new guise, the recruitment of the labourers and their condition of work in the islands were regulated by law. Nevertheless, the constraints of indenture and the indignities attendant on being estate labourers affected the way in which Creole societies developed in the twentieth century. Undoubtedly, slavery and indenture have influenced the social and economic relations of societies in the circum-Caribbean in ways productive of ethnic and class conflict. Yet they have not only been the sources of cruelty and injustice, of acts remembered and resented. By persistent resistance to these oppressive regimes, these societies have also endowed themselves with the dignity and self-confidence of free people. [1]\n\nDuring the latter part of the nineteenth century, the impulse towards autonomy which was felt by some of the propertied and educated elites was frustrated by international, political and economic circumstances outside their control. The production of sugar from cane continued to dominate the Caribbean economies, with oil, minerals and tourism becoming important items in the twentieth century. The influx of American capital and the gradual diminution of European interests in the Caribbean led to the expansion of American influence in the region from the turn of the century onwards, notably in Cuba, Haiti and Santo Domingo. This was the context in which the movements for self-determination worked, complicated everywhere by racial prejudice and disparities in the ownership of property.\n\nIn the years following the Second World War, examined in Volume V, the islands and their immediate mainland neighbours have sought a variety of solutions to the problems which arise from societies asserting political autonomy while possessing economies dependent on overseas markets where their goods are protected from competition. Puerto Rico became the ‘Estado Libre’, a Commonwealth; the French-speaking islands became departments of France; the Dutch-speaking islands, prior to the independence of Suriname, all became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; the British islands first flirted with a Federation, then became independent states separately; other states, following periods of military dictatorship, have pursued the path of socialist revolution. Currently, both in the islands and on the continent, there is a growing tendency for policy to be guided by regionalism, by the impulse towards association and co-operation, towards the formation of trading blocs, initially prompted by geographical propinquity.\n\nThe Working Group convened by the Director-General of UNESCO in Paris in 1981 to begin work on the project of writing a General History of the Caribbean – separately from the General History of Latin America. In conjunction with the Working Group and broad consultation carried out by the Regional Offices in Latin America and the Caribbean, a Drafting Committee was established by the Director-General. This Drafting Committee included 19 scholars and researchers from a range of places, two-thirds of whom were from the Caribbean, including Martinique, Santa Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, Barbados and Cuba. The six-volume History was officially launched in 1993 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011.\n\n\n[1] Frederico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO 1987-1999, Preface: The General History of the Caribbean\n\n"}

Like the Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Science, Master of Engineering Studies or Master of Professional Engineering which are coursework master's degrees. Exceptions are Monash University which awards a Master of Engineering Science by either research or coursework, the University of Melbourne which offers a Master of Engineering by coursework, and the University of Tasmania which offer a Master of Engineering Science by research.\n\nThe University of Melbourne accepted the first intake of Master of Engineering students in February 2010. The coursework Master of Engineering is offered in 11 specialisations and accepts graduates with three-year degrees in Science and Maths.\n\nThe entry requirement is completion of a bachelor's degree at or above the second class honours level. Some universities do not offer direct enrolment into Doctor of Philosophy degree and students must first enrol in a lesser research degree before \"upgrading\".\n\nIn Brazil, the rough equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree of typically two years' length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis or research paper in applied engineering. Entrance to a Master of Engineering degree is a 5-year bachelor engineering degree.\nAnother variant (academic master) is equivalent to a Master of Science, such degree is tied to extensive research and is valid for a Ph.D. entry.\nBoth can be stricto sensu classified and it depends of the course provider institution..\n\nIn Canada, the Master of Engineering degree is a professional degree of typically two years length that involves coursework and a thesis or research paper of significant depth. Some Canadian universities offer a Master of Engineering or either a Master of Science or Master of Applied Science in engineering or both. Master of Engineering degrees usually require more coursework and examination and less research, whereas Master of Applied Science degrees require less coursework and more research. However, this is not absolute since some universities only offer a Master of Engineering and some only offer a Master of Science or Master of Applied Science. Some universities differentiate only by the requirement to be resident and therefore assist in teaching/tutoring for a Master of Science Degree.\n\nIn Colombia, the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of five years. Depending upon the emphasis is called Ms.Eng. with emphasis in Energy, Chemistry, Environment and so on. At the end, it is required to make a publication of the developed work in a recognized journal of scientific spreading as a requirement for the degree.\n\nIntroduced with the Bologna process, the Croatian Master of Engineering is typically a two-year program and a direct continuation of a three-year Bachelor course. The degree is abbreviated mag. ing. and followed by the field of study (for example: \"mag. ing. računarstva\" – Master of Computer Engineering)\n\nThere are two distinct degrees in Finland, a taught university degree (\"diplomi-insinööri\") and a polytechnic master's degree's (\"insinööri (ylempi AMK)\"). While the former is translated as \"Master of Science in Technology\", the term \"Master of Engineering\" is predominantly used by Universities of Applied Sciences, which offer master's degree programmes to holders of polytechnic bachelor's degrees (\"insinööri (amk)\"). As European Bologna process directs, in order to get a M.Eng. degree, B.Sc. engineers have to additionally study full-time one or two years and finalize a Master's thesis. Most of the M.Eng. degree programs are taught in Finnish, but some Swedish and English language programs also exist.\n\nIn France, two diploma exist for 5 years of study in the field of engineering: the Master's diploma in engineering (\"diplôme de master en sciences de l'ingénieur\") which is usually delivered by Universities and the Engineer's degree (\"diplôme d'ingénieur\") which can only be delivered by some Engineering schools called grandes écoles—very selective schools that are generally smaller than universities—and provides \"a level of education comparable to a master's degree in engineering in the United States\" (AACRAO).\n\nThe Engineer's degree usually prepare students for professional careers. Courses always include management, economy or more generally transverse courses. Training periods in industry or in laboratories are also required. The Master's diploma in engineering offers a more focused approach on a field of engineering. A Ph.D. program can be joined by acquiring a Master's diploma in engineering or an Engineer's degree.\n\nIn Germany, the local engineer's degrees (Diplomingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university and Dipl.-Ing. (FH), the engineering degree offered by Fachhochschulen after 4 years of study) were abolished in most universities in 2010 and were replaced by postgraduate master's degrees (M.Sc. and M.Eng.).\n\nThe first Master of Engineering courses were introduced in Germany in 2000 as result of the Bologna process. This type of master's degree is offered by German universities and \"Fachhochschulen\" (\"Universities of Applied Sciences\") alike and is typically a two-year program with application-oriented coursework and an applied research thesis. The entry requirement is the successful completion of a bachelor's degree or an equivalent from before the Bologna process, with good marks. The nine leading German Technical Universities (Group of TU9) prefer awarding the Master of Science degree for completing engineering studies in a master's program.\n\nIn India, Master of Engineering (ME) or Master of Technology (MTech) or Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is a postgraduate program in engineering field. This is generally a 2-year program (2 or more years in case of M.Sc.Eng. degree) after completing a 4-year undergraduate program in engineering resulting in the award of a Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology degree.\n\nMaster of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree in India is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than Ph.D. and considered to be parallel to M.Phil. degree in humanities and science.\n\nIn Italy, the local engineer's degrees (Laurea in Ingegneria), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university were abolished in most universities in 2008.\nThe equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree (Laurea Magistrale) of two years length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis paper in applied engineering. Entry requirements to a Master of Engineering degree include a 3-year bachelor engineering degree (Laurea).\n\nIn New Zealand, the Master of Engineering degree is generally a research based degree requiring completion of a thesis in key universities (University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, etc.). Similar to the UK's Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in engineering or technology, it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than a coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Studies which is coursework master's degree.\n\nIn Auckland University of Technology (AUT), this degree can be achieved either by completing a thesis (research pathway) or a combination of coursework and research project (coursework pathway).\n\nIn Nepal, Master of Engineering or Master of Technology degree is a postgraduate program in engineering. This is generally a 2-year specialization program in a specific branch of engineering field. Students typically enter the ME/MTech program after completing a 4-year undergraduate program in engineering resulting in the award of a Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology degree. Kathmandu University, Tribhuwan University, Pokhara University and Purvanchal University offer this degree.\n\nIn Japan, the , which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is a research degree between the bachelor's degree and the doctor's degree and requires completion of a thesis.\n\nIn Singapore, the master of engineering is a research-based postgraduate program that typically lasts 2 to 3 years including coursework and must be completed by a comprehensive thesis evaluated by an examination committee. It is generally awarded as a pre-doctoral qualification in the field of engineering. This is in contrast to the \"master of science\" programs in engineering which are coursework-based and do not require a research thesis.\n\nIn South Korea, the master of engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is commonly awarded for specializations in the field of engineering rather than the science. For example, the degree \"master of science in computer science\" differs from the degree \"master of engineering in computer science\" in that the latter one is mainly concentrated on the applicability of the design with strong relation with the hardware rather than the software. Generally, the master of engineering program includes both coursework and research.\n\nMagister inżynier (mgr inż., literally: \"master engineer\") academic degree that can be obtained after 2 years post-graduate education (for students having already B.Eng.—\"inż.\") or formerly (until full adaptation of Bologna process by university) through integrated 5 years B.Eng.–M.Eng. (or B.Sc.–M.Sc) programme, giving double degree \"mgr inż.\"\n\nFIIT STU Software engineering IEE accreditation\n\nBefore the introduction of the Bologna Process, there were two different Spanish Engineering degrees: \"Ingeniería\", which took 5 or in some cases 6 full-time yearly courses; and \"Ingeniería Técnica\", of a shorter duration: 3 years or in some cases 4 full-time yearly courses.\n\nIn the wake of the Bologna Process, the Spanish Educational System implanted the \"Máster Habilitante en Ingeniería\" and the \"Máster Universitario en Ingeniería\" degrees (Postgraduate Studies), which use the ECTS system designed by the European Union. They are slightly shorter to the second half of the former Engineering (\"Ingeniería\") academic degree, whereas the Technical Engineering Degree is approximately similar to the Bachelor's Degree within the Bologna system.\n\nEducation in Engineering in Spain had traditionally not too many specialties (Naval, Aerospatial, Industrial, Civil, Telecommunications, Informatics, among others) as in the past specialization was not so necessary but after Bologna the Degrees and Masters branched out numerously, giving birth to hundreds of different combinations, opening the possibility to do a bachelor's degree in one university and specialty and then to take a Master´s degree on another specialty, perhaps at a different university, having usually passed an individual interview by the Dean and/or a \"Propedeutics\" exam or test of some sort, designed to guarantee a solid basis upon which to build further knowledge, that must take into consideration the relationship between the two branches of knowledge and among the subjects being taught at both degrees at the origin and the destination.\n\nThe \"Master of Engineering\" title was introduced in some Swedish universities proceeding the Bologna process. The title \"civilingenjör\" (literally translated \"Civilian engineer\", the English term \"Civil engineer\" is not equivalent to \"civilingenjör\") is the equivalent of a M.Eng. as well as the \"Master of Science in Engineering\" title. A Master of Science in Engineering is awarded after a minimum of 5 years of studies. Before 2007-07-01, it was awarded after a minimum of 4½ year of studies. Students starting with their studies before 2007-07-01, but finishing them before 2015-06-30 and after 2007-07-01, may choose to obtain the title either after 4½ year or after 5 years.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the degree of Master of Engineering (MEng) is the highest award for undergraduate studies in engineering. It is the standard university-level qualification taken by people wishing to become chartered engineers registered with the Engineering Council (EngC). The MEng degree represents the minimum educational standard required to become a chartered engineer, but there are other equally satisfactory ways to demonstrate this standard such as the completion of a BEng Honours and a subsequent postgraduate diploma, MA or MSc or by completion of the Engineering Council Postgraduate Diploma administered by City and Guilds. The UK MEng (undergraduate degree) is typically equivalent to the European \"Diplom Ingenieur\" (Dipl.-Ing.) and degrees.\n\nEngC's minimum requirement for entry to a recognised MEng course is BBB at A-level, compared to CCC for a BEng Honours course. Universities are free to set higher entry requirements if they wish. Some universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge and some courses at Imperial only admit students to study for the MEng degree. (Their courses usually allow a student to leave with a bachelor's degree after three years, but these shortened degrees are not ECUK-recognised and therefore do not count towards the educational requirements for becoming a chartered engineer) Other universities, such as the University of Greenwich, University of Surrey, Coventry University, Brunel University and Swansea University, admit students to read for BEng Honours and MEng courses and allow students to change between the two during the early years of the course. The Open University offers the MEng degree as a postgraduate qualification but requires students to complete its course within four years of completing a BEng Honours degree.\n\nIn England, Northern Ireland and Wales the degree is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering degree (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer onto the MEng The Graduateship in engineering, awarded by the City & Guilds of London Institute (Institution Established in 1878 recognized by Royal Charter n.117 year 1900), is mapped to a British Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)—BEng (Honours)—degree. The Post Graduate Diploma is mapped to a British Master of Engineering (MEng) degree. The Membership in Engineering (MCGI)(NQF at Level 7) is a strategic Management/Chartered professional level and a Post Graduate Diploma, mapped to a British master's degree, awarded by the City & Guilds of London Institute. This will be supported by a minimum of ten years of seasoned experience (peer reviewed) in areas as the Engineering + a British bachelor/graduateship (or by CEng).\n\nEngineers who have been awarded a BEng(Ordinary) or BEng(Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the work place are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng). If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of post graduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of 4–8 years in practice for a total of 8–12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured post graduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development IMechE enable the Engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.\n\nChartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are very broadly equivalent to (but not the same as) North American Professional Engineer (PEng / PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. However, P.Eng/PE serve a very different purpose than the CEng qualification. PE/P.Eng are licenses to practice engineering in the public domain with legal liability at the state or provincial level. Unlike C.Eng they are not qualifications or titles. Under government legislations they allow one to engage in professional practice in a defined geographic region. For example, in Ontario the P.Eng license is issued within the Professional Engineers Act (established in 1922). Despite the Washington accord PE/PEng does not equal C.Eng. The ability of a C.Eng to practice engineering in the public domain in North America is determined on a case by case basis usually by state or province. Agreements to recognize qualifications between EngC or Engineers Ireland and Engineers Canada or the USA ABET are not recognized by individual states or provinces.\n\nMEng degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from bachelor's degrees with lectures, laboratory work, coursework and exams each year. There is usually a substantial project to be completed in the fourth year which may have a research element to it and a more teaching-based project to be completed in the third year. At the end of the third year, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to allow progression to the final year. At some universities, the structure of the final year is rather different from that of the first three, for example, at the University of York, the final year for the Computer Systems and Software programme consists entirely of project work and intensive advanced seminar courses rather than traditional lectures and problem classes. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard British undergraduate degree classification scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail' as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.\n\nAt some universities in the UK in the early 1980s, the MEng was awarded as a taught postgraduate degree after 12 months of study. Its entry requirements would typically be like those for other taught postgraduate courses, including holding an undergraduate degree and its format would be similar to the modern MEng although, as with many postgraduate master's degrees, the project would extend over a longer period. MEng courses in their modern, undergraduate form were introduced in the mid-1980s in response to growing competition from technical-degree graduates from continental Europe, where undergraduate bachelor's degree courses are often longer than the usual three years in the UK. There was a feeling among recent graduates, the engineering institutions, employers and universities, that the longer and more in-depth study offered on the continent needed to be made available to UK students as well. Since to obtain a taught master's degree in the UK typically took an additional year beyond a bachelor's degree, it was decided that this extra year would be integrated into the undergraduate program and, instead of pursuing both a bachelor's and master's degree, students would proceed directly to a master's degree.\n\nSince its introduction, the MEng has become the degree of choice for most undergraduate engineers, as was intended. The most common exception to this is international students who, because of the substantially higher fees they are charged, sometimes opt to take the tradition BEng/B.Sc. route where that is available. Most of the engineering institutions have now made an MEng the minimum academic standard necessary to become a Chartered Engineer. Students who graduated before the changes in the rules will still be allowed to use their bachelor's degree for this purpose and those who have earned a bachelor's degree since the changes can usually take some additional courses (known as 'further learning') over time to reach an equivalent standard to the MEng Some older universities such as Durham allow students to obtain the BEng degree after the third year before continuing on to the fourth year.\n\nThe MEng is one of a number of integrated master's degrees introduced in the UK since the late 20th century, the other major degree introduced being MSci (Master in Science). Some universities, however, have chosen to award subject specific integrated master's degrees, in subjects such as Mathematics (MMath), Computer Science (MCompSci), Physics (MPhys), Chemistry (MChem) and Biology (MBiol).\n\nIn the United States and Canada the Master of Engineering degree is generally a professional degree offered as a coursework-based alternative to the traditional research-based Master of Science. It is typically a two-year program, entered after the completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree and many universities allow students to choose between the Master of Engineering and the Master of Science.\nThe Master of Engineering degree is offered at many leading universities in the United States and Canada on either a full-time and part-time (weekends or evenings) basis and is considered a terminal degree in the field of engineering.\n\nSome M.Eng. degree programs require a scholarly project in addition to coursework. Some Master of Engineering programs require additional courses beyond those required for Master of Science students in order to better prepare students for professional careers. Some Master of Engineering programs highly encourage students to participate in collaborative consulting projects. These courses may include topics such as business fundamentals, management and leadership.\n\n"}
{"id": "227112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227112", "title": "Mentorship", "text": "Mentorship\n\nMentorship is a relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The mentor may be older or younger than the person being mentored, but he or she must have a certain area of expertise. It is a learning and development partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn. Mentorship experience and relationship structure affect the \"amount of psychosocial support, career guidance, role modeling, and communication that occurs in the mentoring relationships in which the protégés and mentors engaged.\"\n\nThe person in receipt of mentorship may be referred to as a protégé (male), a protégée (female), an apprentice or, in the 2000s, a mentee. The mentor may be referred to as a godfather or godmother or a rabbi.\n\n\"Mentoring\" is a process that always involves communication and is relationship-based, but its precise definition is elusive, with more than 50 definitions currently in use. One definition of the many that have been proposed, is \n\nMentoring in Europe has existed since at least Ancient Greek times. Since the 1970s it has spread in the United States mainly in training contexts, with important historical links to the movement advancing workplace equity for women and minorities, and it has been described as \"an innovation in American management\".\n\nThe roots of the practice are lost in antiquity. The word itself was inspired by the character of Mentor in Homer's \"Odyssey\". Though the actual Mentor in the story is a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess Athena takes on his appearance in order to guide young Telemachus in his time of difficulty.\n\nHistorically significant systems of mentorship include the guru–disciple tradition practiced in Hinduism and Buddhism, Elders, the discipleship system practiced by Rabbinical Judaism and the Christian church, and apprenticing under the medieval guild system.\n\nIn the United States, advocates for workplace equity in the second half of the twentieth century popularized the term \"mentor\" and concept of career mentorship as part of a larger social capital lexicon which also includes terms such as glass ceiling, bamboo ceiling, networking, role model, and gatekeeper—serving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970, these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech.\n\nThe European Mentoring and Coaching Council, also called the EMCC, is the leading global body in terms of creating and maintaining a range of industry standard frameworks, rules and processes across the mentoring and related supervision and coaching fields e.g. a code of practice for those practising mentoring.\n\nThe focus of mentoring is to develop the whole person and so the techniques are broad and require wisdom in order to be used appropriately.\nA 1995 study of mentoring techniques most commonly used in business found that the five most commonly used techniques among mentors were:\n\n\nDifferent techniques may be used by mentors according to the situation and the mindset of the mentee, and the techniques used in modern organizations can be found in ancient education systems, from the Socratic technique of harvesting to the accompaniment method of learning used in the apprenticeship of itinerant cathedral builders during the Middle Ages. Leadership authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner advise mentors to look for \"teachable moments\" in order to \"expand or realize the potentialities of the people in the organizations they lead\" and underline that personal credibility is as essential to quality mentoring as skill.\n\nMultiple mentors: A new and upcoming trend is having multiple mentors. This can be helpful because we can all learn from each other. Having more than one mentor will widen the knowledge of the person being mentored. There are different mentors who may have different strengths.\n\nProfession or trade mentor: This is someone who is currently in the trade/profession you are entering. They know the trends, important changes and new practices that you should know to stay at the top of your career. A mentor like this would be someone you can discuss ideas regarding the field, and also be introduced to key and important people that you should know.\n\nIndustry mentor: This is someone who doesn't just focus on the profession. This mentor will be able to give insight on the industry as a whole. Whether it be research, development or key changes in the industry, you need to know.\n\nOrganization mentor: Politics in the organizations are constantly changing. It is important to be knowledgeable about the values, strategies and products that are within your company, but also when these things are changing. An organization mentor can clarify missions and strategies, and give clarity when needed.\n\nWork process mentor: This mentor can speed quickly over the bumps, and cut through the unnecessary work. This mentor can explain the 'ins and outs' of projects, day to day tasks, and eliminate unnecessary things that may be currently going on in your work day. This mentor can help to get things done quickly and efficiently.\n\nTechnology mentor: This is an up-and-coming, incredibly important position. Technology has been rapidly improving, and becoming more a part of day to day transactions within companies. In order to perform your best, you must know how to get things done on the newest technology. A technology mentor will help with technical breakdowns, advise on systems that may work better than what you're currently using, and coach you through new technology and how to best use it and implement it into your daily life.\n\nThese mentors are only examples. There can be many more different types of mentors. Look around your workplace, your life, and see who is an expert that you can learn something from.\n\nThere are two broad types of mentoring relationships: formal and informal. Formal mentoring relationships are set up by an administrative unit or office in a company or organization, which solicits and recruits qualified individuals who are willing to mentor, provides training to the mentors, and then helps to match the mentors up with a person in need of mentoring. While formal mentoring systems contain numerous structural and guidance elements, they still typically allow the mentor and mentee to have an active role in choosing who they want to work with. Formal mentoring programs which simply assign mentors to mentees without giving these individuals a say have not performed well. Even though a mentor and a mentee may seem perfectly matched \"on paper\", in practice, they may have different working or learning styles. As such, giving the mentor and the mentee the opportunity to help select who they want to work with is a widely used approach. Informal mentoring occurs without the use of structured recruitment, mentor training and matching services. Informal mentoring arrangements can develop naturally from business networking situations in which a more experienced individual meets a new employee, and the two strike up a rapport.\n\nIn addition to these broad types, there are also peer, situational and supervisory mentoring relationships. These tend to fall under the categories of formal and informal mentoring relationships. Informal relationships develop on their own between partners. Formal mentoring, on the other hand, refers to a structured process supported by the organization and addressed to target populations. Youth mentoring programs assist at-risk children or youth who lack role models and sponsors. In business, formal mentoring is part of talent management strategies which are used to groom key employees, newly hired graduates, high potential-employees and future leaders. The matching of mentor and mentee is often done by a mentoring coordinator, often with the help of a computerized database registry. The use of the database helps to match up mentees with mentors who have the type of experience and qualifications they are seeking.\n\nThere are formal mentoring programs that are values-oriented, while social mentoring and other types focus specifically on career development. Some mentorship programs provide both social and vocational support. In well-designed formal mentoring programs, there are program goals, schedules, training (for both mentors and protégés), and evaluation. In 2004 Metizo created the first mentoring certification for companies and business schools in order to guarantee the integrity and effectiveness of formal mentoring. Certification is attributed jointly by the organization and an external expert.\n\nThere are many kinds of mentoring relationships from school or community-based relationships to e-mentoring relationships. These mentoring relationships vary and can be influenced by the type of mentoring relationship that is in effect. That is whether it has come about as a formal or informal relationship. Also there are several models have been used to describe and examine the sub-relationships that can emerge. For example, Buell describes how mentoring relationships can develop under a cloning model, nurturing model, friendship model and apprenticeship model. The cloning model is about the mentor trying to \"produce a duplicate copy of him or her self.\" The nurturing model takes more of a \"parent figure, creating a safe, open environment in which mentee can both learn and try things for him-or herself.\" The friendship model are more peers \"rather than being involved in a hierarchical relationship.\" Lastly, the apprenticeship is about less \"personal or social aspects... and the professional relationship is the sole focus\".\n\nIn the sub-groups of formal and informal mentoring relationships: peer mentoring relationships are relationships where individuals are at the same skill training, similar positions and stages of career. However, one person may be more knowledgeable in a certain aspect or another, but they can help each other to progress in their work. A lot of time, peer relationships provide a lot of support, empathy and advice because the situations are quite similar.\n\nSituational mentoring: Short-term relationships in which a person mentors for a specific purpose. This could be a company bringing an expert in regarding social media, or internet safety. This expert can mentor employees to make them more knowledgeable about a specific topic or skill.\n\nSupervisory mentoring: This kind of mentoring has'go to' people who are supervisors. These are people who have answers to many questions, and can advise to take the best plan of action. This can be a conflict of interest relationship because many supervisors do not feel comfortable also being a mentor.\n\nMentoring circles: Participants from all levels of the organization propose and own a topic. They then meet in groups to discuss the topic, which motivates them to grow and become more knowledgeable. Flash mentoring is ideal for job shadowing, reverse mentoring, and more.\n\nFlash mentoring: Creates a low-pressure environment for mentoring that focuses on single meetings rather than a traditional, long-term mentoring relationship.\n\nMeta-analysis of 112 individual research studies found mentoring has significant behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career benefits.\nThese benefits for a mentee depend on which of the different (not mutually exclusive) functions is performed by the mentor. Originally, the concept of mentoring functions was developed based on qualitative research in a organizational context with functions being subsumed under two major factors: psychosocial support (e.g. role modeling, friendship, emotional support, encouragement) and career-related support (e.g. providing advice, discussing goals). An early quantitative approach found role modeling to be a distinct third factor. In mentoring for college success, a fourth function concerning knowledge transfer was additionally identified. Later research also found this function in the context of mentoring creativity.\n\nEspecially in the workplace, there are also many benefits for an employer in developing a mentorship program for new and current employees.\n\nCareer development: Setting up a career development mentoring program for employees enables an organization to help junior employees to learn the skills and behaviours from senior employees that the junior employees need to advance to higher-responsibility positions. This type of mentoring program can help to align organizational goals with employees' personal career goals (of progressing within the organization). It gives employees the ability to advance professionally and learn more about their work. This collaboration also gives employees a feeling of engagement with the organization, which can lead to better retention rates and increased employee satisfaction.\n\nHigh potential mentoring: The most talented employees in organizations tend to be difficult to retain, as they are usually seeking greater challenges and responsibilities, and they are likely to leave for a different organization if they do not feel that they are being given the opportunity to develop. Top talent, whether in an innovation or management role, have incredible potential to make great things happen for an organization. Creating a mentoring program for high-potential employees that gives them one-on-one guidance from senior leaders can help to build the engagement of these talented employees, give them the opportunity to develop, and increase their retention in the organization.\n\nDiversity mentoring: One of the top ways to innovate is by bringing in new ideas from senior employees and leaders from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, ethnic minorities, etc.). Who is an underrepresented group depends on the industry sector and country. In many Western countries, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in executive positions and boards of directors. In some traditionally gender segregated occupations, such as education and nursing, however, women may be the dominant gender in the workforce. Mentors from underrepresented groups can empower employees from underrepresented groups to increase their confidence to take on higher-responsibility tasks and prepare for leadership roles. By developing employees from diverse groups, this can give the organization access to new ideas, new ways of looking at problems, and new perspectives. This also brings cultural awareness and intercultural dialogue into the workplace.\n\nReverse mentoring: While mentoring typically involves a more experienced, typically older employee or leader providing guidance to a younger employee, the opposite approach can also be used. In the 2000s, with the rise of digital innovations, Internet applications and social media, in some cases, new, young employees are more familiar with these technologies than senior employees in the organizations. The younger generations can help the older generations to expand and grow towards current trends. Everyone has something to bring to the table, this creates a \"two way street\" within companies where younger employees can see the larger picture, and senior employees can learn from young employees.\n\nKnowledge transfer mentoring: Employees must have a certain set of skills in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. Mentoring is a great approach to help employees get organized, and give them access to an expert that can give feedback, and help answer questions that they may not know where to find answers to.\n\nMentorship provides critical benefits to individuals as well as organizations. Although mentorship can be important for an individual's career advancement, in the United States it historically has been most apparent in relation to the advancement of women and minorities in the workplace. Until recent decades, American men in dominant ethnic groups gained most of the benefits of mentorship without consciously identifying it as an advancement strategy. American women and minorities, in contrast, more pointedly identified and pursued mentorship in the second half of the twentieth century as they sought to achieve the professional success they had long been denied.\n\nIn a 1958 study, Margaret Cussler showed that, for each female executive she interviewed who did not own her own company, \"something—or someone—gave her a push up the ladder while others halted on a lower rung.\" Cussler concluded that the relationship between the \"sponsor and protégé\" (the vocabulary of \"mentorship\" was not yet in common use) was the \"magic formula\" for success. By the late 1970s, numerous publications had established the centrality of mentorship to business success for everyone and particularly for women trying to break into the male-dominated business world. These publications noted the many specific benefits provided by mentorship, which included insider information, education, guidance, moral support, inspiration, sponsorship, an example to follow, protection, promotion, the ability to \"bypass the hierarchy,\" the projection of the superior's \"reflected power,\" access to otherwise invisible opportunities, and tutelage in corporate politics.\n\nThis literature also showed the value of these benefits. A \"Harvard Business Review\" survey of 1,250 top executives published in 1979, for example, showed that most had been mentored or sponsored and that those who received such assistance reported higher income, a better education, a quicker path to achievement, and more job satisfaction than those who did not. The literature particularly emphasized the necessity of mentoring for businesswomen's success. For example, although women made up less than one percent of the executives in the \"Harvard Business Review\" survey, all of these women reported being mentored. In subsequent decades, as mentoring became a widely valued phenomenon in the United States, women and minorities in particular continued to develop mentoring relationships consciously as they sought professional advancement.\n\nResearch in the 1970s, partly in response to a study by Daniel Levinson, led some women and African Americans to question whether the classic \"white male\" model was available or customary for people who are newcomers in traditionally white male organizations. In 1978 Edgar Schein described multiple roles for successful mentors. He identified seven types of mentoring roles in his book entitled, \"Career Dynamics: Matching individual and organizational needs\" (1978). He said that some of these roles require the teacher to be in a position of power such as \"opener of doors, protector, sponsor and leader.\"\n\nCapability frameworks encourage managers to mentor staff. A manager can mentor their own staff, but more likely will mentor staff in other parts of their organisation, staff in special programs (such as graduate and leadership programs), staff in other organisations or members of professional associations.\n\nMentoring covers a range of roles. Articulating these roles is useful not only for understanding what role you play, but also for writing job applications. Demonstrating how you go about mentoring needs a language of behaviours.\n\nTwo of Schein's students, Davis and Garrison, undertook to study successful leaders of both genders and at least two races. Their research presented evidence for the roles of: cheerleader, coach, confidant, counsellor, developer of talent, \"griot\" (oral historian for the organization or profession), guardian, guru, inspiration, master, \"opener of doors\", patron, role model, pioneer, \"seminal source\", \"successful leader\", and teacher. They described multiple mentoring practices which have since been given the name of \"mosaic mentoring\" to distinguish this kind of mentoring from the single mentor approach.\n\nMosaic mentoring is based on the concept that almost everyone can perform one or another function well for someone else — and also can learn along one of these lines from someone else. The model is seen as useful for people who are \"non-traditional\" in a traditional setting, such as people of color and women in a traditionally white male organization. The idea has been well received in medical education literature. There are also mosaic mentoring programs in various faith-based organizations.\n\nCorporate mentoring programs are used by mid-size to large organizations to further the development and retention of employees. Mentoring programs may be formal or informal and serve a variety of specific objectives including acclimation of new employees, skills development, employee retention and diversity enhancement.\n\nFormal mentoring programs offer employees the opportunity to participate in an organized mentoring program. Participants join as a mentor, protégé or both by completing a mentoring profile. Mentoring profiles are completed as written forms on paper or computer or filled out via an online form as part of an online mentoring system. Protégés are matched with a mentor by a program administrator or a mentoring committee, or may self-select a mentor depending on the program format.\n\nInformal mentoring takes places in organizations that develop a culture of mentoring but do not have formal mentoring in place. These companies may provide some tools and resources and encourage managers to accept mentoring requests from more junior members of the organization.\n\nA study of 1,162 employees found that \"satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than the presence of a mentor, whether the relationship was formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program.\" So even when a mentoring relationship is established, the actual relationship is more important than the presence of a relationship.\n\nFortune 500 companies are also implementing formal mentoring programs on a global scale. Cardinal Health has had an enterprise-wide formal mentoring initiative in place since 2011. The initiative encompasses nine formal mentoring programs, some enterprise-wide and some limited to specific business segments and functions. Goals vary by program, with some focused on employees facing specific challenges or career milestones and others enabling more open-ended learning and development.\n\nNew-hire mentoring programs are set up to help new employees acclimate more quickly into the organization. In new-hire mentoring programs, newcomers to the organization (protégés) are paired with more experienced people (mentors) in order to obtain information, good examples, and advice as they advance. It has been claimed that new employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.\n\nThese mentoring relationships provide substance for career growth and benefit both the mentor and the protégé. For example, the mentor gets to show leadership by giving back and perhaps being refreshed about their own work. The organization receives an employee that is being gradually introduced and shaped by the organization's culture and operation because they have been under the mentorship of an experienced member. The person being mentored networks, becomes integrated easier in an organization, gets experience and advice along the way. It has been said that \"joining a mentor's network and developing one's own is central to advancement\" and this is possibly why those mentored tend to do well in their organizations.\n\nIn the organizational setting, mentoring usually \"requires unequal knowledge\", but the process of mentorship can differ. Bullis describes the mentoring process in the forms of phase models. Initially, the \"mentee proves himself or herself worthy of the mentor's time and energy\". Then cultivation occurs which includes the actual \"coaching...a strong interpersonal bond between mentor and mentee develops\". Next, under the phase of separation, \"the mentee experiences more autonomy\". Ultimately, there is more of equality in the relationship, termed by Bullis as Redefinition.\n\nHigh-potential mentoring programs are used to groom up-and-coming employees deemed to have the potential to move up into leadership or executive roles. Here the employee (protégé) is paired with a senior-level leader (or leaders) for a series of career-coaching interactions. These programs tend to be smaller than more general mentoring programs and mentees must be selected based on a list of eligibility criteria to participate. Another method of high-potential mentoring is to place the employee in a series of jobs in disparate areas of an organization (e.g., human resources, sales, operations management, etc.) all for short periods of time, so they can learn in a \"hands-on\", practical fashion, about the organization's structure, culture, and methods.\n\nMentees are matched with mentors by a designated mentoring committee or mentoring administrator usually consisting of senior members of the training, learning and development group and/or the human resources departments. The matching committee reviews the mentors' profiles and the coaching goals sought out by the mentees and makes matches based on areas for development, mentor strengths, overall experience, skill set, location and objectives.\n\nMentoring technology, typically based on computer software, can be used to facilitate matches allowing mentees to search and select a mentor based on their own development and coaching needs and interests. This mentee-driven methodology increases the speed in which matches are created and reduces the amount of administrative time required to manage the program. The quality of matches increases as well with self-match programs because the greater the involvement of the mentee in the selection of their mentor, the better the outcome of the mentorship. There are a variety of online mentoring technology programs available that can be utilized to facilitate this mentee-driven matching process.\n\nSpeed mentoring follows some of the procedures of speed dating. Mentors and mentees are introduced to each other in short sessions, allowing each person to meet multiple potential matches in a very short timeframe. Speed mentoring occur as a one-time event in order for people \"to meet potential mentors to see if there is a fit for a longer term engagement.\"\n\nIn many secondary and post-secondary schools, mentorship programs are offered to support students in program completion, confidence building and transitioning to further education or the workforce. There are also peer mentoring programs designed specifically to bring under-represented populations into science and engineering.\nThe Internet has brought university alumni closer to graduating students. Graduate university alumni are engaging with current students in career mentorship through interview questions and answers. The students with the best answers receive professional recommendations from industry experts build a more credible CV.\n\nInstructional coaches are former teachers or principals that have shown effectiveness in their work of teaching or leading and go through additional training to learn more about the technical skills needed to be an effective coach. In her book \"The Art of Coaching\", Elena Aguilar recommends that a coach \"must have been an effective teacher for at least five years.\" Though skills that were effective in the classroom are a must, the coach must also be confident in working with adults, bringing strong listening, communication, and data analysis skills to the coaching position. Ultimately, an instructional coach is a former teacher who was successful in the classroom and is respected in the field, with the respect carrying over into this new position.\n\nCoaches seek to work one-on-one with teachers or in a small group setting with teachers to build student achievement in the classroom based on data collected and discussed by both teacher or coach. According to Melinda Mangin and KaiLonnie Dunsmore, instructional coaching models may include: \"cognitive coaching, clinical supervision, peer coaching and mentoring, formal literacy coaching, informal coaching, or a mixed model. Other researchers have described categories of coaching such as data-oriented, student-oriented, managerial, and coaches who work with individual teachers or with groups of teachers\". Ultimately, coaching roles are designed to increase teacher capacity and push teacher improvement through learning opportunities. The practice of instructional coaching is embedded within the work of a teacher, not in isolation of their everyday teaching. In other words, the coach works with the teacher throughout the school year and meets during the school day with the teacher regarding current lessons, planning, and the observations/data collected. The discussions between the instructional coach and teacher are built upon mutual respect and a trusting relationship through confidentiality. Overall, instructional coaching is meant to serve as professional development for the teacher(s).\n\nA coach's main responsibility in this way is to change practice and build knowledge on \"new instructional materials, programs, and initiatives\" with the teacher. This professional development can come through discussion, but also can come in other forms. Instructional coaches can model lessons and instructional strategies in the teachers' classroom to show examples and have teachers feel more confident in using these strategies. Teacher observations is one of the most powerful ways that coaches can put data for change in front of teachers. Coaches doing observations and collecting data to debrief with teachers helps paint a picture for teacher improvement.\n\nAccording to a three-year research study done by the Pennsylvania Institute for Instructional Coaching, there was an increase in student success when instructional coaching was used in the classroom. This, however, could not be viewed as solely \"instructional coaching\" in isolation of other factors. The coaching \"model emphasizes the simultaneous use of four strategies: one-on-one teacher engagement; evidence-based literacy practices applied across the curriculum; data analytics; and reflection on practice.\" Yet, teachers have shared that:\n\n\nIn addition to this, \"the most effective professional development model is thought to involve follow-up activities, usually in the form of long-term support, coaching in teachers' classrooms, or ongoing interaction with colleagues.\" In most cases, instructional coaching can provide this support and meet this definition of effective professional development.\n\nThere should also be support from administration around the instructional coaching to align the work of the coach and teacher with the school's mission or vision. Knight focuses on the partnership with the principal being at the core of successful coaching. Knight explains that the principal and the instructional coach need to be aligned in their goals for the coaching occurring. If they have differing desired outcomes for teaching, then the teacher will be receiving mixed messages and caught between improvement and a standstill. Aguilar suggests that coaches continually ask about the school's goals as well as action steps to meet these and bring into daily coaching.\n\nIn conjunction with this partnership and observations, Knight's belief of data usage is critical for teacher improvement during coaching sessions. Knight shares how giving opinions and telling a teacher how to improve stops the learning for the teacher and instead creates a barrier between the coach and teacher and makes the teacher expect hand-holding. Instead, the data needs to tell a story for the teacher to determine moves to try to improve. This allows ownership for the teacher as well as understanding of their work in conjunction with the work.\n\nThe relationship and trust between the coach and coachee are a critical component of coaching. A coach having specific content knowledge and respect in a teacher's field of teaching would help build trust. Another way to build this trust is through confidentiality. By keeping all conversations confidential and sticking to that, the coachee knows that your word is good. In addition to relationship building, it is important to let the coachee feel comfortable talking to you about anything—there may need to be the time when a crisis they are facing trumps conversation about the lesson. Starting a coaching conversation about how life is going for a coachee is also important to relationship building.\n\nAccording to Nelson and Sassi, \"knowledge of pedagogical process and content knowledge must be fused\" in both understanding teaching and observing teaching. For example, an instructional coach that is working with a math teacher should know \"current mathematics education reform efforts are built on the notion that the ideas in a subject, and the ways in which students and teachers work with the ideas, matter.\" It seems clear that a deep pedagogical knowledge as well as deep content specific knowledge are required for the teacher to have confidence in the coach and for the coach to be able to step in and assume the role of the teacher.\n\nKnowledge that coaches need to be effective span just content and pedagogical knowledge. Aguilar uses the ladder of inference to allow coaches to evaluate their own thoughts, and ultimately use this ladder to help principals and teachers evaluate their own beliefs before jumping to assumptions. Aguilar states that her \"list of beliefs has changed over the years. You can change yours, too. The point is to be mindful of the beliefs from which we're working and to notice the effect of working from those beliefs.\" Beliefs can change about approaches to teaching, classroom management, or even content knowledge.\n\nBlended mentoring is an implementation of information technology (IT) into the traditional mentoring program, intended to give to career counseling and development services the opportunity to adopt mentoring in their ordinary practice.\n\nIn the reverse mentoring situation, the mentee has less overall experience (typically as a result of age) than the mentor (who is typically older), but the mentee has more knowledge in a particular area, and as such, reverses the typical constellation. Examples are when young internet or mobile savvy millennial generation teens train executives in using their high end smartphones. They in turn sometimes offer insight in business processes.\n\nThe concept of mentoring has entered the business domain as well. This is different from being an apprentice; a business mentor provides guidance to a business owner or an entrepreneur on the entrepreneur's business. An apprentice learns a trade by working on the job with the \"employer\".\n\nA 2012 literature review by EPS-PEAKS investigated the practice of business mentoring, with a focus on the Middle-East and North Africa region. The review found strong evidence to suggest that business mentoring can have real benefits for entrepreneurs, but highlights some key factors that need to be taken into account when designing mentoring programmes for this to be the case, such as the need to balance a formal and informal approach and to appropriately match mentors and mentees.\n\n\n"}

Thus it differs from a serial publication such as a magazine, journal, or newspaper. In this context only, books such as novels are monographs.\n\nThe term \"monographia\" is derived from the Greek \"mono\" (single) and \"grapho\" (to write), meaning \"writing on a single subject\". Unlike a textbook, which surveys the state of knowledge in a field, the main purpose of a monograph is to present primary research and original scholarship ascertaining reliable credibility to the required recipient. This research is presented at length, distinguishing a monograph from an article. For these reasons, publication of a monograph is commonly regarded as vital for career progression in many academic disciplines. Intended for other researchers and bought primarily by libraries, monographs are generally published as individual volumes in a short print run.\n\nIn Britain and the U.S., what differentiates a scholarly monograph from an academic trade title varies by publisher, though generally it is the assumption that the readership has not only specialized or sophisticated knowledge but also professional interest in the subject of the work.\n\nBook publishers use the term \"artist monograph\" to indicate books dealing with a single artist, as opposed to broader surveys of art subjects.\n\nIn biological taxonomy a monograph is a comprehensive treatment of a taxon. Monographs typically review all known species within a group, add any newly discovered species, and collect and synthesize available information on the ecological associations, geographic distributions, and morphological variations within the group. See this reference as an example.\n\nThe first-ever monograph of a plant taxon was Robert Morison's 1672 \"Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova\", a treatment of the Apiaceae.\n\nIn the context of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation, monographs represent published standards by which the use of one or more substances is automatically authorized. For example, the following is an excerpt from the \"Federal Register\": \"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule in the form of a final monograph establishing conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded as part of FDA's ongoing review of OTC drug products.\" Such usage has given rise to the use of the word monograph as a verb, as in \"this substance has been monographed by the FDA\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2084005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084005", "title": "National Library of Peru", "text": "National Library of Peru\n\nThe National Library of Peru () is the national library of Peru, located in Lima. It is the country's oldest and most important library. Like the majority of Peruvian libraries, it is a non-circulating library. It has two branches. The old building is on Abancay Avenue (Lima District) and the modern building is on Javier Prado Avenue (San Borja District). Both are open to the public.\n\nThe library was founded by José de San Martín in 1821, after he donated his collection of books and praised the new library as: \"... one of the most efficient mediums to place into circulation our intellectual values.\" The library has various duties, among which it must formulate, conduct, supervise, and evaluate the fulfillment of policies and plans of development of library service within a national and international sphere for educational purposes. These and other administrative decisions concerning the library also depend on the ministry of education of the country.\n\nHistorically, the library has passed through various phases of restructuring since its foundation. During the War of the Pacific, the Chilean army, after taking Lima, ransacked various items along with much capital stock from the library. Peruvian author and scholar Ricardo Palma, who was director of the library in 1884, noted in one of his recounts that of the 56,000 works the library possessed before the war, only 378 were left at the end of the occupation. In 2007, 3,778 books were returned to Peru from Chile. There are current talks between the director of the library and Chilean authorities on identifying works which might belong to Peru that would be eventually returnable. Another significant event the library has gone through was a fire which almost completely destroyed the grounds of the library on May 10, 1943, in which various highly valued historical works were lost. A new building was erected on the same grounds of the old library along with a training center for future librarian administrators.\n\nThe National Library of Peru is currently undergoing a modernization program which aspires to turn the library into one of Latin America's most modern libraries. It is located in Lima's San Borja district. After years of financial planning for the new building, the government of Peru financially collaborated to finish the building, along with a loan of up to seven million dollars from Spain to equip the new library with modern equipment. According to official sources from the library, it is said to have a bibliographic patrimony valued at around 400 million dollars. Among historical works the library has is the first book printed in Lima in 1584 along with other historical books dating back to colonial times. The new library will also attempt to connect to other Peruvian libraries in an effort to create an online national catalog of books and other materials for better research.\n\nThe new library was officially inaugurated on March 27, 2006. To mark the occasion, the then Minister of Education, Javier Sota Nadal, commissioned a symphonic poem from Peruvian composer Jimmy Lopez. The work titled, \"America Salvaje\", is inspired by the poem \"Blasón\" by José Santos Chocano. President Alejandro Toledo and National Library director Sinesio López were present at the inauguration. \n\nThe National Library (Biblioteca Nacional) is the head of the Sistema Nacional de Bibliotecas (SNB) del Perú.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15569416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15569416", "title": "Nicolás Ruiz Espadero", "text": "Nicolás Ruiz Espadero\n\nNicolás Ruiz Espadero (February 15, 1832 – August 30, 1890) was a Cuban pianist, composer, piano teacher and editor of the posthumous works of American composer-pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk.\n\nEspadero was born and died in Havana. In his time, he was the most famous Cuban composer, the only one published abroad, the only one who, at least in the eyes of his Cuban contemporaries, could compete with composers from Europe.\n\nYet of all the Cuban composers of the 19th and early 20th century he was the most parochial and idiosyncratic one. Without schooling and formal musical training, he grew into a chronically shy person, emotionally dependent on his mother. He composed and continually practised, but gave few concerts and had little contact with other people. Espadero never left Cuba, indeed he seldom ever left Havana or his own house, where he lived with seventeen cats, surrounded by stacks of European music scores. Universally described as a recluse, he died from accidental burns after his usual bath in alcohol - one of several musicians to die of rather unnatural causes (Jean-Baptiste Lully and Charles-Valentin Alkan would be among some of the other ones).\n\nAlthough brought up in a cosmopolitan atmosphere and surrounded by black Cuban music, he was the one Cuban composer who adopted but little of the local music tradition that inspired Manuel Saumell before and Ignacio Cervantes after him. He had numerous pupils, and some of them became prominent musicians themselves. Nothing of Espadero’s music has remained in the repertoire, yet his later pieces – allegedly his best output, albeit never printed - remain to be investigated. A CD with a selection of his piano music came out in 2006.\n\nEspadero was born in Havana, Cuba. Cuba was then still a Spanish colony and in all matters of administration, economy and interior and exterior policy dependent on Madrid. The island was a colonial backwater, infested by malaria and yellow fever. Cuba's society was sharply divided into a privileged class of landowners and Spanish colonial administrators – and black and mulatto slaves. Virtually no middle class existed. Of more than two millions blacks, less than 35,000 were free.\n\nEspadero was born in Havana, Cuba. His mother was a pianist from Cadiz who distinguished herself in the Havana salons around 1810 performing Haydn and Mozart. His father, Don Nicolás Ruiz, was a civil servant in the colonial administration. As is often the case in well-to-do families, the father wanted his only son to become a lawyer, an officer or an administrator – but not a musician. Although proud of his wife's musical talents and flattered by his son's nascent artistic abilities, Espadero's father would only permit half an hour's piano lesson every day. But young Espadero's talent proved too strong. From an early age on he showed exceptional ability at the piano. With his mother's complicity young Espadero would play the piano several hours every day.\n\nEspadero never went to school and thus never enjoyed a structured formal education. What education he had received came from pieces and fragments from European, especially Spanish, culture, from selected and very mixed readings and from the surroundings of Cuban upper-class society. Havana had an opera house, the Teatro Colón, but the only operas, sung and acted by imported itinerant opera troupes, were mostly by Bellini, Donizetti and later Verdi.\n\nOn July 8, 1844, Polish pianist and composer Julian Fontana, a close friend of Frédéris Chopin, gave a series of concerts and recitals in Havana playing works by Liszt, Chopin, Thalberg and himself. This was the first time that music by Chopin was played in Cuba. Fontana stayed a year and a half (until November 1845) in Havana giving concerts, composing and teaching. Espadero was among Fontana’s piano students.\n\nBy the time he was twenty, he had already traces of the withdrawn and unsociable character that would grow into in middle and later life. Carpentier characterizes him thus:\n\nCarpentier postulates that Espadero came to believe that in his youth he had been overly influenced by bravura piano music by composers such as Sigismond Thalberg, Émile Prudent, and Joseph Ascher, among others. He then turned to composing according to classical European musical forms. He wrote a piano trio, a scherzo, a sonata, and various longer études. None of it he saw in print. As soon as Espadero started to eschew the bravura pieces of the day, publishers were no longer interested in his music.\n\nThis rejection of his more serious efforts may have contributed his state of mind. The death of his mother in 1885 came as an almost devastating blow to him. Although he was now free to travel and leave Cuba, he did exactly the opposite – he became a total recluse. During his last years Espadero isolated himself almost totally from society, living only for his cats and his piano. Carpentier writes: \"He distanced himself from his colleagues, gruffly reproaching them for not having created a serious institution for the teaching of music.\" This anti-social behaviour may have been aggravated by obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most recent of Espadero’s biographers writes that Espadero could not enter a house without having to rearrange the furniture to suit his orderliness.\n\nEven his sudden and tragic death had its cause in Espadero's neurotic behaviour. For a long time he had had the habit of taking baths in alcohol. On August 22, 1890, he again took an alcohol bath. After the bath, however, he did not rub himself completely dry. When he tried to extinguish a gas light, he was suddenly engulfed by flames and suffered horrifying burns. He died eight days later. Considering the mental state of Espadero prior to his death and his long years of neurotic and increasingly bizarre behaviour, some of his biographers speculated that his death was actually a suicide.\n\nSince Espadero died childless, his estate was scattered. Much of it, among them many unprinted manuscripts, must be considered lost.\n\nNotable students include Carlos Alfredo Peyrellade, Haitian pianist and founder of the Carlos Alfredo Peyrellade Conservatories in Cuba.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "235958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235958", "title": "Numerical sight-singing", "text": "Numerical sight-singing\n\nNumerical sight-singing, an alternative to the solfege system of sight-singing, is a musical notation system that numbers the diatonic scale with the numbers one through eight (or, alternately, one to seven, with the octave again being one).\n\nIn this system, 1 is always the root or origin, but the scale being represented may be major, minor, or any of the diatonic mode. Accidentals (sharps and flats outside the key signature) are noted with a + or - when the numbers are written, but are often skipped when they are spoken or sung.\n\nIn some pedagogies involving numerical sight-singing notation students are not taught to modify vowels to represent sharp or flat notes. In these cases the students usually name the note and whether it is flat or sharp. For example, an augmented unison (\"ouey\") might be called \"one sharp,\" and in some other pedagogies this same pitch may also simply be called \"one.\" \n\nThere is a continual debate about the merits of this system as compared to solfege: it holds the advantage that when dealing with abstract concepts such as interval distance a student may easily recognize that the distance between 1 and 5 is larger than the distance between 1 and 4 because of the numerical values assigned (as compared to Solfege, where comparing Do to Sol and Do to Fa remain completely abstract until sung or played). A drawback often pointed out is that numerical numbers are not always \"singable,\" for example, scale degree 7 (ti, in solfege) contains vowels that are hard to tune.\n\nNumerical sight singing is not the same as integer notation derived from musical set theory and used primarily for sight singing atonal music. Nor is it the same as \"count singing\", a technique popularized by Robert Shaw in which the numbers sung represent the rhythms of a piece in accordance with the beat of a measure.\n"}

{"id": "618870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=618870", "title": "Paulo Freire", "text": "Paulo Freire\n\nPaulo Reglus Neves Freire (; ; September 19, 1921 – May 2, 1997) was a Brazilian educator and philosopher who was a leading advocate of critical pedagogy. He is best known for his influential work, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", generally considered one of the foundational texts of the critical pedagogy movement.\n\nFreire was born on September 19, 1921 to a middle-class family in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. He became familiar with poverty and hunger from an early age, during the Great Depression. In 1931, his family moved to the less expensive city of Jaboatão dos Guararapes. On October 31, 1934, his father died. \n\nDuring his childhood and adolescence at school, Freire ended up four grades behind, and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children, from whom he states to have learned a great deal. These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire stated that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: \"I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge\". Eventually, his family's misfortunes turned around and their prospects improved.\n\nFreire enrolled in law school at the University of Recife in 1943. He also studied philosophy, more specifically phenomenology, and the psychology of language. Although admitted to the legal bar, he never practiced law and instead worked as a secondary school Portuguese teacher. In 1944, he married Elza Maia Costa de Oliveira, a fellow teacher. The two worked together and had five children.\n\nIn 1946, Freire was appointed director of the Pernambuco Department of Education and Culture. Working primarily among the illiterate poor, Freire began to develop an educational praxis that would have an influence on the liberation theology movement of the 1970s. In 1940s Brazil, literacy was a requirement for voting in presidential elections.\n\nIn 1961, he was appointed director of the Department of Cultural Extension at the University of Recife. In 1962, he had the first opportunity for large-scale application of his theories, when, in an experiment, 300 sugarcane harvesters were taught to read and write in just 45 days. In response to this experiment, the Brazilian government approved the creation of thousands of cultural circles across the country.\n\nThe 1964 Brazilian coup d'état put an end to Freire's literacy effort, as the ruling military junta did not endorse it. Freire was subsequently imprisoned as a traitor for 70 days. After a brief exile in Bolivia, Freire worked in Chile for five years for the Christian Democratic Agrarian Reform Movement and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In 1967, Freire published his first book, \"Education as the Practice of Freedom\". He followed it with his most famous work, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", first published in 1968.\n\nAfter a positive international reception of his work, Freire was offered a visiting professorship at Harvard University in 1969. The next year, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" was published in Spanish and English, vastly expanding its reach. Because of political feuds between Freire, a Christian socialist, and Brazil's successive right-wing authoritarian military governments, the book went unpublished in Brazil until 1974, when, starting with the presidency of Ernesto Geisel, the military junta started a process of slow and controlled political liberalisation.\n\nFollowing a year in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Freire moved to Geneva to work as a special education advisor to the World Council of Churches. During this time Freire acted as an advisor on education reform in several former Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique.\n\nIn 1979, he first visited Brazil after more than a decade of exile, eventually moving back in 1980. Freire joined the Workers' Party (PT) in São Paulo and acted as a supervisor for its adult literacy project from 1980 to 1986. When the Workers' Party won the 1988 São Paulo mayoral elections in 1988, Freire was appointed municipal Secretary of Education.\n\nFreire died of heart failure on May 2, 1997 in São Paulo.\n\nPaulo Freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended classical approaches stemming from Platoand modern Marxist, post-Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. His \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" (1968) can be read as an extension of, or reply to, Frantz Fanon's \"The Wretched of the Earth\" (1961), which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern, rather than traditional, and anti-colonial — not simply an extension of the colonizing culture.\n\nIn \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", Freire, reprising the oppressors–oppressed distinction, applies the distinction to education, championing that education should allow the oppressed to regain their sense of humanity, in turn overcoming their condition. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that for this to occur, the oppressed individual must play a role in their liberation. \nNo pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption.\nLikewise, oppressors must be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in oppression if true liberation is to occur: \"those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly\".\n\nFreire believed education could not be divorced from politics; the act of teaching and learning are considered political acts in and of themselves. Freire defined this connection as a main tenet of critical pedagogy. Teachers and students must be made aware of the politics that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom.\n\nIn terms of pedagogy, Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the \"banking\" concept of education, in which students are viewed as empty accounts to be filled by teachers. He notes that \"it transforms students into receiving objects [and] attempts to control thinking and action, lead[ing] men and women to adjust to the world, inhibit[ing] their creative power.\" The basic critique was not entirely novel, and paralleled Rousseau's conception of children as active learners, as opposed to a tabula rasa view, more akin to the banking model. John Dewey was also strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change, stating that \"education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction\". Freire's work revived this view and placed it in context with contemporary theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what would later be termed critical pedagogy.\n\nAccording to Freire, inequal social relations create a 'culture of silence' that instill a negative, passive and suppressed self-image onto the oppressed, and learners must, then, develop a critical consciousness in order to recognize that this culture of silence is created to oppress. A culture of silence can also cause the \"dominated individuals [to] lose the means by which to critically respond to the culture that is forced on them by a dominant culture.\"\n\nHe considers social, race and class dynamics to be interlaced into the conventional education system, through which this culture of silence eliminates the \"paths of thought that lead to a \"language of critique\".\"\n\nSince the publication of the English edition in 1970, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" has had a large impact in education and pedagogy worldwide, especially as a defining work of critical pedagogy. According to Israeli writer and education reform theorist Sol Stern, it has \"achieved near-iconic status in America's teacher-training programs\". Connections have also been made between Freire's non-dualism theory in pedagogy and Eastern philosophical traditions such as the Advaita Vedanta.\n\nFreire's major exponents in North America are Henry Giroux, Peter McLaren, Donaldo Macedo, Antonia Darder, Joe L. Kincheloe, Carlos Alberto Torres, Ira Shor, and Shirley R. Steinberg. One of McLaren's edited texts, \"Paulo Freire: A Critical Encounter\", expounds upon Freire's impact in the field of critical pedagogy. McLaren has also provided a comparative study concerning Paulo Freire and Argentinian revolutionary icon Che Guevara. Freire's work influenced the radical math movement in the United States, which emphasizes social justice issues and critical pedagogy as components of mathematical curricula.\n\nIn South Africa, Freire's ideas and methods were central to the 1970s Black Consciousness Movement, often associated with Steve Biko, as well as the trade union movement in the 1970s and 1980s, and the United Democratic Front in the 1980s. There is a Paulo Freire Project at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Pietermaritzburg.\n\nIn 1991, the Paulo Freire Institute was established in São Paulo to extend and elaborate upon his theories of popular education. The institute has started projects in many countries and is headquartered at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, where it actively maintains the Freire archives. Its director is UCLA professor Carlos Torres, the author of several Freirean work, including the 1978 \"A praxis educativa de Paulo Freire\".\n\nIn 1999 PAULO, a national training organisation named in honour of Freire, was established in the United Kingdom. This agency was approved by the New Labour Government to represent some 300,000 community-based education practitioners working across the UK. PAULO was given formal responsibility for setting the occupational training standards for people working in this field.\n\nThe Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy was founded at McGill University. Here Joe L. Kincheloe and Shirley R. Steinberg worked to create a dialogical forum for critical scholars around the world to promote research and re-create a Freirean pedagogy in a multinational domain. After the death of Kincheloe the project was transformed into a virtual global resource.\n\nIn 2012, a group of educators in Western Massachusetts, United States received permission to name a public school after Freire. The Holyoke, Massachusetts Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School opened in September 2013.\n\nShortly before his death, Freire was working on a book of ecopedagogy, a platform of work carried on by many of the Freire Institutes and Freirean Associations around the world today. It has been influential in helping to develop planetary education projects such as the Earth Charter as well as countless international grassroots campaigns in the spirit of Freirean popular education generally.\n\nFreirean literacy methods have been adopted throughout the developing world. In the Philippines, Catholic \"basal Christian communities\" adopted Freire's methods in community education. Papua New Guinea, Freirean literacy methods were used as part of the World Bank funded Southern Highlands Rural Development Program's Literacy Campaign. Freirean approaches also lie at the heart of the \"Dragon Dreaming\" approach to community programs that have spread to 20 countries by 2014.\n\n\nFreire wrote and co-wrote over 20 books on education, pedagogy and related themes.\n\nSome of his works include:\n\n\n\n"}

Its primary method is to create intensive collaborative relationships between students and working field researchers through structured programs involving the University of Chicago and other institutions. In January 2010, it received a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. The organization, founded in 1999, is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA.\n\nProject Exploration currently serves nearly 1,000 students. It began as an after-school and summer program when Gabrielle Lyon, a teacher at Fiske Elementary School on the South Side of Chicago, decided that students underrepresented in the sciences, primarily girls and minorities, should be given opportunities to collaborate with actual scientists and participate in real-life scientific research. Students design research projects and test them in the field, or work summers at museums demonstrating science to young children.\n\nSisters4Science is a year-round after-school and field program that combines science exploration with leadership development for approximately 100 minority middle school girls. Girls participate in hands-on science activities led by women scientists as well as participate in science-based field trips.\n\nProject Exploration organizes a one-day symposium with workshops on the topics of sexuality and tolerance, healthy relationships, self-worth, the female body, and self-defense for female students across Chicago in grades 7-10.\n\nThe All Girls Expedition is an intensive two-week classroom and field work experience for twenty girls . It includes intensive classroom instruction in geology, biology, evaluation, and field skills followed by one week working in the field alongside scientists. A recent expedition was to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, to conduct fieldwork on the water chemistry of geysers, track coyotes and explore a cave with Project Exploration and Yellowstone researchers.\n\nThe Science Teacher Field Institute is an annual three-week professional development program for Chicago Public School teachers which includes both classroom and field experience with scientists in the disciplines of geology, paleontology, and astronomy. All costs are covered by private donations. This program includes field work at eastern Montana's Lost-in-Time Ranch under supervision of professional paleontologists from the University of Chicago and Project co-founder Gabrielle Lyon.\n\nThe Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, awarded each year to individuals or organizations, recognizes the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science or engineering and who belong to minorities that are underrepresented in those fields. By offering their time, encouragement and expertise to these students, mentors help ensure that the next generation of scientists and engineers will better reflect the diversity of the United States.\nCandidates for the Presidential Mentoring Award are nominated by colleagues, administrators, and students from their home institutions. The mentoring can involve students at any grade level from elementary through graduate school. In addition to being honored at the White House, recipients receive awards of $10,000 to advance their mentoring efforts. \"There is no higher calling than furthering the educational advancement of our nation’s young people and encouraging and inspiring our next generation of leaders,\" President Obama said. \"These awards represent a heartfelt salute of appreciation to a remarkable group of individuals who have devoted their lives and careers to helping others and in doing so have helped us all.\"\n\nThe award to Project Exploration was announced in July 2009. The award ceremony took place in January 2010 at the White House.\n"}
{"id": "227590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227590", "title": "Radical transparency", "text": "Radical transparency\n\nRadical transparency is a phrase used across fields of governance, politics, software design and business to describe actions and approaches that radically increase the openness of organizational process and data. Its usage was originally understood as an approach or act that uses abundant networked information to access previously confidential organizational process or outcome data.\n\nModern usage of the term radical transparency coincided with increased public use of Information communications technologies including the Internet. Kevin Kelly argued in 1994 that, “in the network era, openness wins, central control is lost.” David Brin's writing on \"The Transparent Society\" re-imagined the societal consequences of radical transparency remixing Orwell's \"1984\". However, the explicit political argument for “radical transparency” was first made in a 2001 Foreign Affairs article on information and communication technology driving economic growth in developing regions. In 2006 Wired’s Chris Anderson blogged on the shift from secrecy to transparency blogging culture had made on corporate communications, and highlighted the next step as a shift to ‘radical transparency’ where the “whole product development process [is] laid bare, and opened to customer input.” By 2008 the term was being used to describe the WikiLeaks platform that radically decentralized the power, voices and visibility of governance knowledge that was previously secret.\n\nRadical corporate transparency, as a philosophical concept, would involve removing all barriers to free and easy public access to corporate, political and personal (treating persons as corporations) information and the development of laws, rules, social connivance and processes that facilitate and protect such an outcome.\n\nUsing these methods to 'hold corporations accountable for the benefit of everyone' was emphasised in Tapscott and Ticoll's book \"The Naked Corporation\" in 2003. Radical transparency has also been explained by Dan Goleman as a management approach where (ideally,) all decision making is carried out publicly. Specific to this approach is the potential for new technologies to reveal the eco-impact of products bought to steer consumers to make informed decisions and companies to reform their business practices.\n\nIn traditional public relations management, damage control involved the suppression of public information. But, as observed by Clive Thompson in \"Wired\", the Internet has created a force towards transparency:\n\"[H]ere's the interesting paradox: The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation. Putting out more evasion or PR puffery won't work, because people will either ignore it and not link to it – or worse, pick the spin apart and enshrine \"those\" criticisms high on your Google list of life.\" Mark Zuckerberg has opined that \"more transparency should make for a more tolerant society in which people eventually accept that everybody sometimes does bad or embarrassing things.\"\n\nA partial form of radical transparency was instituted into parliaments of the Westminster system, through full records of discussions in parliament, recorded and published in what is referred to as \"Hansard\", while the texts of proposed laws and final laws are all, in principle, public documents.\n\nSince the late 1990s, many national parliaments decided to publish all parliamentary debates and laws on the Internet. However, the initial texts of proposed laws and the discussions and negotiations regarding them generally occur in parliamentary commissions, which are rarely transparent, and among political parties, which are very rarely transparent. Moreover, given the logical and linguistic complexity of typical national laws, public participation is difficult despite the radical transparency at the formal parliamentary level.\n\nRadical transparency has also been suggested in the context of government finance and public economics.\n\nA radically transparent approach is also emerging within education. Open Educational Resources (OER) are freely accessible, usually openly licensed documents and media that are useful for teaching, learning, educational, assessment and research purposes. Although some people consider the use of an open format to be an essential characteristic of OER, this is not a universally acknowledged requirement. In addition online courses activities are also becoming increasingly more accessible for others. One example are the new and popular massive open online courses (MOOC).\n\n\n"}

Hogg\n\nRobert Vincent (\"Bob\") Hogg (8 November 1924 – 23 December 2014) was an American statistician and professor of statistics of the University of Iowa. Hogg is known for his widely used textbooks on statistics (with his 1963 Ph.D. student Elliot Alan Tanis) and on mathematical statistics (with his 1950 Ph.D. advisor Allen Thornton Craig). Hogg has received recognition for his research on\nrobust and adaptive nonparametric statistics and for his scholarship on total quality management and statistics education.\n\nBorn on 8 November 1924 in Hannibal, Missouri, Hogg served three years in the US Navy from 1943 through 1946. In 1947, he graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. With the goal of becoming an actuary, Hogg matriculated at the mathematics department of the University of Iowa (then the \"State University of Iowa\"). However, Hogg studied statistics under Allen Craig, who became his mentor and helped him obtain a job teaching statistics at the Mathematics Department. Hogg earned his Ph.D. 1950 under Allen Craig. After graduating, Hogg remained at the Mathematics Department, where he remained to become a long-serving professor.\n\nHogg independently discovered a special case of \"Basu's theorem\", a few years before the publication by Deb Basu. Hogg's second paper on the topic of Basu's theorem was never published, because of a negative report by an anonymous referee in 1953. Later, Basu refers \"to Hogg and Craig (1956) for several interesting uses [of Basu's theorem] in proving results in distribution theory\".\n\nThe textbook \"Hogg and Craig\" was innovative, particularly in emphasizing sufficient statistics: Sufficient statistics were treated not only for parametric families but also for nonparametric probability distributions: In particular, the sufficiency and completeness of the order statistics from a continuous distribution were treated. Another innovation was the systematic derivation of the distributions of functions of several random variables by using the change-of-variable method.\n\nAs noted before, Craig was Hogg's mentor, helping him to obtain a teaching position while a graduate student and also supervising his thesis. Later, after Hogg had graduated, Craig became a close friend, and served as the best man at Hogg's wedding and later as the \"godparent\" to each of Hogg's four children. Indeed, Hogg's son Allen was named after Craig.\n\nIn 1965 Hogg became the founding chair of the new Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and he remained as the chair for nineteen years. At Iowa, Hogg held other positions, including Chair of the Quality Management and Productivity Program and the Hanson Chair of Manufacturing Productivity. After serving 51 years as an instructor at the University of Iowa, Hogg became Professor Emeritus in 2001.\n\nHogg has been a leader in statistics education in the US.\n\nHogg has received a number of educational awards by state and national organizations: these awards include the Iowa Governor’s Science Medal for Teaching in 1990, the Iowa Board of Regents' Award for Faculty Excellence in 1992, and the Iowa Section of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA)'s Distinguished Teaching Award in 1992 with the national MAA's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1993. At the University of Iowa, Hogg won his first teaching award after a student submitted a nomination with the title \"There is a hog in my statistics book!\".\n\nHogg's 70th birthday was marked by a conference organized by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, whose proceedings were published as a special issue of \"Communications in Statistics — Theory and Methods\" in 1996; in the conference proceedings, a list of Hogg's publications appears on pages 2467–2481.\n\nFor his research in nonparametric statistics, Hogg received the Gottfried Noether Senior Scholar Award in 2001.\n\nHogg has been recognized internationally as a leading researcher in statistics and as an exemplary professor of statistics who has served as a public spokesperson for the profession. Hogg has had a particularly visible role in the United States, where he was elected as President of the American Statistical Association (ASA), serving in 1988. One of the ASA President's tasks is to arrange an annual meeting, and Hogg's diligence was rewarded by the ASA staff, who presented him with the name tag, \"Boss Hogg\" (after the name of a character in the television series \"The Dukes of Hazzard\"). Three years after Hogg had served as President, he was awarded the ASA’s Founder’s Award in 1991. \n\nHogg has also been internationally active on behalf of the statistics profession. Hogg is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, which awarded him its Carver Medal. Hogg is also an Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Vitale\" (1962) and \"Abington School District v. Schempp\" (1963), the United States Supreme Court ruled that government mandated school prayer is unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. However voluntary prayer is not unconstitutional.\n\nThe history of school prayer amendment began in 1962 with the Supreme Court case of Engel v. Vitale. A New York policy required schools to begin each day with a word of prayer. Regarding this case, Justice Hugo Black wrote \"… the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.\"\n\nThe next year, a similar case arose: Abington Township School District v. Schempp. The effect of this incident was the prohibition of school officials from organizing or leading prayers as well as devotional Bible reading in public schools. Abington v. Schempp required that school faculties should neither promote nor degrade religion. The Supreme Court next examined school prayer in 1985 with the case of Wallace v. Jaffree. A change to Alabama's moment-of-silence law included a requirement that the moment of silence must be for \"meditation or voluntary prayer.\" The Court saw the change as government promotion of prayer in the schools, and overturned the change to the law. The justices explained that a moment of silence is appropriate, but not for any religious purpose.\n\nDemocratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia proposed the amendment in 1962, 1973, 1979, 1982, 1993, 1995, and 1997.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in July 1999 that the House of Representatives, at that time occupied by a Republican majority, had long been proposing such an amendment but was preoccupied with a competing, more general amendment allowing for \"religious freedoms\" proposed by Henry Hyde, then-Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Representative Ernest Istook, a Republican from Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, proposed the amendment on May 8, 1997. In March 1998, the Judiciary Committee passed the bill by a 16-11 vote. On June 4, 1998, the full House voted on the amendment, 224-203 in favor. The vote was 61 short of the two-thirds majority required by Article Five of the United States Constitution to propose a constitutional amendment.\n\nIstook reintroduced the amendment to Congress twice: first in 1999 as the House Joint Resolution 66 and in 2001 as the \"Religious Speech Amendment\". Byrd proposed the amendment again on April 29, 2006.\n\nThough the proposed amendment failed to be adopted, it led to the passing of the Equal Access Act.\n\nRick Perry, governor of Texas and Republican a former candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" on December 11, 2011: \"I would support a constitutional amendment that allows our children to pray in school anytime they would like.\"\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, American Civil Liberties Union, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State have all expressed opposition to this amendment. The Family Research Council has supported it.\n"}
{"id": "2218485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218485", "title": "Tawse", "text": "Tawse\n\nThe tawse, sometimes formerly spelled taws (the plural of Scots taw, a thong of a whip) is an implement used for corporal punishment. It was used for educational discipline, primarily in Scotland, but also in schools in the English cities of Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, Manchester and Walsall.\n\nA tawse consists of a strip of leather, with one end split into a number of tails. The thickness of the leather and the number of tails is variable. Many Scottish saddlers made tawses for local schoolmasters. The official name \"tawse\" was hardly ever used in conversation by either teachers or pupils, who instead referred to it as either the school strap or the belt, the normal term for an unforked implement, as worn in trousers (see belt).\n\nScottish public (state) schools used the tawse to punish pupils of either sex on the palm of the outstretched hand. Pupils were usually instructed to hold out one hand, palm uppermost, supported by the other hand below, which made it difficult to move the hand away during the infliction of the strokes. It also ensured that the full force of each stroke was taken by the hand being strapped. The punishment was usually inflicted by the class teacher in front of the entire class, to act as a deterrent to others; sometimes by a designated teacher, such as the Deputy Headmaster, to whom the pupil was sent.\n\nIn Walsall and Gateshead, and in some schools in Manchester and Nottingham, male students were tawsed on the seat of the trousers.\n\nSome Scottish private (independent) schools also used the tawse, such as Keil School, but others such as Fettes College used the cane instead, as did most schools in England outside the north-east.\n\nIn 1982 two Scottish mothers went to the European Court of Human Rights, who passed a judgment that parents had the right to refuse corporal punishment of a child. This judgement led indirectly to the use of the tawse (and all other forms of corporal punishment) being banned by law in UK state schools. The legislation came into force in 1987, but most Scottish local education authorities had already abolished it by the early 1980s.\n\nJohn J. Dick Leather Goods was a manufacturer in Lochgelly estimated to have made around 70% of tawses when they were used in schools. Original tawses sold for around £6 in 1982 but twenty years later some collectors were paying hundred of pounds each for rare items.\n\nThe tawse was also used for judicial corporal punishment in Scotland as an alternative to the more usual birch. Courts could sentence boys of over 14 but under 16 to up to 36 strokes with an extra-heavy tawse for any offence. This was administered to the offender's bare buttocks. Judicial corporal punishment was abolished in 1948.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2425212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2425212", "title": "University of West Alabama", "text": "University of West Alabama\n\nThe University of West Alabama (abbreviated as UWA) is a public university located in Livingston, Alabama, United States.\n\nFounded in 1835, the school began as a church-supported school for young women called Livingston Female Academy. The original Board of Trustees of Livingston Female Academy was selected in 1836, and four of the seven board members were Presbyterians.\n\nThe university serves students in several academic colleges and divisions on a campus in west-central Alabama. UWA offers a wide arrangement of degree programs including associate, bachelor's, master's,educational specialist, and educational doctorate degrees. The university hosts concerts, lectures, fall and spring theatrical productions, fall and spring commencement exercises, and intercollegiate athletic events.\n\nIts athletics teams, known as the West Alabama Tigers, are members of the Gulf South Conference and compete in the NCAA's Division II in all sports except two. The men's and women's rodeo teams compete in the Ozark Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association.\n\nThe University of West Alabama began as Livingston Female Academy in 1835. As a church-related female academy, it admitted its first students in 1839. The school was established by ethnic Scots-Irish Presbyterians, who controlled the majority of seats on the first board of trustees selected in 1836. The purpose of the school was to educate future teachers, while also offering course work in art, music, languages, and home economics. Tuition at this time was $20 annually with an additional $25 charged for piano lessons and $10 for French language and embroidery. Jones Hall was the first building constructed on the campus in 1837, and was located near what is now Brock Hall. (The building was lost to fire in the 1890s). On January 15, 1840, state lawmakers incorporated Livingston Female Academy, granted it tax-exempt status, and gave the board the authority to establish rules and regulations.\nLivingston Female Academy awarded its first diploma in 1843 to Elizabeth Houston, the daughter of M. L. Houston, a prominent local businessman and a school trustee. The first principal of the school was A. A. Kimbrell, followed by Margaret McShan. In 1853, Dr. Robert Dickens Webb arrived in Sumter County and served as a trustee for more than 40 years. He led the school during the American Civil War and Reconstruction through the 1870s, helping to keep the institution open. The main administration building that sits in the middle of campus today is named in his honor. In 1878, the institution changed its name to Livingston Normal College.\n\nEducation reformer Julia Strudwick Tutwiler joined the faculty in 1881 as co-principal with her uncle, Carlos Green Smith, former president of the University of Alabama. In 1882–1883, state lawmakers provided $2,500 for tuition and supplies; Alabama was the first southern state to fund the education of women. Tutwiler and state legislator Addison Gillespie Smith helped secure this appropriation. In 1883, the school was renamed the Alabama Normal College for Girls and Livingston Female Academy, to better reflect the new mission of the institution, providing students with choices of either two- or four-year programs. \"Normal training\" was the term used at that time to describe teacher education that represented high school plus two years of college education. The Normal College presented its first diplomas at the 1886 commencement exercises.\n\nIn 1890, Tutwiler was named president of the college. She is the only woman to have been president. During her tenure, Tutwiler aided in establishing the Alabama Girls' Industrial Institute (now the University of Montevallo) and in having the first women admitted to the University of Alabama in 1893.\n\nIn the early 20th century new leadership brought a new name to the college as well. George William Brock was hired by the trustees in 1907 to oversee the institution's financial affairs. Following Tutwiler's retirement in 1910, Brock assumed the presidency. Alumni began meeting in honor of Tutwiler in 1910 and formed the first alumni association. Men were admitted to the institution as regular students in 1915. Foust Hall was built in 1922 as a lab school where college professors taught, and students observed and participated in classroom instruction. The building's open-air plan with a central courtyard became a building design familiar to many Alabamians. In 1928, both Bibb Graves Hall and Brock Hall were added to the physical plant under this plan.\n\nIn 1929, the Alabama State Board of Education took over supervision and renamed the facility the Livingston State Teachers College. Under George William Brock, in 1929 the school founded a student newspaper called \"Campus Lights\" (now called \"The Muse\").\n\nA football team was added in 1931. With striped uniforms, the college took the tiger as its mascot, and the sports teams continue to be known as the UWA Tigers; red and white are the school colors. After president Brock retired in 1936, Noble Franklin Greenhill took over and served until 1944. Under Greenhill, campus life flourished as social sororities and intercollegiate sports in baseball, basketball, and football were added. The first homecoming celebration was held in 1939.\n\nWorld War II brought such a decline in enrollment that the college nearly closed. When William Wilson Hill assumed the presidency in 1944 after Greenhill left, he commissioned studies to determine if the institution should continue as a four-year college. Hill began with only 92 students, so he set out to recruit veterans. With more men on campus, the interest in sports was revived, and servicemen were aided financially in going to college by the GI Bill, which increased the educational level of a generation of men. Tiger Stadium was built in 1952. The first campus fraternities were established during Wilson's presidency.\n\nThe college gained a reputation for teacher education in the region and state through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The mission of the institution was broadened in 1957 when, under the leadership of Delos Culp (1954–1963), the school's name was changed to Livingston State College. Graduate-level classes were added, and the state board of education began awarding master's degrees in professional education under a new graduate division. Kelly Hester Land was awarded the first master's degree, and a writing scholarship competition and building are named for her.\n\nUnder John E. Deloney (1963–1973), the college had substantial growth, so it expanded its campus, to more than with a lake surrounded by nature trails, open to the community as well as college population. In 1967, the U.S. Office of Education approved a grant for the institution to receive campus renovations and updates. During the same year, an act of the Legislature created Livingston University with its own Board of Trustees. In 1969, a longtime historic landmark in Sumter County, the Alamuchee-Bellamy Covered Bridge (built 1861), was restored and moved on campus by the Sumter County Historical Society. It spans the northeast corner of Duck Pond behind Reed Hall. The number of faculty was increased during Deloney's presidency as well, and the school's colleges and divisions started taking shape.\n\nIn 1973, Asa N. Green (1973–1994) became president; he oversaw the establishment of the Ira D. Pruitt School of Nursing and dual-degree programs with Auburn University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He worked to establish a consortium of 13 schools to create a marine biology program and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. More buildings were added and renovated across campus. During the late 1970s, an area was reserved on campus for the construction of Lake LU.\n\nPre-professional programs were established, and the first Ira D. Pruitt Division of Nursing class earned associate degrees in 1976. Overall, 153 degrees were awarded during commencement exercises in May that same year. In 1977, Dr. Ralph M. Lyon, University educator and administrator, retired from his position, and was honored for his tenure. His wife presented the University with a handcrafted ceremonial mace in his dedication. The mace is used at yearly commencement exercises. Not long after the 1977 commencement, history professor William E. Gilbert was found dead off campus.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a new computer system was installed on campus to support the University's computer information processing systems major. During the 1985–1986 academic year, the University observed its 150th anniversary. After Green resigned, Don C. Hines (1994–1998) assumed the post of president and brought additional change. Today, the rodeo complex on campus is named in his honor. Among students, Hines is most remembered for bringing collegiate rodeo to campus. UWA competes in the Ozark Region and has won regional championships in both the men and women's divisions. In addition, individual competitors have placed nationally in bull-riding and barrel racing.\n\nHines brought more computers to campus and established new programs in psychology and forestry. In 1995, despite a lack of support for a name change, the institution, considering that its regional educational mission was not reflected in its name (some thought that it sounded like a private school), adopted the name The University of West Alabama. Ed Roach (1998–2002) assumed the presidency in 1998 and set about integrating technology into every aspect of UWA life. He established the Technology 2000 campaign and helped establish UWA as one of the first wireless institutions in the region. Women's sports received a boost under his leadership. During this period, the UWA Softball Complex was completed. In February 2002, he stepped down from his position as president. The Board of Trustees met to choose a replacement on an interim basis from University employees David Taylor, Richard Holland, Roy Underwood, and Clemit Spruiell.\n\nRichard Holland, an alumnus of the institution and former dean of the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, was selected by trustees to take over the position. Six months later, he was named the next University president by a unanimous vote. Holland is the first UWA graduate to serve as president. However, UWA's board of trustees placed him on paid leave and voted to not renew his contract in March 2014 after he challenged the board's review of his performance.\n\nEnrollment continues to grow each year. After hovering around the 2,000 mark for a few years, that number was exceeded in the fall of 2002. In 2005, enrollment reached the 3,000 mark for the first time with a combined 3,090 students on campus and online. That number continued to rise the following year to 3,633 and topped 4,000 in 2007 when 4,186 students were enrolled. When the fall semester rolled around, the University was just shy of the 5,000 mark at 4,888. In 2009, a higher education center was added in neighboring Demopolis. Dr. Don C. Hines died on August 26 from cancer.\n\nUWA was temporarily on probation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation body in 2011. It was removed from probation on December 5, 2011.\n\nThe mission of the University of West Alabama is \"to provide opportunities for students to pursue a quality education and assist in developing the important qualities of independent thinking, respect for the ideas of others, personal integrity and character in order to realize their quests for a philosophy of life and self-fulfillment.\"\n\nUWA offers more than 60 undergraduate programs and 10 graduate programs through its academic colleges and divisions at the bachelor's, master's, educational specialist, and educational doctorate levels. They are as follows:\n\nDegrees in each academic college and division are awarded at the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Master's degree and Educational specialist levels. Students are awarded an Associate's degree from the Ira D. Pruitt School of Nursing. Upon graduation from the University of West Alabama, students may choose to earn a Bachelor's degree in nursing through a partnership with the University of Alabama.\n\nThe University of West Alabama is a single-campus university located in the heart of downtown Livingston on U.S. Highway 11. The campus is on the western border of Alabama. Larger cities close by include Meridian (30 minutes), Tuscaloosa (50 minutes), and Birmingham. The small population in the city of Livingston and Southern hospitality give UWA its small-town atmosphere that many students come to appreciate. The UWA campus includes nature trails, a lake, and sculptures. Recent campus beautification projects have enhanced the natural beauty that can be found on campus.\n\nThe University of West Alabama campus includes many buildings. Some are used for academic purposes, while others serve different needs. These facilities include the following:\n\nOther buildings located on campus are listed below:\n\nThe University of West Alabama has a diverse student population. As of the fall semester of 2008, the University has a total enrollment of 4,888 undergraduate and graduate students. 63% of the total enrollment is female, while males make up the remaining 37%. Most students who attend UWA are from Alabama, while others come from all over the world. 48% are Caucasian, 50% are minorities, and the final 2% are international students. 38% of the students (both campus and online) make up the Julia Tutwiler College of Education. The remaining three colleges are all in close proximity to each other. The Division of Nursing stakes claim to the final 4% of the student population.\n\nIn figures from 2008, the University has a faculty of 97. The numbers are about even, as 48.5% of the total faculty are men; the remaining 51.5% are women. 77% of the faculty possess terminal degrees. Two-thirds hold the rank of associate professor or higher. 37 faculty members were tenured with 40 on tenure track. 16% are members of minority groups. The student-teacher ratio on campus is 18:1.\n\nAlthough the University does not require students to live on campus, UWA strongly encourages students to live in a residence hall their freshman and sophomore years. Research has shown that students who live on campus are much more likely to graduate from college than students who live off-campus. Students who receive a Trustee Scholarship from the University or participate in certain activities such as varsity-level athletics may be required to live on campus. Three buildings make up the traditional residence halls on the University campus. These are Spieth Hall, Selden Hall and Sisk Hall. Most students who attend the University reside in these residence halls. Three buildings make up the residential scholar communities on the University campus. These are Reed Hall, Stickney Hall and Hoover Apartments. First-year freshmen on a Trustee Scholarship are given priority to stay in Reed Hall. Sophomore students and above are given preferences in Stickney Hall, Hoover Apartments, and Patterson Apartments.\n\nThe official student newspaper is \"Muse\". It is published weekly by students and advised by members of the UWA faculty. First published in 1940, the newspaper was called \"Livingston Life\" until 1995 when it changed to \"The Life\". This lasted until 2010, when \"The Life\" was rebranded into \"Muse\". Students also produce the official University of West Alabama yearbook called \"The Paragon\". Much like the campus newspaper, the yearbook is published by a student staff with a faculty advisor. It is unknown when the first yearbook was published. In addition, \"The Sucarnochee Review\" is a creative-writing and art journal published by the University's Department of Languages and Literature. The journal got its start on campus in the 1970s. Students serve as staff members for the journal under a faculty advisor and faculty advisory board. Also on campus, the University's theatre program presents two full-length plays each year. These are performed by members of the student body with an advisor during the fall and spring semesters. Finally, the University of West Alabama provides educational video services to the community through Studio 96. The students produce a weekly local news broadcast named TIGER PAUSE which is broadcast on a YouTube channel named studio96productions.\n\nThe University of West Alabama's Greek system comprises 8 fraternities and 6 sororities. Fraternities and sororities take part in a number of philanthropic programs and provide social opportunities for students. Formal rush takes place at the start of every fall semester.\n\n\n\n---Sororities---\n\n---Fraternities---\n\nThe University of West Alabama has multiple student organizations and honor societies on its campus for students to join. With over 50 of these on campus, students can choose from a variety to become a member of. There are athletic support groups, governing and programming organizations, musical, religious, and special interest organizations just to name a few. UWA also has quite a number of honor societies in addition to these social organizations.\n\nThe University of West Alabama features 12 sports teams (13 beginning in 2011–2012 with the addition of women's soccer). Both the male and female athletic teams are called the West Alabama Tigers. Ten of the twelve teams participate in the NCAA's Division II as a member of the Gulf South Conference East Division. Men's and women's rodeo compete in the Ozark Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. The NCAA's Division II sports at the University of West Alabama include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, outdoor track, soccer, and tennis for men; basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, outdoor track, and volleyball for women. The University's official mascot is Luie the Tiger.\n\nAs an NAIA member in 1971, the football team won the school's only national championship in any sport.\nIn 1992, the baseball team made history, advancing to their only Division II College World Series. Their chances for the school's first baseball national championship ended in tough luck as they dropped two of three games. In 1997, the Tiger softball program made its only trip to the national tournament and posted a 1–2 record on the campus of Barry University. The men's and women's basketball teams have each made two appearances in the NCAA Tournament. The football team made its first trip to the NCAA Division II Championship since 1975 during the 2009 season. They upset Albany State in the first round before ultimately falling to Carson-Newman in the second round. The 2011 team went 8-4, beat DI foe Georgia State, and qualified for the NCAA DII tournament. The 2012 team went undefeated in Gulf South play (5-0) to claim the conference title. UWA defeated Miles College 41-7 in round one of the playoffs. The team lost at eventual national champion Valdosta State 49-21 in the second round. UWA finished 9-4. In 2017, the men's soccer team advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division II tournament losing to Lynn University 1-0.\n\nIn addition to varsity sports, the University offers a wide variety of intramural sports programs. Recently, an 18-hole disc golf course was added to the University campus.\n\n\nThe UWA National Alumni Association is the official alumni association of the University of West Alabama. Formed in 1910, the UWA National Alumni Association currently has 16 chapters. It is headquartered at the University of West Alabama's Webb Hall. The association works to assist the University of West Alabama in achieving its goals by serving as a catalyst for building alumni relationships, raising scholarship money for students, assisting with recruitment of potential students, and organizing programs and events such as homecoming.\n\n"}

Before 1992 VECs had authority over the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Regional Technical Colleges. They existed from 1930 to 2013, when they were replaced by Education and Training Boards.\n\nVECs were originally created by the Vocational Education Act 1930, as successors to the Technical Instruction Committees established by the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899. The original purpose of the committees was to administer continuation and technical education for 14- to 16-year-olds. Continuation education was defined as \"general and practical training in preparation for employment in trades\", while technical education was described as \"pertaining to trades, manufacturers, commerce and other industrial pursuits\". To this end the VECs were charged with the duty of setting up and maintaining vocational schools.\n\nOver time the duties of VECs increased, in particular in the area of adult education. These included:\n\n\"Post-primary (secondary) education\"\n\n\"Further and adult education\"\n\nVECs also administered maintenance grants and bursaries for third-level education until 2012.\n\nIn September 2008, County Dublin VEC opened the first Community National School, in Porterstown, Dublin 15. This marked the first time a VEC had become involved in primary school education.\n\nVECs were originally established in each administrative county and county borough in the then Irish Free State. In addition, a VEC was formed in those municipal boroughs and urban districts which had a separate Technical Instruction Committee under the 1899 legislation (namely Bray, Drogheda, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford) and in the newly created Borough of Dún Laoghaire.\n\nThe number of VECs was reduced to the final number of thirty-three when five town committees were amalgamated with the adjacent county committees, leaving Dún Laoghaire as the only VEC area not consisting of a city or county.\n\nEach Vocational Education Committee was elected by the county, borough or urban district council and consisted partly of councillors and partly of persons with an \"interest and experience in education\" and who could be recommended by bodies \"interested in manufacture or trades\".\n\nThe Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 changed the composition of the committees, and parents of students under 18 and members of the staff were also entitled to elect committee members. Members could also be appointed to represent the interests of students, voluntary organisations, community organisations, Irish language interests and business.\n\nIn October 2010 the Department of Education and Skills announced that the number of VECs was to be reduced from 33 to 16 by amalgamation In 2011 the new government confirmed that scale of reduction but revised the scheme of amalgamations It subsequently announced the establishment of SOLAS, a new steering and funding agency to cover the further education provision of the VECs, which also absorbed the training activities formerly carried out by FÁS.\n\nUnder the terms of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 the VECS were dissolved, being replaced by 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) on 1 July 2013:\n\n\n"}

Wimsatt (born May 27, 1941) is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy, the Committee on Conceptual and Historical Studies of Science (previously Conceptual Foundations of Science), and the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. He is currently a Winton Professor of the Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota and Residential Fellow of the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science. He specializes in the philosophy of biology, where his areas of interest include reductionism, heuristics, emergence, scientific modeling, heredity, and cultural evolution.\n\nWimsatt, as an undergraduate, began studying engineering physics at Cornell University. After working for a year working as a designer in industry, he turned to philosophy receiving a BA degree \"magna cum laude\" in 1965. Wimsatt then went to the University of Pittsburgh on Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and Mellon Fellowships. to study philosophy of science and received his PhD in 1971. His thesis consisted of a philosophical analysis of biological function. He published three papers from his dissertation: \"Teleology and the Logical Structure of Function Statements\", \"Complexity and Organization\", and \"Reductionism, levels of organization, and the mind-body problem\". From July 1969 to December 1970, he was a postdoctoral fellow in population biology with Richard Lewontin at the University of Chicago, and was subsequently hired as an assistant professor of Philosophy in 1971 and promoted to full professor in 1981.\n\nIn 2007, he was named the Peter H. Ritzma Professor in Philosophy and Evolutionary Biology. He has been a visiting Distinguished Professor at Ohio State University, visiting Hurst Professor and a Clark-Way Harrison Distinguished Visitor at Washington University in St. Louis, a fellow at the Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Study and Conference Center in Italy, a senior fellow at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research in Vienna, Austria, Winton University Professot at the University of Minnesota, and a fellow at the Franke Humanities Institute in Chicago. He is on the scientific advisory board of the Land Institute.\n\nRichard Lewontin, Richard Levins, Herbert A. Simon, Stuart Kauffman, and Donald T. Campbell are all important influences on Wimsatt's work. Some of the most important commentators on Wimsatt's writings are his students, many of whom are now working as philosophers of science and scientists, e.g. Marshall Abrams, Douglas Allchin, Irene Appelbaum, William Bechtel, Stuart Glennan, James R. Griesemer, Jeffry Ramsey, Sahotra Sarkar, Jeffrey Schank, and Marty Sereno.\n\nWimsatt is the son of the late William A. Wimsatt who was a Cornell University professor specializing in bats. He was married to Barbara Horberg on June 13, 1971. He has one son, William Upski Wimsatt, known as an author and political activist.\n\nWimsatt's philosophical position starts with two themes: we are limited beings and the world we try to understand is complex. The problem then is how to build a philosophical world view based on these two themes. For Wimsatt, \"robustness\" (e.g., believing that a particular apple exists because we can see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, and hear it crunch when we eat it) is fundamental for accessing what exists in the world. The more we can detect things in multiple ways, the more we are inclined to believe they exist. Closely connected to robustness are the heuristics, which we use to think about the world and are foundational to his epistemology. They are rules of thumb, which can be wrong or biased but tend to work when applied to what is robust in the world. For Wimsatt, questions of realism (i.e., what exists) are not separable from questions of epistemology (i.e., what we can know) and the discovery of what exists. This may appear circular, but it is by evolution that we have evolved multiple ways of detecting things in the world.\n\nWimsatt was awarded the 2013 David Hull award for outstanding contributions to Philosophy of Biology and support of students in the profession by the International Society for History Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology.\n\n\n"}
