AMCIS is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious conferences for IS/IT in the Western Hemisphere, and provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of peer-reviewed information systems research papers. The conference attracts over 600 submissions each year, and those that are selected for presentation appear in the \"AMCIS Proceedings\", which are distributed to hundreds of libraries throughout the world.\n\nThe first AMCIS conference took place in 1995 in Pittsburgh and is notable for being the first IS/IT conference to utilize electronic paper submissions. Since that time, AMCIS has been held every August in different cities and attracts between 800 and 1,200 registered delegates every year. In 2006, AMCIS was held in Acapulco, Mexico, thereby marking a major milestone for the conference insofar as it was the first time AMCIS has been held outside of the United States. In 2008, AMCIS was held in Toronto, Canada, and, in 2012, in Lima, Peru. A Portuguese-language track was added in 2008. This continued in 2009 at the San Francisco conference and was a large component of the 2010 Lima conference.\n\n"}

It is primarily designed to give private member institutions of the College Board a closer look into the finances of a student and family. It is much more detailed than the FAFSA. The College Board estimates it will take most students/families between 45 minutes and two hours to complete the CSS PROFILE application. Generally speaking, most public and state universities do not use CSS PROFILE to make financial aid decisions, while most private colleges do.\n\nThe CSS PROFILE asks questions about the financial status of the student and the student's parents. The information the student gives in the CSS PROFILE is then sent to colleges or universities that the student specifies.\n\nAlong with the FAFSA, the CSS PROFILE is the most common financial aid application that students in the United States fill out.\n\nEach CSS PROFILE costs a fee, varying from year to year.\n\nThe application for the CSS PROFILE is usually available on October 1 in the calendar year preceding the year that a student hopes to receive financial aid. Generally, colleges with early acceptance programs (student receives admission decision before the new year) use the CSS PROFILE to make preliminary financial aid decisions, even though the FAFSA application is now available in October as well. Then after student completes the FAFSA (the official financial aid application) colleges may then make adjustments to their financial aid awards if necessary.\n\nFor the 2017-2018 scholastic year, the application fee is $25.00 to submit CSS PROFILE to a single college or university, and $16.00 per each additional college. Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and most other prestigious schools require the CSS PROFILE. Princeton University is a notable exception because it does not require a CSS PROFILE but instead has its own free financial aid application form. Students may, however, submit a CSS PROFILE to Princeton and later automatically transmit that information onto Princeton's form.\n\n"}

It was equivalent to a master's degree in present-day nomenclature but the title \"diploma\" was retained for historic reasons, \"diploma\" being the archaic term for a master's degree.\n\nThe Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government (EPSRC) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. \n\nThe introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a University of Cambridge Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the \"demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … <nowiki>[which]</nowiki> if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered\". The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory \"was one of the pioneers in the de and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)\". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that \"The Summer School deals <nowiki>[only]</nowiki> with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed.\" The Diploma \"would include theoretical and practical work … <nowiki>[and also]</nowiki> instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based.\" With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.\n\nUniversity-supported teaching and research staff in the Laboratory at the time were Maurice Wilkes (head of the laboratory), J. C. P. Miller, W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove.\n\nIn its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year (\"Part IB\") of the undergraduate Computer Science Tripos course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate (\"Part II\") lecture courses also included.\n\nThere were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.\n\n"}

The team of 60 Cambridge students design, build and race solar-powered vehicles. Founded in 2007, their first prototype vehicle, \"Affinity\", became the first solar-powered car to drive legally on UK roads. The team compete in the biennial World Solar Challenge. CUER's race vehicle for the 2013 race, \"Resolution\", is known for its innovative tracking plate design, and unusual teardrop shape. Its latest vehicle, \"Evolution\", builds upon this previous design and was entered into the 2015 race, where it became the best UK entry since 2007.\n\nCambridge University Eco Racing is based in the University's Department of Engineering and comprises around 60 undergraduate members from several departments of Cambridge University. As well as having a large student body, the team is strongly supported by a number of academic and industrial advisers, including Hermann Hauser and David Cleevely.\n\nThe team was founded in 2007 by Martin McBrien, inspired by the solar car team at MIT. Its first vehicle, \"Affinity\", was designed and constructed in early 2008 and was used as a prototype and display vehicle rather than for serious competition. In June 2008, \"Affinity\" was driven from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise awareness of sustainable energy. As part of the End to End venture, it was endorsed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to legally drive on UK roads, and became the first such vehicle to qualify. CUER runs outreach events at local schools and has been featured in a wide range of local, national and international media.\n\nIn July 2008, work began on the second generation CUER vehicle, \"Endeavour\". Following design work by a number of students in the Engineering Department, and with the support of the advisory board, the team competed in the 2009 World Solar Challenge, a 3000 km marathon across Australia. They came 14th, of 26 competitors, after a battery failure severely hindered their chances of competing effectively. \"Endeavour\"'s 2009 entry was launched by Jenson Button at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.\n\nOver the next two years, they continued redesigning and refining Endeavour, resulting in a car with much improved aerodynamic properties and more reliable batteries. The team used CFD simulations to make minor tweaks to the canopy, and tested the car extensively at a local airfield, before heading out to the next World Solar Challenge in October 2011. There, after the hardest race on record due to a combination of thunderstorms and bush fires, they came 25th out of 37 teams.\n\nSince then, the team designed a new vehicle, Resolution, to compete in the WSC in 2013. This vehicle differed from CUER's previous vehicles in that the design team chose to prioritise aerodynamic efficiency over power-generation - opting instead to use a sleek \"tear-drop\" design to reduce the car's drag coefficient while also making use of efficient satellite-grade Gallium Arsenide solar cells to maximize the amount of power generated for a smaller surface area of solar panels. Although CUER entered Resolution into the WSC 2013 race, it was unable to fully trial the design as the vehicle crashed during testing in Australia - damaging the solar cell array - and was subsequently unable to compete in the race.\n\nCUER's newest vehicle and Resolution's successor, Evolution, was its entry into WSC 2015. It implements improvements that addresses many of the stability and structural problems that affected Revolution, while maintaining the new design. The race was used as a proof-of-concept for Evolution's design and to identify areas for improvement in future race cycles. As well as this, Evolution achieved 2,047 km on solar power to become the most successful UK entry into WSC since 2007 in terms of distance covered under solar power. The team finished 22nd of 27 Challenger class competitors.\n\n\"Affinity\" was CUER's first vehicle, built as a prototype and based on a shape taken from MIT's \"Manta Elite\" solar car. Affinity became the UK's first road legal solar car, successfully driving from Land's End to John o'Groats as part of CUER's \"End to End\" tour in 2008.\n\nThe second generation vehicle, designed and built to compete in the World Solar Challenge. First entering the World Solar Challenge in 2009, the team led by Anthony Law raced across the Outback of Australia marking the teams highest placed finish to date. Endeavour was modified and take to Australia again in 2011 by the team led by Emil Hewage.\n\nDesigned and built in under 12 months, Resolution's innovative aerodynamic shape breaks away from the classic 'table top' design seen in most entrants to the World Solar Challenge.\n\nEvolution formed an improvement to the design concept which had been pioneered with Resolution\n\nCUER regularly attends industry conferences. They have been represented at the Raymond James’ 4th Annual European Investors North American Equities Conference, and the Exhibition of Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering at Hethel Engineering Centre and Marketforce’s ‘Renewables 2008’. CUER also exhibited in Cambridge at the ARM Partner Meeting, Cambridge Climate’s ‘Entrepreneurship for a Zero-Carbon Society’ conference and CIR’s ‘Solar Smart HEAT’ event.\n\nFurther afield, CUER exhibited amongst the Europe’s top 100 Cleantech companies at the Guardian/Library House Essential Cleantech conference, and presented at ‘Commercialising Photovoltaics’ organised by Renewables East.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She studied English and History at the University of Reading.\n\nGilbert trained as a history teacher, \"and I couldn't get over the fact that there were children of 14 or 15 in front of me who couldn't read,\" so took an Open University reading diploma to learn what she should do. At the age of 32, she became head of Whitmore High School, and then promoted to Director of Education for the London Borough of Harrow. She became head of Tower Hamlets Education Services in 1997 where those gaining General Certificate of Secondary Education or equivalent at good grades (A*-C) was raised to 56% from 26% in under a decade. Later she became Chief Executive of Tower Hamlets.\n\nGilbert became HM Chief Inspector on 1 October 2006, replacing Maurice Smith. One of her key briefs was to oversee the expansion of Ofsted's remit from April 2007 to include the inspection of children's social services, adult learning and aspects of court administration, as this relates to children. Gilbert states that her aim is that schools not be \"satisfactory\", that all should aspire to be \"good\". She is associated with \"personalised learning\" and aims to include \"the child in the corner who isn't following\".\n\nShe focused on free school meals as a factor that is an indicator of a poverty-group (incomes far below official levels of poverty are required to claim free meals). In 2000–01, there was a simple relationship of the higher the proportion of free school meals, the lower the chances of being rated good or better, and conversely the higher of being just satisfactory or worse.\n\nMiriam Rosen, Gilbert’s successor, wrote in The Annual Report of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills 2010/11 \"In concluding this commentary, I want to take the opportunity to say a brief and personal word about Christine Gilbert, who finished her term as HMCI during the year. Christine brought the new Ofsted together from its predecessor organisations in 2007. She brought extraordinary energy and personal drive to the service of children and learners. She passionately believed not only that everyone deserves the best from the services they use, but that every child can and should achieve and do well. That has been the vision which has animated Ofsted for many years, and it continues to do so today\".\n\nOn Monday 5 November 2012, Gilbert took up a post as Acting Chief Executive of the Council in the London Borough of Brent, initially for a six-month appointment, succeeding Gareth Daniel, who left at short notice earlier in the year.\n\nWhen she went into education she initially taught the 'whole books' method and believed in it, but seeing the effects of the National Literacy Strategy, realised for those of school age the explicit teaching of phonics was important.\n\nDivorced from her first husband, she met then councillor and later government minister Tony McNulty when she was Director of Education for the London Borough of Harrow. The couple married in September 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham. She has no children from either marriage.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Tablet\" named her as one of Britain’s most influential Roman Catholics.\n\n"}

It is one of the best known companies of entomology and taxidermy of Paris. Today, Deyrolle is a shop and a cabinet of curiosities open to the public, a reference in the field of taxidermy, entomology and natural sciences, whose vocation is to show the beauty of Nature. Deyrolle is also involved in pedagogy and art.\n\nDeyrolle was created in 1831 by Jean-Baptiste Deyrolle, who was soon succeeded by his son Achille, at 46 rue du Bac in a building constructed in 1697-1699 by Jean-Baptiste Voille for a member of the Bruand family (Libéral Bruand). It was deeply transformed in 1739 by Samuel-Jacques Bernard, son of the banker of Louis XIV, Samuel Bernard (7 arrondissement). Beyond its scientific material, minerals collections, seashells, fossils, mounted animals and prehistoric tools, Deyrolle provides pedagogical charts to schools and universities in France, made to illustrate teacher’s lessons. (\"Musée scolaire Deyrolle\").\n\nIn 2001 Louis Albert de Broglie bought Deyrolle and he restored the shop.\n\nOn February the 1st 2008, the Cabinet of Curiosities was destroyed by a big fire. The cause was probably a short-circuit. A big part of the rooms and of the collections has been destroyed: butterflies, insects, and animals (zebras, alligators, gazelles, bears, lions, shellfish and turtles). On May the 15th 2008, the building was already cleaned and the two rooms of the first floor reopened.\n\nSome artists that contributed to save Deyrolle:\n\nJan Fabre - Nan Goldin - Jacques Grange - Karen Knorr - Marie-Jo Lafontaine - Claude Lalanne - François-Xavier Lalanne - Pierre Alechinsky - Yann Arthus-Bertrand - Miquel Barcelo - Pascal Bernier - Laurent Bochet - Sophie Calle - Johan Creten - Marc Dantan - Nicolas Darrot - Mark Dion - Bettina Rheims - Bernar Venet - Huang Yong Ping.\n\nDeyrolle is well known for its pedagogical charts. It all starts around 1871, when Emile Deyrolle developed everything that concerns the educational material, anatomical models in staff, biology pieces, and most of all, the creation of coloured wall charts, published under the name \"Musée scolaire Deyrolle\". They are meant to teach the \"Leçons de choses\" (\"Lessons of things\") but also Botany, Zoology, Entomology, Geography, Anatomy, Civics, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Mineralogy, Biology, etc.\n\n« \"Visual instruction is the least tiring for the mind, but this education can have good results only if the ideas engraved in the children’s mind are rigorously exact.\" » Émile Deyrolle\n\nIn 2007, Louis Albert de Broglie restarts the publishing activity with the creation of new educational charts, to tackle contemporary environmental and societal issues. It is the start of a new collection of educational charts published under the name of Deyrolle pour l’Avenir (DPA). There are charts on sustainable development, climate changes, endangered species, renewable energy, etc.\n\nDeyrolle is a reference in the field of taxidermy. We can find birds, beasts and mammals from all over the world. At Deyrolle, with only a few exceptions, no animal was killed to be mounted: the non-domestic species come from zoos, parks, where they died of old age or illness. They are traceable, and protected species are held and delivered in accordance with the Washington Convention (CITES).\n\nDeyrolle is also known for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological room are filled with colourful butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.\n\nThe first aim of Deyrolle was to teach natural sciences to children and students, but Deyrolle was a point of interest also for artists: the surrealists André Breton and Salvador Dalí, the painters Jean Dubuffet and Mathieu, the writers Louise de Vilmorin and Théodore Monod, Raymond Queneau and many others stopped regularly at the shop.\n\nToday, Deyrolle continues its proximity with artists and the shop welcomes a lot of exhibitions and events during the year: Bettina Rheims, Éric Sander or also Charwei Tsai was exhibited at Deyrolle. Woody Allen used the rooms of Deyrolle in July 2010 for his movie \"Midnight in Paris\", and Wes Anderson is a huge fan of the shop.\n\nDeyrolle also develops collaborations with artists. We can mention Aurèle or Damien Hirst, for example.\n\nIn 2005, French singer Nolwenn Leroy shot the artwork for her album \"Histoires Naturelles\" at Deyrolle, as well as the music video for the single \"Histoire Naturelle\".\n\nSome exhibitions:\n\n\n"}

Simultaneously, VSO teachers from the UK and the Netherlands were recruited to work in other Guiyang institutes of higher education including the school of fashion and the catering college, both experiencing booms concurrent with Guiyang's emergence from relative obscurity. These teachers taught in both the undergraduate and post-graduate programmes at each institution. \n\nIn 2005, eight years after Gui Nong (Guizhou Agricultural College) was merged with Gui Da (Guizhou University), Guizhou University began hosting United States Peace Corps Volunteers. The volunteers teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level in the School of Foreign Languages.\n\nGuizhou University has nine campuses situated in different locations around the city of Guiyang. The administrative center is located on the North Campus on the Huaxi River, Huaxi District of Guiyang.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, the Liberian interior was next of kin to being terra incognita in the West, there having been no previous medical or scientific survey of the region, nor any recorded expedition into the Liberian hinterlands. \nThe Expedition leader was Richard Pearson Strong (Harvard's first Professor of tropical medicine), with the others being zoologists Harold Jefferson Coolidge Jr. (Assistant Curator of Mammals at Harvard) and Dr. Glover Morrill Allen, entomologist Dr. Joseph Charles Bequaert, botanist and Washington University Professor David H. Linder, bacteriologist Dr. George C. Shattuck, clinician Dr. Max Theiler, and Assistant Ornithologist Loring Whitman (also a Harvard medical student and the Photographer). The Expedition was a success and, while its \"chief objective was the investigation of tropical diseases, many zoological specimens were collected and the customs of the native tribes were studied.\" The story of their travels back and forth across Liberia, and reports of the diseases found that ailed the inhabitants, animals and plants was published in the two-volume \"The African Republic of Liberia and the Belgian Congo: Based on the Observations Made and Material Collected during the Harvard African Expedition, 1926-1927\" written by Dr. Strong in a partnership with other Expedition members and Harvard officials.\n\nWhile investigating tropical medicine, maladies, and wildlife along with general exploration was indeed the prime purpose of the Harvard Expedition, Dr. Strong noted two underlying political and economic reasons for the venture as well:\nHowever, it was the geographical element that overlaid the entire venture as Liberian interior was all but entirely unknown to the West - meaning the Dr. Strong and his company had to make the maps as they journeyed; for the current ones, they found, were grossly inaccurate:\n\"The greater part of the country has not been surveyed from a geographical standpoint, and most of the prominent features are inaccurately placed on the various maps obtainable ... The sources and courses of rivers, the heights of mountains, and the situations and positions of towns are usually hypothetical. We found that names of the great majority of the towns and villages in the interior, inscribed on the published maps were unknown to the inhabitants of the regions concerned.\"\nAs such, the Medical Expedition had many eyes upon it as it would inform not only medical and zoological research, but also anthropological and geological along with government and business views on Liberia regarding the current status of the country.\n\nArriving in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, Dr. Strong and co. began by settling permits, route issues, and meeting dignitaries. Then, with such logistical concerns settled by the beginning of August and after making brief ventures to collect specimens in the adjacent countryside, they proceeded up the Du river to the first three Firestone Plantations before journeying into the hinterlands that, effectively, were not wholly under the control of the central government. The Expedition's goal being Gbarnga - then called Gbanga - (where they intended to and eventually did establish their base camp), they traversed many towns and villages en route. However, while the Expedition encountered and observed many African tribes during and following this stage of their journey, one of their most historically noted meetings occurred in the beginning of September just before they arrived in Gbanga. This encounter being with the famed Paramount tribal chief Suah Koko of Suakoko, a formidable woman whose estimated age was 60-70 said was said to be the only female chief in the country. Spending a few nights in her domain, the Westerners describe Chief Suah Koko as, despite her age and near blindness, displaying \"surprising intelligence in her conversation and [that she is] apparently feared, respected, and obeyed in her community.\" Indeed, while peace currently reigned, the Harvard Expedition noted signs of her previous war with the Liberian Frontier Force in the heavily fortified compound that was her home; a peace that Chief Suah Koko had previously and successfully negotiated with the Liberian government. Hence her importance not just in Liberian politics, but also to the Expeditior - for she ruled a strategic region in that it served as a key crossing point into the Liberian hinterlands; indeed, \"without her permission and without her generosity, the Harvard expedition could not have traveled further to Gbanga and beyond.\" A charge that the chief managed quite well, for Dr. Strong notes in his book that \"her province was apparently well governed, and all the promises which she made while we in the community, and in response to our requests, chiefly relating to the sales of food, to transportation, and the examination of her people were kept.\" However, a slight yet harmless culture clash occurred between the Westerners and the Chief - one owed to the fact that the chief was a woman. In sum, knowing that gaining the local rulers' favor was necessary for the success of the Expedition, Dr. Strong showered them with gifts consisting mainly of gin and tobacco. But, as the Professor notes in his diary:\n\nChief Suah Koko was as good as her word for, while the Medical Expedition had had difficulty throughout their Liberian journeys in securing the help of porters, Chief Suah Koko was instrumental in providing them. Indeed, while the Expedition members stay with the famed Chief was brief, the hospitality and aid she offered them made her a meeting with her an important event.\n\nHarvard Medical African Expedition was a success with countless specimens collected and the customs of tribes such as Suah Koko's and those of the Gbanga and beyond Liberia in the Congo recorded. Furthermore, the photography endeavors of Loring Whitman yielded many photos ranging from local wildlife to the everyday dress and activities of the tribes, to the flesh-eating and twisting diseases whose study was the primary purpose of the venture - all, and the details of which, are printed, explained, and analyzed in Dr. Strong's two-volume \"The African Republic of Liberia and the Belgian Congo: Based on the Observations Made and Material Collected during the Harvard African Expedition, 1926-1927\". Furthermore, Harold Coolidge brought back a large gorilla that is still on display at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, and, in 1929, he published \"A revision of the genus Gorilla\", which forms the basis of the modern taxonomy of the genus Gorilla. The legacy of the Medical Expedition is twofold: at the time and as noted by Dr. Strong, the Expedition's return prompted the United States to take steps to rectify the unsanitary conditions observed in Monrovia and, in addition, \"there has been much publicity and interest taken in connection with the opportunities offered by Mr. Harvey S. Firestone. However, the ultimate legacy of the venture is, like the gorilla, the lasting accumulation and possession of knowledge and specimens for study across many fields.\n\n"}

{"id": "10129706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10129706", "title": "Inquiry-based learning", "text": "Inquiry-based learning\n\nInquiry-based learning (also enquiry-based learning in British English) is a form of active learning that starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios—rather than simply presenting established facts or portraying a smooth path to knowledge. The process is often assisted by a facilitator. Inquirers will identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning includes problem-based learning, and is generally used in small scale investigations and projects, as well as research. The inquiry-based instruction is principally very closely related to the development and practice of thinking skills.\n\nInquiry-based learning is primarily a pedagogical method, developed during the discovery learning movement of the 1960s as a response to traditional forms of instruction—where people were required to memorize information from instructional materials, such as direct instruction and rote learning. The philosophy of inquiry based learning finds its antecedents in constructivist learning theories, such as the work of Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, and Freire among others, and can be considered a constructivist philosophy. Generating information and making meaning of it based on personal or societal experience is referred to as constructivism. Dewey's experiential learning pedagogy (that is, learning through experiences) comprises the learner actively participating in personal or authentic experiences to make meaning from it. Inquiry can be conducted through experiential learning because inquiry values the same concepts, which include engaging with the content/material in questioning, as well as investigating and collaborating to make meaning. Vygotsky approached constructivism as learning from an experience that is influenced by society and the facilitator. The meaning constructed from an experience can be concluded as an individual or within a group.\n\nIn the 1960s Joseph Schwab called for inquiry to be divided into three distinct levels. This was later formalized by Marshall Herron in 1971, who developed the Herron Scale to evaluate the amount of inquiry within a particular lab exercise. Since then, there have been a number of revisions proposed and inquiry can take various forms. There is a spectrum of inquiry-based teaching methods available.\n\nSpecific learning processes that people engage in during inquiry-learning include:\n\n\nInquiry learning involves developing questions, making observations, doing research to find out what information is already recorded, developing methods for experiments, developing instruments for data collection, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, outlining possible explanations and creating predictions for future study.\n\nThere are many different explanations for inquiry teaching and learning and the various levels of inquiry that can exist within those contexts. The article titled \"The Many Levels of Inquiry\" by Heather Banchi and Randy Bell (2008) clearly outlines four levels of inquiry.\n\nLevel 1: Confirmation Inquiry\nThe teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings.\n\nLevel 2: Structured Inquiry\nThe teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect.\n\nLevel 3: Guided Inquiry\nThe teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings.\n\nLevel 4: Open/True Inquiry\nStudents formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions.\n\nBanchi and Bell (2008) explain that teachers should begin their inquiry instruction at the lower levels and work their way to open inquiry in order to effectively develop students' inquiry skills. Open inquiry activities are only successful if students are motivated by intrinsic interests and if they are equipped with the skills to conduct their own research study.\n\nAn important aspect of inquiry-based learning (and science) is the use of open learning, as evidence suggests that only utilizing lower level inquiry is not enough to develop critical and scientific thinking to the full potential. Open learning has no prescribed target or result that people have to achieve. There is an emphasis on the individual manipulating information and creating meaning from a set of given materials or circumstances. In many conventional and structured learning environments, people are told what the outcome is expected to be, and then they are simply expected to 'confirm' or show evidence that this is the case.\n\nOpen learning has many benefits. It means students do not simply perform experiments in a routine like fashion, but actually think about the results they collect and what they mean. With traditional non-open lessons there is a tendency for students to say that the experiment 'went wrong' when they collect results contrary to what they are told to expect. In open learning there are no wrong results, and students have to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the results they collect themselves and decide their value.\n\nOpen learning has been developed by a number of science educators including the American John Dewey and the German Martin Wagenschein. Wagenschein's ideas particularly complement both open learning and inquiry-based learning in teaching work. He emphasized that students should not be taught bald facts, but should understand and explain what they are learning. His most famous example of this was when he asked physics students to tell him what the speed of a falling object was. Nearly all students would produce an equation, but no students could explain what this equation meant. Wagenschien used this example to show the importance of understanding over knowledge.\n\nSociologist of education Phillip Brown defined inquisitive learning as learning that is intrinsically motivated (e.g. by curiosity and interest in knowledge for its own sake), as opposed to \"acquisitive learning\" that is extrinsically motivated (e.g. by acquiring high scores on examinations to earn credentials). However, occasionally the term \"inquisitive learning\" is simply used as a synonym for \"inquiry-based learning\".\n\nInquiry learning has been used as a teaching and learning tool for thousands of years, however, the use of inquiry within public education has a much briefer history. Ancient Greek and Roman educational philosophies focused much more on the art of agricultural and domestic skills for the middle class and oratory for the wealthy upper class. It was not until the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason, during the late 17th and 18th century that the subject of Science was considered a respectable academic body of knowledge. Up until the 1900s the study of science within education had a primary focus on memorizing and organizing facts.\n\nJohn Dewey, a well-known philosopher of education at the beginning of the 20th century, was the first to criticize the fact that science education was not taught in a way to develop young scientific thinkers. Dewey proposed that science should be taught as a process and way of thinking – not as a subject with facts to be memorized. While Dewey was the first to draw attention to this issue, much of the reform within science education followed the lifelong work and efforts of Joseph Schwab. \nJoseph Schwab was an educator who proposed that science did not need to be a process for identifying stable truths about the world that we live in, but rather science could be a flexible and multi-directional inquiry driven process of thinking and learning. \nSchwab believed that science in the classroom should more closely reflect the work of practicing scientists. Schwab developed three levels of open inquiry that align with the breakdown of inquiry processes that we see today.\n\n\nToday, we know that students at all levels of education can successfully experience and develop deeper level thinking skills through scientific inquiry. The graduated levels of scientific inquiry outlined by Schwab demonstrate that students need to develop thinking skills and strategies prior to being exposed to higher levels of inquiry. Effectively, these skills need to be scaffolded by the teacher or instructor until students are able to develop questions, methods, and conclusions on their own. \nA catalyst for reform within North American science education was the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the Soviet Union satellite. This historical scientific breakthrough caused a great deal of concern around the science and technology education the American students were receiving. In 1958 the U.S. congress developed and passed the National Defense Education Act in order to provide math and science teachers with adequate teaching materials.\n\nAmerica's National Science Education Standards (NSES) (1996) outlines six important aspects pivotal to inquiry learning in science education.\n\n\nScience naturally lends itself to investigation and collection of data, but it is applicable in other subject areas where people are developing critical thinking and investigation skills. In history, for example, Robert Bain in his article in \"How Students Learn\", describes how to \"problematize\" history. Bain's idea is to first organize a learning curriculum around central concepts. Next, people studying the curriculum are given a question and primary sources such as eye witness historical accounts, and the task for inquiry is to create an interpretation of history that will answer the central question. It is held that through the inquiry people will develop skills and factual knowledge that supports their answers to a question. They will form an hypothesis, collect and consider information and revisit their hypothesis as they evaluate their data.\n\nAfter Charles Pascal's report in 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario's Ministry of Education decided to implement a full day kindergarten program that focuses on inquiry and play-based learning, called The Early Learning Kindergarten Program. As of September 2014, all primary schools in Ontario started the program. The curriculum document outlines the philosophy, definitions, process and core learning concepts for the program. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Piaget's child development theory and Dewey's experiential learning are the heart of the program's design. As research shows, children learn best through play, whether it is independently or in a group. Three forms of play are noted in the curriculum document, pretend or \"pretense\" play, socio-dramatic play and constructive play. Through play and authentic experiences, children interact with their environment (people and/or objects) and question things; thus leading to inquiry learning. A chart on page 15 clearly outlines the process of inquiry for young children, including initial engagement, exploration, investigation, and communication. The new program supports holistic approach to learning. For further details, please see the curriculum document.\n\nSince the program is extremely new, there is limited research on its success and areas of improvement. One government research report was released with the initial groups of children in the new kindergarten program. The Final Report: Evaluation of the Implementation of the Ontario Full-Day Early-Learning Kindergarten Program from Vanderlee, Youmans, Peters, and Eastabrook (2012) conclude with primary research that high-need children improved more compared to children who did not attend Ontario's new kindergarten program. As with inquiry-based learning in all divisions and subject areas, longitudinal research is needed to examine the full extent of this teaching/learning method.\n\nThere are several common misconceptions regarding inquiry-based science, the first being that inquiry science is simply instruction that teaches students to follow the scientific method. Many teachers had the opportunity to work within the constraints of the scientific method as students themselves and figure inquiry learning must be the same. Inquiry science is not just about solving problems in six simple steps but much more broadly focused on the intellectual problem-solving skills developed throughout a scientific process. Additionally, not every hands-on lesson can be considered inquiry.\n\nSome educators believe that there is only one true method of inquiry, which would be described as the level four: Open Inquiry. While open inquiry may be the most authentic form of inquiry, there are many skills and a level of conceptual understanding that the students must have developed before they can be successful at this high level of inquiry. While inquiry-based science is considered to be a teaching strategy that fosters higher order thinking in students, it should be one of several methods used. A multifaceted approach to science keeps students engaged and learning.\n\nNot every student is going to learn the same amount from an inquiry lesson; students must be invested in the topic of study to authentically reach the set learning goals. Teachers must be prepared to ask students questions to probe their thinking processes in order to assess accurately. Inquiry-science requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise, however, the benefits outweigh the cost when true authentic learning can take place.\n\nThe literature states that inquiry requires multiple cognitive processes and variables, such as causality and co-occurrence that enrich with age and experience. \nKuhn, et al. (2000) used explicit training workshops to teach children in grades six to eight in the United States how to inquire through a quantitative study. By completing an inquiry-based task at the end of the study, the participants demonstrated enhanced mental models by applying different inquiry strategies. In a similar study, Kuhan and Pease (2008) completed a longitudinal quantitative study following a set of American children from grades four to six to investigate the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies for inquiry. Results demonstrated that children benefitted from the scaffolding because they outperformed the grade seven control group on an inquiry task. Understanding the neuroscience of inquiry learning the scaffolding process related to it should be reinforced for Ontario's primary teachers as part of their training.\n\nInquiry-based learning is fundamental for the development of higher order thinking skills. According to Bloom's Taxonomy, the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information or new understandings indicates a high level of thinking. Teachers should be encouraging divergent thinking and allowing students the freedom to ask their own questions and to learn the effective strategies for discovering the answers. The higher order thinking skills that students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical thinking skills that they will be able to transfer to other subjects.\n\nAs shown in the section above on the neuroscience of inquiry learning, it is significant to scaffold students to teach them how to inquire and inquire through the four levels. It cannot be assumed that they know how to inquire without foundational skills. Scaffolding the students at a younger age will result in enriched inquiring learning later.\n\nInquiry-based learning can be done in multiple formats, including:\n\n\nRemember to keep in mind...\n\n\nThere is a necessity for professional collaboration when executing a new inquiry program (Chu, 2009; Twigg, 2010). The teacher training and process of using inquiry learning should be a joint mission to ensure the maximal amount of resources are used and that the teachers are producing the best learning scenarios. The scholarly literature supports this notion. Twigg's (2010) education professionals who participated in her experiment \nemphasized year round professional development sessions, such as workshops, weekly meetings and observations, to ensure inquiry is being implemented in the class correctly. Another example is Chu's (2009) study, where the participants appreciated the professional collaboration of educators, information technicians and librarians to provide more resources and expertise for preparing the structure and resources for the inquiry project. To establish a professional collaboration and researched training methods, administration support is required for funding.\n\nKirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) review of literature found that although constructivists often cite each other's work, empirical evidence is not often cited. Nonetheless the constructivist movement gained great momentum in the 1990s, because many educators began to write about this philosophy of learning.\n\nHmelo-Silver, Duncan, & Chinn cite several studies supporting the success of the constructivist problem-based and inquiry learning methods. For example, they describe a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application. Students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.\n\nIn contrast, Hmelo-Silver et al. also cite a large study by Geier on the effectiveness of inquiry-based science for middle school students, as demonstrated by their performance on high-stakes standardized tests. The improvement was 14% for the first cohort of students and 13% for the second cohort. This study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.\n\nIn a 2006 article, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute's president, Chester E. Finn Jr., was quoted as saying \"But like so many things in education, it gets carried to excess... [the approach is] fine to some degree.\". The organization ran a study in 2005 concluding that the emphasis states put on inquiry-based learning is too great.\n\nRichard E. Mayer from the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2004 that there was sufficient research evidence to make any reasonable person skeptical about the benefits of discovery learning—practiced under the guise of cognitive constructivism or social constructivism—as a preferred instructional method. He reviewed research on discovery of problem-solving rules culminating in the 1960s, discovery of conservation strategies culminating in the 1970s, and discovery of LOGO programming strategies culminating in the 1980s. In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer.\n\nIt should be cautioned that inquiry-based learning takes a lot of planning before implementation. It is not something that can be put into place in the classroom quickly. Measurements must be put in place for how students knowledge and performance will be measured and how standards will be incorporated. The teacher's responsibility during inquiry exercises is to support and facilitate student learning (Bell et al., 769–770). A common mistake teachers make is lacking the vision to see where students' weaknesses lie. According to Bain, teachers cannot assume that students will hold the same assumptions and thinking processes as a professional within that discipline (p. 201).\n\nWhile some see inquiry-based teaching as increasingly mainstream, it can be perceived as in conflict with standardized testing common in standards-based assessment systems which emphasise the measurement of student knowledge, and meeting of pre-defined criteria, for example the shift towards \"fact\" in changes to the National Assessment of Educational Progress as a result of the American No Child Left Behind program.\n\nPrograms such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Program can be criticized for their claims to be an inquiry based learning program. While there are different types of inquiry (as stated above) the rigid structure of this style of inquiry based learning program almost completely rules out any real inquiry based learning in the lower grades. Each \"unit of inquiry\" is given to the students, structured to guide them and does not allow students to choose the path or topic of their inquiry. Each unit is carefully planned to connect to the topics the students are required to be learning in school and does not leave room for open inquiry in topics that the students pick. Some may feel that until the inquiry learning process is open inquiry then it is not true inquiry based learning at all. Instead of opportunities to learn through open and student-led inquiry, the IB program is viewed by some to simply be an extra set of learning requirements for the students to complete.\n\nChu (2009) used a mixed method design to examine the outcome of an inquiry project completed by students in Hong Kong with the assistance of multiple educators. Chu's (2009) results show that the children were more motivated and academically successful compared to the control group.\n\nCindy Hmelo-Silver reviewed a number of reports on a variety studies into problem based learning.\n\nEdelson, Gordin and Pea describe five significant challenges to implementing inquiry-based learning and present strategies for addressing them through the design of technology and curriculum. They present a design history covering four generations of software and curriculum to show how these challenges arise in classrooms and how the design strategies respond to them.\n\n\n"}

Teachers can catch up with work and also have the opportunity to train for any new technology or new ways of doing things within the school \n\nInset days were introduced in 1988 under a Conservative government by the minister then responsible, Kenneth Baker, as part of a series of reforms, including the introduction of the National Curriculum. They were originally, and are still occasionally, referred to as Baker Days, because Kenneth Baker introduced the requirement for teachers to attend training in addition to the 190 days previously required.\n\nTeachers in state schools are required to undertake five Inset days in addition to the 190 teaching days children are required to be in school. The days are determined by the local education authority, though academy and free schools have the freedom to set their own dates.\n\nThis development of teacher training days is thought by some education bodies to cause additional disruption and burdens on working parents who do not have easy access to flexible childcare, although the five training days were introduced as an addition to teachers' attendance days and the total number of days children are required to be in school was not affected.\n\nTeachers who are parents themselves may have greater problems than other working parents since they are unable to take ad-hoc days off to look after their own children whenever an Inset day is scheduled at their children's school.\n\n"}

Intellectual synthesis is most apparent in fields which blur the lines of existing disciplines (for example, history has been regarded as a social science, but is dependent upon anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, military theory, climatology, etc., and some such as Jared Diamond have proposed establishing human history as one of the historical sciences). \n\nWorld history is another example—as typically historians specialize on particular periods or regions or nations—with a new synthesis occurring of the histories of the world's diverse societies being brought together to tell a unified picture of the course of world history. \n\nThe goal of intellectual synthesis is to bring together all of the related transdisciplinary knowledge into a single, cohesive whole to provide for a more complete and comprehensive understanding and potentially lead to new theories, perspectives, and interpretations.\n\nMany new and emerging fields involve intellectual synthesis:\n\nPursuits that seek the broadest possible intellectual synthesis so as to establish principles that apply to everything in the universe include:\n\nThe topic of intellectual synthesis is the subject of many books, as often proponents of the need for such a scholarly endeavor will use a written work to voice their call to the intellectual community:\n\n"}

Her father, , was a noted baritone singer at La Scala and other European venues, and a music critic. Her mother was Bice Adami, a soprano singer. Her younger half sister, Fiora Contino, became a conductor and music teacher.\n\nA soprano singer, Corradetti studied piano and taught herself singing. She debuted in 1926 at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan, playing the part of Coralità in the opera \"Anima Allegra\" by Franco Vittadini. In 1928, she was the protagonist at La Scala in Milan, playing Rosalina in \"Sly\" by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari. In the same season she sang her first Mozart part, that of Barbarina in \"The Marriage of Figaro\".\n\nCorradetti had a vast repertoire that included eighty works, of which thirty-five were first performances of a piece, and about a hundred roles, mostly by composers of early Romanticism, such as Mozart and Cimarosa, as well as Verdi, Puccini, and Mascagni. She also performed works by contemporary composers such as Alberto Franchetti, Giuseppe Mulè and Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari. The parts that were most noted in her career were those of Francesca, in \"Francesca da Rimini\" by Riccardo Zandonai and the \"Madama Butterfly\" by Puccini.\n\nIn the 1930s, she recorded of some works for Italian radio. Corradetti officially retired from performing on January 28, 1946, during a Martini & Rossi concert; although on March 18, 1957, invited to a concert, she gave a final farewell to her career. After her retirement, Corradetti dedicated herself to teaching singing, initially in the Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello di Venezia in Venice, and latterly in Padua. Among her most famous students were Katia Ricciarelli, Mara Zampieri, Lucia Valentini Terrani, and Wladimiro Ganzarolli. She participated as a judge on the panels of many singing competitions, held conferences and master classes, in Italy and abroad, and for her expertise was assigned artistic direction positions at various institutions.\n\nThere are few recordings of her voice; three opera pieces were recorded in 1940 for Cetra Records and a series of concert arias, made from live recordings and today remastered on CD.\n\n\n"}

Woolley attended Western Grammar School, Brompton, London and then the University College, London from 1830, and during the next two years passed every subject he took with first-class honours. Woolley then won an open scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, graduating BA, 1836, with a first-class in classics, MA, 1839, and DCL in 1844. Woolley was ordained a deacon on 14 June 1840 and a priest on 4 July 1841. In 1840 Woolley published \"An Introduction to Logic\". In 1842 he was appointed headmaster of Edward the Sixth's Grammar School, Hereford, and three years later held the same position at Rossall School in Lancashire. Woolley published \"Sermons Preached in the Chapel of Rossall College\" in 1847. He became headmaster of Norwich Grammar School in 1849, and in 1852 was appointed principal and professor of classics at the University of Sydney.\n\nWoolley arrived in Sydney with his wife and daughters on 9 July 1852 and quickly started making arrangements for the opening of the University. The first matriculation examination was held in October, 24 students were admitted to matriculation, and teaching work began at once. Woolley afterwards added to his duties the teaching of logic. He had an extremely difficult task as principal. Parliament was unsympathetic, there were few students, and in many cases their preliminary schooling had been inadequate. One of the means of improving the position of the University that Woolley brought forward (not developed until after his death) was linking the primary education of the colony with the university. Woolley published a volume of \"Lectures Delivered in Australia\" (1862), some of which had been given at the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, Sydney, and similar institutions. Woolley gratuitously held classes at the mechanics' school of arts and endeavoured to expand the classes there into a regular curriculum of studies, and though in 1860 he had to admit the comparative failure of the attempt, after his death more was done in this area. In 1882, 1100 Pupils were attending classes. (Commemorative address on the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary by Sir William Windeyer).\n\nWoolley took leave and left for England on 26 December 1864 aboard HMS \"Miranda\". There he visited friends and relations. On his way back to Australia, Woolley was drowned in the Bay of Biscay when the \"SS London\" sank on 11 January 1866. Woolley married in July 1842 Mary Margaret, daughter of Major William Turner, who survived him with six children. A sum of £2000 was raised by subscription among his friends and presented to his widow. \n\nWoolley was a regarded a scholarly and amiable man. J. Sheridan Moore's lecture on \"The Life and Genius of James Lionel Michael\" contains a glowing reference to Woolley. Henry Barff, in \"A Short Historical Account of the University of Sydney\", speaks highly of his scholarship and enthusiasm, and of the work he did in the forming of the university and the moulding of young men's minds throughout the colony. Woolley however, found it almost impossible to make the young university take its proper place in the life of the colony. It was not until several years after his death that the number of students reached 100.\n\nThe John Woolley building at the University of Sydney is named in his honour. It currently houses the School of Letters, Art and Media.\n"}

{"id": "22305699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22305699", "title": "Leadership studies", "text": "Leadership studies\n\nLeadership studies is a multidisciplinary academic field of study that focuses on leadership in organizational contexts and in human life. Leadership studies has origins in the social sciences (e.g., sociology, anthropology, psychology), in humanities (e.g., history and philosophy), as well as in professional and applied fields of study (e.g., management and education). The field of leadership studies is closely linked to the field of organizational studies.\n\nAs an academic area of inquiry, the study of leadership has been of interest to scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds. Today, there are numerous academic programs (spanning several academic colleges and departments) related to the study of leadership. Leadership degree programs generally relate to: aspects of leadership, leadership studies, and organizational leadership (although there are a number of leadership-oriented concentrations in other academic areas).\n\nLeadership has become one of the fastest-growing academic fields in higher education At all levels, undergraduate through doctoral, an increasing number of colleges and universities have begun developing not only individual courses, but entire degree programs specifically devoted to the study of leadership.\n\nEven among some of the more established and traditional academic disciplines such as engineering, education, and medicine, specialization and concentration areas have developed around the study of leadership. Most of these academic programs have aimed to be multidisciplinary in nature—drawing upon theories and applications from related fields such as sociology, psychology, philosophy, and management. Such an approach, Rost (1991) has argued \"allows scholars and practitioners to think radically new thoughts about leadership that are not possible from a unidisciplinary approach\" (p. 2).\n\nThe study of leadership can be dated back to Plato, Sun Tzu and Machiavelli; however, leadership has only become the focus of contemporary academic studies in the last 60 years, and particularly more so in the last two decades. Contemporary leadership scholars and researchers have often been questioned about the nature of their work, and its place within the academy, but much of the confusion surrounding leadership as a field of study may be attributed to a lack of understanding regarding transdisciplinary, inter-, and multi- disciplinary academic fields of study in general.\n\nThe discipline (which encompasses a host of sub-fields) is filled with definitions, theories, styles, functions, competencies, and historical examples of successful and diverse leaders. Collectively, the research findings on leadership provide a far more sophisticated and complex view of the phenomenon than most of the simplistic views presented in the popular press.\n\nSome of the earliest studies on leadership include:\n\nIn addition to these studies, leadership has been examined from an academic perspective through several theoretical lenses:\n\nThe first doctoral program in Leadership Studies was established at the University of San Diego in the School of Leadership and Education Sciences in 1979. The first undergraduate school of Leadership Studies was established at the University of Richmond Jepson School of Leadership Studies in 1992.\n\nEmpirical, meta-analytic, and theoretical studies have been conducted on various types of leadership. Some of the styles of leadership studied include:\n\n\nLeadership has been studied using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative) research methodologies. From a quantitative psychology orientation, statistical and mathematical modeling has been used in the development of leadership scales, in testing established leader evaluation tools, and in examining perceptions of leaders. Quantitative analysis may also take an experimental approach, incorporating methods from the field of experimental economics. Survey methodology has also been widely used in leadership research. As such, traditional methods of analysis in survey research have also extended to the analysis of survey research within the study of leadership (e.g., cross-tabulations, ANOVAs, regression analysis, log-linear analysis, factor analysis, etc.). From a qualitative orientation, leadership research has included a host of research techniques: phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, interviews, case studies, historiography, literary criticism, etc.\n\n\"Coaches and coaching psychologists are increasingly using the lessons and\ntools of positive psychology in their practice (Biswas-Diener, 2010).\" An example of leadership research done was by P. Alex Linley and Gurpal Minhas researching the strengths that may be found in more effective strengthspotters; the people who are skilled in the identification and development of strengths in others. The study consisted of an online survey used to collect data on the Strengthspotting Scale, together with an assessment of 60 different strengths using the Realise2 model (www.realise2.com). There were 528 respondents to retrieve data from and the results showed that the four strengths connector, enabler, esteem builder and feedback were found across the Strengthspotting Scale. \"The strengths of Connector, Enabler and Feedback were significant predictors for each strengthspotting domain, suggesting that these may be the essence of the personal characteristics of an effective strengthspotter\" (Linley and Minhas, 2011).\n\nThere are a considerable number of doctoral, masters, and undergraduate degree programs related to the study of leadership. Given that the study of leadership is interdisciplinary, leadership-related degree programs are often situated within various colleges, schools, and departments across different university campuses (e.g., Schools of Education at some universities, Business Schools at other universities, and Graduate and Professional Schools at still other universities). As such, at the doctoral level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Ph.D., Ed.D., and executive doctoral degrees (depending on the situation of the program within the university). At the masters level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Master of Science, Master of Arts, and executive master's degrees. At the undergraduate level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees as well as leadership certificate and minor programs.\n\n"}
{"id": "30273319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30273319", "title": "Learning circle", "text": "Learning circle\n\nThe use of a circle as both the organizational structure and descriptive metaphor for a meeting of equals is likely to have been a part of our history for as long as fire has. The learning circle is a mechanism for organizing and honoring the collective wisdom of the group and is present in many indigenous cultures. For example, in early native councils of elders came together to understand problems in a spirit of shared community in “wisdom circles.” The term Learning Circle has been used to describe group efforts with clear links to social change. Over time and across countries, civic organizations, neighborhood communities, trade unions, churches and social justice groups have used the idea of learning circles to empower their members to make choices and take action. The web can help locate the many ways both present and past that groups have used the term Study circle or Learning Circle as a form of adult and student education. For example, Educators for Community Engagement, find that learning circles—with their principles of equal participation, reciprocity, and honoring of collective wisdom -embody the democratic principles of effective service-learning partnerships. They use learning circles, rather than more traditional forms of group meetings, to structure their annual conferences. Primary teachers use a simple form of learning circles when they gather the students at the rug for \"circle time.\" However many educators are using learning circles to connect students from around the world. Among the goals of this activity are helping students to develop the trust and respect for diversity of experience, and fostering both listening and speaking skills among peers. Researchers have used learning circles as a form of professional development to improve their practice. A similar term, \"Quality circle\" was used in the 80's to characterize the successful practice in corporate settings in which the hierarchical boundaries between workers and managers are flattened to encourage participatory management and team leadership. Quality circles, originally associated with Japanese management and manufacturing techniques developed in Japan after World War II, based on lectures of W. Edwards Deming (Joel & Ross, 1982). The goal was to encourage everyone to develop a strong sense of ownership over the process and products of the group.\n\nLearning Circles have been used for centuries with students and adults in many different contexts. Two models are described here but others may exist.\n\nOpenAgile is an agile system of project and team management. In the OpenAgile system, the Learning Circle \"is a simple and practical model of effective learning\". The Learning Circle was adapted by Garry Bertieg from a development model in the \"Building Momentum\" document issued by the Baha'i World Center around 2003. The Learning Circle is one of OpenAgile's three foundations, alongside Truthfulness and Consultative Decision-making.\n\nThis model describes learning as a series of four steps, four capacities for us to develop, and the pivotal importance of Guidance.\n\nThe four steps in the Learning Circle are Reflection, Learning, Planning, and Action, and are followed one after another, over and over. It is possible to begin an endeavour with any of the four steps. The diagram below shows the Learning Circle Model:\n\n\nEach of the four capacities in the Learning Circle are prerequisites for taking the next step. At the same time, as we exercise these capacities through the use of the Learning Circle, we develop these capacities within ourselves, in our teams and in our organizations. Our inner conditions and capabilities have an effect on our environment which in turn then has an effect on us. By going through the Learning Circle, we use and develop these four capacities:\n\nGuidance is the act of assisting an individual, team, or organization to reach a destination by accompanying, giving directions, or supplying with them advice. Guidance plays a pivotal role in developing our capacity and can be applied to all four steps and all four capacities. For individuals, teams, and organizations, Guidance is critical to be able to progress in the development of knowledge, skills or capacities. Guidance can come from within - a team member who has expertise can share it with the other team members. And Guidance can come from outside - we can bring experts into the organization, we can read books or web sites. Inspiration can also be thought of as a form of Guidance, for example a team member suddenly has a bright idea. Being open to receiving Guidance ensures that the Learning Circle is both organic and disciplined.\n\nIn this model, Learning circles are described as a structure or distributed leadership in collaborative learning contexts Riel, 2010 \"A learning circle is a highly interactive, participatory structure for organizing group work. The goal is to build, share, and express knowledge though a process of open dialogue and deep reflection around issues or problems with a focus on a shared outcome.\" This model is described by a (1) set of defining dimensions, (2) norms that support the interaction; and (3) the phase structure that guides the process. Many of these features also describe learning circles in face to face settings. \n\n\n\nMore details on any of these dimensions can be found in the description of the <rev> learning circle model </rev>\n\n"}

{"id": "3535359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3535359", "title": "Modernising Medical Careers", "text": "Modernising Medical Careers\n\nModernising Medical Careers (MMC) is a programme for postgraduate medical training introduced in the United Kingdom in 2005. The programme replaced the traditional grades of medical career before the level of Consultant. The different stages of the programme contribute towards a \"Certificate of Completion of Training\" (CCT). It has been dogged by criticism within and outside the medical profession, and an independent review of MMC led by Professor Sir John Tooke criticised many aspects of it.\n\nMMC refers to both the programme itself, and also to the temporary organization, formed in 2003, responsible for its nationwide implementation.\n\nFrom 2005 new medical graduates embarked on a two-year Foundation Programme in place of the former one-year Pre-registration house officer (PRHO) term and the first year of the former Senior house officer (SHO) term, with the older titles nominally replaced by \"Foundation House Officer 1\" or F1 and \"Foundation House Officer 2\" or F2. In keeping with the previous system, new graduates are only provisionally registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) during the first year, with full registration taking place following successful completion of the first year of postgraduate training. At this point doctors move straight into the F2 year in most, but not all, foundation schools, without having to apply again. Under the previous system, doctors applied for SHO jobs within six to eight months of beginning work as a PRHO.\n\nThe Foundation Programme consists of two years training split into rotations of three or four months in different specialties. The programme features continuing assessments, and the introduction of a national curriculum intended to nationalise and standardise medical training. As part of this junior doctors are required to maintain a \"learning portfolio\". Despite these notional benefits, 69% of doctors surveyed felt F2 was not an improvement on the first-year SHO experience it replaced, with experiences of the programme \"very variable\".\n\nThe next stage of training is the Specialty Registrar (StR). This is a unification of the previous training grades of SHO (except for year 1) and the old SpR grade. The duration of StR training varies by specialty, but as with the Foundation years, all programmes have a standardised curriculum and assessment model that is approved by the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board. In 2007 appointments were made centrally, but following the disastrous outcomes of that system, whereby some 14,000 junior doctors were left without jobs, many specialties have appointed registrars locally since 2008.\n\nThis meant that doctors are required under the new system to choose a specialty midway through F2, after just one-and-a-half years of practice. Under the old system, doctors had the flexibility to try a variety of different jobs before deciding what to specialise in, and this allowed them to build a broader base for their ultimate specialism. This change ran entirely against existing and subsequent evidence that junior doctors do not know immediately what specialism they wish to pursue, with fewer than a third thinking they knew after F1 and with many forced to decide on a specialism without having had any opportunity to practice it. In keeping with these data, 66% of doctors surveyed felt Foundation Training had not had a positive effect on clinical service delivery.\n\nOn completion of these training programmes, trainees will be awarded a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) and will be entitled to enter the Specialist Register or the General Practitioner (GP) Register as appropriate.\n\nAnother principle of MMC has been that doctors from Foundation level and upwards undergo regular assessment of their skills and activities while in practice. This would commence for Foundation level in August 2005, with the new intake of Foundation trainees. After spending extensively on a management consultant to advise on how to go about this, MMC failed to resolve how this would be implemented and handed the decision at the last moment in July 2005 to the deaneries. In the few weeks they were given to organize the assessment for their own trainees, thirteen deaneries and the small cohort of naval medical trainees opted to use Healthcare Assessment and Training (HcAT), based at Sheffield Children's Hospital. A smaller number of deaneries opted to use the NHS eportfolio, based in NHS Scotland.\n\nMMC was intended to \"improve patient care by improving medical education with a transparent and efficient career path for doctors\". This followed the publication of the NHS Plan 2000, which committed to increase the number of consultants in the NHS and to \"modernise the Senior House Officer (SHO) grade\".\n\nWhile these principles received broad support, their implementation has not, largely because the Department of Health has achieved an increase in the number of consultants by reducing the length of training required to reach the grade from an average of 21,000 to just 6,000 hours. This has led to accusations in the press, from regional medical selection committees, and from Remedy UK that it has been a \"dumbing-down\" process.\n\nIn keeping with this accusation, just 1% of doctors surveyed in the Tooke Report felt that run-through training would have a positive effect on clinical service delivery, and 58% believed patients would not benefit from MMC.\n\nIn 2007 appointment to this level of training was facilitated using the Medical Training Application Service. Due to several system failures and political pressure, this was abandoned partway during the process. In 2008, following significant pressure from junior doctors, the MMC Programme Board for England came to an agreement to revert to a local application process determined by deaneries and specialties. Agreement was made that no further attempts would be made to introduce new selection methodologies without piloting, academic evaluation and professional buy-in.\n\nConcerns have been expressed by Remedy UK, in the Lancet, and by the British Medical Association, among others that the reforms have not been fully thought through, may worsen the training situation for many junior doctors, and may be part of a covert plan to create \"a permanent subclass\" of cheap, undertrained subspecialists.\n\nA number of criticisms have been made about the new MMC system, and it was perceived sufficiently poorly within the medical profession that its implementation was ultimately boycotted by senior doctors around the country.\n\nThe transition to the new system and the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) have been particularly criticised. In order to implement MMC, all trainees not appointed to specialist registrar posts for 1 August 2007 were required to apply for posts on the new MMC curriculum, with far fewer posts than applicants. However, the application process has had technical problems, and was criticised over the weighting and marking of the applications, with one London training school calling it \"unfair and ineffective\" in resigning from the process.\n\nThere were also concerns expressed over the number of training posts available and the subsequent risk that trained doctors would be forced to emigrate or leave the profession as they would be unable to find jobs in the UK. Government claims that there were 23,000 posts for 32,000 applicants were revealed by subsequent work to be 4,500 out, with the actual number appearing to be 18,500.\n\nOn 17 March 2007 doctors marched in mass protest orchestrated by Remedy UK against the system in London and Glasgow.\n\nOn 30 March 2007, Professor Alan Crockard resigned as national director of Modernising Medical Careers. In his letter of resignation to Prof Sir Liam Donaldson the chief medical officer for England, Professor Crockard stated that he was increasingly aware that he had \"responsibility, but less and less authority\" and that \"the overriding message coming back from the profession is that it has lost confidence in the current recruitment system\". Professor Crockard asked that this be urgently addressed \"in the interest of the most important people in the whole process, the junior doctors\".\n\nOn 31 March 2007, Alex Liakos, one of the student advisers to MMC, also resigned, citing widespread misgivings about MMC as a whole and \"tokenistic\" involvement of doctors in the process.\n\nOn 5 April 2007 Professor Shelley Heard resigned as MMC National Clinical Advisor, expressing her support for MMC in principle but citing the major problems with the recruitment process and concerns over the conclusions of the Department of Health's Review Group.\n\nThe MTAS affair was swiftly followed by a purge of the remaining members of MMC, and by mid or late 2007 all of the senior members of MMC had been replaced, effectively forming a new organization.\n\nThe Department of Health launched a full review of the recruitment process for specialty training on 9 March 2007. On 22 March 2007 the Review Group issued a statement building on the recommendations they had made and guaranteeing interviews to all long-listable applicants. These recommendations were not found acceptable by the British Medical Association's junior doctors committee and they pulled out from the negotiations with the government on 23 March.\n\nOn 3 April 2007, during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt apologised to junior doctors over the crisis, saying that the application scheme had caused \"needless anxiety and distress\". The BMA welcomed the government's acknowledgement of the problem but stated that \"an apology isn't enough\". Patricia Hewitt's apology was repeated to parliament on 16 April 2007, in which she stated that \"the problems that have arisen relate in the main to the implementation process and not to the underlying principles of Modernising Medical Careers.\". This was later disputed in the independent inquiry into MMC by Sir John Tooke.\n\nLater that month Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley accused Ms Hewitt of failing to express genuine regret over the situation.\n\nOn 1 May 2007 Ms Hewitt made another apology in the House of Commons after the suspension of the MTAS website due to security breaches that she described as \"utterly deplorable\".\n\nThe MTAS website was suspended on 26 April 2007 after a Channel 4 News report stated that applicants had been able to see each other's files by changing two digits in the personalised web address given to each individual. At that point the Department of Health announced that this was a temporary suspension.\n\nOn 15 May 2007 MTAS was shelved by ministers due to security breaches. Patricia Hewitt said that after the first round of recruitment, the system would only fulfil a monitoring role that year.\n\nA judicial review of MTAS was requested by pressure group Remedy UK, who demanded that the appointments process should be scrapped altogether. The case was heard in the High Court from 16 to 17 May 2007. On Wednesday 23 May 2007 Mr Justice Goldring ruled against Remedy UK, stating that \"although far from ideal\", the Review Group's decision on amending the appointments process after the first round of interviews was \"within the range of reasonable responses\", and that the Review Group was \"entitled to reach the decision it did given the circumstances facing it at the time\". Although he ruled against invalidating the interviews that had already taken place, Mr Justice Goldring added that this judgement did not imply that junior doctors were not entitled to feel aggrieved, as \"the premature introduction of MTAS has had disastrous consequences\". Remedy UK have said they will not appeal the verdict, in order to avoid further uncertainty for junior doctors.\n\nFor the 2008 specialty recruitment, deaneries and Royal Colleges were asked to arrange the recruitment for all specialities themselves, with particular deaneries or Colleges handling national recruitment for particular disciplines. Although the intention was to have a new version of MTAS operations for the 2009 recruitment process, again this is being handed over the colleges and deaneries.\n\nObliging doctors to adhere to the European Working Time Directive has had an effect on patient care and on medical training with the Royal College of Surgeons of England reviewing research in 2009 and finding that there were not enough surgeons to fill rotas if they worked only 48 hours a week. They further noted that 90% trainees were exceeding their rostered hours on a weekly basis, 85% reported coming in to do operations on their days off, only 25% felt the working patterns held by their human resources departments accurately reflected their actual working hours, and 55% reported being pressured to falsely declare their actual hours worked. More than two thirds felt the quality of their training and operative skills had deteriorated as a result of shift-working patterns brought in to meet working time regulations, and 71% felt the reduction in working hours had not led to any improvement in their work/life balance.\n\nThe Association of Surgeons in Training have stated that they believe 65 hours a week is required to gain the necessary training opportunities, and that 80% of respondents to a survey they ran would support an opt-out of the European Working Time Regulation (EWTR) to protect training.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9389420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9389420", "title": "ProLiteracy", "text": "ProLiteracy\n\nProLiteracy, also known as ProLiteracy Worldwide, is an international nonprofit organization based in Syracuse, N.Y., that supports programs that help adults learn to read and write. It is the largest adult literacy and basic education membership organization in the United States. ProLiteracy has over 800 member programs in the U.S. and is active in 20 developing countries.\n\nProLiteracy was formed when Laubach Literacy International and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. merged in 2002.\n\nLaubach Literacy International’s history began in 1930, when Dr. Frank C. Laubach was a missionary among the Maranao people of the Philippines. His concern about their poor living conditions led him to conclude that the ability to read and write was essential for them to begin to solve their problems. As the Maranaos learned to read, they would, in turn, teach other adults on a one-to-one basis that became known as “Each One Teach One.” From 1935 to 1967, Dr. Laubach visited 105 countries answering calls for literacy help and created reading lessons in 315 languages. He founded Laubach Literacy International in Syracuse, N.Y. in 1955.\n\nFor years, literacy as a global mission interested Ruth Johnson Colvin. She had heard Dr. Laubach speak about illiteracy in faraway countries, but she didn’t consider it a problem in America. So she was shocked when she read a 1961 Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper article that stated there were over 11,000 people in her county who could not read or write well (based on 1960 U.S. Census figures). She began speaking with local social service agencies, community leaders, and church groups about the problem. With the help of reading experts, she developed a means to train volunteers to tutor adults. In 1962, she started Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc.\n\nProLiteracy believes every adult has a right to literacy. ProLiteracy develops and promotes adult literacy learning, content, programs and advocacy to help adult learners.\n\nProLiteracy’s Programs division works in the U.S. and around the world. ProLiteracy has grassroots partner programs in developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. ProLiteracy provides training, technical assistance, and targeted local grants to support tailored programs that combine literacy with economic self-reliance, health, education, peace, human rights, and environmental sustainability projects.\n\nIn the U.S., ProLiteracy represents over 800 community-based volunteer and adult basic education affiliates in 49 states and the District of Columbia. ProLiteracy accredits programs and supports them with technical assistance and program and professional development services online, in regional trainings, and at a biennial conference. ProLiteracy also serves as an advocate for issues related to adult literacy and lifelong learning.\n\nNew Readers Press, ProLiteracy’s publishing house, generates $7 million in revenue annually through the sale of materials used in teaching adults and older teens. Proceeds from these sales support the services that ProLiteracy offers to literacy practitioners. News for You, published by New Readers Press, is a weekly online and print news source for English language learners and basic literacy students.\n\nThe National Book Fund (NBF) gives grants of New Readers Press books and materials directly to local literacy service providers. The NBF provides books for family literacy programs that work with parents and children, English-as-a-second-language (ESL) programs, adult basic education initiatives, and women-focused programming.\n\nProLiteracy began its Women In Literacy (WIL) initiative in 1991 in response to the particular needs of women. Cultural traditions and local laws often favor men, allowing them access to education, property, employment, health care, and participation in government that is denied to women. ProLiteracy's Women in Literacy initiative gives women the literacy skills they need to understand and change their daily lives. Women hold key leadership positions in more than 80 percent of WIL partner programs.\n\nAbout 60 percent of ProLiteracy’s funding comes from sales of its educational materials. About 35 percent comes from private sources, including individuals, corporations, and foundations. The remainder comes from affiliate dues and investment income.\n\nIn 2011, more than 81 percent of donor contributions were allocated to program expenses.\n\nA 2017 report by the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance (WGA) found that ProLiteracy met all of its standards for charity accountability. The WGA found that ProLiteracy is truthful in its representations of how money is spent, does not allocate an excessive part of its budget for fundraising or administrative expenses, and makes its financial statements readily available to the public.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, under then-President and CEO David C. Harvey, ProLiteracy faced severe financial issues, with a $1.8 million shortfall and a $1.7 million loss in net assets in 2012. Moving their headquarters to a revitalized warehouse and investing in the local Syracuse, NY community were contributing factors in the shortfall, including its newly-opened Ruth J. Colvin Center for Innovation and Excellence in Adult Literacy, a public computer lab designed to teach adults computer literacy. \n\nSix months after the move to ProLiteracy's new headquarters, Harvey resigned as President and CEO. Kevin J. Morgan, Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2009, stated that Harvey \"went on to pursue other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area, and let's leave it at that\". Despite likely being a significant contributing factor to the financial mismanagement leading to the crisis, Harvey himself purported to have \"Led a turn-around operation for a $9 million international organization\" during said pursuit of \"other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area\". Harvey has been the Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors since 2016.\n\nMorgan, who received his graduate degree in marketing from DeVry University, was appointed Interim President and CEO, dividing his time between ProLiteracy and Full Suspension Marketing, a small, Utah-based startup and marketing agency he founded in 2007. The ProLiteracy Board of Directors then \"formed a search committee for a new president and CEO,\" said Morgan, concluding that \"sometimes it happens quickly, other times it may take some time, depending on who you talk to\".\n\nDespite raising over $1 million in charitable donations to refurbish ProLiteracy's new headquarters in the midst of the crisis, it faced yet another shortfall of $1.2 million in 2013, receiving a 1-star rating on Charity Navigator following nearly a decade of fluctuating between 1- and 2-stars, prompting Harvey's 2010 public criticism of the charity watchdog as an \"imperfect way to assess\" . \n\nDuring the following fiscal year, ProLiteracy downsized considerably, laying off the majority of its full-time staff and shutting down budding investments into the local Syracuse, NY community. Furthermore, ProLiteracy significantly reduced its international involvement from 30 to 20 countries. In effect, ProLiteracy ended its 2014 fiscal year with $3 million in revenues less expenses and nearly double their net assets, from $3.3 to $6.3 million. The search committee dissolved, as did Morgan's marketing agency, and he remains President and CEO to this day. In 2017, ProLiteracy was awarded its first 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, a composite of a 3-star rating in financial health and 4-star rating in accountability and transparency.\n\nOrganizational Links\n\nReports by Charity-monitoring Organizations\n"}

He attended the City of London School and then Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took the classical tripos and then historical tripos.\n\nHe spent two years at Nottingham High School for Boys. Later he joined the Board of Education in 1911 as a school inspector and later became Principal Private Secretary to the President of the Board of Education, Lord Eustace Percy. He continued in the Civil Service rising through the ranks.and remained in London during the Second World War. Part of his key work was incorporated into the 1944 Education Act working closely with R A Butler who introduced the Act in August 1944. He also developed an initiative that produced 35,000 additional teachers between 1945 and 1951, regarded as a considerable achievement.\n\nBy the 1944 act the Board of Education became the Ministry of Education. It was expected that Wood would become permanent secretary, but this did not happen probably due to objections from Ellen Wilkinson, the Labour minister of education. Wood then left the ministry in 1946 succeeding Kenneth Vickers as Principal of Southampton University College. He led the University College to full university status in 1952, becoming its first Vice Chancellor.\n\nAcquisition of new buildings and equipment was a priority made difficult by considerable damage to the port of Southampton during the war. Halls of residence were provided for students and by 1952 student numbers had almost doubled. An institute of education was also established. He worked closely with Lillian Penson, Vice-Chancellor of London University, which awarded external degrees to Southampton students at the time. Wood retired as vice-chancellor but due to age at the end of the 1952 session.\n\nIn 1922 he married Iris Cecilie and they had a daughter. \n\nHe was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1939, and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1941.

In 1655 his parents returned to Great Britain and settled in Edinburgh, where Samuel was educated, matriculating in 1659 in the university. In 1662 his parents removed to Rolvenden in Kent. Next year Samuel became an assistant-master in the Cranbrook free school. He was in holy orders, but never held any benefice. Hoadly established a private school at Westerham in 1671, whence in 1678 he removed to Tottenham High Cross. In 1686 he removed to Brook House, Hackney. He was appointed in 1700 head-master of Norwich School, an appointment which he held till his death on 17 April 1705. He was twice married; first in 1666 to Mary Wood, who died in childbirth in 1668; secondly, in 1669, to Martha, daughter of a priest called Pickering.

He had some correspondence with Grævius, in which occur notices of Bentley's projected edition of ‘Hesychius’ and of the controversy upon the Phalaris question. It was probably owing to the recommendation of Grævius that several young foreign scholars became boarders in Hoadly's house in order to learn English.\n"}

{"id": "4331915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4331915", "title": "Substitute teacher", "text": "Substitute teacher\n\nA substitute teacher is a person who teaches a school class when the regular teacher is unavailable; e.g., because of illness, personal leave, or other reasons. \"Substitute teacher\" (usually abbreviated as \"sub\") is the most commonly used phrase in the United States, Canada, India and Ireland, while supply teacher is the most commonly used term in Great Britain and the Canadian province of Ontario. Common synonyms for substitute teacher include relief teacher or casual teacher (used in Australia and New Zealand) and \"emergency teacher\" (used in some parts of the United States). Other terms, such as \"guest teacher\", are also used by some schools or districts. Regional variants in terminology are common, such as the use of the term teacher on call (T.O.C.) in the Canadian province of British Columbia and occasional in Ontario.\n\nSubstitute teachers find jobs by first completing the application and interview process from their local school district. Once approved, they will either be enrolled in an automated calling system or more currently, via a system that uses the internet to post available substitute teaching assignments. Substitutes can also find work by contacting private schools in their district. Most substitute teachers in the U.S. can be assigned to work in all academic subject areas as needed (except for long-term substituting assignments). The substitute is generally responsible for closely following and continuing with the lesson plans left by the teacher, and to maintain student order and productivity. As with locum tenens physicians, the idea is that continuity exists between the work done by the substitute and that done by the other professional. Substitutes work with the same students as the regular teacher does. Substitute teachers can often work in multiple schools within one district, as well as for multiple school districts.\n\nIn some regions, the qualifications for substitute teaching may not be as strict as those for a regular teacher. Most areas require a college degree, and some the successful completion of competency tests; others require only that the applicant possess a high school diploma or its equivalent; full teaching qualifications are required for long-term assignments. Long-term substitutes, who may be assigned to a class for up to an entire semester, generally require full teaching qualifications in the subject area of the class to be taught. Some school administrators may not hire full-time teachers unless they have had substitute teaching experience.\n\nIn 2015, the National Substitute Teachers Alliance estimated the national average pay for a substitute teacher in the United States as US$105 per day with a range of US$20 (although $3.08 per hour would be below minimum wage in any state) to US$190, although most districts pay well below $100 per day. In Connecticut, for example, the typical rate in a city/town district is about $80 per day (or $11.43 per hour). A few state schools pay as much as $150 per day. The Alliance also reported substantial variation in benefits with substitute teachers in some locales receiving no benefits while others receive sick time, retirement, or other benefits especially in areas where substitute teachers have a union. The comparatively lower wages for the employees of school districts is often credited to the shorter work day (6.22-7.17 hours). The length of time spent each day at other jobs is roughly 15 percent longer.\nIn Australia, the rate can vary between states and between sectors. Casual Relief Teachers must be fully qualified teachers. In the state of Victoria, relief teachers in the government sector earn $359.21 per day (as of 1st October 2018) and teachers in a Catholic school can earn $41 per hour or $246 per day, whereas in the New South Wales public school system, teachers can earn between $239 and $327 per day depending on experience.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, substitute teachers in secondary schools are paid a rate of €46.85 per hour for qualified teachers and €40.85 for unqualified teachers. In primary schools qualified teachers are paid at a rate of €164.26 per day.\n\nIn Canada, substitute teachers are fully certified teachers, and are paid regular salary when employed as long-term occasionals (LTO), or paid a daily rate of about $240 to $300 per day.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, supply teachers employed by a local education authority or school directly must be paid a daily rate of 1/195 of the annual salary to which they would be entitled were they employed in the position on a full-time basis. Teachers employed through agencies are not subject to this rule, unless they have been working for the same hiring institution for more than 12 weeks, but nevertheless daily rates are generally around UK£100–125.\n\nThe United States observes a \"Substitute Educator's Day\", which was instituted by the National Education Association (NEA). The purpose of this day is to highlight the role and importance of the substitute teacher by providing information about, advocating for, and helping to increase appreciation and respect for this unique professional. This day also focuses on the needs of substitutes, which include better wages and health benefits and continual professional development. Substitute Educator's Day is observed by some on the 3rd Friday of November during American Education Week. Other countries and jurisdictions have similar observances.\n\nNational Substitute Teacher Appreciation Week, or SubWeek, is also observed by some districts in the US and is held the first full week in May.\n\n"}

{"id": "1077017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1077017", "title": "Viola Spolin", "text": "Viola Spolin\n\nViola Spolin (November 7, 1906 — November 22, 1994) was a theatre academic, educator and acting coach. She is considered an important innovator in 20th century American theater for creating directorial techniques to help actors to be focused in the present moment and to find choices improvisationally, as if in real life. These acting exercises she later called Theater Games and formed the first body of work that enabled other directors and actors to create improvisational theater. Her book \"Improvisation for the Theater\", which published these techniques, includes her philosophy and her teaching and coaching methods, and is considered the \"bible of improvisational theater\". Spolin's contributions were seminal to the improvisational theater movement in the U.S. She is considered to be the mother of Improvisational theater. Her work has influenced American theater, television and film by providing new tools and techniques that are now used by actors, directors and writers.\n\nSpolin influenced the first generation of improvisational actors at the Second City in Chicago in the mid- to late 1950s, through her son, Paul Sills. He was the founding director of the Compass Players which led to the formation of the Second City. He used her techniques in the training and direction of the company, which enabled them to create satirical improvisational theater about current social & political issues. Spolin also taught workshops for Second City actors, as well as for the general public. Paul Sills and the success of the Second City were largely responsible for the popularization of improvisational theater, which became best known as a comedy form called \"improv.\" Many actors, writers and directors, grew out of that school of theater and had formative experiences performing and being trained at the Second City. See below for a list of notable theater, television and film professionals who were influenced by Spolin and Sills.\n\nSpolin developed acting exercises or \"games\" that unleashed creativity, adapting focused \"play\" to unlock the individual's capacity for creative self-expression. Viola Spolin's use of recreational games in theater came from her background with the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression where she studied with Neva Boyd starting in 1924. Spolin also taught classes at Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago.\n\nShe authored a number of texts on improvisation. Her first and most famous was \"Improvisation for the Theater\", published by Northwestern University Press. This book has become a classic resource for improvisational actors, directors and teachers. It has been published in three editions in 1963, 1983 and 1999.\n\nViola Spolin initially trained to be a settlement worker (from 1924–1927), studying at Neva Boyd's Group Work School in Chicago. Boyd's innovative teaching in the areas of group leadership, recreation, and social group work strongly influenced Spolin, as did the use of traditional game structures to affect social behavior in inner-city and immigrant children. While serving as drama supervisor for the Chicago branch of the Works Progress Administration's Recreational Project (1939–1941), Spolin perceived a need to create within the WPA drama program an easily grasped system of theater training that could cross the cultural and ethnic barriers of the immigrant children with whom she worked.\n\nAccording to Spolin, Boyd's teachings provided \"an extraordinary training in the use of games, story-telling, folk dance and dramatics as tools for stimulating creative expression in both children and adults, through self discovery and personal experiencing.\" Building upon the experience of Boyd's work, she responded by developing new games that focused on individual creativity, adapting and focusing the concept of play to unlock the individual's capacity for creative self-expression. These techniques were later to be formalized under the rubric \"Theater Games\".\n\nSpolin acknowledged she was influenced by J.L. Moreno, originator of the therapeutic techniques known as psychodrama and sociodrama. Spolin's exercises had a therapeutic impact on players. She drew on Moreno's idea of using audience suggestions as the base of an improvisation, which became a hallmark of the Second City's brand of improv and is now universally employed in workshop and performance. She strongly emphasized the need for the individual to overcome what she called \"The Approval/Disapproval Syndrome,\" which she describe as the performer blocking their own natural creativity in an effort to please the audience, director, teacher, peers or anyone else.\n\nIn 1946, Spolin founded the Young Actors Company in Hollywood. Children six years of age and older were trained, through the medium of the still developing Theater Games system, to perform in productions. This company continued until 1955. Spolin returned to Chicago in 1955 to direct for the Playwright's Theater Club and, subsequently, to conduct games workshops with the Compass Players, the country's first professional improvisational acting company. The Compass Players made theater history in America. It began in the backroom of a bar near the University of Chicago campus in the summer of 1955 and out of this group was born a new form: improvisational theater. They are said to have created a radically new kind of comedy. \"They did not plan to be funny or to change the course of comedy\", writes Janet Coleman. \"But that is what happened.\"\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, still in Chicago, she worked with her son Paul Sills as workshop director for the Second City Company and continued to teach and develop Theater Games theory and practice. As an outgrowth of this work, she published \"Improvisation for the Theater\", consisting of approximately 220 games and exercises. It has become a classic reference text for teachers of acting, as well as for educators in other fields.\n\nIn the early-1960s Viola Spolin took on an assistant and protégé, Josephine Forsberg, to help with her workshops at the Second City, as well as with her children's theatre that performed there on weekends. Viola Spolin eventually handed both the children's show and the improv classes over to Forsberg, who continued teaching Spolin's work at the Second City from the mid-1960s on, leading to the creation of Forsberg's own improv school, Players Workshop in 1971, as well as the Improv Olympic and the Second City Training Center in the 1980s, all of which were based on Spolin's work.\n\nIn 1965, with Sills and others, Spolin co-founded the Game Theater in Chicago, and around the same time organized a small cooperative elementary school (called Playroom School and later Parents School) with Sills and other families in the Chicago area. The theater and the school's classes sought to have audiences participate directly in Theater Games, thus effectively eliminating the conventional separation between improvisational actors and audiences. The theater experiment achieved limited success, and it closed after only a few months, but the school continued to use the techniques, alongside a regular elementary curriculum, well into the 1970s.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971 Spolin served as special consultant for productions of Sills' Story Theater in Los Angeles, New York City and on television. On the West Coast, she conducted workshops for the casts of the television shows, \"Rhoda\" and \"Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers\", and appeared on film as an actress in Paul Mazursky's \"Alex in Wonderland\" (1970).\nIn November 1975, \"The Theater Game File\" was published. She designed it to make her unique approaches to teaching and learning more readily available to classroom teachers. In 1976, she established the Spolin Theater Game Center in Hollywood, to train professional Theater Games Coaches and served as its artistic director. In 1979 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Eastern Michigan University, and until the 1990s she continued to teach at the Theater Game Center. In 1985 her new book, \"Theater Games for Rehearsal: A Director's Handbook\", was published.\n\nSpolin's Theater Games transform the teaching of acting skills and techniques into exercises that are in game forms. Each Theater Game is structured to give the players a specific focus or technical problem to keep in mind during the game, like keeping your eye on the ball in a ball game. These simple, operational structures teach complicated theater conventions and techniques. By playing the game the players learn the skill, keeping their attention on the focus of the game, rather than falling into self-consciousness or trying to think up good ideas, from an intellectual source. The intention of giving the actor something on which to focus is to help them to be in the present moment, like a mantra in meditation. In this playful, active state the player gets flashes of intuitive, inspired choices that come spontaneously. The focus of the game keeps the mind busy in the moment of creating or playing, rather than being in the mind pre-planning, comparing or judging their choices in the improvisation. The exercises are, as one critic has written, \"structures designed to almost fool spontaneity into being.\"\n\nSpolin believed that every person can learn to act and express creatively. In the beginning of her book \"Improvisation for the Theater\", she wrote:\nEveryone can act. Everyone can improvise. Anyone who wishes to can play in the theater and learn to become 'stage-worthy.'\n\nWe learn through experience and experiencing, and no one teaches anyone anything. This is as true for the infant moving from kicking and crawling to walking as it is for the scientist with his equations.\n\nIf the environment permits it, anyone can learn whatever he chooses to learn; and if the individual permits it, the environment will teach him everything it has to teach. 'Talent' or 'lack of talent' have little to do with it.\n\nViola Spolin began working with children early in her career. Aside from her work with The Parent's School, Spolin used her Theatre Games as a way to help develop creative confidence in troubled kids as well as for child actors and kids who just wanted to have fun improvising. Spolin was associated for many years with the Jane Adam's Hull House as well as other locations where she and her assistant teachers taught improv workshops to children.\n\nSpolin also directed numerous shows for children, including a production at Playwights in the mid-1950s. Soon after the Second City opened its doors in 1959, Spolin started putting up shows for children on the weekends. During Spolin children's shows the kids in the audience were invited up onto the stage to play Theatre Games with the cast. In the mid-1960s, Spolin handed the children's show (along with her improv classes) over to her protégé and assistant, Josephine Forsberg, who renamed it \"The Children's Theatre of the Second City\" and continued to produce and direct it until 1997, using Viola Spolin's audience participation improv games after every performance.\n\n\n"}
