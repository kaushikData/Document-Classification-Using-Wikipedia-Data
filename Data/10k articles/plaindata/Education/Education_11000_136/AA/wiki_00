Dorenfeld, known as Doren, was born in Chicago, July 29, 1935, to Hy and Rose Dorenfeld. He grew up on the west side of Chicago, attending Howland Elementary School and Farragut High School (now Farragut Career Academy) (per classmate and friend Howard N. Allen, M.D.). An encounter with a Graflex camera while working on the high school newspaper (\"The Scroll\") led to a dedicated life in photography. After joining the Navy in 1953, he was stationed at San Diego, CA and worked as a submariner running missions to Acapulco. \"News with Views\" was the name of the Navy newsletter which published his photographs.\n\nA turning point occurred when he enrolled at Rochester Institute of Technology in 1957 where his philosophy and purpose in life were clarified by Minor White, one of the legendary professors. It was the deeply spiritual nature of Minor White along with his knowledge of poetry and Eastern philosophy that affected Doren. Minor put an emphasis on \"feeling\" as a way of knowing and realizing a multitude of meanings. A quote by Peter Layton describes Minor's teaching. \" He created an atmosphere for constantly questioning ideas or responses.\" With discipline, practice and sincerity, the students of Minor White often achieved a visual, sensual and personal awareness. It was under Minor's influence that Doren began to photograph \"Americana Faces\" which was a documentation of the land and its people from 1960-2003. He photographed throughout the USA and returned frequently to the southwest. While working on the \"Americana Faces\", he produced series on Italy, Greece, Scotland and China. Related to Doren's traditional photographs were the experimental works inspired by Minor White and by another influential teacher, Ralph Hattersley.\n\nDuring Doren's NYC years, he worked as a commercial photographer for Alan Vogel, Arnold T. Rosenberg, Irving Penn and Erwin Blumenthal while living in a one-room apartment and frequenting jazz clubs, poetry readings and art openings. Doren wrote extensively about his years in NYC with and without his first wife, Elizabeth Knox, a painter. He committed to several personal projects such as photographing the same NYC street for one hour per day for several years. The NYC street project was partly inspired by his neighbor, Berenice Abbott. Doren's series on the Woodstock Festival resulted in his well-known photograph of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nAfter accepting a teaching position in 1978 at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Doren helped to shape the growing respect for photography as art. He educated thousands of students, participated in numerous exhibitions, operated a photography gallery and gained national and international recognition for his work. Often he introduced himself on the first day of class with \"My name is Doren and photography is my life\". Doren's second wife, Caroline Cornish, 1924–2008, was a noted photographer who possessed organizational skills that provided stability for both of them while allowing Doren extra freedom to pursue a fine arts career.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "363338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363338", "title": "Bologna Process", "text": "Bologna Process\n\nThe Bologna Process is a series of ministerial meetings and agreements between European countries to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher-education qualifications. The process has created the European Higher Education Area under the Lisbon Recognition Convention. It is named after the University of Bologna, where the Bologna declaration was signed by education ministers from 29 European countries in 1999. The process was opened to other countries in the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, and governmental meetings have been held in Prague (2001), Berlin (2003), Bergen (2005), London (2007) and Leuven (2009).\n\nBefore the signing of the Bologna declaration, the Magna Charta Universitatum was issued at a meeting of university rectors celebrating the 900th anniversary of the University of Bologna (and European universities) in 1988. One year before the declaration, education ministers Claude Allegre (France), Jürgen Rüttgers (Germany), Luigi Berlinguer (Italy) and Baroness Blackstone (UK) signed the Sorbonne declaration in Paris in 1998, committing themselves to \"harmonising the architecture of the European Higher Education system\". The Bologna Process has 48 participating countries.\n\nSignatories of the Bologna Accord, members of the European Higher Education Area, are:\n\nAll member states of the EU are participating in the process, with the European Commission also a signatory. Monaco and San Marino are the only members of the Council of Europe which did not adopt the process.\n\nThe ESU, EUA, EURASHE, EI, ENQA, UNICE, the Council of Europe and UNESCO are part of the process' follow-up. Other groups at this level are ENIC, NARIC and EURODOC.\n\nFour countries are not members of the process. Although Kyrgyzstan ratified the Lisbon Recognition Convention in 2004, it is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe and there are no known plans to expand the convention's geographical scope.\n\nIsrael is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, although it has observer status. Although Israel is not geographically part of Europe, it is part of the UNESCO European Region. Israel is also a signatory of the Lisbon Recognition Convention but, under the criteria of the Berlin Communiqué, ineligible for the Bologna Process.\n\nKosovo is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe. Although Serbia is a party, Kosovo declared independence from it and is theoretically a part of the Bologna Process since the 1999 war. It was suggested that Kosovo could be associated with the process in a category appropriate to its situation, such as guest or special-observer status.\n\nThe basic framework is three cycles of higher-education qualifications. The framework adopted by the ministers at their meeting in Bergen in 2005 defines the qualifications in terms of learning outcomes: statements of what students know and can do on completing their degrees. In describing the cycles, the framework uses the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS):\n\n\nIn most cases, it would take three to four years to earn a bachelor's degree and another one or two years for a master's degree. Doctoral degrees usually require another two to four years of specialization, primarily individual research under a mentor. Degree names may vary by country. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS credits, equivalent to 1,500–1,800 hours of study.\n\nAccording to Chris Lorenz of the VU University Amsterdam,\nLorenz argues that just as the World Trade Organization and GATS propose educational reforms that would, in his view, erode all effective forms of democratic political control over higher education, so \"it is obvious that the economic view on higher education recently developed and formulated by the EU Declarations is similar to and compatible with the view developed by the WTO and by GATS.\"\n\nIn 2011, Slavoj Žižek called the process \"an attack on \" and \"the end of intellectual life as we know it\".\n\nThe process, an intergovernmental agreement between EU and non-EU countries, does not have the status of EU legislation. Since the Bologna Declaration is not a treaty or convention, there are no legal obligations for the signatory states; participation and cooperation are voluntary.\n\nAlthough the declaration was created without a formal affiliation with EU institutions, the European Commission (which has supported European projects such as the Tuning and TEEP projects) plays an important role in implementing the process. Most countries do not fit the framework, using their traditional systems. The process, which will result in bilateral agreements between countries and institutions which recognise each other's degrees, is moving from strict convergence in time spent on qualifications towards a competency-based system which will have an undergraduate and postgraduate division (with a bachelor's degree in the former and a master's and doctorate in the latter).\n\nIn mainland Europe, five-year-plus first degrees are common. Many do not complete their studies, and many countries are introducing bachelor-level qualifications. The situation is evolving as the Bologna Process is implemented.\n\nSome countries introduced the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and discussed their degree structures, qualifications, financing and management of higher education and mobility programmes. At the institutional level, the reform involved higher-education institutions, their faculties or departments, student and staff representatives and other factors. Priorities varied by country and institution.\n\nIn Andorra, degrees are awarded by the state in all three cycles (bachelor's, master's and doctoral). The University of Andorra has adapted its classroom studies to the European Higher Education Area in accordance with the Bologna Agreement. The degree workload is counted in European credits, with a European equivalent of 180 credits (three years) for bachelor's degrees and 120 credits (two years) for master's degrees.\n\nAustria's situation is similar to Germany's, with the lowest undergraduate degrees the Magister (FH) and Diplom (FH) (designed to take three or four years). The lowest graduate degrees are Magister and Diplom, which typically fulfill a thesis requirement (including final examination and thesis defence) and can be obtained after four to six years of study. In 2000 many curricula began to be converted into bachelor's degrees (\"Bakkalaureat\"; the term was replaced by \"bachelor's\" in most curricula by 2007) and master's (\"Magisterstudium\") programmes, with nominal durations of six semesters (three years) and three to four semesters (18 months to two years) respectively.\n\nEnrollment in a doctoral programme generally requires a master's degree in a related field. Although the nominal duration of doctoral programmes is two or three years, the time to graduate varies considerably and is generally longer.\n\nBelarus became a member of the European Higher Education Area at a conference in Yerevan, Armenia in May 2015.\n\nIn Croatia, implementation of the Bologna Process began during the 2005–2006 academic year. \nA diploma degree became a baccalaureate (), and the programmes were shortened from four to about three years. \"Magisterij\" became a master's degree, achieved after two additional years of study. The \"doktorat\" degree (PhD, dr.sc.) may be received after three more years (eight years total).\n\nThe typical length of study is three years for a bachelor's degree (\"Baccalaureus\"), two years for a master's (\"magistar\") and three years for a doctor of science (\"doktor znanosti\"). A local distinction is made between vocational and academic degrees at the baccalareate level, and between engineering and other programs at levels below the doctoral.\n\nThere are several exceptions. The first degree in economics still takes four years, and the master's degree is obtained after an additional year at the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Economics and Zagreb School of Economics and Management. The four-plus-one-year system also applies to fine arts and music. Medical and related studies replace the bachelor's degree with six-year first professional degrees and graduate Doctor of Medicine (\"doktor medicine\") degrees.\n\nThe old degrees are translated as follows:\n\nIn May 2008, about 5,000 students protested weak funding, imprecisely defined new rules and the poor results of the Bologna reform.\n\nDenmark introduced the 3+2+3 system in 1971 with an education-management working group of the Society of Danish Engineers and a 1984–85 group of the Federation of Danish Industries, both headed by Hans Bruno Lund. Before the adoption of international standards, the lowest degree normally awarded at universities in Denmark was equivalent to a master's degree (Kandidat/cand.mag). Although bachelor's degrees have been obtained after three years of study, most students continue the additional two years required for a master's degree. Mid-length (two-to four-year) professional degrees have been adapted as professional bachelor's degrees (3½ years).\n\nIn the Finnish pre-Bologna system, higher education was divided between universities and polytechnics. In universities, degrees were divided in most fields into a three-year bachelor's degree (\"kandidaatti\") and a two-year master's degree (\"maisteri\"). In these fields, the Bologna Process resulted in no change.\n\nIn engineering, universities only offered a 5½-year master's program (\"diplomi-insinööri\"). This has been replaced by a three-year bachelor's degree (\"tekniikan kandidaatti\") and a two-year master's degree (\"diplomi-insinööri\"), for which the English names are Bachelor of Science (Technology) and Master of Science (Technology). A corresponding change has been made in military higher education, where the officer's degree was divided between bachelor's and master's programmes. Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences, which have offered bachelor's-equivalent engineering programmes, began offering master's-degree programs in 2005. Some Master of Engineering (\"insinööri (ylempi AMK)\") programmes are taught in English.\n\nOnly medicine and dentistry retain their non-standard degree structure, where the Licentiate (higher than a master's degree, but less extensive than Doctor of Medicine or Dentistry degrees) is the basic degree. A six-year program of at least 360 ECTS credits leads to the Licentiate of Medicine (\"lääketieteen lisensiaatti\") degree. There is an intermediate title (but not an academic degree) of \"lääketieteen kandidaatti\", and no master's degree.\n\nPolytechnic degrees are considered bachelor's degrees in international use. In domestic use, bachelors transferring from polytechnics to universities may be required to amass a maximum of 60 ECTS credits of additional studies before beginning master's-level studies. In conjunction with the Bologna Process, polytechnics have the right to award master's degrees.\n\nIn France the \"baccalauréat\", awarded at the end of secondary education, allows students to enter university. Before the LMD reform which implemented the Bologna Process, it was followed by a two-year \"Diplôme d'études universitaires générales\" (DEUG) and a third-year Licence (the equivalent of a UK bachelor's degree).\n\nStudents could then pursue a Maîtrise, a one-year research degree which could be followed by a one-year vocational degree (the \"Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées\" or DESS) or research degree (the \"Diplôme d'études approfondies\", or DEA).\nThe DEA, preparation for a doctorate, was equivalent to the M. Phil. Students could then pursue a \"doctorat\" (PhD), which took at least three years.\n\nThe DESS was created in 1975 for students who completed four-year degrees. Intended as a doctorate with a more practical approach than research, it included the production of a 120-page paper which was defended to a jury of three international specialists in the field. The mini-thesis was kept in the libraries of the university issuing the DESS, unlike a PhD dissertation (distributed by its author to every French university library).\n\nHigher education in France is also provided by non-university institutions dedicated to specific subjects. The \"Diplôme d'ingénieur\" (engineering diploma) is awarded to students after five years of study in state-recognized \"Écoles d'ingénieurs\", particularly the Grandes Écoles such as Mines, Centrale and ENAC.\n\nAlthough the \"baccalauréat\" and \"doctorat\" are unchanged in the Bologna system (known in France as LMD reform), the DEUG and \"licence\" have been merged into a three-year Licence. The Maîtrise, DESS and DEA have been combined into a two-year master's degree, which can be work- (\"master professionnel\") or research-oriented (\"master recherche\"). The \"Diplôme d'ingénieur\" degree is still separate from a university degree, but holders may legally claim a master's degree as well.\n\nStrikes occurred in 2002 and 2003 and 2007 protesting LMD reform, focusing more on under-funding of French universities since May 1968 than on the Bologna Process. Although the two major student organisations object to some aspects of its application to the French system, they generally welcome the European process.\n\nAlthough Georgia joined the Bologna Process in 2005 at the Bergen summit, steps towards the establishment of the European Higher Education Area were completed earlier. Since the end of the 1990s, many Georgian universities (mostly private) have introduced limited educational programs allowing students to graduate with a bachelor's degree (four years) and earn a master's degree (one to two years) while preserving the old five-to-six-year scheme. During the Soviet era, the only degree was the discontinued Specialist.\n\nCycles of higher education are divided into first (bachelor's degree with 240 credits), second (master's degree, 120 credits) and third (doctorate, 180 credits). Human and veterinary medicine and dentistry (300–360 credits) are integrated programs with a qualification equal to a master's degree.\n\nGreece joined the Bologna Process in 1999. Since 2007, more-intensive steps towards the establishment of the European Higher Education Area were completed.\n\nIn Hungary, the Bologna system applies to those who began their university education in or after September 2006. One hundred eight majors were available for selection (compared with over 400 in 2005), of which six are exempt from the bachelor's-master's division: law, human and veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and architecture.\n\nAccording to an online poll by the National Tertiary Education Information Centre, 65 percent of respondents thought it unnecessary to adopt the system. The new system provides less of a guarantee that students will obtain a master's degree, because many will complete their education after the three-year bachelor's degree. Students are expected to study more unrelated subjects during the first three years, due to the smaller number of majors.\n\nIn Iceland, bachelor's degrees are usually three years in duration; master's degrees are two years, and doctoral degrees range from three to six years.\n\nIn Ireland, bachelor's degrees are commonly three to four years in duration; master's and doctoral degrees are basically similar to those in the UK. Bachelor's degrees are first-cycle qualifications. Except for the MA at the University of Dublin, a master's degree is always a postgraduate degree (teaching or research). The generic outcomes for Irish degrees are laid out in the 2003 National Framework of Qualifications. In 2006, Ireland was the first country to verify the compatibility of its national framework with that of the EHEA.\n\nItaly fits the framework since its 1999 adoption of the 3+2 system. The first degree is the \"Laurea triennale\", which may be obtained after three years of study. Selected students may then complete their studies with two additional years of specialization leading to the \"Laurea Magistrale\".\n\nThe Laurea corresponds to a bachelor's degree; the Laurea magistrale, corresponding to a master's degree, grants access to third-cycle programmes (post-MA degrees, doctorates or specialized schools) lasting two to five years (completing a PhD usually takes three years). A five-year degree, Laurea Magistrale Quinquennale (Five-Year Master of Arts) is awarded in law (Facoltà di Giurisprudenza), the arts (Accademia di Belle Arti) and music (Conservatorio di Musica). The title for BA and BS undergraduate students is \"Dottore\" and for MA, MFA, MD and MEd graduate students \"Dottore magistrale\" (abbreviated \"Dott.\", \"Dott.ssa\" or \"Dr.\"). This should not be confused with PhD and post-MA graduates, whose title is \"Dottore di Ricerca\" (Research Doctor).\n\nThe Italian system has two types of master's degree. \"Laurea Magistrale\" (120 ECTS) allows access to third-cycle programmes, and \"Master universitario\" (at least 60 ECTS) may be divided into first- (second cycle) and second-level master's degrees (third cycle).\nA first-level master's degree is accessible by a first-cycle degree and \"does not allow access to PhD and to 3rd cycle programmes, since this type of course does not belong to the general requirements established at national level, but it is offered under the autonomous responsibility of each university\".\n\nThe Netherlands differentiates between HBO (higher professional or polytechnic education) and WO (scientific education or research universities). HBO has become the bachelor's-master's system. It generally requires four years of education to obtain a bachelor's degree; graduates may then apply for a master's program at a university, which generally require one to two years to complete. An HBO bachelor graduate may have to pass one year of pre-master's education to bridge the gap between their HBO study and (research-oriented) WO study to be admitted to a WO Master's programme, which may grant degrees such as MA, MSc and LLM. There are also HBO master's studies, granting the title \"Master of\" rather than MA, MSc and LLM.\n\nDue to the Bologna Process, in 2005 new \"licenciatura\" (licentiate) degrees were organized at university and polytechnic institutions of Portugal. Previously a four- to six-year programme, equivalent to 300 ECTS, it is now a three-year first cycle and the only requirement for the two-year second cycle which awards a master's degree. Some Bologna courses are integrated five- or six-year programmes awarding a joint master's degree, a common practice in medicine. In engineering, despite the use of two cycles, an engineer may be licensed only after obtaining a master's degree. Master's degrees attained after five or six years of study correspond to the old undergraduate degrees known as \"licenciatura\". The new \"licenciatura\", obtained after three years of study, corresponds to the discontinued \"bacharelato\" awarded by polytechnics from the 1970s to the early 2000s (roughly equivalent to an extended associate degree). Old and new master's degrees are the first graduate degree before a doctorate, and the old and new \"licenciatura\" are undergraduate degrees.\n\nThe \"licenciatura\" degree (a four- to six-year course) was required for applicants who wished to undertake the old master's and doctoral programmes, but admission was reserved for those with a \"licenciatura\" degree with a grade above 14 (out of 20). After the changes introduced by the Bologna Process, the master's degree is conferred at the end of a programme roughly equivalent in time to many old \"licenciatura\" programmes. The process was developed to improve the education system to one based on the development of competency rather than the transmission of knowledge. Its goal was the development of a system of easily comparable degrees to simplify the comparison of qualifications across Europe. Its flexibility and transparency is intended to enable wider recognition of student qualifications, facilitating movement around a European Higher Education Area based on two main cycles (undergraduate and graduate) and providing third-cycle degrees for doctoral candidates.\n\nThe Russian higher education framework was basically incompatible with the process. The generic, lowest degree in all universities since the Soviet era is the \"Specialist\", which can be obtained after five to six years of study. Since the mid-1990s, many universities have introduced limited programmes allowing students to graduate with a bachelor's degree in four years and a master's degree in an additional one to two years while preserving the old system. In October 2007, Russia moved to two-tier education in line with the Bologna Process. Universities inserted a BSc diploma in the middle of their standard specialist programmes, but the transition to MS qualification has not been completed.\n\nAlthough Specialists and masters are eligible for doctoral programmes (\"Aspirantura\"), bachelors are not; the Specialist degree is being discontinued. In most universities bachelor's- and master's-degree education is free of charge, although some state and private universities charge for one or both. The labour market does not yet understand BSc diplomas, but some universities made the program similar to classical education and the MS stage remains mandatory for most graduates.\n\nA bill proposing new regulations in the field of Higher Education was presented to Parliament in 2005, and the new system came into force in July 2007. The new system of degrees will have two degrees, of different lengths, in each cycle.\n\nStudents may not always be offered all the combinations above to obtain a degree. The \"högskoleexamen\" is usually not offered, and many schools require students to obtain the \"kandidatexamen\" before obtaining a \"magisterexamen\" or \"masterexamen\". Most third-cycle programmes require at least a \"magisterexamen\", although the legal requirement is only the \"kandidatexamen\".\n\nIn July 2007 a new system of credits, compatible with the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, was introduced in which one credit (\"högskolepoäng\") in the new system corresponds to one ECTS credit and two-thirds of a credit in the old system (\"poäng\").\n\nSome Swedish universities have introduced the ECTS standard grading scale for all students, and others will use it only for international students. Since criterion-referenced grading is used instead of relative grading in the Swedish educational system, the 10-, 25-, 30-, 25- and 10-percent distribution of students among A, B, C, D and E will not be done. Some universities only give Fail or Pass grades (F or P) for certain courses (such as internship and thesis projects) or assignments, such as laboratory exercises.\n\nSeveral Bologna Process seminars have been held. The first devoted to a single academic discipline, Chemistry Studies in the European Higher Education Area (which approved Eurobachelor), was held in June 2004 in Dresden.\n\n\n"}

They worked together on the Recurrent Coronary Prevention Project, which followed 1013 heart attack survivors for 4.5 years to determine effects from altering their coronary-prone (type A) behavior patterns. Thoresen was responsible \"to help design and direct the psychological treatment program based on a behavioral self-control perspective\" (p. 282). Results indicated that behavioral counseling reduced rates of recurrence to 13% (from 21% or higher). After the first year, those receiving behavioral counseling also experienced significantly lower rates of death. The study showed, \"for the first time, within a controlled experimental design, that altering type A behavior reduces cardiac morbidity and mortality in post infarction patients\" (p. 653).\n\n"}

The official activities of these groups are generally organized and led by class officers, who are elected in the late spring of each year for the term beginning in the fall, or early in the fall term. After graduation, the class officers are typically responsible for organizing their class reunion.\n\nLike a student council, their leadership model is loosely based on either the parliamentary system or the executive branch of the United States. Unlike a student council, which represents the students of an entire school, class officers typically represent only a single class. Whereas the purpose of student council is to learn about democracy and leadership, and to work in partnership with school management for the benefit of the school, the goal of class officers is to organize and facilitate activities for the enjoyment of their classmates.\nThe following positions are common to nearly all groups of class officers:\n\n\nThe responsibilities of the secretary and treasurer are sometimes combined into a \"secretary/treasurer\" position.\nSome schools have multiple vice presidents, each responsible for an activity, such as decorating or fundraising. Typically, class officers are automatically members of the student government group at their school, but that is not their primary responsibility.

Walter Distinguished Professor of Medicine and the Dean for Medical Education at Harvard Medical School. He had helped change medical education at through its New Pathway curriculum around the early 1990s, and his work helped create the field of genetic endocrinology. He also worked for over thirty years from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard teaching hospital in the Longwood Medical Area.\n\nBefore he was Dean for Medical Education, he had served as Dean for Students and Alumni. He later became Senior Dean for Alumni Relations and Clinical Teaching.\n\nHe was also an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and hormones and practicing clinical medicine in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter he retired in Spring 2007 and was succeeded by Edward M. Hundert, he served in Miami, Florida for over six years at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\nDr. Federman was born in New York City in 1928, the son of European immigrants who settled in the Bronx. He was graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in 1949 and magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1953. Following an internship and residency at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), he became a clinical associate at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Disease (NIAMS) where, under the guidance of Ed Rall, he studied the effects of androgens on thyroid function, thyroxine metabolism, and thyroxine-binding protein. In 1957, he began a two-year clinical research fellowship with Sir Edward Pochin at the University College Hospital Medical School, London, pioneering in the use of radioactive iodine for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Following his time in London, he returned to HMS and the MGH and worked his way up the ranks, becoming chief of the endocrine unit at the MGH in 1964, assistant chief of medical services at the MGH in 1967, associate professor of medicine at HMS and physician at the MGH in 1970, and associate chairman of medicine in 1971. During this period, Dr. Federman produced his classic text, Abnormal Sexual Development: a genetic and endocrine approach to differential diagnosis, which has been credited as bringing order to a hitherto disorganized field.\n\nIn 1973, Dr. Federman was recruited to become physician-in-chief and chair of the Department of Medicine at Stanford University.\n\nHe authored at least 379 biomedical research articles published in refereed publications.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Federman was senior dean for alumni relations and clinical teaching at HMS, mentoring medical education developments through innovative initiatives.\n\nAfter his retirement from Harvard Medical School at the end of 2007, when he was succeeded by Edward M. Hundert, he taught in Miami, Florida for over six years at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine.\n\nHis most recent topics reflectively expressed his broad and humane interests: “Protecting Research Participants”, “The physician’s responsibility toward hopelessly ill patients”, “The endocrine patient”, and “The education of medical students: sounds, alarms, and excursions”.\n\nWhile Federman was a medical student doing a three-month clerkship in medicine, he met his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Buckley, who was head nurse - the youngest head nurse ever - at Massachusetts General Hospital. MGH Trustees needed to vote to allow Betty to work in that role, since she was only 22 at the time.

Scott Brown and her husband and partner, Robert Venturi, are regarded as among the most influential architects of the twentieth century, both through their architecture and planning, and theoretical writing and teaching.\n\nBorn to Jewish parents Simon and Phyllis (Hepker) Lakofski, Denise Lakofski had the vision from the time she was five years old that she would be an architect. Pursuing this goal, she spent her summers working with architects, and from 1948 to 1952, studied in South Africa at the University of the Witwatersrand. She briefly entered liberal politics, but was frustrated by the lack of acceptance of women in the field. Lakofski traveled to London in 1952, working for the modernist architect Frederick Gibberd. She continued her education there, winning admission to the Architectural Association School of Architecture to learn “useful skills in the building of a just South Africa,” within an intellectually rich environment which embraced women. She was joined there by Robert Scott Brown, whom she had met at Witwatersrand in 1954, and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1955.\n\nDenise Lakofski and Robert Scott Brown were married on July 21, 1955. The couple spent the next three years working and traveling throughout Europe, and in 1958, they moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to study at the University of Pennsylvania's planning department. In 1959, Robert died in a car accident. Denise Scott Brown completed her master's degree in city planning in 1960 and, upon graduation, became a faculty member at the university. While teaching, she completed a master's degree in architecture. At a 1960 faculty meeting, she argued against demolishing the university's library (now the Fisher Fine Arts Library), designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. At the meeting, she met Robert Venturi, a young architect and fellow professor. The two became collaborators and taught courses together from 1962 to 1964. Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in urban planning, she taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of Los Angeles and Las Vegas. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at UCLA, and in 1966 asked him to visit Las Vegas with her. The two were married in Santa Monica, California, on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to Philadelphia in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969. Denise Scott Brown later taught at Yale University, and in 2003 was a visiting lecturer with Venturi at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design.\n\nIn 1972, with Venturi and Steven Izenour, Scott Brown wrote \"Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form\". The book published studies of the Las Vegas Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at Yale's School of Architecture and Planning. The book joined Venturi's previous \"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\" (Museum of Modern Art, 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and vernacular architecture. The book coined the terms \"Duck\" and \"Decorated Shed\" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.\n\nScott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the Bryn Mawr College plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.\nScott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as “FFF studios.” In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment. For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.\n\nThe fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the Nikko hotel chain are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical kimono patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior “street” complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.\n\nWith the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design. She has also served as principal-in-charge with Robert Venturi on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the Sainsbury Wing of London's National Gallery, the capitol building in Toulouse and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in Japan.\n\nWhen Robert Venturi was named as winner of the 1991 Pritzker Architecture Prize, Scott Brown did not attend the award ceremony in protest. The prize organization, the Hyatt Foundation stated that, in 1991, it honored only individual architects, a practice that changed in 2001 with the selection of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. However, the award was given to two recipients in 1988.\n\nIn 2013, Women In Design, a student organization spearheaded by Caroline Amory James and Arielle Assouline-Lichten at the Harvard Graduate School of Design started a petition for Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner Robert Venturi. When awarded the Jane Drew Prize in 2017 Scott Brown referred to the Pritzer controversy and subsequent petition saying \"I was very touched by the Pritzker petition – and that is my prize in the end. 20,000 people wrote from all over the world and every one of them called me Denise.\"\n\nIn 1989, Scott Brown published her famous essay, \"Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture\". Although Scott Brown wrote the essay in 1975, she decided not to publish it at the time, out of fear for damaging her career. The essay describes her struggle to be recognized as an equal partner of the firm, in an architecture world that was predominantly male. She has since been an advocate for Women in Architecture and has spoken out about discrimination within the profession on several accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the first woman named a field demonstration agent by the United States Department of Agriculture, and later occupied high-level positions supporting the New Deal.\n\nAgnew was born at the family home, Roseland, in Prince Edward County, Virginia, ninth of ten children born to Dr. James Anderson Agnew and Martha Chaffin Scott Agnew. The house soon burned, and the family moved to Burkeville, in neighboring Nottoway County. There her mother died after giving birth to another daughter, Anne Virginia, known as \"Jean\". Dr. Agnew married again, to Elizabeth McLean, who would raise Ella after the doctor died in 1879.\nAgnew began her education in local schools in Nottoway County before studying stenography at Smithdeal Business College in Richmond. In 1892 she took a position as secretary at the Stonewall Jackson Institute, a women's college in Abingdon. In 1894 she moved to Long Island to work at a publishing firm. The following year she migrated to South Africa, where she had accepted a position teaching business and working as a secretary in Paarl, at the Huguenot Seminary. She would stay in South Africa for five years, until the Boer War necessitated her return to the United States. For two of those years she was principal of the Amajuba Seminary in Wakkerstroom. After this was closed by the war, she spent time providing assistance to the Boers and doing clerical and administrative work at the American consulate. During her time in South Africa Agnew also became involved in the student Christian movement.\n\nAgnew continued her professional life upon her return from Africa; she worked as a teacher in Virginia, an office manager in New York, and general secretary of a number of Young Women's Christian Association chapters. She also continued her education via correspondence courses during this time. She returned to Virginia to begin a system of professional training for rural girls; supported by the state superintendent of education, Joseph D. Eggleston, and agriculturist Seaman A. Knapp, she began implementing her ideas in 1910 in Nansemond and Halifax Counties with the creation of tomato and canning clubs. She was soon named the first female home demonstration agent in the country. her role has been described as a precursor to modern 4-H and Extension Homemaker clubs. In 1914, upon the organization of the Cooperative Extension Service, she was assigned to Virginia Tech, as it was the primary land-grand school in the Commonwealth. In 1919 she was named the first president of the Virginia Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. After ten years in the position she left to work for the YWCA's national board, as a member of the finance department, in which role she traveled the country raising money and developing plans to fund local YWCM chapters. In 1927 she took a job as the first female editor of the \"Women's Department\" of \"Southern Planter\" magazine, remaining there until 1931. From 1933 until 1943 she headed New Deal relief activities for women in Virginia for both the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and the Works Progress Administration; she was instrumental in developing programs which allowed women to contribute to various New Deal programs, even though she was unable to persuade the Civilian Conservation Corps to develop female-only camps. Women under her purview were hired to build bird and wildflower sanctuaries, and she created \"sewing rooms\" where women, black and white, could make clothes for the needy or costumes for pageants and National Park Service reenactors. At the disbanding of the WPA in 1943 she retired, but continued in civic life.\nAgnew died in Richmond in 1958, and is buried at the Sunset Hill Cemetery in Burkeville.\n\nAgnew received a Certificate of Merit from Virginia Tech in 1926; she was the first woman to receive the award. Agnew Hall on the campus of Virginia Tech is named in her honor; the first building on campus to be named for a woman, it was completed in 1940 and christened in 1949. She was recognized as one of the Virginia Women in History for 2000, the inaugural year of the program. A historical marker in Crewe, Virginia details her accomplishments. A scholarship in her honor exists as well, offered by The Virginia Association For Family and Community Education, Inc. and designed to aid a Virginia student studying nursing or another medical profession.\n\nAgnew's papers are today held by the Library of Virginia.\n"}

The founder and the first director of the Institute was Professor Ilia Abuladze, a Corresponding Member of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. The collection of the National Centre of Manuscripts comprises manuscripts, historical documents, early printed books, rare publications and heirlooms. The Centre carries out various projects related to scientific research, exhibitions and restoration. Specialists working at and with the Centre engage in the description, systematization, study and publication of the material housed at the Centre, as well as in the production of data bases dealing with this material. The Centre also has rich academic library and includes rooms dedicated in memory of Korneli Kekelidze, Ivane Javakhishvili, Ilia Abuladze, Niko Berdzenishvili, Elene Metreveli and Shalva Amiranashvili.\n\nThe National Centre of Manuscripts was founded in 1958 under the name \"The Institute of Manuscripts of the Georgian Academy of Sciences\". It was created on the basis of the collection in the Department of Manuscripts at the State Museum of Georgia and on the initiative of Ilia Abuladze, who became the first director of the Institute. In 1962, the name of the Institute was supplemented with \"Kekelidze\" to honour the Georgian philologist and literary historian Korneli Kekelidze. From 1968 until 1989, the director of the Institute was Elene Metreveli, Academician of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. During the period from 1989 to 2006, the director of the Institute was Zaza Aleksidze, a Corresponding Member of the Georgian Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 2006, the \"Korneli Kekelidze Institute of Manuscripts of the Georgian Academy of Sciences\" was abolished and replaced through the establishment of a legal entity under public law, the \"Korneli Kekelidze Institute of Manuscripts\".

This initiative was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science and was approved by the government.\n\nOrganizational and administrative activities of the Centre are managed by the director, whereas scientific and development activities are managed and implemented by the Scientific Council. In addition, the Centre contains other structural units: departments and laboratories. Currently there are eight departments (Codicology, Source Studies and Diplomatics, Archival Studies, Fund Management, Exhibitions, Education, the Library, Art History) and two laboratories (Restoration and Conservation, Digitalization).\n\nThe Director of the National Centre of Manuscripts manages organizational and administrative activities of the Centre. In relations with third parties, the director is the official representative of the Centre and is responsible for ensuring that the Centre's activities are the legitimate, reasonable and effective.\n\nAccording to the Charter of the National Centre of Manuscripts, the Scientific Council elects a director for a period of four years. Mandatory requirements for this post are a higher degree and work experience of not less than five years. \n\nThe director of the Centre has a deputy who, in the event of the absence of the former, serves as Acting Director. At present, the director of the Centre is Zaza Abashidze.\n\nThe Scientific Council of the National Centre of Manuscripts is, together with the Director, the executive body of the Centre. The Scientific Council discusses and takes decisions by voting on matters regarding the management and development of the Centre.\n\nThe members of the Council are elected for a five-year period at the general meeting of the scientific members of the National Centre of Manuscripts. The number of Council members depends on the number of the Centre's structural units (departments and laboratories). Each structural unit is represented on the Council by one or two academic colleagues (two if the number of academics in the structural unit is greater than ten).\n\nThe Council is led by a chairman, elected for five years by the Council itself. At present the chairman of the Scientific Council is Shalva Gloveli.\n\nDepartment of Codicology performs work in two main directions:\n\n\nDepartment of Source Studies and Diplomatics was founded at the beginning of the establishment of the Centre. The specifics of the material itself defined the scientific-research activity profile of the department. The department activities mainly cover the following: \n\n\nIn the scientific-research activity of the department great attention was given to the description – research and publication oriental sources of Georgian history – Armenian, Arabic, Persian, Turkish sources.\n\nThis Department was established in 2007 on the basis of the private archives of writers and public figures preserved at the National Centre of Manuscripts. Department works in the following directions: \n\n\nThe Department Fund Management manages the funds of manuscript books and historical documents as well as the private archives. Other funds created in the Department’s structure are also within its competence. The library books, the funds of memorial cabinets and articles as well as the cartography funds are managed and controlled by the Department of Library, but the issues of creation, integration or division are agreed with the Department of Fund Management.\n\nThe aim of the Department of Exhibition is to give mass appeal to the cultural heritage preserved in the Centre by the means of the various exhibition projects. The Exhibition Department arranges permanent and mobile exhibitions both inside and outside Georgia. The Exhibition Department supports development of the exhibition system of the National Centre of Manuscripts and it's compliance with the international standards of exhibitions.\n\nDepartment of Education by means of the educational and exhibition projects, various programs and services implements integration of the cultural and intellectual heritage preserved at the Centre in the life of society. Interaction and direct contact with this heritage Department supports self-realization and development of the members and groups of society.\n\nThere are 10935 Georgian, 11654 Russian and 6496 other foreign-language books in the field of humanities kept at the main depositories of the Library of the National Centre of Manuscripts. The library also counts 3096 Georgian, 7285 Russian and about 4000 other foreign journals. \n\nThe main part of the library books and journals are kept at depositories, encyclopedias, dictionaries and referral literature in the reading hall of the library. \n\nThe library has an integrated catalogue that, in addition to main depository catalogues, lists the catalogues of the books and journals kept at 6 memorial halls of the National Centre of Manuscripts.\n\nDepartment of Art History studies art of the Georgian books, works on creation and preparation of the corpus of miniatures which are included in the manuscripts for publishing. Illumination of manuscripts is studied considering chronological and thematic aspects in order to define artistic styles typical to the different scriptoriums, epoch or subject matter. Special attention is devoted to the matters related to the copyists, artists and book-binders.\n\nThe Laboratory of Conservation and Restoration was established at the National Centre of Manuscripts in 2006. This Laboratory replaced the former Department of the Hygiene and Restoration. In the Laboratory of Conservation and Restoration the works are performed in several directions:\n\nAt the centre of the National Centre of Manuscripts functions the Laboratory of Digitalization, where the materials kept at the Centre are scanned, sorted and encoded in digital format. Digitalization of the manuscripts, documents, miniatures and photo materials the Centre supports their fixation and presentation to the scientific circles. Digitalization is also a good tool for the preservation of the existing material – in the future materials which might be lost in the course of time can be restored on the basis of the digital copy.\n\nThe collection of the National Centre of Manuscripts comprises handwritten books, historical documents and archival funds. The collection of the manuscripts and historical documents are divided into groups (sub-funds) according to language, in the archival fund are kept private archives of the Georgian and foreign public figures, also archives of the various organizations.\n\nCollection of the manuscripts is divided into groups of Georgian, Oriental, Greek, Russian and manuscripts in other languages. Out of these groups collection of the Georgian manuscripts is the biggest. It comprises thousands of manuscripts, dated from 5th to 19th centuries. Among them are also palimpsests.\n\nCollection of the Georgian manuscripts is divided into four sub-collections – A, H, Q and S. This collection contains both church and secular literary works.

Her father was an investment banker and she was privately educated at the Ethical Culture School and the Seabury School, both in New York City. As a teenager she was privately tutored in Europe for two years, and attended one semester at Columbia University. She joined the Red Cross as a nurse's aide during World War I, at Roosevelt Hospital. Despite her wealth, she subsequently sought a career for herself. She was Executive Secretary to Dr. Leo Kessel (1881–1932) at Mount Sinai Hospital where she organized the follow-up clinic for Graves' disease patients, an experience that contributed to her subsequent reputation for conscientiousness and exactitude.\n\nIn 1930 Mayer volunteered at the newly formed Museum of the City of New York, then housed in Gracie Mansion and in 1931 was appointed Curator of Prints there, a position she held until 1959.\n\nOver three decades at the museum she organized about 150 exhibitions, among them \"Currier & Ives and the New York Scene\" and \"We Cover The New Yorker.\" In 1934 she organized the first important Berenice Abbott show in the United States. Her exhibition of the work of Jacob A. Riis, in 1947, rediscovered the pioneer social documentarian and gained his collection for the museum where it resides alongside more than 10,000 prints and negatives of New York City by the father-son team of Joseph and Percy Byron, taken over half a century, and the Harry T. Peters Collection of Currier & Ives prints. \n\nFrom the Byron collection she published \"Once Upon a City,\" presenting New York at the turn of the century, for which Edward Steichen wrote the foreword. In writing to thank Steichen she asked what she might do to repay him and he responded by asking for her assistance with the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition, \"70 Photographers Look at New York\" which opened in 1957.\n\nIn 1958 Steichen hired her first as his Special Assistant, then In 1961 as Associate Curator and, in 1962, John Szarkowski appointed her as Curator of the Department, organising the inaugural show in MoMA's first photography-collection galleries, which opened in 1964. She collaborated with Steichen on important shows such as \"The Sense of Abstraction\" (1960), \"Steichen the Photographer\" (1961) for which she wrote the biographical outline, and the introduction to \"The Bitter Years: 1935-1941\" (1962), both published by the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\nMayer wrote articles in the \"Bulletin of the Museum of the City of New York\" and in \"Antiques,\" \"Contemporary Photographer,\" \"Aperture\" and \"Audience.\"\n\nShe was also responsible for the biographical outline in \"Steichen the Photographer,\" a selection of photographs by Steichen (1961).\n\nShe was a member of the Advisory Council of the Village Art Center and a director of the Print Council of America.\n\nAfter retiring in 1968 Mayer was appointed curator of the Edward Steichen Archive, a voluntary position. She donated photographs she personally collected to the Museum of Modern Art where they are archived with her written records.\n\nIn 1997, the year after she died, Peter Galassi installed \"From the Grace M. Mayer Collection,\" at the Museum; a selection of 35 works from the group she left to the museum, mostly of gifts from photographer friends, including Abbott, Steichen, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Harry Callahan, Paul Caponigro, Roy DeCarava, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, Helen Levitt, Nathan Lyons, Aaron Siskind, W.

Those playing the game take on the role of a bartender attempting to maximize tips from customers.\n\nThe game was developed by Cutler Creative and supported Windows 95 and Windows 98. The game's creator, John Cutler, first got the idea for the game in 1995. He wanted to have a game that could teach people to mix drinks. Under the original title Bartender USA, the player would start at a Howard Johnson's and gradually work their way up to a trendy bar in New York City. At the time, Cutler had no video game experience, and didn't own a computer until he started development. He attended E3 and also worked as a bartender to better understand what he needed to do. He hired programmers and artists to put together a mockup of the game. The original concept included some live action animation, which was dropped from the final game. Simon & Schuster had recently published the comedy game Deer Avenger, and agreed to publish the game since it matched up with their business model at the time. This agreement gave Cutler's team funding to develop and complete the game. Due to Cutler's inexperience, many aspects of the game needed to be rethought during the development process. Cutler credited his choice to use Macromedia Director as making a mammoth task much easier. He struggled with feature creep and his relationship with the testing company.\n\nThe setting of the game is a fictional bar in New York City. The player, as bartender, must learn to mix over one hundred drinks. They also have to ID all customers (serving an underage customer will get the player fired), charm customers, keep music playing, and keep customers from being too drunk. The game offers a recipe book for players, but players will score better if they don't use it. Also, without memorizing the recipes, the player will run out of time. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the most tips. There are around 20 characters that the player needs to serve in the game. One of these characters is Vincent the Hedgehog, who is an actual hedgehog.\n\nReview of the game were mixed. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution describes it as a casual game, and not one that a player would expect to play for hours. Silverman described it as a replacement for Solitaire that wouldn't hook players, but also stated that with its low price, it may be worth buying. Lisa Savignano of All Game praised the creative characters, but noted that some of the graphics were poor. IGN appreciated the large library of drinks, but noted that the animation was often clunky.\n\nThe game sold poorly and was a flop. Despite this, for the French and UK market under the name Happy Hour, and in Germany under the name On the Rocks. Cutler was surprised at the nearly even ratio of male to female purchasers.\n\nThe video game is rated mature and is not recommended for those younger than 21.\n"}

Founded in 1956, it works to help NYC’s public school students by running family and community engagement programs, which empower parents to foster their children’s educational development and training volunteers to provide individualized tutoring and support.\n\nLearning Leaders works closely with the New York City Department of Education in its efforts to create and support partnerships between schools, families and the community to enhance student achievement.\n\nAs of school year 2013-2014, the organization has over 4,000 volunteers working with 180,000 students through partnerships with 250 elementary and middle schools across every district in NYC’s five boroughs. Seventy per cent of all Learning Leaders volunteers, including family and community members, are African American or Latino and half speak a language other than English at home. Some 4,000 parents participated in its family education workshops to increase knowledge and skills on how to support their children’s education.\n\nLearning Leaders was founded in 1956 as the New York City School Volunteer Program (SVP), the brainchild of Clara Blitzer, a member of the Board of the Public Education Association. The organization was adopted by the New York City Board of Education in 1962 but became an independent non-profit organization in 1970.\n\nIn 1999, SVP changed its name to Learning Leaders and created its website, learningleaders.org, to reflect its evolving role in student education and the increased involvement of parents and family members as school volunteers and supporters of their own children’s learning at home and at school.\n\nWhen the City’s new ‘Children First’ initiative was launched in 2002, it brought far-reaching structural and curriculum changes to the public school system. Growing parent involvement became a major goal of the New York City Department of Education and Parent Coordinators were recruited for every school. Learning Leaders was, and continues to be, a key partner in this effort.\n\nIn 2007, the nonprofit was among over 530 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nEmpowering Family Members to Support Children’s Education\n\nLearning Leaders is committed to effective family engagement, which research has shown to boost student learning and positive child and youth development. It offers a wide range of interactive parent workshops in multiple languages. The workshops cover topics including supporting literacy and math skills at home, understanding child and adolescent development and navigating the middle and high school applications process. The program aims to help increase parent knowledge about the public school system and learning standards and to develop strategies for effectively supporting their children’s education.\n\nBringing Community and Family Resources to Schools\n\nLearning Leaders divides its volunteer programs into two main models: the Core Program and the Enrichment Programs. The Core Program recruits and trains community and family volunteers to provide students with one-on-one tutoring in reading, writing, ESL, math and other academic subjects at the elementary and middle school levels, as well as non-instructional support such as general office and library assistance.\n\nThrough Learning Leaders’ Enrichment Programs, volunteers supplement students’ education beyond core academic support. These programs, which include BookTalk and Book Buddies, promote a life-long love of reading and literature, encourage students to discuss and think critically and develop confidence and communication skills.\n\n"}

An institution may be need-blind in any given year by policy (de jure) or by circumstances (de facto).\n\nMost colleges and universities cannot afford to offer financial aid to all admitted students and many will admit all students on a need-blind basis but cannot offer them sufficient aid to meet need. Many schools who admit all U.S. citizens or resident aliens without regard to need do not extend this policy to international students or to transfer students. Therefore, schools, especially private ones, which are need-blind and full-need for all applicants, including internationals, tend to be much more selective as they have relatively more applicants than other similar schools.\n\nNeed-blind admission does not necessarily mean a \"full-need\" financial aid policy—where the school agrees to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all its admitted students. Indeed, the two policies can be in tension because need-blind admissions and full-need financial aid together commit the school to spend an undetermined amount of money regardless of other budgetary constraints. Thus, some need-blind schools will admit students who will nonetheless not be able to attend because of deficient financial aid awards.\n\nInstitutions self-define their definition of meeting full demonstrated need. There is no U.S. standard that an institution must abide by to claim that they meet fully demonstrated need. Therefore, an applicant's financial aid package can vary significantly at various schools, even if all of these institutions claim to meet fully demonstrated need.\n\nThere are currently only seven U.S. higher learning institutions that are need-blind and meet full demonstrated need for all applicants, including international students. These are:\n\nA number of U.S. institutions of higher learning offer both need-blind admissions and meet the full demonstrated need for all domestic students. However, these institutions are need-aware when it comes to international student admissions. However, all admitted students will have their demonstrated need met. The following schools fall into this category:\nMany reputable US institutions that once championed \"need-blind\" policies in the past have modified their policies due to rising tuition and financial aid costs, as well as less-than-ideal returns on endowments. This largely affects prestigious institutions with vulnerable resources that do not offer merit-based aid but base their financial aid entirely on need and promise to deliver 100% of financial need (composed mostly of grants). These stated institutions refer to themselves as \"need-aware\" or \"need-sensitive,\" policies that somewhat contradict their call to admit and provide education for all qualified candidates regardless of economic status but allow them to fully fund the needs of all accepted students.\n\nFor instance, at Macalester College, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College, at least 95% of students are admitted without their financial aid need being a factor (i.e., \"need-blind\"), but a slim percentage (1%–5%), generally students wait-listed or with borderline qualifications, are reviewed in modest consideration of the college's projected financial resources. All of these aforementioned colleges grant all admitted students full financial aid packages meeting 100% need. At Wesleyan University, attempted shifts to a \"need-aware\" admission policy have resulted in protests by the school's student body.\nSome schools have a need-blind admissions policy, but do not guarantee to meet the full demonstrated financial need of the students they admit. The following schools fall under this category:\n\nThe following institutions are need-aware and do not meet full need for the students they admit:\n\nAs of 2014, Phillips Academy is the only USA boarding high school that has a clearly stated need-blind admission policy and is committed to meeting the full demonstrated need of its admitted students. St. Andrew's School ended its policy in 2013. Phillips Exeter Academy was \"effectively need-blind\" prior to the 2009 admission season but stopped the practice because of the economic pressures. Roxbury Latin School, a day school outside of Boston, is also need-blind.\n\n"}

The main campus is located in Puerto Madero, one of the most modern neighborhoods of Buenos Aires.\n\nIt is considered, according to a 2011 study by the Spanish Ministry of Education, as one of the best private universities in Latin America. It is the second university preferred by Argentine employers and the sixth in all Latin America.\n\nIts predecessor, the Catholic University of Buenos Aires (1910–1922), was founded by the Argentine episcopate in 1910, but its degrees, in law, were not recognized by the Argentine government, and the institution was closed in 1922.\n\nIn 1955, Decree 6403 concerning the freedom of education enabled the creation of private universities with the authority to deliver academic qualifications. In 1956, the bishops decided to create the Catholic University of Argentina, formally founded on March 7, 1958.\n\nCardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was UCA's Grand Chancellor, by virtue of his office as Primate of Argentina and Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, until his election in 2013 as Pope Francis to succeed Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. When Mario Aurelio Poli was named Archbishop of Buenos Aires by Pope Francis later in 2013, he became Grand Chancellor of the University. In May 2013 Pope Francis named Victor Manuel Fernández, the University's President (the second-highest administrative rank, after the Grand Chancellor), as titular archbishop of Tiburnia.\n\nThe part-time MBA program taught by the university has been accredited by the London-based Association of MBAs (AMBA) since 1998.\n\nLike Buenos Aires itself, the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina was founded twice. \nThe foundation of a catholic university was first discussed in the Eucharistic Congress of 1884. At the time, the Argentine Law 1420 of Common Education had dictated public compulsory, free and secular education in order to guarantee the separation of Church and State and prevent discrimination on the basis of religious adherence.\n\nEventually the idea lost its momentum, but in 1908 the first Congress of Catholic Youths underlined the importance of a well-rounded, integral education and promoted the foundation of a catholic university \"in which students are trained to excel in liberal professions and are taught the core of catholic doctine\". The Argentine Episcopate finally decided in favour of this initiative by founding the Catholic University of Buenos Aires in 1910. The bishops proceeded with the conception of this first university regardless of the poor legislation on private institutions of higher education that the country had at the time.\n\nThe Faculty of Law was its first and only one, and the curriculum was largely based on those of public universities plus compulsory courses on philosophy and history. The aforementioned lack of legislation conspired against the procurement of official accreditation and the Catholic University of Buenos Aires was forced to close its doors in 1922, little over a decade after being founded.\n\nThe Argentine Episcopate decided to found the university once again in its plenum in 1956 and two years later, the Catholic University of Argentina was created.\n\nOnce the statutes of the institution were promulgated and approved, the university started receiving students to the original faculties:\n\nUCA is widely considered to be one of the best institutions of higher education in Argentina. QS World University Rankings has ranked UCA 2nd overall and 1st among private institutions in Argentina in 2013. The university is also ranked 2nd in terms of employer preference.\n\nUCA is also labeld as a \"Top Business School\" with 4 out of 5 Palmes by EdUniversal. The French consulting company also ranked UCA's Business School 3rd in the nation.\n\nUCA's main campus is located in Puerto Madero, the financial center of downtown Buenos Aires. It is just 500 meters (546 yards) away from Casa Rosada and 3 lines of the Buenos Aires Underground intersect less than 600 meters away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2000, the Office of International Relations was established, renamed to International Relations and Academic Cooperation in 2006, with the aim of promoting the internationalization of all components of the university. From that time the institution increased its links with institutions abroad, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage. There are a variety of approaches to professional development, including consultation, coaching, communities of practice, lesson study, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.\n\nThe University of Management and Technology notes the use of the phrase \"professional development\" from 1857 onwards.\n\nIn the training of school staff in the United States, \"[t]he need for professional development [...] came to the forefront in the 1960s\".\n\nA wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. Individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements. Many American states have professional development requirements for school teachers. For example, Arkansas teachers must complete 60 hours of documented professional development activities annually. Professional development credits are named differently from state to state. For example, teachers: in Indiana are required to earn 90 Continuing Renewal Units (CRUs) per year; in Massachusetts, teachers need 150 Professional Development Points (PDPs); and in Georgia, must earn 10 Professional Learning Units (PLUs). American and Canadian nurses, as well as those in the United Kingdom, have to participate in formal and informal professional development (earning credit based on attendance of education that has been accredited by a regulatory agency) in order to maintain professional registration.\n\nA professional school is a graduate school level institution that prepares students for careers in specific fields. Some of the schools also offer undergraduate degrees in specific professions. Examples of this type of school include:\nArchitecture school, Business school, Divinity school, Engineering school, Journalism school, Law school, Library school, Education school (Normal school), Public policy school and Social work school. The field of healthcare has many professional schools including Medical school, Chiropractic school, Dental school, Pharmacy school, Physician Assistant school, Physiotherapy school, Podiatric medical school, Public health school, Speech-Language Pathology School, Occupational therapy school, Nursing school, Veterinary school and Optometry school.\n\nIn a broad sense, professional development may include \"formal\" types of vocational education, typically post-secondary or poly-technical training leading to qualification or credential required to obtain or retain employment. Professional development may also come in the form of pre-service or in-service professional development programs. These programs may be formal, or informal, group or individualized. Individuals may pursue professional development independently, or programs may be offered by human resource departments. Professional development on the job may develop or enhance process skills, sometimes referred to as leadership skills, as well as task skills. Some examples for process skills are 'effectiveness skills', 'team functioning skills', and 'systems thinking skills'.\n\nProfessional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences. Some examples of approaches to professional development include:\n\n\nThe World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on the future of work argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.\n\nInitial professional development (IPD) is defined as \"a period of development during which an individual acquires a level of competence necessary in order to operate as an autonomous professional\". Professional associations may recognise the successful completion of IPD by the award of chartered or similar status. Examples of professional bodies that require IPD prior to the award of professional status are the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, the Institution of Structural Engineers, and the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nContinuing professional development (CPD) or continuing professional education (CPE) is continuing education to maintain knowledge and skills. Most professions have CPD obligations. Examples are the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, American Academy of Financial Management, safety professionals with the International Institute of Risk & Safety Management (IIRSM) or the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to continuing medical education or continuing legal education requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.\n"}

The DOS version of the game was released as freeware for download in 2006. The game is the first in the Railroad Tycoon series.\n\nA port of the game for the Super NES was planned for a 1994 release, and screenshots were shown in the March 1993 issue of Nintendo Power; however the port was never released. Though no reason was officially given, it may have been due to the DOS release of \"Transport Tycoon\", and its planned release on the upcoming Playstation console.\n\nThe objective of the game is to build and manage a railroad company by laying track, building stations, and buying and scheduling trains. The player acts a railway entrepreneur and may start companies in any of four geographic locales: the Western United States, Northeast United States, Great Britain, or Continental Europe. The company starts with one million dollars in capital, half equity, half a loan. The company may raise additional capital through the sale of bonds.\n\nThe player acts as a railway entrepreneur who owns and manages the business as described above and may also handle individual train movement and build additional industries. The game models supply and demand of goods and passengers as well as a miniature stock market on which players can buy and sell stock of their own or competing companies. The game also has other railroad companies attempting to put the player out of business with stock dealings and \"Rate Wars\".\n\nThere are four types of stations: Signal Tower, Depot, Station, and Terminal. The Signal Tower acts as a passing loop and may control movements. The rest service surrounding areas: the Depot serves its own square and the adjoining eight squares, the Station takes another ring, and the Terminal handles up to three squares away. The player can build at most 32 stations. When the player builds the first station they also build their first engine shop. Each engine shop is the manufacturing area for the player's different trains. The player can upgrade and downgrade Depots, Stations, and Terminals. Other facilities such as stores and hotels may be added.\n\nOnce the player builds a station they can build their first train (of the 32 permitted) at any engine shop. The player then can add cars to the train and send it on its way. The player can at any time change the \"consist\", which is the list of cars the train is to pick up at the various stations along the way. These include pure mail and passenger cars and specialized freight cars for each of the other nine types of commodity produced in the game.\n\nThe player can continue to build the track network and build stations until the player runs out of funds. The game runs for a century (1830 - 1930 and 1866 - 1966 in America and 1900 - 2000 in Europe), with accounting periods two years long. Stations built or rebuilt in a particular accounting period pay the player double freight rates for everything they purchase in that period.\n\nNot every station buys everything offered to it. Some good producers buy nothing. There are two alternatives the player can choose between: Simple Economy (where, for example, a station serving two or more cities will buy anything) and Complex Economy (where \"two cities\" will buy mail, passengers, and a couple of other products; \"four villages\" will buy passengers and different freight products; only a station with a steel mill will buy coal; and other products have other buyer types). There are product variations over the four geographical scenarios.\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon\" sold more than 400,000 units by September 1997.\n\nOn its release in 1990 \"Railroad Tycoon\" was hailed by reviewers as one of the best games of the year. In 1990 \"Computer Gaming World\" gave the game five out of five stars and named it as its Game of the Year, and in 1992 added it to the magazine's Hall of Fame for games that readers highly rated over time. Both the PC version of \"Railroad Tycoon\" and the Macintosh version were rated 5 out of 5 stars by \"Dragon\". It won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Strategy Program. The editors of \"Strategy Plus\" declared it their 1990 game of the year.\n\nIn 1991, \"PC Format\" named \"Railroad Tycoon\" one of the 50 best computer games ever. In 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" declared it the 4th best computer game ever.\n\nRailroad Tycoon was featured in G4 Icons' episode 12 \"Sid Meier\" which documents the history of Sid Meier with games and computers in general.\n\n"}

The system is powered by a backpack battery, and is controlled by a simple wrist-mounted remote which detects and enhances the user's movements. Designed in Yokneam, Israel, by Amit Goffer, the ReWalk is marketed by ReWalk Robotics Ltd (originally Argo Medical Technologies Ltd), and is priced at approximately US$85,000 per unit.\n\nThe device underwent clinical trials at MossRehab in suburban Philadelphia. In July 2014, ReWalk Robotics filed for an American initial public offering that could raise up to US$58 million. The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol \"RWLK\".\n\nAt the time of its initial release, ReWalk was available in two versions – the ReWalk I and the ReWalk P. The ReWalk I is used by medical institutions for research or therapy to be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The ReWalk P is for personal use by patients at home or in public.\n\nAn updated version, ReWalk Rehabilitation 2.0, was released in January 2013. The ReWalk 2.0 featured improved sizing for taller individuals and some enhancement in controlling software.\n\nThe ReWalk system weighs approximately ; the backpack containing the system's Windows-operated computer and battery weighs around , and the robotic leg attachments weigh around . The user can engage in three modes: walking, sitting, and standing. The signals to these modes are sent via a wrist-watch type device to the computer.\n\nThe ReWalk was approved for hospital use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011. FDA approval for home and public use was issued in June 2014.\n\nIn 2010, a prototype ReWalk appeared in the American TV series \"Glee\"; the exoskeleton is used by fictional character Artie Abrams during the Season 2 episode \"A Very Glee Christmas\".\n\nOn 8 May 2012, paralyzed British woman Claire Lomas became the first person to finish a marathon using a bionic assistance suit. Lomas, who was paralyzed from the waist down in a 2007 riding accident, completed the London Marathon in 17 days with her ReWalk system. Later in 2012, Lomas became the first person to take the ReWalk suit home for assistance with everyday tasks, and participated in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in her ReWalk.\n\nBy 2015, Japanese robotics maker Yaskawa Electric Co. has been distributing ReWalk in Asia, i.e. China, under a deal signed in 2014 with ReWalk Robotics. However, in Japan itself ReWalk faces a long approval process that is typical for Japanese businesses. This is due to tight regulation laws in Japan that has been in effect for the last decade.\n\nThe weight and bulk of the ReWalk exoskeleton is considered to be too much for some users by its creator, Amit Goffer. In addition, with a price of between US$69,500 to US$85,000, the system is beyond the reach of many poorer patients, especially because, as of July 2014, health insurance in the United States does not yet cover the ReWalk. Larry Jasinki, the CEO of ReWalk, stated in 2014 that the company is \"working with insurers and other health-care coverage providers to ensure individuals eligible to use the ReWalk are able to purchase a system\".\n\n\n"}

She was one of only around 200 women to earn PhDs in mathematics from American universities during the 1940s, a period of women's underrepresentation in mathematics at this level.\nShe was involved in developing the close contact between Vassar College and IBM that led to the establishment of the first computer science lab at Vassar.\n\nAsprey was born in Sioux City, Iowa; her parents were Gladys Brown Asprey, Vassar class of 1905, and Peter Asprey Jr. She had two brothers, actinide and fluorine chemist Larned B. Asprey (1919–2005), a signer of the Szilárd petition, and military historian and writer Robert B. Asprey (1923–2009) who dedicated several of his books to his sister Winifred.\n\nAsprey attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, where she earned her undergraduate degree in 1938. As a student there, Asprey met Grace Hopper, the \"First Lady of Computing,\" who taught mathematics at the time. After graduating, Asprey taught at several private schools in New York City and Chicago before going on to earn her MS and PhD degrees from the University of Iowa in 1942 and 1945, respectively. Her doctoral advisor was the topologist Edward Wilson Chittenden.\n\nAsprey returned to Vassar College as a professor. By then, Grace Hopper had moved to Philadelphia to work on UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) project. Asprey became interested in computing and visited Hopper to learn about the foundations of computer architecture. Asprey believed that computers would be an essential part of a liberal arts education.\n\nAt Vassar, Asprey taught mathematics and computer science for 38 years and was the chair of the mathematics department from 1957 until her retirement in 1982.\nShe created the first Computer Science Department at Vassar, the first course being taught in 1963, and secured funds for the college's first computer, making Vassar the second college in the nation to acquire an IBM System/360 computer in 1967.\nAsprey connected with researchers at IBM and other research centers and lobbied for computer science at Vassar. In 1989, due to her contributions, the computer center she started was renamed the Asprey Advanced Computation Laboratory.\n\n"}

He was part of the Dagar family of musicians. \n\nHe taught at the Dhrupad Kendra in Bhopal with his elder brother Zia Mohiuddin Dagar. He also taught as a visiting professor up to the time of the Babri mosque riots. After the riots, he decided to live at the gurukul of his brother Zia Mohiuddin Dagar at Palaspe near Panvel.\n\nHe was awarded the 1994 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in Hindustani music-Vocal by Sangeet Natak Akademi. \nLater \n\nHe was born in Udaipur, Rajasthan, where his father, the great Ustad Ziauddin Khansahib, was the court musician for Maharana Bhupal Singh of Udaipur. He was taught Dhrupad vocal and veena by his father. After his father’s demise, he continued learning under his elder brother, Late Ustad Z M Dagar.\n\nHe has performed widely in India and abroad, and received the Tansen Samman from the Madhya Pradesh government and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. In 2005, he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the North American Dhrupad Association. \n\nBy 1980, he had virtually settled down in Austria where he taught at the conservatory of Innsbruck teaching Dhrupad in Austria and France (mainly Paris). Once, during a visit to India, one of his disciples, the filmmaker, Mani Kaul came to him and pleaded with him to provide the background score for a film, \"The Cloud Door\" (1994) he was making on Madhya Pradesh. \n\nDuring the making of the film, they spent over two months in Madhya Pradesh, a lot of time in Bhopal. In those days, Shri Arjun Singh was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. Cultural development was one of his passions. It is because of him that the magnificent Bharat Bhavan cultural center came up in Bhopal. \n\nAt that time, the Secretary to the Department of Culture in Madhya Pradesh was Ashok Vajpayee. Vajpayee offered to start a government supported school for Dhrupad in Bhopal. Zia Fariduddin agreed to move back to India and to take charge as the teacher at this school. He taught dhrupad for 25 years at this Dhrupad Kendra, under the Ustad Allauddin Khan Music Academy, Bhopal, to students like the Gundecha Brothers and Uday Bhawalkar.\n\nHe was a distinguished guest faculty at 'Dhrupad Sansar', IIT Bombay for a span of 5 years. Dhrupad Sansar was started under the Cell for Human Values to create an appreciation about Indian Classical Arts and Culture among staff and students of the institution.\n\nHe was staying and teaching at the Dhrupad Gurukul near Panvel, which was built by his elder brother Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar and continued to perform in India and abroad until his brief illness and death on 8 May 2013.\n\n\n\n"}
