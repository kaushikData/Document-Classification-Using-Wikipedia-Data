{"id": "7341657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7341657", "title": "Academic grading in Canada", "text": "Academic grading in Canada\n\nAcademic grading in Canada varies by province, level of education (e.g., high school or university), institution (e.g., Wilfrid Laurier University), and faculty. The following are commonly used conversions from percentage grades to letter grades, however, this is not necessarily meaningful, since there is not a uniform scheme for assigning percentage grades either.\n\nIn Alberta, academic grading follows a scale of letter grades (A through D), sentences to describe how well one's performance is to the curricular tasks expected of them, and percentages which are typically reserved for high school, college, and university students. These percentages vary from faculty to faculty in universities, as well as among different universities.\nIn most post-secondary institutions, percentages are mainly a suggestion, and not a hard grading system, and even some individual classes can have large deviations from the norm (such as anything below an 80 being a C+ or lower).\nLetter grades are not used at all in francophone schools; only percentages are used. In francophone schools, from grades 1–19, as well as kindergarten, an alternative grading system is used instead of percentages and letter grades: numbers 1 to 4 are used, with 4 being excellent, 3 being good, 2 being acceptable, and 1 being poor.\n\nA: 90%–100% (student has demonstrated an exemplary performance to what is expected)\n\nB: 80%–89% (student has demonstrated a proficient performance to what is expected)\n\nC: 70%–79% (student has demonstrated an adequate performance to what is expected)\n\nD: 60%–69% (student has demonstrated a limited performance to what is expected)\n\nF: 0%–59% (student has demonstrated a weak performance to what is expected)\n\nIEA: Insufficient Evidence Available: indicates that the teacher of a particular course has not gathered enough evidence of a student's learning and thus, cannot give a grade for said student.\n\nWDR: Withdrawal: indicted the student has withdrew from a particular course and thus, is given no grade because of it.\n\nAMP: Academic Malpractice: Indicates that the student was placed in an incorrect class, whether it be by not having the pre-requiste or did not request the class upon registration. No mark is given.\n\nP: Pass: indicates that the student has achieved the bare minimum grade to pass the class granted by a teacher due to reasons beyond the students control. A grade of P translates into a 50% when used to calculate averages for university or college admission.\n\nA mark of 0%–49%, or a F and under, is a failure for a class and is typically given for high school and post-secondary students only, but can be given to junior high students too, but isn't typically done. A failing grade will also result in not earning credits for an Alberta High School Diploma or for any subject taken in post-secondary, and typically means the student will more than likely repeat the course.\n\nLetter Grade Interpretation:\n\nA = The student demonstrates excellent or outstanding performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.\n\nB = The student demonstrates very good performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.\n\nC+ = The student demonstrates good performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.\n\nC = The student demonstrates satisfactory performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.\n\nC- = The student demonstrates minimally acceptable performance in relation to expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade.\n\nI = (In Progress or Incomplete) The student, for a variety of reasons, is not demonstrating minimally acceptable performance in relation to the expected learning outcomes. An \"I\" letter grade may only be assigned in accordance with section 3.\n\nF = (Failed) The student has not demonstrated the minimally acceptable performance in relation to the expected learning outcomes for the course or subject and grade. F (Failed) may only be used as a final letter grade if an \"I\" (In Progress) letter grade has been previously assigned or the \"F\" is assigned as a result of failing a provincially examinable course.\n\nW = (Withdrawal) According to the policy of the board, and upon request of the parent of the student or, when appropriate, the student, the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of a school may grant permission to a student to withdraw from a course or subject.\n\nSG = (Standing Granted) Although completion of normal requirements is not possible, a sufficient level of performance has been attained to warrant, consistent with the best interests of the student, the granting of standing for the course or subject and grade. Standing Granted may be used in cases of serious illness, hospitalization, late entry or early leaving, but may only be granted by an adjudication process authorized by the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of the school. Standing Granted may not be used for a course with a Required Graduation Program Examination. Standing Granted may not be used for Graduation Transitions.\n\n(TS = Transfer Standing) May be granted by the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of a school on the basis of an examination of records from an institution other than a school as defined in the School Act. Alternatively, the principal, vice principal or director of instruction in charge of a school may assign a letter grade on the basis of an examination of those records.\n\nMany school districts in British Columbia have switched the reporting method from percentages to letter grades for Grades 8–9.\n\nThe grading standards for A-letter grades changed in September 2010 to coincide with a new academic year. The new changes require a higher percentage grade by two or five points to obtain an A or A+ respectively. \n\n\nAt a high school level, most subjects are separated in three competencies. On report cards, marks are normally shown as numbers and an average of the two marks associated to the subject will be calculated. For example, if a student achieves A, A- and B+ in a subject, teachers will calculate an average of the three marks (in this case, 85%).\n\nQuebec passing mark is 60% and not 50% as compared to some other provinces. Note that it is common practice for students to pass with grades in the range of 55% to 59% at the teacher's discretion. Also worth note the military pass mark is also generally 60%.\n\nNote: Most schools in Quebec have now switched to percentages. The mark the students receives is the mark that is shown. The 60% passing mark remains.\n"}

Students learn about where their food comes from, how to grow their own food, and why farms and agriculture play such an important role in our society.\n\nThe foundation is part of a national group, Agriculture in the Classroom that operates across Canada through individual provinces. Though partially supported by government, the foundation relies on financial support from the agricultural community to sustain its activities.\n\nThe organization's mission is: \"Working to bring BC's agriculture to our students\".\n\nThe foundation has representation on its board of directors from teachers, the provincial government, financial institutions, nutritionists, producers, and dieticians.\n\nBCAITC's resource centre provides teachers with print and video resources. With titles such as The Sustainability Road Show, Wonderful Worms, Food For Thought, and Spuds In Tubs, teachers from all grades are encouraged to bring resources into their classroom and have developed different programs to help spread awareness of agriculture and the importance of eating healthy and supporting local producers.\n\nTake a Bite of BC was developed in 2009 by BCAITC in partnership with the BC Culinary Arts Association, BC agricultural commodity groups and BC producers. BC grown products are donated to the program and delivered to participating secondary school teaching kitchens over a four-month period. The program provides an opportunity for Chef Instructors to feature locally grown product in secondary school teaching kitchens. Students gain experience working with fresh products and begin to develop an appreciation for farmers in their community as they connect with the foods that are grown around them and learn about the benefits of eating healthy, fresh and local. As of the 2016/2017 school year, all 60 secondary schools with culinary arts programs are benefiting from this program. .\n\nBCAITC's signature program, Spuds in Tubs enables students to experience growing their own food. With the help of a teacher, students plant seed potatoes into tubs, and from there tend them and watch them grow into something they can harvest and eat. There are currently 125 classrooms and 3,250 students participating .\n\nThe foundation's biggest program, the BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program, partners with local producers to deliver fresh, local fruits and vegetables to BC schools. In 2011 a three million dollar expansion of the program was announced and the program will now reach over 1,200 schools in BC, and serve over 400,000 students with fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe Summer Institute is a course put on by BCAITC for teachers who want to learn more about agriculture. This course is designed for teachers in the BC school system to explore practical ways to integrate concepts related to food production and consumption, food safety, agricultural issues, and sustainability across the curriculum at all grade levels. Through active participation, field trips, guest speakers, video presentations, and the like, participants will expand their knowledge of agriculture and food concepts and issues and reflect on their own values and orientations to the topic. Ways to incorporate this new knowledge into existing courses will be explored with ethical defensibility being the guiding principle. The goal is to produce curriculum projects that can be implemented in schools or other settings. The course is put on in partnership with the University of British Columbia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3597098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3597098", "title": "Balasaraswati", "text": "Balasaraswati\n\nTanjore Balasaraswati, also known as Balasaraswati (13 May 1918 – 9 February 1984), was a celebrated Indian dancer, and her rendering of Bharatanatyam, a classical dance style originated in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, made this style of dancing well known in different parts of India and many parts of the world.\n\nShe was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1957 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1977, the third and the second highest civilian honours given by the Government of India. In 1981 she was awarded the \"Sangeetha Kalasikhamani\" award of The Indian Fine Arts Society, Chennai.\n\nBalasaraswati was a seventh generation representative of a traditional matrilineal family of temple musicians and dancers (devadasis, who traditionally enjoyed high social status), who have been described as the greatest single repository of the traditional performing arts of music and dance of the southern region of India [(\"Balasaraswati\" by V.K. Narayana Menon)]. Her ancestor, Papammal, was a musician and dancer patronized in the mid-eighteenth century by the court of Thanjavur. Her grandmother, Vina Dhanammal (1867–1938), is considered by many to be the most influential musician of the early twentieth century. Her mother, Jayammal (1890–1967) was a singer who encouraged the training of Balasaraswati and was her accompanist.\n\nBalasaraswati created a revolution in traditional music and dance for bharata natyam, a combination of the performance arts of music and dance. She learned music within the family from her infancy, and her rigorous training in dance was begun when she was four under the distinguished dance teacher K. Kandappan Pillai, a member of the famed Thanjavur Nattuvanar family. Her younger brothers were the musicians T. Ranganathan and T. Viswanathan who would both become prominent performers and teachers in India and the United States. Her daughter, Lakshmi Knight (1943–2001), became a distinguished performer of her mother's style. Her grandson Aniruddha Knight continues to perform the family style today, and is artistic director of Bala Music and Dance Association in the United States and the Balasaraswati School of Dance in India. Her son-in-law Douglas M. Knight, Jr. has written her biography with the support of a Guggenheim Fellowship (2003). Famous Indian film maker Satyajit Ray made a documentary on her works.\n\nBalasaraswati's debut took place in 1925. She was the first performer of her traditional style outside of South India, performing first in Calcutta in 1934. As a young teenager, she was seen by choreographer Uday Shankar, who became an ardent promoter of her performances, and throughout the 1930s she captured the imagination of audiences across India. She went on to a global career that attracted international critical attention and the respect of dance greats such as Shambhu Maharaj, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Martha Graham, and Merce Cunningham. Interest in bharata natyam rebounded in the 1950s as the public became interested in promoting a unique Indian art form. Balasaraswati, encouraged by an administrator at the Music Academy in Madras, established a dance school in association with the institution. There she trained new dancers in bharata natyam as per her vision. In the early 1960s she increasingly travelled globally, with performances in East Asia, Europe, and North America. Later that decade, throughout the 1970s, and into the early 1980s, she visited the United States repeatedly and held residencies—as both a teacher and a performer—at Wesleyan University (Middletown, Connecticut), California Institute of the Arts (Valencia), Mills College (Oakland, California), the University of Washington (Seattle), and Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival (Beckett, Massachusetts), among other institutions. Through her international engagements as well as her activities in India, especially in Madras, Balasaraswati not only exposed countless audiences to the traditional style of bharata natyam but also trained many new practitioners of the art form.\n\nShe received numerous awards in India, including the President's Award from the Sangeet Natak Akademi (1955), Padma Vibushan from the Government of India for distinguished national service (1977) and Sangita Kalanidhi from the Madras Music Academy, South India's highest award for musicians (1973). In a review in 1977, the New York Times dance critic Anna Kisselgoff described her as one of the \"supreme performing artists in the world\". India Today, one of the leading news magazine of India, based on a survey, classified her as one of the 100 prominent Indians who have shaped the destiny of India. She was the only non-western dancer included in a compilation of the Dance Heritage Coalition, \"America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures: The First 100\" (2000).\n\n\nBengali film director Satyajit Ray made a documentary film on Balasaraswati named \"Bala\" (1976).\n\n\n"}

In , the CISSP designation was accredited under the ANSI . It is also formally approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in both their Information Assurance Technical (IAT) and Managerial (IAM) categories for their DoDD 8570 certification requirement. The CISSP has been adopted as a baseline for the U.S. National Security Agency's ISSEP program. CISSP is a globally recognized certification in the field of IT security.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, a need arose for a standardized, vendor-neutral certification program that provided structure and demonstrated competence. In November 1988, the Special Interest Group for Computer Security (SIG-CS), a member of the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA), brought together several organizations interested in this goal. The International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium or \"(ISC)²\" formed in mid-1989 as a non-profit organization.\n\nBy 1990, the first working committee to establish a \"Common Body of Knowledge\" (CBK) had been formed. The first version of the CBK was finalized by 1992, and the CISSP credential was launched by 1994.\n\nThe CISSP curriculum covers subject matter in a variety of Information Security topics. The CISSP examination is based on what (ISC)² terms the Common Body of Knowledge (or CBK). According to (ISC)², \"the CISSP CBK is a taxonomy – a collection of topics relevant to information security professionals around the world. The CISSP CBK establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles that allow information security professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding.\"\n\nFrom 15 April 2018, the CISSP curriculum is updated as follows:\n\nFrom 2015 to early 2018, the CISSP curriculum is divided into eight domains similar to the latest curriculum above.\n\nBefore 2015, it covered ten similar domains.\n\n\nNumber of CISSP members as of January 1, 2018.\n\nHolders of CISSP certifications can earn additional certifications in areas of specialty. There are three possibilities:\n\n\nThe CISSP credential is valid for three years; most holders renew by submitting Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits. There is also a yearly membership fee required to maintain certification. \n\nThe Annual Maintenance Fee (AMF) must be submitted by the anniversary date. \n\nOnce the CPE and AMF requirements are met, the certification will automatically renew for another three-year certification cycle. The certification will not renew until the current certification cycle expires. Typically, renewals are processed around the 1st and 15th of every month.\n\nAfter the certification(s) has been renewed, a confirmation email will be sent to the certification holder. An updated certificate and ID card will follow in the postal mail within 8 to 12 weeks.\n\nIn 2005, \"Certification Magazine\" surveyed 35,167 IT professionals in 170 countries on compensation and found that CISSPs led their list of certificates ranked by salary. A 2006 \"Certification Magazine\" salary survey also ranked the CISSP credential highly, and ranked CISSP concentration certifications as the top best-paid credentials in IT.\n\nIn 2008, another study came to the conclusion that IT professionals with CISSP (or other major security certifications) and at least 5 years of experience tend to have salaries around US$102,376, about US$21,000 (or 26%) higher than IT professionals with similar experience levels who do not have such certificates. Note that any actual cause-and-effect relationship between the certificate and salaries remains unproven.\n\nAs of 2017, a study by CyberSecurityDegrees.com surveyed some 10,000 current and historical cyber security job listings that preferred candidates holding CISSP certifications. CyberSecurityDegrees found that these job openings offered an average salary of $17,526 more than the average cyber security salary.\n\nANSI certifies that CISSP meets the requirements of ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024, a personnel certification accreditation program.\n"}

Families are the primary educators on non-classroom days; and (2) Homeschool Collaborative Program– 5-day per week of homeschool program with 1 optional day per week of inquiry-based workshops on campus. \n\nDa Vinci Communications High School offers a college-prep, project-based, real-world curriculum and career pathways in computer science, journalism, strategic communications, and music & media production.\n\nDa Vinci Design High School offers a college-prep, project-based, real-world curriculum and career pathways in architecture and graphic design. \n\nDa Vinci Science High School offers a college-prep, project-based, real-world curriculum and career pathways in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and biomedical engineering. \n\nDa Vinci RISE High offers an individualized education for foster, homeless, dropout, and other youth who have struggled in a traditional school setting. \n\nDa Vinci Extension offers three unique pathways leading to college degree completion, in partnership with College for America at Southern New Hampshire University, UCLA Extension, and El Camino College.\n\nPresident - Chet Pipkin, Founder, Chairman, President and CEO, Belkin International; Vice President - Dr. Donald Brann, former superintendent of Wiseburn School District and a member of the El Segundo City Council; Trustee - Art Lofton, (Retired) Sector Vice President Global Mission Excellence at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems; Treasurer - Brian Meath, Principal with Nigro Karlin Segal & Feldstein, LLP; Board Secretary - Jennifer Morgan, Wiseburn community member, small business owner; Trustee - Israel Mora, General Manager, Interstate Hotels; Trustee - Roger Bañuelos, President of Element Consulting, Inc.\n\nProject-based learning (PBL) is learn-by-doing curriculum that integrates core subjects with real-life problems to be solved. Teachers work in teams with one another to identify key content standards and essential skills that need to be addressed at the grade-level. Then, teachers work backwards to plan their curriculum, striving to create a project that centers on a big idea and a real world connection. Students work in teams to create a final product that demonstrates mastery of content standards and a demonstration of key skills. One of the most important aspects of project-based learning is a public presentation of the work created, as assessment is based on students’ ability to articulate and demonstrate the content and skills learned. For a recent Engineering project, students learned about mechanics and motion, then constructed a Medieval-style Trebuchet to calculate the trajectory of a ball’s travel from its starting point to its ending point represented by a quadratic equation.\n\nStudent progress is measured and assessed through traditional tests and quizzes, public presentations of learning, projects, and exhibitions.\n\nDa Vinci Schools' graduation requirements are aligned with the UC/Cal State admission requirements. 98% of the Class of 2018 graduates met the UC and CSU “A-G” requirements for admission; 78% of the Class of 2016 graduates received four-year university offers.\n\nDa Vinci Schools has strategic partnerships with many corporate, nonprofit and education institutions. Community partners offer students and faculty access to expert knowledge, industry-specific curriculum, internship opportunities, mentoring, teacher training, early college programs, career guidance, volunteer support, direct funding, and much more.\n\nSome of Da Vinci Schools’ partners include: Northrop Grumman, Belkin International, The Boeing Company, Chevron Corporation, Raytheon, SpaceX, Gensler, 72andSunny, Karten Design, Project Lead the Way, El Camino College, UCLA Extension, Southern New Hampshire University, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Loyola Marymount University, and many more.\n\nHigh school students have the opportunity to earn college credits for free while simultaneously earning their high school diploma. Higher education partners include El Camino College, UCLA Extension, Southern New Hampshire University, West L.A. College, and Cal State University Dominguez Hills.\n\nDa Vinci high school students have the opportunity to work unpaid at local businesses and corporations as part of the Real World Learning Program. The goal of the Work Experience Program is to provide students with workplace skills in a real-world environment. Additionally, the program is designed to develop a talent pool of diverse employees to meet the local community’s workforce planning objectives. Work Experience and Internship partners include Belkin, 72andSunny, Gensler, Northrop Grumman, SpaceX, Old Navy, Best Buy, Barnes and Noble, FIDM, Toyota Sports Center, New Earth, and many more.\n\nDa Vinci high school students are required to perform a minimum of 20 hours of Community Service each year. Community Service must be as a volunteer and benefit the community at large.\n\nStudents and families are guided through the college process, including the financial aid process, via college counseling with on-site counselors and advisory teachers. Starting in 10th grade, students receive additional guidance in testing, financial literacy, and in exploring college options. By the start of the senior year they will be ready to finalize their college lists and focus on the actual applications. Da Vinci seniors are required to apply to a minimum of two colleges. Students begin making college visits in the 9th grade. Past college visits have included trips to USC, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, Pepperdine University, LMU, and the Claremont Colleges.\n\nEvery student is enrolled in an Advisory class for the full 4 years of high school that includes students from 9-12 grade. The advisory class is a place where students can bond with each other, get academic support, and have a safe place to share their feelings.\n\nTechnology is integrated throughout the day in student performance, classroom instruction, data management, and communication. Da Vinci Schools recently adopted digital math and physics resources that students use both on campus and from home. A web-based student management system provides families a portal to check their child’s progress 24/7.\n\nSeminar classes (similar to electives) are practical, real-world non-core classes. Some recent seminar classes have included: Architecture and Design, Vehicle Design, Toy Design, Game Theory, Product and Industrial Design, Web Programming, Robotics, Flight School, Aerospace Engineering, Rocketry, Creative Writing, Leadership, Youth and Government, Drama, Yearbook, CrossFit, Yoga, Photography, and many more.\n\nDa Vinci Schools offer extracurricular activities, including CIF sports, after-school clubs, music, and more. There is also a non-profit Crossfit gym, Crossfit Zen, that offers a free after school exercise program for Da Vinci Science students. This program is funded by a once per year fundraiser, and Da Vinci Science students are creating a documentary that follows its development.\n"}

In the narrowest sense, it is education about compliance – Affirmative Action (AA), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), and sexual harassment.\" A competency based definition refers to diversity training as any solution designed to increase cultural diversity awareness, attitude, knowledge, and skills. Diversity training is thought to be more needed because of the growing ethnic and racial diversity in the workplace. While major corporations believe that diversity training and active diversity hiring will assist them in remaining competitive in a global economy, other large organizations (universities and colleges) have been slow to embrace diversity training. Diversity training is often aimed to meet objectives such as attracting and retaining customers and productive workers; maintaining high employee morale; and/or fostering understanding and harmony between workers. \n\nDespite purported and intended benefits, systematic studies have not shown benefits to diversity training and instead show that they backfire and lead to reductions in diversity and to discrimination complaints being taken less seriously.\n\nAccording to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive ideology and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people \"tiptoe\" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to communicate with and truly understand each other. Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as equal opportunity staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that White females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for African American females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. Networking and mentoring, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served African American females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods. Sue Steiner and collaborators have advocated that controversy be used as a cooperative learning style. They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.\n\nAlexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.\n\nAn analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce. Other research shows that people \"were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs\". As organizations and communities are becoming more globalized, there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment. Some scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve. According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization. There is an ability to create inventive solutions to issues being faced in the world market. \n\nAccording to \"Diversity Training University International students\", the most important diversity pioneers include:\n"}

Attending school is obligatory from the ages of 4 to 16.\n\nFundamental education (\"enseignement fondamental\") consists of pre-school and primary school. It is obligatory from the age of 4 onwards and is composed of 4 cycles instead of school years: \nThis system was introduced in the law of 21 January 2009.\n\nSecondary education lasts 6–7 years, and consists of:\nSchools of secondary education (that is, aimed towards university education) are called \"Lycées \"(or, colloquially, \"Lycée classique\"), while schools of secondary technical education are \"Lycées techniques\". Some \"Lycées\" offer both types of education. The oldest Lycée in the country is the Athénée de Luxembourg, established in 1603. For a long time, it was also the only secondary school.\n\n32 public Lycées and 5 private Lycées teach the state curriculum. Out of these, the following 4 have a special status to use innovative teaching techniques, while still using the public curriculum: \n\nHigher education in Luxembourg is dominated by the University of Luxembourg, this being the only fully-fledged university in Luxembourg. It was founded in 2003.\n\nThe following foreign universities have campuses or outposts in Luxembourg:\n\nHigher education is also offered by several \"lycées techniques\", in the areas of business and management, arts, and healthcare. After three years of study, this leads to the award of a \"Brevet de technicien supérieur\" (BTS).\n\nSince 2013, the Lycée classique d'Echternach offers \"classes préparatoires\" for the French grandes écoles.\n\nSince 2012, 3 Higher Education Institutes offer courses exclusively in English in Wiltz in the North of Luxembourg. The schools are located in the castle of Wiltz and are private, non-profit organisations and offer Bachelor, Master and DBA degrees. For information see http://www.bbi-edu.eu; http://www.ubi.edu; http://www.business-science-institute.com.\n\nThe vast majority of schools are state-run and free. However, some non-public schools exist. Some of these teach the same curriculum as state schools for the same diplomas, but charge tuition. Others teach foreign curricula and award foreign qualifications.\n\nAmong secondary schools, the following private schools teach the state curriculum and receive state subsidies:\nAnother five private schools teach a different curriculum, and receive fewer subsidies:\nThe European schools are public schools, in the sense that they accept (for free) the children of European Union civil servants, and those whose parents work for other organisations with some special agreement. Other parents may also send their children, spaces permitting, but must pay tuition. They consist of European Schools I and II, and award the European Baccalaureate.\n\nTri-lingualism is a feature of the state education system, and of Luxembourgish society in general.\n\nFrom pre-school onwards, Luxembourgish is spoken with the children. For the large number of foreign children in the country, this may be their first exposure to Luxembourgish. From the age of 6, children are taught to read and write German. The year after, French is introduced, while the vehicular language of teaching is German.\n\nIn secondary school, German is the vehicular language in the \"Lycées techniques\", and in the lower years of the \"Lycées classiques\". From the age of 15, however, French is used in \"Lycées classiques\". English is added as a further obligatory language in all secondary schools. In Lycées classiques, pupils may optionally also choose to take lessons in Latin, Spanish or Italian. The number of hours per week devoted to language teaching at all levels of school is high, at 50% of teaching time.\n\nSimilarly, for the University of Luxembourg, one of its defining features is its \"multi-lingual character\": it uses English, French and German.\n\nThe history of education in Luxembourg is closely linked to that of the Athénée de Luxembourg: in addition to being the oldest, and for a long time the only, secondary school in the country, it was also the home of Luxembourg's fledgling higher education courses for a while. It was founded as the Jesuit College (\"Collège des Jésuites\") in Luxembourg city in 1603, and from this it derives its nickname \"Kolleisch\". When the Jesuit order was abolished by the Pope in 1773, it became a Royal College, staffed by the secular clergy instead of Jesuits. The French occupation from 1795 to 1814 put an end to its activities. \n\nAn \"École centrale\" was created in its place from 1802, renamed an \"École Secondaire\" in 1805. It became a \"Collège communal\" in 1808, then a \"Gymnasium\" after Napoleon's defeat. It was renamed the \"Athénée Royal\" in 1817. That same year, the \"cours supérieurs\" (called \"cours académiques\" from 1824) were founded: these taught metaphysics, logic, physical sciences and mathematics, and were intended to compensate to an extent for the lack of a university in Luxembourg. Around the 1830s, the time of the Belgian Revolution, a distinction started to be made in the higher school years of the Athénée, between the \"gymnasium,\" for those intending to attend university, and the \"middle school\" (\"école moyenne\"), later the industrial and commercial school, for everyone else.\n\nIn 1830, most of Luxembourg (with the exception of the capital) sided with the Belgian Revolution against the Dutch King William I. The King-Grand Duke therefore sought to prevent young Luxembourgers from attending Belgian universities, which were hotbeds of anti-Dutch revolutionary sentiment. Belgian academic degrees were no longer recognised in Luxembourg from 1832, and an 1835 decree forced Luxembourgish students to study exclusively in the states of the German Confederation. This Germanisation policy continued with the Friedemann reform in 1837, which had the goal of turning the Athénée de Luxembourg into a preparatory school for German universities, and abolished the academic courses that had existed there since 1817, depriving Luxembourg of its embryo of higher education.\n\nWhen the country became independent in 1839 (while remaining under personal union with the Dutch king), it needed its own administrative and political institutions: one major problem was the education of future elites, who would replace the foreign functionaries and play a key role in society. William I's measures of 1835 and 1837 had oriented the education system towards Germany, but the specific geographical nature of the country also required links with French-speaking countries. The professors of the Athénée demanded a reform of secondary education and the re-establishment of the academic courses.\n\nWilliam II came to the throne in 1840, ending his father's policies of reaction and Germanisation. The Constitution of 1841 allowed a free choice of universities, and laid the foundation for an education policy that took account of the specificities of the country. The coming reform was supported by the liberals, but opposed by the advocates of the Friedemann reform. While it was generally agreed that establishing a fully-fledged university in the Grand-Duchy was not viable, the question of how to organise higher education was a divisive one. As in other areas, the Luxembourgers examined the neighbouring countries's systems to determine the best course to follow. The clerical faction was in support of the German system, while the Belgian model had liberal support. This latter system entrusted university examinations to a jury of professors as well as learned and reputable men drawn from different parts of society, and this was the system eventually chosen by Luxembourg. It was clear that, far from just being a demonstration of academic knowledge, degrees were seen as a test of one's ability to exercise public office, and therefore it was only fitting that they should be brought under tight state control. For the government, academic examinations were a matter of national sovereignty, which could not be entrusted to foreign universities. Automatically recognising foreign diplomas was out of the question.\n\nThe authorities decided, as a minimum, to re-establish the \"cours supérieurs\" at the Athénée, which were, however, just a pale imitation of higher education. The Luxembourgish state thereby gave itself the prerogative to confer academic degrees.\n\nThe system of academic degrees and the \"cours supérieurs\" was organised in the organic law of 23 July 1848: the Athénée would provide \"cours supérieurs\", preparing for the degree of \"candidat\" (obtainable after only one year) in physical sciences and mathematics on the one hand, and in philosophy and letters on the other. Degrees were to be awarded by examination juries in Luxembourg. Qualifications obtained elsewhere were not recognised in the Grand Duchy. The law did, however, oblige students to take courses at foreign universities, the contents of which would be tested by Luxembourgish juries. The law of 1848 was continually adapted over the next half-century. These changes, accompanied by passionate debates, concerned the subject matter to be examined, the creation of new degrees for certain professions, and an adaptation to the realities of university education: there were cases where the state prescribed the attendance of courses that were no longer offered anywhere. From 1882, the need to reform secondary education set off an argument over the nature, and indeed the purpose, of the \"cours supérieurs\". The Council of State was against abolishing them, as this would entail a reform of the law on academic awards. The debate was to flare up again in the early 20th century, but national sentiment prevailed: abandoning the \"cours supérieurs\", and the end of awarding degrees, would mean abandoning a part of the Luxembourgish nation's independence.\n\nThose graduating from the last year of gymnasium in the Athénée mostly went on to attend the \"cours supérieurs\". The familiar atmosphere and the money saved were the reasons behind this, as well as the fact that these professors would be on the examination juries. Until 1884, the letters section was predominant, attended by students preparing for law, philology or theology. Towards the end of the century, interest in the science section increased, with young adults devoting themselves to the hard sciences, pharmaceutics, and industrial studies.\n\nThe controversy over the \"cours supérieurs\" was partly due to their confusing nature. Accessible after an entrance exam, they took place in the building of the Athénée, a secondary school, and led to the award of certain degrees. But it was unclear whether these were an extension of secondary education, or the early stage of higher education. Even legislators and legal experts of the day had no definitive answer. They were described in 1882 by the Athénée's director as a \"hybrid institution\" between secondary and tertiary education; twenty years later, the jury for pharmacy termed them a \"mockery, a caricature of university courses.\" The courses' practical organisation was partly to blame. After 1848, the Athénée consisted of three establishments: the \"cours supérieurs\", the gymnasium, and the industrial school. But this was only a nominal division: the science section of the \"cours supérieurs\", for example, often consisted of lessons combined with the two highest years of the industrial school. There was barely a consensus on whether there was one or two \"cours supérieurs\". The Chamber of Deputies debated this in 1892, and decided in the end that there was one set of \"cours supérieurs\": the letters section of the \"cours supérieurs\" was taught by professors of the gymnasium, the science section by those of the industrial school. While many refused to admit it, these courses hardly fulfilled the requirements of university studies.\n\nThe professors' training was not necessarily of a higher standard. The degree of \"candidat\" was sufficient to teach until 1857, when a doctorate became a requirement for many teaching posts, and demanded by law from 1874. The professors' pay, on the other hand, did not increase. No special compensation was offered for those teaching \"cours supérieurs\".\n\nThe failure rates in the exams by the Luxembourgish juries was relatively low in the beginning, but increased steadily to reach 50% in 1901-1902. Results did not improve over the next few years. Some contemporaries saw this as a result of inherent flaws in the Luxembourgish system: the exams did not take into account the subject matter taught in the universities, and the examiners themselves were not up to speed with the latest research. The composition of the exam juries was problematic: without a university, the country did not have enough qualified teachers of an academic calibre. Their qualifications were questioned: a letter written to the \"Luxemburger Wort\" claimed that most examiners would not be able to pass their own exams. The problem was most serious for the subjects not taught in the \"cours supérieurs\", such as law, medecine, the profession of notary, pharmacy, and veterinary studies. To resolve this issue, professional persons were appointed to juries: high-ranking state functionaries, practising doctors, and notables.\n\nThe period both before and after the turn of the 20th century saw education reform. In the late 19th century, the political class became aware that the traditional system of education was not well-adapted to the needs of an industrial society. Economic developments had created new social and professional classes. A middle class of employees and civil servants emerged from the growth of state services and administration. Artisanship and trade were transformed by industrial and commercial progress.\n\nThe government of Baron Félix de Blochausen (1874-1885) enacted a decisive reform of primary education when it introduced obligatory schooling over the opposition of conservative deputies. School absenteeism was particularly widespread in rural areas, where the children helped on the fields. The \"loi Kirpach\" of 10 April 1881 (named after Henri Kirpach, the Director-General for the Interior) made school attendance mandatory between the ages of 6 and 12. This reform provoked bitter debates over the role of the state in society and the relations between church and state. The law also provided for a single system of public schools, and made it the state's duty to organise education. At the same time, however, the church remained involved, since the local parish priest was an \"ex officio\" member of the local commune's school commission, and the schoolteacher was under his supervision.\n\nThrough a far-reaching reform of the education system, the government of Paul Eyschen (1888-1915) attempted to respond to the changes in society. Eyschen was an advocate of the idea of specialisation of schools: the Athénée de Luxembourg for those intending to later pursue university studies, an industrial school for those destined for a technical occupation, an agriculture school for farmers' sons, and a craftwork school for the sons of craftsmen. Particular attention was given to vocational education.\n\nThe law of 1892 split off the industrial and commercial school from the Athénée and added to it a commercial section. In 1908, it moved to Limpertsberg, to later become the Lycée des Garçons de Luxembourg. The law of 1896 created an artisanal school. These efforts were accompanied by an increase in students attending secondary school under the Eyschen government: 875 in 1879-1880 compared to 2500 in 1919-1920. In 1891, the \"Soeurs de la Doctrine Chrétienne\" had responded to the government's invitation by opening a domestic agricultural school for young girls.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Echternach and Diekirch had each received a so-called \"pro-gymnasium\", which operated under the supervision of the headteacher of the Athénée. Later, these too became autonomous institutions, and the Athénée lost its tight grip on secondary and higher education in Luxembourg.\n\nEyschen's government also tackled primary education through the Education Law of 1912. This abolished school fees, and made school mandatory for 7 years. Most controversially, it rolled back the Church's position in schools: teachers no longer needed a certificate of morality from their priest to be employed, and were no longer obliged to teach religious education. The law of 1912 was the subject of bitter arguments between the Left Bloc (socialists and liberals) and the clerical Right.\n\nWhile in the rest of Europe, universities were opening their doors to women, Luxembourg was a late-comer in this regard. The establishment of two \"Lycées\" for young girls in 1909 and 1911 revealed the government's preoccupation with denying girls access to the Latin section, which granted sole access to universities. It was not until after the First World War, when they received the right to vote, that the first women attended exams for academic awards.\n\nThe state and the middle-class liberals who ran the government steadfastly refused to allow the opening of non-state schools, as demanded by the Church. At the same time, they allowed the clergy a lot of influence in teaching. The liberal Deputy Robert Brasseur complained of a \"clericalisation of education\". Around 20% of the secondary school professors were clerics, and this did not include the lay members of the Jesuits (\"Jésuites en courte robe\") alleged by Brasseur. Students in the \"cours supérieurs\" were obliged to participate in religious processions, and to attend Mass and confession every Sunday and Thursday. Some criticised the philosophy lessons, firmly in the hands of the philosopher-preachers, as being a \"theology course in disguise.\" In 1903 the Athénée's director tried to forbid students from attending a conference on the subject of the formation of the world, given by a Brussels professor. To some, it appeared that maintaining the \"cours supérieurs\" was a means of keeping a check on the students' ideology, whereas those who studied abroad might pick up foreign, radical ideas.\n\nUntil 1881, the Church still had plans for establishing a Catholic university in Luxembourg. In 1867, the General Assembly of Catholic Associations in Germany was looking for a location for a new free Catholic university—that is to say, one run by the Church. Luxembourgish priests campaigned for this to be in Luxembourg, emphasing the benefits this would bring to the country, and the government pledged its help, but the Chamber of Deputies was opposed. In any case, the new university was established in Fribourg in Switzerland instead. In 1881, Luxembourgish priests attempted to establish a university run by the Jesuits, who had been expelled from France. Neighbouring countries, however, were against the Jesuits setting up in the Grand Duchy, and the project was abandoned.\n\nThe Werner-Cravatte government (1964-1969) once again saw an urgent need to reform the education system, due to economic and social changes. The government attempted to respond by diversifying the types of Lycées in existence. 1965 saw the creation of middle schools (\"écoles moyennes\"): these were intended to cater to young people not quite suited for a university education, in order to prepare them for mid-level careers in the administration or the private sector, and to take the weight off the over-crowded Lycées. May 1968 also saw unrest in Luxembourg: the students of the \"cours supérieurs\" went on strike, demanding a reform of higher education and the awarding of academic degrees. The Werner-Cravatte government drafted a law which would not, however, come to a vote until the next government was in office. The Werner-Cravatte Ministry did introduce changes in the secondary education system: it aligned girls' education—previously in separate Lycées—with that of boys, and introduced co-education. Secondary education (as opposed to technical secondary education) was unified: two streams could be chosen, \"classical\" with Latin, and \"modern\", without Latin. For the upper school years, four sections were introduced.\n\nIt was under the second Werner-Schaus ministry that the system of academic awards dating back to 1848 was finally abolished, fulfilling the demands of the 1968 students. The law of 18 June 1969 stipulated that instead, degrees from other countries would be certified in Luxembourg.\n\nIn 1970, the \"cours supérieurs\" were integrated into the new \"Centre universitaire de Luxembourg\".\n\nThe Werner-Flesch government (1980-1984) introduced a move that harmonised public and private secondary schools: the law of 31 May 1982 provided for state subsidies for private schools, in return for allowing the state to supervise their curricula and their teachers' qualifications.\n\nThe initial idea of creating a Luxembourgish university was raised in a debate in the Chamber in 1993. In 2000, the government introduced a white paper on the matter. The law creating a University of Luxembourg was approved by the Chamber on 17 July 2003.\n\nThe Juncker-Polfer government also introduced further changes in secondary education. Tests conducted for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranked Luxembourgish students 30th out of 32 countries. The government therefore launched a \"back to basics\" programme. The conservative-socialist government from 2004 to 2009 also set up several new schools outside of the mainstream system, with innovative teaching methods: the \"Neie Lycée\" (now \"Lycée Ermesinde\"), \"Eis Schoul\", the \"École de la 2e chance,\" and the Deutsch-Luxemburgisches Schengen-Lyzeum Perl.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been shown in research to promote learning. Additionally, music study in general has been shown to improve academic performance of students. \n\nMusic used for learning can be in many formats, including video recordings, audio recordings, sheet music, and improvised music. Most of the time, music is added to an existing lesson plan or story. Songs are usually easy to sing and catchy, so that they can be repeated for later learning. Some children's music is considered Educational, and, historically, most educational music is geared towards children. Prominent examples include songs from LazyTown, \"Sesame Street\", \"Schoolhouse Rock\", Smart Songs' educational rap videos on YouTube, and Tom Lehrer's songs for the PBS show \"The Electric Company\".\n\nRecent developments have extended music's use to secondary and collegiate education, with Cornel West breaking new ground in this regard.\n\nVideo recordings are the most use of educational music. Television shows, DVDs, and even some movies use music to teach the viewer, whether it be a moral lesson or a scholastic lesson. Sesame Street and Schoolhouse Rock are examples of shows that use music to teach topics like math, science, and government. Things like counting, the names of the planets, or the law making process are put to music with simple lyrics to aid in retention of information.\n\nShows such as Little Einsteins use music as a story aid to teach decision-making and music recognition. Instrumental music represents different objects, people, animals, or actions to help the viewer distinguish between various options.\n\nShows such as Veggie Tales use a story as well as music to teach biblical and moral lessons to its viewers. This form uses songs to tie the story together and help the viewer remember important aspects of the story.\n\nAudio music recordings are also used prominently as a form of education. The website Songs for Teaching has many songs for teachers to use to help kids learn. Baby Genius is a very popular company that produces educational music CDs for children. \nThe European Union funded an education project to encourage early language learning called Lullabies of Europe that gathered and recorded lullabies in 7 European languages. Some Television shows and DVD series also make Audio recordings of their songs to further learning. \n\nImprovisation is used in educational music in a few settings. Teachers might make up a song for times tables and teach it to the students, perhaps having students add parts. Some people also make up songs to remember things or to study for a test.\n\nHip-hop demonstrates increasing relevance and success as a pedagogical tool in primary and secondary education. Flocabulary and Defined Mind, focusing primarily on vocabulary building for SAT and ACT_(examination) tests, have established a Web presence in addition to their textbooks. Smart Songs, concentrating on middle school, offers amusing and pertinent music video. Rhythm, Rhyme, Results uses hip hop music to help students learn lessons ranging from economics to photosynthesis. MC SKULE (Rohen Shah) of the non-profit SKULE.org makes parody music videos of popular songs where the lyrics teach math. Alex Kajitani, the 2009 California State Teacher of the Year, created original middle school math songs as the Rappin' Mathematician.\n\nSome schools integrate music with other subjects in the hope that the music and the other subjects enhance each other. With this mutual growth, educators hope to improve the overall quality and experiences of education.\n\nOne program that integrates music in education is the Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA) program, which is done through the Kennedy Center. CETA is a partnership between the Kennedy Center and eight arts focus schools in the Washington D.C. area. They work together to produce staff that can integrate the arts across the curriculum. CETA aims to integrate music and other arts, such as dance and visual arts, into other scholastic areas, such as math and science \"...to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.”\n\nThe objectives of CETA are to:\n\nArts Horizons is an arts in education organization that serves schools in New York and New Jersey. They integrate music, as well as other arts, into learning to help children gain appreciation for the arts as well as stimulate children “through the arts to improve their proficiency in reading, writing and math.”\n\nArts Horizons has a variety of programs, including:\n\nAn example of an assembly provided by Arts Horizons is the Peter and the Wolf program. In this program, an actor tells the tale of Peter and the Wolf while a woodwind quintet plays the music of Prokofiev to bring the story to life. After the story, students have a chance to learn about the woodwind instruments that were used in the story, as well as other woodwind instruments, and hear other folk tales.\n\nCETA has concrete evidence on the following:\n\nThere have been many studies on the use of music to aid in teaching, as well as how an individual who plays music fares in their education. Results show that using music when teaching children to read, for example, can help children learn how to read and give lasting results. A study on elementary students even showed that students with music training have overall better verbal memory, compared to the memory of those students of the same demographic without music training.\n\n"}
{"id": "33400962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33400962", "title": "Erasmus Smith", "text": "Erasmus Smith\n\nErasmus Smith (1611 – 1691) was an English merchant and a landowner with possessions in England and Ireland. Having acquired significant wealth through trade and land transactions, he became a philanthropist in the sphere of education, treading a path between idealism and self-interest during a period of political and religious turbulence. His true motivations remain unclear.\n\nSmith's family owned manors in Leicestershire and held Protestant beliefs. He became a merchant, supplying provisions to the armies of the Puritan Oliver Cromwell – during Cromwell's suppression of rebellion in Ireland — and an alderman of the City of London. His financial and landowning status was greatly enhanced by benefiting from his father's subscription to the Adventurers' Act from which he gained extensive landholdings in Ireland as a reward, and from his own speculative practice of buying additional subscriptions from other investors. \n\nDuring the period of Cromwell's rule and the subsequent Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property was used for the purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.\n\nErasmus Smith was born in 1611 and baptised on 8 April of that year at Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire. He was the second son of Roger Smith and his second wife, Anna (née Goodman). The family had changed their name to Smith from Heriz (or Harris) when they inherited the manor of Edmondthorpe during the reign of Henry VII, and it was Erasmus's paternal grandfather, also called Erasmus, who had bought the manor of Husbands Bosworth in 1565. Henry \"Silver-tongued\" Smith, the Puritan preacher, was an uncle of Erasmus, and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Goodman, was a wealthy London merchant.\n\nThe contacts of Thomas Goodman enabled Erasmus to serve a seven-year apprenticeship in London with a poultry merchant, John Saunders, and he was made a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 10 February 1635. By 1631 Roger Smith had become an alderman of the City of London and in 1635 he was knighted; Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps, being elected an alderman in 1657, but preferred to pay a fine of £420 in order to be released from the duties of office. In these early years he was also unwilling to have much involvement in the business of the Grocers' Company, although this changed later in life: the cause of his initial reluctance may have been his preference to concentrate on acquiring his wealth. According to the records of the Aldermen of the City of London, Erasmus was Member of Parliament for Ardee in County Louth between 1665 and 1666.\n\nIn July 1642 Roger Smith subscribed £225 under the terms of the Adventurers' Act of 1641, whereby money loaned to the government of Charles I for the purpose of suppressing the Irish rebellion was secured by lands to be confiscated in that country. The lands had been confiscated in law but it would require the overthrow of the rebels in order to realise those property assets. The subsequent Doubling Ordinance of 1643 allowed those who had subscribed to receive twice the amount of land if they added a further 25 per cent of their initial financial aid: Roger Smith accepted those terms, contributing a further £75 in July 1643 and then two more payments of £75 in August and in October of that year.\n\nErasmus Smith had become a \"Turkey merchant\". He was a Protestant and, like his father, by 1650 he was supplying foodstuffs to Oliver Cromwell's armies in the civil wars of that time. This applied in particular to military activities in Ireland, where the rebellion of 1641 was believed by him and others to have resulted in part from a failure of education in that country.\n\nW. J. R. Wallace, in his history of Smith and the eponymous Trust, notes that the first record of Erasmus being in Ireland is from 1648 and that \n\nBy the time that the rebellion was suppressed in 1653, and just prior to the first assignments of land under the terms of the Settlement of Ireland Act, 1652, Roger had registered the transfer of his investment to Erasmus. Erasmus had speculated by buying out the interests of other subscribers, who had tired of the delay in seeing a reward from their investment; and he was also entitled to further land grants in payment for his supplies to the army. What began as a grant of eventually became — by the 1680s, after various wranglings and adjustments — over situated in nine counties, and Erasmus had an estimated worth of £120,000. Some of these lands, notably those in Connaught, may have been obtained fraudulently by Erasmus, who together with his nephew Edward Smith, sat on the committee based at Grocers' Hall whose purpose was the allocation of lots for the distribution of land between the debenture holders. Edward Smith was subsequently appointed to a Court of Claims in Dublin, where he may also have favoured his uncle Erasmus in his applications for land.\n\nAlthough Smith visited Dublin while overseeing his land purchases, he had no desire actually to live in Ireland. In 1655 – the year that his father died – he proposed that some of the profits from his Irish lands should be used to support five Protestant schools for boys. A Trust was established for this purpose in 1657, in relation to which Smith and the Grocers' Company had various powers of oversight. There were 18 trustees, the principal of whom was Henry Jones, who was soon to become Protestant Bishop of Meath. There have been various suggestions since at least the 19th century that creating the trust may not have been an altruistic act but rather one intended to curry favour and counter any possible legal challenges to holdings over which he had a tenuous claim, such as those obtained in Connaught. Writing in 1824, Hely Dutton said in his \"Statistical Survey of County Galway\" that \n\nThe Trust initially encompassed of his land. In keeping with his religious views, the schools were to teach their pupils \"fear of God and good literature and to speak the English tongue\", and both prayers and catechism (in the style of the Presbyterian Assembly of Divines) were compulsory. Those pupils who showed particular promise were to have the opportunity of taking up scholarships at Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nHis plans for the Trust were, however, overtaken by events. Cromwell died in 1658 and Smith's arrangements were not entirely acceptable to the new regime. The Restoration period, which began around 1660 and saw Charles II become king, was not sympathetic to the Puritan beliefs of the Cromwellian Interregnum. Nonetheless, Smith's venture was able to survive the political upheaval and change in moral tone, albeit in modified form. That it did so was largely due to his wealth and connections, but also because the educational purpose for which his lands were being used was clearly beneficial and because he engaged in many lawsuits in order to protect both his own interests and those of family and friends. Referred to by his enemies as \"pious Erasmus with the golden purse\", Smith came to an arrangement in 1667 which reduced the number of schools to three and required that he give £100 annually to one of Charles's favourite institutes, Christ's Hospital. The terms stipulated that although the schools were to be for the free education of children of Smith's tenants, they should each provide education on similar terms to a further 20 children from poor families, and that additional children could be schooled at a charge not to exceed two shillings.\n\nWallace argues that Smith \n\nA Royal Charter was granted to the Trust in 1669. This stipulated its name to be \"The Governors of the Schools Founded by Erasmus Smith, Esq.\" and provided for a seal bearing the words \"We are faithful to our Trust\". By 1675, the new board of 32 trustees had around £600 per annum available to them from the landholdings; by the first quarter of the 18th century this had risen to £1100. Free schools were established in Templemore, Galway and Drogheda. Funding was also given to another school, in Dublin: the recently founded King's Hospital School benefited from the trust's interest by being provided with twenty scholarships at Trinity College and also apprenticeships. The trust also funded a lectureship in Hebrew at the College, and arrangements were in place to that any surplus funds generated were used for purposes such as clothing the poor children in the grammar schools and arranging apprenticeships.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Irish schools were not as successful as Smith had anticipated. He and others attributed this to the resentment shown by Catholics, and there was also resentment from those charged with sending Irish rent money to England's Christ's Hospital.\n\nThe arrangement by which an annual grant was given to Christ's Hospital corresponded with Smith's own interests in that institution. The Hospital had for many years enjoyed close links with various Livery Companies and Smith had become a Governor there in 1658. The aftermath of the Great Fire of London in 1666, as a consequence of which the Hospital was destroyed, demonstrated his interest. He wrote that \n\nSmith was a benefactor during the period of reconstruction. He became frustrated that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him under the terms of the Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.\n\nVarious parties then engaged in legal actions and in petitions to both Charles II and his successor from 1685, James II. With the added complication of James II being overthrown by William of Orange, the dispute remained unresolved at the time of Smith's death.\n\nSmith had married Mary Hare, the 20-year-old daughter of , in 1670 when he was 59. The couple had nine children, five of whom were baptised in Clerkenwell, where he had lived at St John's Court for many years.\n\nIn 1683 he bought the manor of Hamerton, Huntingdonshire, in the parish church of which he was buried, next to his wife, upon his death some time between 25 August and 9 October 1691. He had also bought Weald Hall in 1685.\n\nSmith's six sons and three daughters mostly died young. One, Hugh Smith, inherited Weald and Hamerton from his older siblings in 1732 and appointed his two daughters as co-heirs. One of those daughters, Lucy, married into the Stanley family. Her husband changed his surname to become James Smith-Stanley, Lord Strange, and the couple were the parents of Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby.\n\n, the Erasmus Smith Trust continues to operate.\n\nFour professorships at Trinity College are named after him:\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

Typically, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment is between €300 to €500 a month, two-bedroom is between €400 to €550 a month, while the rent for a three-bedroom apartment is between €550 to €650 a month. The cost of living in Nicosia depends on the lifestyle of each individual. For the average student, it is calculated between €450 to €550 a month.\n\nOn the University campus, a cafeteria-restaurant offers meals and snacks at regulated prices. The cafeteria-restaurant is open daily from 8:00am – 9:00pm except for Saturday and Sunday.\n\nStudent Life\n\nCampus life at European University Cyprus focuses on the intellectual, occupational, social and cultural growth and nurturing of students. Students are encouraged to become involved with one or more clubs and student organizations. Extracurricular activities range from Legal Rhetoric Speech Contests, Cultural Nights, Meditation, BBQs, Parties, Excursions and Festivals.\n\nThe Laureate Professional Assessment\n\nThe LPA – Laureate Professional Assessment is a tool employed by the Career Center for the purpose of facilitating the transition of young graduates into the labor market. This specific assessment tool, developed by Laureate International Universities seeks to measure and record the individual skills of graduates. At the end of the academic year, each graduate will be examined on the basis of the LPA psychometric tool. A personal assessment report – the LPA Certificate – describing their performance, their skills and personal traits across a range of competencies will compliment their academic and personal achievements and considerably boost their job search process.\n\nCareer Center\n\nThe Career Center was established in 1989 and has provided students as well as alumni with personal and career development counseling and advice. The Center maintains links to a wide range of local and regional public sector organizations and private corporations. Every year the Career Center invites distinguished professionals from various fields to talk to students helping them broaden their scope and understanding of the job market as well as refine their own professional choices. European University Cyprus has adopted and developed several specialized tools to assist its students including the Employability Database and the Ariadne Psychometric Tool and is an active member of the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience IAESTE.\n\n"}

V. Raman, and was registered as a Society on 24 April 1934. Inaugurated on 31 July 1934, it began with 65 founding fellows. The first general meeting of Fellows, held on the same day, elected Raman as President, and adopted the constitution of the Academy.\n\nThe aims of the Academy are to:\n\n\nThe first issue of the Academy Proceedings appeared in two sections in July 1934. They were split into two in July 1935 - one part devoted to physical sciences and the other to life sciences. In 1973 the Academy's publications were further split into several journals aimed as specific scientific disciplines.\n\nThe Academy publishes a monthly journal called \"Resonance\" since January 1996. Aimed generally at under-graduates, it also contains some material for junior and senior academic levels. Each issue focuses on the life and work of a famous scientist. It incorporates articles reviewing new books and classics. The Editorial Board comprises 40 scientists from across the country.\n\nThe Academy also publishes a monthly research journal called \"Sadhana - Academy Proceedings in Engineering Sciences\" since 1978. The journal covers all branches of Engineering Science. Sadhana is distributed in print outside India and online worldwide by Springer.\n\nAimed at enriching scientific education, the Academy launched \"Project Lifescape\" in collaboration with the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science to spread biodiversity literacy. It aims to involve school and college students in obtaining first hand information on the status of, and ongoing changes in, ecological habitats of a set of species of considerable human significance. An objective of the project is to publish illustrated accounts of 1500 Indian species of micro-organisms, plants and animals. The accounts would also include ancillary information on the distribution, ecology and behaviour of the species.\n\nThe project has published three books, \"Butterflies of Peninsular India\", \"Freshwater Fishes of Peninsular India\", and \"Amphibians of Peninsular India\". A fourth, \"Dragonflies and Damselflies of Peninsular India\" is available in electronic format, freely downloadable from the project website.\n\nThe Government of India instituted the \"Raman Chair\" in 1972 to commemorate the memory of the founder of the Academy. Eminent scientists are invited by the Council of the Academy to occupy the Chair, for periods of between six weeks and six months.\n\nThe Academy sponsors and conducts two week Refresher Courses for selected teachers from across India. It awards annual Summer Fellowships to some of the brightest and talented teachers and students to work with Academy Fellows on research-oriented projects in various research centres across India including IISc, Bangalore. It conducts Lecture Programmes at schools and universities on appropriate research topics.\n\nThe list of presidents of the academy.\n\n"}

Students gain relevant technical training lasting from 4 weeks to 18 months. IAESTE includes committees representing more than 80 countries, with the potential of accepting new countries into the organization every year. At the general conference 2005 held in Cartagena, Colombia, the statute and by-laws of IAESTE a.s.b.l. were established, making IAESTE a registered \"associacion sans but lucratif\" (non-profit organization), with the centre in Luxembourg. The current President is prof. Bernard Baeyens from Colombia. IAESTE's motto is \"Work, Experience, Discover\". IAESTE's aims are to connect students with employers in foreign countries, provide university students with technical experience, and culturally enrich students and their host communities.\n\nIAESTE was founded in 1948 at Imperial College, London. The Imperial College Vacation Work Committee headed by Mr. James Newby initiated a meeting with national organizations from 10 European countries in a post war effort to promote better understanding between countries and cultures.\n\nSince 1948, the association has grown to include more than 80 countries worldwide and has exchanged in excess of 300,000 students. IAESTE exchanges around 7000 students annually playing an important role in giving technical undergraduates practical work experience and a global perspective.\n\nThe IAESTE Association is a confederation of National Committees representing academic, industrial, and student interests. Coordinating the daily administration of the association is the responsibility of the President. The President is elected for two years and is responsible for the General Conference or the GC as it is called in IAESTE. The GC makes the formal decisions in IAESTE and is composed of one delegate (National Secretary) from each country. The GC meets every year in January and is a forum for discussion.\n\nThe Board is an elected body which prepares the work of the General Conference and advises the President. It is composed of four elected members and the President.\n\nThe GC is the most important event of IAESTE each year. Here every country brings job offers they have obtained in their own country. Every job is written on a standardized form stating where and when the job is, who is eligible for the job and which qualifications (language, skills, etc.) are required. The jobs are traded during the \"Exchange Sessions\". During these sessions, countries meet and try to get the best possible jobs to bring back home. This is very hectic as countries try to get the best jobs. These jobs either have to fit pre-selected students or are open for applications from students back home.\n\nOne other notable event at the GC is the \"International Party\". At this party, every member country brings a national dish, drinks and clothes.\n\nThe international work is funded by member fees based on GDP per capita and the number of students sent abroad and is paid by the National Committees.\n\nThe National Committees represent the member countries and are composed of persons representing academic, industrial and student interests. Every full member of the IAESTE has one vote at the GC. The National Secretary is normally the person with the formal vote, even though the decisions are often made by the whole National Committee.\n\nEach National Committee is responsible for the administration of the exchange in its own country. Membership is given after the establishment of a National Committee in accordance with the statutes of IAESTE, together with a responsible permanent secretariat. The type of secretariat which administers the exchange varies according to each country's national structure, educational system, and funding policies. The essential requirement is that the national secretariat, whatever its organization and status, should have competent permanent staff.\n\nEvery country has their own way of organizing the work of IAESTE, but the National Committee can mainly be classified into four categories:\n\nIAESTE varies a lot from country to country and even within countries there can be a big difference from one city to another. Traineeships also vary a lot: some countries have extended programmes with students employed to help and organize events, while in other places arriving trainees organize events themselves.\n\nThe most important international event that connects IAESTE leaders from all over the world. Next AC will be held by IAESTE Cyprus. It will host the 72nd IAESTE Annual Conference in January 2019 (18 January to 24 January 2019 in Limassol). More information you can find here.\n73rd AC will be held by IAESTE Slovakia in January 2020.\n\nPast ACs\n\nThe Friends of IAESTE Network (FoIN) was founded 1996 in Denmark as the official Alumni branch of IAESTE, with the goal of helping former IAESTE trainees and members keep in touch.\n\nIn 2010, FoIN was re-branded as the IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN) and an Alumni Relations Manager was appointed to oversee all activities. The current holder of this position is Bruce Wicks from the United Kingdom. In 2011, IAN launched a new, online network which currently has over 10,000 members.\n\nIn 2005, an international IAESTE Day was created, for the purpose of global promotion of the organization as well as the celebration of its aims and goals. Starting with 6 countries, IAESTE Day was celebrated in 28 of its member countries in 2007. IAESTE Day is held on 20 October every year.\n\nJoin Us to Motivate People (JUMP) is the \"Motivation and Training Seminar\" of IAESTE. JUMP was founded in 1995 in Vienna, Austria on the initiative of Martin Klaus, former National Secretary of IAESTE Austria. Martin became co-ordinator of JUMP, later this role was taken over by Adrian Keller from IAESTE Switzerland, and in 2009 by Tomasz (Tomek) Pawliszyn from IAESTE Poland.\nJUMP is aimed to young members of IAESTE who want to explore more the organisation and meet other members of IAESTE.\n\nPrimarily new members of IAESTE meet in a different European city each year during four days in September or October for training sessions and discussion groups. An important component is cultural exchange with corporate tours, cultural events and tours and social events incorporating local cuisine and customs. The theme song for the seminar is Jump (For My Love) by the Pointer Sisters.\n\nUsually 40 - 70 participants take part in the event. Each JUMP is combined of six workshop sessions, led by experienced members, that cover the essence of IAESTE activities:\nAdditionally all participants visit various information boots on the topics of summer reception, career fairs, career websites, etc. All together combined with IAESTE related games, international evening, sightseeing trip and company presentation to show that IAESTE is much more than the exchange of job offers. One of the other highlights are motivation speeches by invited guests.\n\nThe Central European Convention is a group of several IAESTE member countries in the specific geographic region. Those are all \"student-run\" countries, so students are in the decision making positions (contrary to academic or professional-run countries).\n\nThose countries agree to meet twice a year and hold working and discussion groups. At the same time, they get to know the culture of the hosting country.\n\n\nThe Central European Convention (CEC) was founded in May 1998 in Tuheljske Toplice, Croatia, on the initiative of Thomas Haim, former National Secretary IAESTE AUSTRIA, and Mario Kauzlaric, former National Secretary IAESTE CROATIA. Because of the great success, the CEC is held 2 times a year.\n\nPast CECs\n\n"}

{"id": "16861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16861", "title": "Kurt Vonnegut", "text": "Kurt Vonnegut\n\nKurt Vonnegut Jr. (; November 11, 1922April 11, 2007) was an American writer. In a career spanning over 50 years, Vonnegut published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction. He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969).\n\nBorn and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vonnegut attended Cornell University but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, with whom he had three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband was killed in a train accident.\n\nVonnegut published his first novel, \"Player Piano\", in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively but was not commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as \"Cat's Cradle\" (1963) and \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\" (1964). Vonnegut's breakthrough was his commercially and critically successful sixth novel, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\". The book's anti-war sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing Vietnam War and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" went to the top of \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures and commencement addresses around the country and received many awards and honors.\n\nLater in his career, Vonnegut published several autobiographical essays and short-story collections, including \"Fates Worse Than Death\" (1991), and \"A Man Without a Country\" (2005). After his death, he was hailed as a morbidly comical commentator on the society in which he lived and as one of the most important contemporary writers. Vonnegut's son Mark published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled \"Armageddon in Retrospect\". In 2017, Seven Stories Press published \"Complete Stories\", a collection of Vonnegut's short fiction including 5 previously unpublished stories. \"Complete Stories\" was collected and introduced by Vonnegut friends and scholars Jerome Klinkowitz and Dan Wakefield. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.\n\nKurt Vonnegut Jr. was born on November 11, 1922, in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was the youngest of three children of Kurt Vonnegut Sr. and his wife Edith (born Lieber). His older siblings were Bernard (born 1914) and Alice (born 1917). Vonnegut was descended from German immigrants who settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his patrilineal great-grandfather, Clemens Vonnegut of Westphalia, Germany, settled in Indianapolis and founded the Vonnegut Hardware Company. Kurt's father, and his father before him, Bernard, were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt Sr. designed such buildings as Das Deutsche Haus (now called \"The Athenæum\"), the Indiana headquarters of the Bell Telephone Company, and the Fletcher Trust Building. Vonnegut's mother was born into Indianapolis high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city, their fortune derived from ownership of a successful brewery.\n\nAlthough both of Vonnegut's parents were fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country during and after World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon that culture to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach their youngest son German or introduce him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling \"ignorant and rootless.\" Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper for the first 10 years of his life, for raising him and giving him values. \"[She] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me. So she was as great an influence on me as anybody.\" Vonnegut described Young as \"humane and wise\", adding that \"the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs\" came from her.\n\nThe financial security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts once enjoyed were destroyed in a matter of years. The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of Prohibition in the United States. When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce. Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed in a public school, called Public School No. 43, now known as the James Whitcomb Riley School. He was not bothered by this, but both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a \"dreamy artist\". His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred \"as corrosive as hydrochloric acid\" for her husband. Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried to sell short stories to magazines like \"Collier's\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\" with no success.\n\nVonnegut enrolled at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in 1936. While there, he played clarinet in the school band and became a co-editor (along with Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, \"The Shortridge Echo\". Vonnegut said his tenure with the \"Echo\" allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was \"fun and easy\". \"It just turned out that I could write better than a lot of other people\", Vonnegut observed. \"Each person has something he can do easily and can't imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut enrolled at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He wanted to study the humanities or become an architect like his father, but his father and brother, a scientist, urged him to study a \"useful\" discipline. As a result, Vonnegut majored in biochemistry, but he had little proficiency in the area and was indifferent towards his studies. As his father had been a member at MIT, Vonnegut was entitled to join the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and did. He overcame stiff competition for a place at the university's independent newspaper, \"The Cornell Daily Sun\", first serving as a staff writer, then as an editor. By the end of his freshman year, he was writing a column titled \"Innocents Abroad\" which reused jokes from other publications. He later penned a piece, \"Well All Right\", focusing on pacifism, a cause he strongly supported, arguing against U.S. intervention in World War II.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor brought the U.S. into the war. Vonnegut was a member of Reserve Officers' Training Corps, but poor grades and a satirical article in Cornell's newspaper cost him his place there. He was placed on academic probation in May 1942 and dropped out the following January. No longer eligible for a student deferment, he faced likely conscription into the United States Army. Instead of waiting to be drafted, he enlisted in the army and in March 1943 reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for basic training. Vonnegut was trained to fire and maintain howitzers and later received instruction in mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee as part of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP). In early 1944, the ASTP was canceled due to the Army's need for soldiers to support the D-Day invasion, and Vonnegut was ordered to an infantry battalion at Camp Atterbury, south of Indianapolis in Edinburgh, Indiana, where he trained as a scout. He lived so close to his home that he was \"able to sleep in [his] own bedroom and use the family car on weekends\". On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave for Mother's Day weekend to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous night by overdosing on sleeping pills. Possible factors that contributed to Edith Vonnegut's suicide include the family's loss of wealth and status, Vonnegut's forthcoming deployment overseas, and her own lack of success as a writer. She was inebriated at the time and under the influence of prescription drugs.\n\nThree months after his mother's suicide, Vonnegut was sent to Europe as an intelligence scout with the 106th Infantry Division. In December 1944, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge, the final German offensive of the war. During the battle, the 106th Infantry Division, which had only recently reached the front and was assigned to a \"quiet\" sector due to its inexperience, was overrun by advancing German armored forces. Over 500 members of the division were killed and over 6,000 were captured.\n\nOn December 22, Vonnegut was captured with about 50 other American soldiers. Vonnegut was taken by boxcar to a prison camp south of Dresden, in Saxony. During the journey, the Royal Air Force bombed the prisoner trains and killed about 150 men. Vonnegut was sent to Dresden, the \"first fancy city [he had] ever seen\". He lived in a slaughterhouse when he got to the city, and worked in a factory that made malt syrup for pregnant women. Vonnegut recalled the sirens going off whenever another city was bombed. The Germans did not expect Dresden to get bombed, Vonnegut said. \"There were very few air-raid shelters in town and no war industries, just cigarette factories, hospitals, clarinet factories.\"\nOn February 13, 1945, Dresden became the target of Allied forces. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a fierce firebombing of the city. The offensive subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled at the level of both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. \"It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around\", Vonnegut said. \"When we came up the city was gone ... They burnt the whole damn town down.\" Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble. He described the activity as a \"terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt\".\n\nThe American prisoners of war were evacuated on foot to the border of Saxony and Czechoslovakia after General George S. Patton captured Leipzig. With the captives abandoned by their guards, Vonnegut reached a prisoner-of-war repatriation camp in Le Havre, France, before the end of May 1945, with the aid of the Soviets. He returned to the United States and continued to serve in the Army, stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, typing discharge papers for other soldiers. Soon after he was awarded a Purple Heart about which he remarked \"I myself was awarded my country's second-lowest decoration, a Purple Heart for frost-bite.\" He was discharged from the U.S. Army and returned to Indianapolis.\n\nAfter he returned to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill, as an anthropology student in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that conferred a master's degree. He augmented his income by working as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study Russian literature as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, Mark (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on the Ghost Dance religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.\n\nShortly thereafter, General Electric (GE) hired Vonnegut as a publicist for the company's Schenectady, New York, research laboratory. Although the job required a college degree, Vonnegut was hired after claiming to hold a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Chicago. His brother Bernard had worked at GE since 1945, contributing significantly to an iodine-based cloud seeding project. In 1949, Kurt and Jane had a daughter named Edith. Still working for GE, Vonnegut had his first piece, titled \"Report on the Barnhouse Effect\", published in the February 11, 1950 issue of \"Collier's\", for which he received $750. Vonnegut wrote another story, after being coached by the fiction editor at \"Collier's\", Knox Burger, and again sold it to the magazine, this time for $950. Burger suggested he quit GE, a course he had contemplated before. Vonnegut moved with his family to Cape Cod, Massachusetts to write full-time, and left GE in 1951.\n\nOn Cape Cod, Vonnegut made most of his money writing pieces for magazines such as \"Collier's\", \"The Saturday Evening Post\", and \"Cosmopolitan\". He also did a stint as an English teacher, wrote copy for an advertising agency, and opened the first USA Saab dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, \"Player Piano\", was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers have been replaced by machines.\n\n\"Player Piano\" draws upon Vonnegut's experience as an employee at GE. He satirizes the drive to climb the corporate ladder, one that in \"Player Piano\" is rapidly disappearing as automation increases, putting even executives out of work. His central character, Paul Proteus, has an ambitious wife, a backstabbing assistant, and a feeling of empathy for the poor. Sent by his boss, Kroner, as a double agent among the poor (who have all the material goods they want, but little sense of purpose), he leads them in a machine-smashing, museum-burning revolution. \"Player Piano\" expresses Vonnegut's opposition to McCarthyism, something made clear when the Ghost Shirts, the revolutionary organization Paul penetrates and eventually leads, is referred to by one character as \"fellow travelers\".\n\nIn \"Player Piano\", Vonnegut originates many of the techniques he would use in his later works. The comic, heavy-drinking Shah of Bratpuhr, an outsider to this dystopian corporate United States, is able to ask many questions that an insider would not think to ask, or would cause offense by doing so. For example, when taken to see the artificially intelligent supercomputer EPICAC, the Shah asks it \"what are people for?\" and receives no answer. Speaking for Vonnegut, he dismisses it as a \"false god\". This type of alien visitor would recur throughout Vonnegut's literature.\n\n\"The New York Times\" writer and critic Granville Hicks gave \"Player Piano\" a positive review, favorably comparing it to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\". Hicks called Vonnegut a \"sharp-eyed satirist\". None of the reviewers considered the novel particularly important. Several editions were printed—one by Bantam with the title \"Utopia 14\", and another by the Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club—whereby Vonnegut gained the repute of a science fiction writer, a genre held in disdain by writers at that time. He defended the genre, and deplored a perceived sentiment that \"no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and understand how a refrigerator works.\"\n\nAfter \"Player Piano\", Vonnegut continued to sell short stories to various magazines. In 1954 the couple had a third child, Nanette. With a growing family and no financially successful novels yet, Vonnegut's short stories sustained the family. In 1958, his sister, Alice, died of cancer two days after her husband, James Carmalt Adams, was killed in a train accident. Vonnegut adopted Alice's three young sons—James, Steven, and Kurt, aged 14, 11, and 9, respectively.\n\nGrappling with family challenges, Vonnegut continued to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar in terms of plot. \"The Sirens of Titan\" (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp that allows him to appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera \"The Tales of Hoffmann\".\n\nRumfoord, who is based on Franklin D. Roosevelt, also physically resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described, \"he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up.\" William Rodney Allen, in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\" and \"Jailbird\".\n\n\"Mother Night\", published in 1961, received little attention at the time of its publication.

Campbell Jr., Vonnegut's protagonist, is an American who goes to Nazi Germany during the war as a double agent for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, and rises to the regime's highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as Adolf Eichmann, and later commits suicide. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition, \"we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be\". Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", to illustrate the tendency for \"impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion\".\n\nAlso published in 1961 was Vonnegut's short story, \"Harrison Bergeron\", set in a dystopic future where all are equal, even if that means disfiguring beautiful people and forcing the strong or intelligent to wear devices that negate their advantages. Fourteen-year-old Harrison is a genius and athlete forced to wear record-level \"handicaps\" and imprisoned for attempting to overthrow the government. He escapes to a television studio, tears away his handicaps, and frees a ballerina from her lead weights. As they dance, they are killed by the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers. Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that \"Harrison Bergeron\" might have sprung from his envy and self-pity as a high school misfit. In his 1976 biography of Vonnegut, Stanley Schatt suggested that the short story shows \"in any leveling process, what really is lost, according to Vonnegut, is beauty, grace, and wisdom\". Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on \"Harrison Bergeron\", theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War misunderstandings of communism and socialism.\n\nWith \"Cat's Cradle\" (1963), Allen wrote, \"Vonnegut hit full stride for the first time\". The narrator, John, intends to write of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the fictional fathers of the atomic bomb, seeking to cover the scientist's human side. Hoenikker, in addition to the bomb, has developed another threat to mankind, ice-9, solid water stable at room temperature, and if a particle of it is dropped in water, all of it becomes ice-9. Much of the second half of the book is spent on the fictional Caribbean island of San Lorenzo, where John explores a religion called Bokononism, whose holy books (excerpts from which are quoted), give the novel the moral core science does not supply. After the oceans are converted to ice-9, wiping out most of humankind, John wanders the frozen surface, seeking to have himself and his story survive.\n\nVonnegut based the title character of \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\" (1964), on an accountant he knew on Cape Cod, who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a volunteer fire department, and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers, and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs. Allen deemed \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\" more \"a cry from the heart than a novel under its author's full intellectual control\", that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.\n\nAfter spending almost two years at the writer's workshop at the University of Iowa, teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At the time of the bombing, Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he came to believe that 135,000 had died there.\n\nVonnegut had been writing about his war experiences at Dresden ever since he returned from the war, but had never been able to write anything acceptable to himself or his publishers—Chapter 1 of \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" tells of his difficulties. Released in 1969, the novel rocketed Vonnegut to fame. It tells of the life of Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnegut was born in 1922 and survives the bombing of Dresden. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story's climaxes—Billy's death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy's friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot—disclosed in the story's first pages. In 1970, he was also a correspondent in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War.\n\"Slaughterhouse-Five\" received generally positive reviews, with Michael Crichton writing in \"The New Republic\", \"he writes about the most excruciatingly painful things. His novels have attacked our deepest fears of automation and the bomb, our deepest political guilts, our fiercest hatreds and loves. No one else writes books on these subjects; they are inaccessible to normal novelists.\" The book went immediately to the top of \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. Vonnegut's earlier works had appealed strongly to many college students, and the antiwar message of \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" resonated with a generation marked by the Vietnam War. He later stated that the loss of confidence in government that Vietnam caused finally allowed for an honest conversation regarding events like Dresden.\n\nAfter \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" was published, Vonnegut embraced the fame and financial security that attended its release. He was hailed as a hero of the burgeoning anti-war movement in the United States, was invited to speak at numerous rallies, and gave college commencement addresses around the country. In addition to briefly teaching at Harvard University as a lecturer in creative writing in 1970, Vonnegut taught at the City College of New York as a distinguished professor during the 1973–1974 academic year. He was later elected vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and given honorary degrees by, among others, Indiana University and Bennington College. Vonnegut also wrote a play called \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June\", which opened on October 7, 1970, at New York's Theatre de Lys. Receiving mixed reviews, it closed on March 14, 1971. In 1972, Universal Pictures adapted \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" into a film which the author said was \"flawless\".\n\nMeanwhile, Vonnegut's personal life was disintegrating. His wife Jane had embraced Christianity, which was contrary to Vonnegut's atheistic beliefs, and with five of their six children having left home, Vonnegut said the two were forced to find \"other sorts of seemingly important work to do.\" The couple battled over their differing beliefs until Vonnegut moved from their Cape Cod home to New York in 1971. Vonnegut called the disagreements \"painful\", and said the resulting split was a \"terrible, unavoidable accident that we were ill-equipped to understand.\" The couple divorced and they remained friends until Jane's death in late 1986. Beyond his marriage, he was deeply affected when his son Mark suffered a mental breakdown in 1972, which exacerbated Vonnegut's chronic depression, and led him to take Ritalin. When he stopped taking the drug in the mid-1970s, he began to see a psychologist weekly.\n\nVonnegut's difficulties materialized in numerous ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress he was making on his next novel, the darkly comical \"Breakfast of Champions\". In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book \"American Literature on Stage and Screen\", \"Breakfast of Champions\" was called \"funny and outlandish\", but reviewers noted that it \"lacks substance and seems to be an exercise in literary playfulness.\" Vonnegut's 1976 novel \"Slapstick\", which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In \"The New York Times\"'s review of \"Slapstick\", Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut \"seems to be putting less effort into [storytelling] than ever before\", and that \"it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all.\" At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.\n\nIn 1979, Vonnegut married Jill Krementz, a photographer whom he met while she was working on a series about writers in the early 1970s. With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old. In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including \"Jailbird\" (1979), \"Deadeye Dick\" (1982), \"Galápagos\" (1985), \"Bluebeard\" (1987), and \"Hocus Pocus\" (1990). Although he remained a prolific writer in the 1980s Vonnegut struggled with depression and attempted suicide in 1984. Two years later, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in Rodney Dangerfield's film \"Back to School\". The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, \"Timequake\" (1997), was, as University of Detroit history professor and Vonnegut biographer Gregory Sumner said, \"a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency.\" Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled \"A Man Without a Country\" (2005), became a bestseller.\n\nIn a 2006 \"Rolling Stone\" interview, Vonnegut sardonically stated that he would sue the Brown & Williamson tobacco company, the maker of the Pall Mall-branded cigarettes he had been smoking since he was twelve or fourteen years old, for false advertising. \"And do you know why?\" he said. \"Because I'm 83 years old. The lying bastards! On the package Brown & Williamson promised to kill me.\" He died on the night of April 11, 2007 in Manhattan, as a result of brain injuries incurred several weeks prior from a fall at his New York brownstone home. His death was reported by his wife Jill. Vonnegut was 84 years old. At the time of his death, Vonnegut had written fourteen novels, three short story collections, five plays and five non-fiction books. A book composed of Vonnegut's unpublished pieces, \"Armageddon in Retrospect\", was compiled and posthumously published by Vonnegut's son Mark in 2008.\n\nWhen asked about the impact Vonnegut had on his work, author Josip Novakovich stated that he has \"much to learn from Vonnegut—how to compress things and yet not compromise them, how to digress into history, quote from various historical accounts, and not stifle the narrative. The ease with which he writes is sheerly masterly, Mozartian.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Gregory Rodriguez said that the author will \"rightly be remembered as a darkly humorous social critic and the premier novelist of the counterculture\", and Dinitia Smith of \"The New York Times\" dubbed Vonnegut the \"counterculture's novelist.\"\n\nVonnegut has inspired numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published a compendium of Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's \"Unstuck in Time\" and Charles J. Shields's \"And So It Goes\". Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to \"The Guardian\", the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. \"Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes\", said \"The Daily Beast\"'s Wendy Smith. \"Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose\", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.\n\nVonnegut's works have evoked ire on several occasions. His most prominent novel, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", has been objected to or removed at various institutions in at least 18 instances. In the case of \"Island Trees School District v. Pico\", the United States Supreme Court ruled that a school district's ban on \"Slaughterhouse-Five\"—which the board had called \"anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy\"—and eight other novels was unconstitutional. When a school board in Republic, Missouri decided to withdraw Vonnegut's novel from its libraries, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.\n\nTally, writing in 2013, suggests that Vonnegut has only recently become the subject of serious study rather than fan adulation, and much is yet to be written about him. \"The time for scholars to say 'Here's why Vonnegut is worth reading' has definitively ended, thank goodness. We know he's worth reading. Now tell us things we don't know.\" Todd F. Davis notes that Vonnegut's work is kept alive by his loyal readers, who have \"significant influence as they continue to purchase Vonnegut's work, passing it on to subsequent generations and keeping his entire canon in print—an impressive list of more than twenty books that [Dell Publishing] has continued to refurbish and hawk with new cover designs.\" Donald E. Morse notes that Vonnegut, \"is now firmly, if somewhat controversially, ensconced in the American and world literary canon as well as in high school, college and graduate curricula\". Tally writes of Vonnegut's work:\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Vonnegut posthumously in 2015.\n\nThe asteroid 25399 Vonnegut is named in his honor.\n\nIn the introduction to \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" Vonnegut recounts meeting filmmaker Harrison Starr at a party who asked him whether his forthcoming book was an anti-war novel — \"I guess\" replied Vonnegut. Starr responded \"Why don't you write an anti-glacier novel?\". This underlined Vonnegut's belief that wars were, unfortunately, inevitable, but that it was important to ensure the wars one fought were just wars.\nIn 2011, NPR wrote, \"Kurt Vonnegut's blend of anti-war sentiment and satire made him one of the most popular writers of the 1960s.\" Vonnegut stated in a 1987 interview that, \"my own feeling is that civilization ended in World War I, and we're still trying to recover from that\", and that he wanted to write war-focused works without glamorizing war itself. Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the George W. Bush administration led him to write \"A Man Without a Country\".\n\n\"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is the Vonnegut novel best known for its antiwar themes, but the author expressed his beliefs in ways beyond the depiction of the destruction of Dresden. He has one character, Mary O'Hare, opine that \"wars were partly encouraged by books and movies\", made by \"Frank Sinatra or John Wayne or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men\". Vonnegut made a number of comparisons between Dresden and the bombing of Hiroshima in \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" and wrote in \"Palm Sunday\" (1991) that \"I learned how vile that religion of mine could be when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima\".\n\nNuclear war, or at least deployed nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In \"Player Piano\", the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In \"Cat's Cradle\", John's original purpose in setting pen to paper was to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.\n\nVonnegut was an atheist and a humanist, serving as the honorary president of the American Humanist Association. In an interview for \"Playboy\", he stated that his forebears who came to the United States did not believe in God, and he learned his atheism from his parents. He did not however disdain those who seek the comfort of religion, hailing church associations as a type of extended family. Like his great-grandfather Clemens, Vonnegut was a freethinker. He occasionally attended a Unitarian church, but with little consistency. \n\"According to Vonnegut,he continued to say he was Unitarian Universalist\". In his autobiographical work \"Palm Sunday\", Vonnegut says he is a \"Christ-worshipping agnostic\";. \"In his 1984\" (Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA)) \"Ware Lecture, \"Vonnegut described his connection to Unitarian Universalism with characteristic sarcasm: \"In order not to seem [spiritually inept] to strangers trying to get a fix on me, I sometimes say I'm a Unitarian Universalist. So that denomination claims me as one of their own.\"\" \"Despite his blasé view of religious affiliation, Vonnegut was a deeply grounded person whose life was indeed an expression of UU values.\". However, he was keen to stress that he was not a Christian.\n\nVonnegut was an admirer of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, particularly the Beatitudes, and incorporated it into his own doctrines. He also referred to it in many of his works. In his 1991 book \"Fates Worse than Death\", Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, \"anything that sounded like the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American\". In \"Palm Sunday\", he wrote that \"the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade.\" However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the televangelists of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.\n\nReligion features frequently in Vonnegut's work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced a number of his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric, and was prone to using such expressions as \"God forbid\" and \"thank God\". He once wrote his own version of the Requiem Mass, which he then had translated into Latin and set to music. In \"God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian\", Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is euthanized by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including Isaac Asimov, William Shakespeare, and Kilgore Trout—the last a fictional character from several of his novels. Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths, and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in \"Player Piano\", \"The Sirens of Titan\" and \"Cat's Cradle\". In \"The Sirens of Titan\", Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall. In \"Cat's Cradle\", Vonnegut invented the religion of Bokononism.\n\nVonnegut did not particularly sympathize with liberalism or conservatism, and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics. \"If you want to take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other ... you're a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative. What could be simpler?\" Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, \"The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don't acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead.\"\n\nVonnegut disregarded more mainstream political ideologies in favor of socialism, which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for what he saw as social Darwinism and a spirit of \"survival of the fittest\" in American society, believing that \"socialism would be a good for the common man\". Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs: \"As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\" Vonnegut expressed disappointment that communism and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American, and believed that they may offer beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems.\n\nVonnegut's writing was inspired by an eclectic mix of sources. When he was younger, Vonnegut stated that he read works of pulp fiction, science fiction, fantasy, and action-adventure. He also read the Classics, like those of Aristophanes. Aristophanes, like Vonnegut, wrote humorous critiques of contemporary society. Vonnegut's life and work also share similarities with that of \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" writer Mark Twain. Both shared pessimistic outlooks on humanity, and a skeptical take on religion, and, as Vonnegut put it, were both \"associated with the enemy in a major war\", as Twain briefly enlisted in the South's cause during the American Civil War, and Vonnegut's German name and ancestry connected him with the United States' enemy in both world wars.\n\nVonnegut called George Orwell his favorite writer, and admitted that he tried to emulate Orwell. \"I like his concern for the poor, I like his socialism, I like his simplicity\", Vonnegut said. Vonnegut also said that Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", and \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley, heavily influenced his debut novel, \"Player Piano\", in 1952. Vonnegut commented that Robert Louis Stevenson's stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works that he tried to mimic in his own compositions. Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist George Bernard Shaw as \"a hero of [his]\", and an \"enormous influence.\" Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him. \"[My] mother thought she might make a new fortune by writing for the slick magazines. She took short-story courses at night. She studied magazines the way gamblers study racing forms.\"\n\nEarly on in his career, Vonnegut decided to model his style after Henry David Thoreau, who wrote as if from the perspective of a child, allowing Thoreau's works to be more widely comprehensible. Using a youthful narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and straightforward way. Other influences on Vonnegut include \"The War of the Worlds\" author H. G. Wells, and satirist Jonathan Swift. Vonnegut credited newspaper magnate H. L. Mencken for inspiring him to become a journalist.\n\nIn his book \"Popular Contemporary Writers\", Michael D. Sharp describes Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter in a way that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" and \"Slapstick\".\n\nVonnegut believed that ideas, and the convincing communication of those ideas to the reader, were vital to literary art. He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of \"Player Piano\" leads up to the moment when Paul, on trial and hooked up to a lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood, and states, \"every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity\". Robert T. Tally Jr., in his volume on Vonnegut's novels, wrote, \"rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness.\" Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society, but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety. The large artificial families that the U.S. population is formed into in \"Slapstick\" soon serve as an excuse for tribalism, with people giving no help to those not part of their group, and with the extended family's place in the social hierarchy becoming vital.\n\nIn the introduction to their essay \"Kurt Vonnegut and Humor\", Tally and Peter C. Kunze suggest that Vonnegut was not a \"black humorist\", but a \"frustrated idealist\" who used \"comic parables\" to teach the reader absurd, bitter or hopeless truths, with his grim witticisms serving to make the reader laugh rather than cry. \"Vonnegut makes sense through humor, which is, in the author's view, as valid a means of mapping this crazy world as any other strategies.\" Vonnegut resented being called a black humorist, feeling that, as with many literary labels, it allows readers to disregard aspects of a writer's work that do not fit the label's stereotype.\n\nVonnegut's works have, at various times, been labeled science fiction, satire and postmodern. He also resisted such labels, but his works do contain common tropes that are often associated with those genres. In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction. Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world. Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems that plague societies, as is done in satirical works. However, literary theorist Robert Scholes noted in \"Fabulation and Metafiction\" that Vonnegut \"reject[s] the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [He has] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter.\" Examples of postmodernism may also be found in Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths of the world will be discovered through science. Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world. They often use unreliable, first-person narration, and narrative fragmentation. One critic has argued that Vonnegut's most famous novel, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", features a metafictional, Janus-headed outlook as it seeks both to represent actual historical events while problematizing the very notion of doing exactly that. This is encapsulated in the opening lines of the novel: \"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.\" This bombastic opening – \"All this happened\" – \"reads like a declaration of complete mimesis\" which is radically called into question in the rest of the quote and \"[t]his creates an integrated perspective that seeks out extratextual themes [like war and trauma] while thematizing the novel's textuality and inherent constructedness at one and the same time.\" While Vonnegut does use elements as fragmentation and metafictional elements, in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others.\n\nVonnegut was a vocal critic of the society in which he lived, and this was reflected in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In \"The Sirens of Titan\", the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, as a result of his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\", readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in \"Hocus Pocus\", the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In \"Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion\", Thomas F. Marvin states: \"Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States.\" Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a \"hereditary aristocracy\" develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a \"survival of the fittest\" view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because \"they deserve their fate\". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" and \"Timequake\" the characters have no choice in what they do; in \"Breakfast of Champions\", characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in \"Cat's Cradle\", Bokononism views free will as heretical.\n\nThe majority of Vonnegut's characters are estranged from their actual families and seek to build replacement or extended families. For example, the engineers in \"Player Piano\" called their manager's spouse \"Mom\". In \"Cat's Cradle\", Vonnegut devises two separate methods for loneliness to be combated: A \"karass\", which is a group of individuals appointed by God to do his will, and a \"granfalloon\", defined by Marvin as a \"meaningless association of people, such as a fraternal group or a nation\". Similarly, in \"Slapstick\", the U.S. government codifies that all Americans are a part of large extended families.\n\nFear of the loss of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut witnessed machines being built to take the place of human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, \"Player Piano\", where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in \"Galápagos\", where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in \"Timequake\", where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.\n\nSuicide by fire is another common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often returns to the theory that \"many people are not fond of life.\" He uses this as an explanation for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as nuclear weapons that can make their creators extinct. In \"Deadeye Dick\", Vonnegut features the neutron bomb, which he claims is designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices at the disposal of politicians.\n\n\"What is the point of life?\" is a question Vonnegut often pondered in his works. When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question \"What is the purpose of life?\" written in a bathroom, his response is, \"To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool.\" Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, \"[as] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in.\" In the epigraph to \"Bluebeard\", Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: \"We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.\"\n\nUnless otherwise cited, items in this list are taken from Thomas F.

Since September 2011, the LCSB is based on the new university campus Esch-Belval.\n\nThe LCSB was founded in 2009 as the first biomedical research centre of the University of Luxembourg by the founding director Prof. Dr. Rudi Balling. The main goal of the LCSB is to accelerate biomedical research by closing the link between systems biology and medical research.\n\nThe LCSB currently counts about 230 employees and 15 research groups in the areas of experimental neurobiology, cell metabolism, computational biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, eco-systems biology, and translational medicine. Collaboration between biologists, medical doctors, computer scientists, physicists and mathematicians is offering new insights into complex systems like cells, organs and whole organisms in both health and disease states. These findings are essential for understanding principal mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and for developing new tools in diagnostics and therapy.\n\nClose collaboration with clinicians and patients are of utmost importance to the LCSB. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease and description of diseases as networks are at the focus of the LCSB’s research. It aims to contribute to earlier diagnosis and personalized treatment, for instance through its coordinating role in the recently established National Centre of Excellence in Research on Parkinson’s Disease. \n\nThe LCSB also hosts the Luxembourgish node of ELIXIR, the European infrastructure for life science information. ELIXIR Luxembourg (ELIXIR-LU) focuses on long-term sustainability of tools and data for Translational Medicine. Translational Medicine data integrate clinical information with molecular and cellular data for a better understanding of diseases. They bridge the gap between the molecular level, findings from the laboratory, and the clinical observations and applications. ELIXIR-LU aims to facilitate long-term access to those research data and to tools for scientists in both academia and industry. This will allow the reuse of previously generated translational data to address new research questions and dramatically save time and cost.\n\nThe Centre has established strategic partnerships with leading biomedical laboratories worldwide and with all major biological and medical research units in Luxembourg. The LCSB fosters collaboration with industrial partners and accelerates the translation of fundamental research results into (clinical) applications.\n\n\n"}

The test was established at the leading urgency of Oxford University as an answer to the problem facing universities trying to select from an increasingly competitive pool with similarly high A-levels. With effect from its second year, the LNAT is required for UK and overseas applicants alike. There are now nine participating law schools and hundreds of test centres worldwide.\n\nThe LNAT is 135 minutes long and consists of two sections. The test taker is allotted 40 minutes to complete the essay and 95 minutes to answer 42 multiple-choice questions aimed at measuring reading comprehension and logical reasoning skills. The reading portion contains twelve short passages, with three or four questions about each passage. The questions typically ask for terms and arguments from the reading to be defined by inference. The essay portion is 40 minutes long and involves the candidate answering one of three available essay questions. The questions are generally open-ended prompts that can focus on any one of a wide variety of issues.\n\nThe reading section is scored out of 42 and the essays are individually marked by proctors at the respective universities.\n\nThe universities currently using the LNAT are:\n\n\nThe LNAT was first administered on 3 November 2004. The average score for the reading portion was 13.16 out of 24. Four test-takers received a 21 out of 24, the highest score achieved; the lowest score achieved by the 4,345 candidates was 3. Men performed slightly better than women on the multiple-choice portion, scoring 13.37 and 13.02 on average, respectively. A University of Bristol report on the scores expressed dissatisfaction with the ability of law candidates to develop \"reasoned arguments\". Men and women scored approximately equally to each other, in contrast to the distribution of A grades in A-level law, which were awarded to 19.3% of women and only 14.1% of men.\n\nThe LNAT consortium also reported statistically insignificant differences in scores between state and independent students. Research conducted by the University of Bristol concluded: \"the impact of the Lnat both in general and on specific supposedly sensitive widening participation groups has been negligible\".\n\nEntrants' mean average scores for the multiple choice element of the test in each year are as follows:\n\n"}

C. Grayling, who became its first Master.\n\nIn November 2018, Northeastern University, a private research university in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, announced its intention to acquire the New College of the Humanities. The deal is pending regulatory approval.\n\nIn 2016 two University of London academic awards were given to NCH London students, including the Sir Charles Harris award.\n\nIn 2015 New College of the Humanities won the Courses and Lecturers category at the What Uni Student Choice Awards (WUSCA) and came fourth in the category of University of the Year.\n\nIn 2015 NCH students won three of the University of London's academic awards, including the Sir Charles Harris award.\n\nIn the 2017 National Student Survey, NCH achieved student satisfaction scores above Russell Group universities and London universities, beating London members of the Russell Group in most categories.\n\nIn May 2014 it was reported that independent research that replicated the annual HEPI academic experience survey showed that the College's academic experience had exceeded the expectations of 63% of its students. This was more than twice the comparative statistic (28%) for Russell Group university students of humanities and social sciences in the HEPI 2014 annual student experience survey. The same research also showed that NCH students experienced 40% more contact time than their peers at Russell Group universities, that they completed twice as many assignments, and that they received feedback on their assignments in person more than twice as often.\n\nThe college offers tuition for 53 undergraduate programmes featuring major and minor options in Art History, Creative Writing, Economics, English, History, Law, Philosophy and Politics and International Relations, as well as a single honours Law LLB, and a Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA. In addition, its undergraduate students complete courses in applied ethics, critical reasoning, science literacy, and a professional development programme. The science literacy course includes as its teachers, Richard Dawkins teaching evolution, Steven Pinker lecturing about the brain, and Daniel C Dennett lecturing on consciousness.\n\nStudents experience more than 13 contact hours per week, including regular one-to-one and small group tutorials. In the 2017 National Student Survey, NCH achieved student satisfaction scores above Russell Group universities and London universities, beating London members of the elite Russell Group in 26 out of 27 categories.\n\nIn May 2014 it was reported that independent research that replicated the annual HEPI academic experience survey showed that the College's academic experience had exceeded the expectations of 63% of its students. This was more than twice the comparative statistic (28%) for Russell Group university students of humanities and social sciences in the HEPI 2014 annual student experience survey. The same research also showed that NCH students experienced 40% more contact time than their peers at Russell Group universities, that they completed twice as many assignments, and that they received feedback on their assignments in person more than twice as often.\n\nThe college models itself on liberal arts colleges in the United States, such as Amherst College. Initial reports said it aimed to offer an education to rival that of Oxford and Cambridge, but Grayling said this had been blown out of proportion by press hyperbole. He said he had the idea for the college years ago when he was admissions tutor for an Oxbridge college, and was turning down 12 good applicants for every successful one. Grayling himself completed his first degree in philosophy in the 1970s as a University of London external student. He argues that there is not enough elite university provision in the UK, leading thousands of British students to study in the United States instead. He told \"The Independent\" that the headmaster of Winchester College, an independent secondary school, had said many of his best students failed to get into Oxbridge because of government pressure to increase the number of students from state schools. Grayling has criticised English state examinations, arguing that A-levels do not measure ability adequately.\n\nGrayling said David Willetts, the universities minister, was told of the project in 2010, and appeared enthusiastic. NCH Limited was first named Grayling Hall Limited (after AC Grayling and Peter Hall), incorporated in July 2010 and registered at an address in Peckham, south London. The name was changed to New College of the Humanities in February 2011. The warden of New College, Oxford, who asked Grayling to change the name again to prevent confusion with the Oxford college, said other names Grayling had previously considered were Bloomsbury College and Erasmus College.\n\nFrom September 2012 to September 2015 it offered tuition in economics, English, history, law and philosophy and politics and international relations for undergraduate degrees with the University of London International Programme. It now runs its own degree programmes, modelled on American liberal arts college courses where students study a major and a minor subject, validated by Southampton Solent University. It continues to offer a law degree through the University of London. In addition, it requires all undergraduate students to work towards a \"Diploma of New College of the Humanities\" by completing courses drawn from applied ethics, critical reasoning, science literacy and LAUNCH, its professional development programme.\n\nIn 2016 NCH announced that it would be offering its first postgraduate qualification, the Historical Research and Public History MA starting in September 2016. This Masters programme has been designed by Dr Suzannah Lipscomb, Head of Faculty and Senior Lecturer in Early Modern History. It is validated by Swansea University. In 2017 the College launched three additional master's degrees, the MA Economic Policy & Communication, MSc Global Politics, and MA Philosophy.\n\nThe college uses its own building, \"The Registry\", and some of the University of London's teaching and student facilities, including Senate House Library and the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, all in the Bloomsbury district of London.\n\nThe College's foundation attracted a substantial response in the UK, and a significant amount of adverse publicity, where most higher education institutions are publicly funded. London's mayor, Boris Johnson, welcomed it as a bold experiment, while \"The Times\" argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long. There was an angry reaction from sections of the academic community. Complaints included that NCH had copied the course descriptions of the University of London's international programmes on its website; was offering the same syllabus with a significantly higher price tag; and that the senior academics involved with the project would in fact do very little of the teaching.\n\nAcademics and Administrators within the British academic world have in recent years alluded to the College's for-profit agenda, highlight the College's high tuition fees, the corporate structure as a Limited company, and the membership of the College's board.\n\nInitial \"seed capital\" of £200,000 for the project was provided, according to British newspaper \"The Guardian\", by the financier Peter Hall.\n\n£10 million in private equity funding was subsequently raised to cover costs for two years, with the expectation that NCH would break even by the third. One third of the enterprise is owned by 14 senior academics, including Grayling, and the rest by private investors, including a couple from Switzerland and three British businessmen—Jeremy Gibbs, Matthew Batstone and Roy W. Brown. Cavendish Corporate Finance LLP were the corporate financiers hired by NCH Ltd and raised this £10 million from a range of private investors including a number of prominent individuals from the world of business and finance.\n\nGibbs, former chairman of Futuretalk plc, deputy chairman of Scientific Digital Imaging plc and director of Cambridge Venture Management (2000) Ltd, was registered as the CEO, while Charles Watson, chairman of the PR firm Financial Dynamics, was named as non-executive chairman.\nBatstone and Brown are non-executive directors; Batstone is the former marketing chief of the Economist Group and a trustee of Bedales, an independent secondary school, and Brown is the founder of Metier Management Systems.\n\nThe 14 academic partners, also referred to as \"The Professoriate\", were announced as:\n\nSince the launch of the college, professors Vernon Bogdanor, Daniel C Dennett, Rebecca Goldstein, Roger Halson, Howard Jacobson, Simon May, Barbara McDonald, Stephen Neal, Sir Trevor Nunn and Christopher Peacocke have also lectured at the college.\n\nA charitable trust was established, the New College of the Humanities Trust, consisting of Grayling, Gibbs, Batstone, Watson and Brown. This provides scholarships based on academic merit, and means-tested bursaries to students with sufficient academic calibre who would not be able to study at the college without further financial support.\n\nThe first cohort consisted of around 60 students, primarily from independent schools; one in five of the college's offers have gone to state-school students. College staff made 130 visits to schools (21 to state schools) to attract applications. They graduated in 2015.\n\nThe college has a building called \"The Registry\" in Bedford Square where the one-to-one and small group tutorials take place. The Registry also contains rooms for most lectures. In addition, the college's students have access to the University's facilities, including Senate House Library and Student Central. It block-books rooms for its first-year students with student accommodation providers in Bloomsbury, Westminster, St Pancras and Tufnell Park. NCH has offered classes since October 2012, its annual fees are £9,250.\n\nGrayling said he had received 900 expressions of interest from potential students and 80 job applications in the first week. Britain's former prime minister, Tony Blair, endorsed it; and London's mayor, Boris Johnson, called it the boldest experiment in higher education in the UK since the foundation in 1983 of the University of Buckingham, the UK's first private university; he wrote that it showed the way ahead for academics demoralized by government interference with admissions procedures and \"scapegoated for the weaknesses of the schools.\" \"The Times\" argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long, that all over the world there are excellent universities run independently of the state, and that in its conception NCH is teaching by example. \"The Economist\" wrote that there is a market for the idea because of the increasing number of qualified British students who fail to get into their university of choice, in part because of pressure on the top universities from the Office for Fair Access to increase the number of students from state schools; they added that \"a 'toffs’ college' of well-heeled Oxbridge near-misses is a provocative concept.\" The Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, one of the college's partners, said he had read the criticism of NCH with incredulity: \"Anyone who cares about the humanities will be cheering Anthony Grayling.\"\n\nThe news triggered accusations of elitism. Literary critic Terry Eagleton called the college \"odious,\" arguing that it was taking advantage of a crumbling university system to make money; Grayling responded that Eagleton himself teaches a few weeks a year at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, USA, a private - though non-profit - university. Lawyer David Allen Green, writing in the \"New Statesman\", described NCH as a \"sham\" and a \"branding exercise with purchased celebrity endorsements and a PR-driven website.\" Several academics complained in a letter to \"The Guardian\" that its creation was a setback for the campaign against the current government's policy of commercializing education, and were joined by 34 of Grayling's former colleagues at Birkbeck, who questioned how much teaching the college's 14 academic partners would actually do. Terence Kealey, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Buckingham, suggested it was dangerous to have a university funded by private equity, citing the possible collapse in 2011 of Southern Cross private nursing homes.\n\nToby Young argued in \"The Daily Telegraph\" that the reaction was part of a left-wing campaign to retain state control over education, involving, he wrote, public sector unions, university lecturers, and the Socialist Workers Party. Simon Jenkins wrote that the country's professors, lecturers and student trade unionists were \"united in arms against what they most hate and fear: academic celebrity, student fees, profit and loss, one-to-one tutorials and America.\"\n\nGrayling responded to the criticism by arguing that NCH is trying to keep humanities teaching alive. He said he felt persecuted by the negative reaction: \"My whole record, everything I have written, is turned on its head. Now I am a bastard capitalist. It is really upsetting. ... Education is a public good and we should be spending more on it and it shouldn't be necessary to do this, but standing on the sidelines moaning and wailing is not an option.\" In a 2012 interview, Grayling also responded to claims that the college was \"elitist\": \"There is nothing wrong with being elite as long as you are not exclusive. You want your surgeon or airline pilot to have been trained at an elite institution.\"\n\nA dozen protesters heckled Grayling at Foyles bookshop in London on 7 June 2011 during a debate about cuts to arts funding, one of them shouting that he had \"no right to speak.\" A protester let off a smoke bomb, and 100 people were evacuated from the store. Later in the week police removed protesters from a British Humanist Association talk by Richard Dawkins at the Institute of Education.\n\nIn January 2012, the UK's Intellectual Property Office objected to the college name being registered as a trademark because of possible confusion with New College, Oxford.\n\n\n"}

These are:\n\n\nThese are open for the education and enjoyment of the public and its members.\n\nThe Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks has played a significant role in the historic preservation movement in Philadelphia by restoring, furnishing and presenting to the public its distinguished house museums.\n\nLandmarks has an interesting history of its own. In 1931, roused by the news that the historic Powel House was to be demolished in six weeks, Frances Anne Wister and Sophia Cadwalader and a group of strong supporters (including famous names like Biddle, Barnes, Curtis and Lippincott) founded Landmarks to save the house. The newly formed Landmarks was successful despite the economic depression of the time and within another ten years had acquired Grumblethorpe in Germantown. In the late 1960s, Ambassador and Mrs. Walter Annenberg restored the stately Hill-Physick-Keith House and then donated the house to Landmarks. In 1981, Landmarks entered into an agreement with Easttown Township in Chester County, Pennsylvania to administer Historic Waynesborough.\n\nToday, Landmarks carries on the vision of Miss Wister by managing the four house museums and bringing thousands of visitors and schoolchildren each year to learn about Philadelphia's history.\n\nFor the last decade Landmarks has served as the sponsor in the Philadelphia Region for the world-renowned Road Scholar program (formerly known as \"Elderhostel\"). On average each year, Landmarks Road Scholar Program attracts over 2,000 visitors to the Philadelphia Region to enjoy its many historical and cultural resources. Landmarks Road Scholar ranks 20th out of a total of 638 sponsors around the world. Landmarks is a major supporter of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia Flower Show and The Barnes Foundation among others through its purchase of admission tickets to these fine organizations. Accounting for over $500,000 in purchases of hotel rooms and services throughout the region, Landmarks Road Scholar plays a significant role in the Philadelphia Region's tourism economy.\n\nFor over eighty years, the Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks has played a significant role in the historic preservation movement in Philadelphia by restoring, furnishing and presenting to the public its four distinguished house museums: Grumblethorpe, Physick House, Powel House and Waynesborough. While remaining committed to preserving and interpreting the past, Landmarks is moving into the future with a renewed mission to expand beyond business-as-usual, explore new conceptual territories, create new collaborations and make its houses relevant to today's audiences. To that end, working with founding curator Robert Wuilfe, the organization in 2006 created a new program called Landmarks Contemporary Projects.\n\nLandmarks Contemporary Projects is a program of exhibitions, residencies, screenings, lectures, performances and educational strategies that is bringing new and experimental contemporary culture from Philadelphia and beyond to historic sites. Landmarks Contemporary Projects tries to provide a thoughtful alternative for audiences, creative opportunities for artists and new partnerships with other organizations. The core of the program is an exhibition/residency program in which Landmarks invites artists to explore and react to its properties and collections and create site-specific installations. By providing an experimental atmosphere in which artists are free to create new work and question basic assumptions of historical preservation, Landmarks hopes to stimulate discourse and challenge accepted approaches to both house-museums and contemporary art.\n\nTo date, Landmarks Contemporary Projects has offered opportunities to a wide range of emerging and established artists.

{"id": "360726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360726", "title": "Planisphere", "text": "Planisphere\n\nIn astronomy, a planisphere is a star chart analog computing instrument in the form of two adjustable disks that rotate on a common pivot. It can be adjusted to display the visible stars for any time and date. It is an instrument to assist in learning how to recognize stars and constellations. The astrolabe, an instrument that has its origins in Hellenistic astronomy, is a predecessor of the modern planisphere.\nThe term \"planisphere\" contrasts with \"armillary sphere\", where the celestial sphere is represented by a three-dimensional framework of rings.\n\nA planisphere consists of a circular star chart attached at its center to an opaque circular overlay that has a clear elliptical window or hole so that only a portion of the sky map will be visible in the window or hole area at any given time. The chart and overlay are mounted so that they are free to rotate about a common pivot point at their centers. The star chart contains the brightest stars, constellations and (possibly) deep-sky objects visible from a particular latitude on Earth. The night sky that one sees from the Earth depends on whether the observer is in the northern or southern hemispheres and the latitude. A planisphere window is designed for a particular latitude and will be accurate enough for a certain band either side of that. Planisphere makers will usually offer them in a number of versions for different latitudes. Planispheres only show the stars visible from the observer's latitude; stars below the horizon are not included.\n\nA complete twenty-four-hour time cycle is marked on the rim of the overlay. A full twelve months of calendar dates are marked on the rim of the starchart. The window is marked to show the direction of the eastern and western horizons. The disk and overlay are adjusted so that the observer's local time of day on the overlay corresponds to that day's date on the star chart disc. The portion of the star chart visible in the window then represents (with a distortion because it is a flat surface representing a spherical volume) the distribution of stars in the sky at that moment for the planisphere's designed location. Users hold the planisphere above their head with the eastern and western horizons correctly aligned to match the chart to actual star positions.\n\nThe word planisphere (Latin \"planisphaerium\") was originally used in the second century by Ptolemy to describe the representation of a spherical Earth by a map drawn in the plane.\nThis usage continued into the Renaissance: for example Gerardus Mercator described his 1569 world map as a planisphere.\n\nIn this article the word describes the representation of the star-filled celestial sphere on the plane.\nThe first star chart to have the name \"planisphere\" was made in 1624 by Jacob Bartsch.\nBartsch was the son-in-law of Johannes Kepler, discoverer of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\n\nSince the planisphere shows the celestial sphere in a printed flat, there is always considerable distortion. Planispheres, like all charts, are made using a certain projection method. For planispheres there are two major methods in use, leaving the choice with the designer. One such method is the polar azimuthal equidistant projection. Using this projection the sky is charted centered on one of the celestial poles (polar), while circles of equal declination (for instance 60°, 30°, 0° (the celestial equator), -30°, and -60°) lie equidistant from each other and from the poles (equidistant). The shapes of the constellations are proportionally correct in a straight line from the centre outwards, but at right angles to this direction (parallel to the declination circles) there is considerable distortion. That distortion will be worse as the distance to the pole gets greater. If we study the famous constellation of Orion in this projection and compare this to the real Orion, we can clearly see this distortion. One notable planisphere using azimuthal equidistant projection addresses this issue by printing a northern view on one side and the southern view on the other, thus reducing the distance charted from the center outward.\n\nThe stereographic projection solves this problem while introducing another. Using this projection the distances between the declination circles are enlarged in such a way that the shapes of the constellations remain correct. Naturally in this projection the constellations on the edge become too large in comparison to constellations near the celestial pole: Orion will be twice as high as it should be. (This is the same effect that makes Greenland so huge in Mercator charts.) Another disadvantage is that, with more space for constellations near the edge of the planisphere, the space for the constellations around the celestial pole in question will be less than they deserve. For observers at moderate latitudes, who can see the sky near the celestial pole of their hemisphere better than that nearer the horizon, this may be a good reason to prefer a planisphere made with the polar azimuthal equidistant projection method.\n\nThe upper disc contains a \"horizon\", that defines the visible part of the sky at any given moment, which is naturally half of the total starry sky. That horizon line is most of the time also distorted, for the same reason the constellations are distorted.\nThe horizon line on a stereographic projection is a perfect circle.\nThe horizon line on other projections is a kind of \"collapsed\" oval.\nThe horizon is designed for a particular latitude and thus determines the area for which a planisphere is meant. Some more expensive planispheres have several upper discs that can be exchanged, or have an upper disc with more horizon-lines, for different latitudes.\n\nWhen a planisphere is used in a latitude zone other than the zone for which it was designed, the user will either see stars that are not in the planisphere, or the planisphere will show stars that are not visible in that latitude zone's sky. To study the starry sky thoroughly it may be necessary to buy a planisphere particularly for the area in question.\n\nHowever, most of the time the part of the sky near the horizon will not show many stars, due to hills, woods, buildings or just because of the thickness of the atmosphere we look through. The lower 5° above the horizon in particular hardly shows any stars (let alone objects) except under the very best conditions. Therefore, a planisphere can fairly accurately be used from +5° to -5° of the design latitude. For example, a planisphere for 40° north can be used between 35° and 45° north.\n\nAccurate planispheres represent the celestial coordinates: right ascension and declination. The changing positions of planets, asteroids or comets in terms of these coordinates can be looked up in annual astronomical guides, and these enable planisphere users to find them in the sky.\n\nSome planispheres use a separate pointer for the declination, using the same pivot point as the upper disc. Some planispheres have a declination feature printed on the upper disc, along the line connecting north and south on the horizon. Right ascension is represented on the edge, where the dates with which to set the planisphere are also found.\n\n"}

For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases. Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious. Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.\n\nIn terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at \"elite\" universities, were religious.\n\nA Pew Center study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that Jews are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling; Jews also have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita (61%). Based on the study data, Muslims and Hindus have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both. About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling, Muslims and Hindus have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have graduate and post-graduate degrees.\n\nChristians ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling. Christians were found to have the second highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million). According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic Christian churches, in addition to the historical evidence that \"Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic\". According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of gender equality in educational attainment, and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the Protestant Reformers in promoting the education of women, which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.\n\nThe religiously unaffiliated—which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling, and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.\n\nBuddhists have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees. According to the same study \"there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa\" as Muslim adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts, with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by Christian missionaries during the colonial era for fellow believers.\n\nAccording to a 2015 global survey by Gallup International, the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.\n\nAn EU survey finds a positive correlation between leaving school early and believing in a God.\n\nIn one analysis of World Values Survey data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US. They concluded that \"these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion\". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, \"education raises religious attendance at individual level,\" while \"at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere.\" The authors suggest that \"this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief,\" causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.\n\nStatistical analysis of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of Nobel laureates were Christians, over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers. According to a study that was done by University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1998, 60% of Nobel prize laureates in physics from 1901 to 1990 had a Christian background. Since 1901-2013, 22% of all Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews.\n\nResearch in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both. \n\nA survey conducted by the \"Times of India\" revealed that 22% of IIT Bombay graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.\n\nIn Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.\n\nIn 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.\n\nAccording to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%. Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”\nSociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. \"The irony\" he states \"is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education.\"\n\nHe found that Hindus, Jews, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Buddhists, and Orthodox Christians have the highest levels of education. Catholics, Mormons, and Muslims are at about the national average.. Jehovah's Witnesses have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education. Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.\n\nAccording to the Gallup's 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.\n\nResearch done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher \"public religiosity\" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less \"belief.\" Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.\n\nResearch done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).\n\nResearch by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at \"elite\" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At \"elite\" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, \"religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities.\" They also found that professors at elite doctoral universities are much less religious than professors teaching in other kinds of institutions with more atheists and agnostics in numbers. However, both groups were still a minority.\n\nA study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity. \n\nFrank Sulloway of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Shermer of the California State University conducted a study that found in their polling sample of \"credentialed\" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a correlation indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.\n\nSociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect. Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education. Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than mainline Protestants. He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.\n\nSociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education \"positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life\", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of \"exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism\". \n\nCross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.\n\nAccording to a Pew Center study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American Hindus have a graduate and post-graduate degree, followed by Unitarian Universalists (67%), Jews (59%), Anglican (59%), Episcopalians (56%) and Presbyterians (47%) and United Church of Christ (46%). While cording to the same study about (43%) of American atheists, and (42%) agnostics, and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a graduate and post-graduate degree.\n\nStudies of Mormons in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending church regularly.\n\nEdward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge — factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.\nIn 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that \"Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics.\" He used SAT scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.\n\nContrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and Christian fundamentalism was found by Burton et al. (1989), a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, Protestant residents of Delaware County, Indiana.\n\n"}

Originally focused on providing an English college-preparatory education for the children of American expatriates in Cuba, it quickly grew into a bilingual academy with a multinational student body. In the 1940s, Ruston expanded to include an elementary school, business preparatory program, basic English classes for Cuban students, and a boarding school, with enrollment measuring at roughly 750 students. In 1955 Ruston moved to a new, larger campus in Havana.\n\nThe school was founded by retired English teacher Hiram Hall Ruston and his sister Martha Ruston, of Princeton, Indiana. Mr. Ruston served as headmaster from 1920 to his death in 1946, after which James Baker took over the school's administration. James and his wife Sibyl inherited ownership of the school and converted it into an educational non-profit foundation. Ruston Academy was closed down by the Castro government in 1961. Its former location was used as a public school, storage facility, homeless shelter, and military intelligence facility by the Cuban government.\n\nThe Ruston-Baker Educational Institution (RBEI) was founded in 1992 by James Baker and former members of the Ruston Academy Board of Directors, with the goal of reopening Ruston Academy following the collapse of the Castro government.

{"id": "51504268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51504268", "title": "Social Purpose Education", "text": "Social Purpose Education\n\nSocial Purpose Education was developed at The Northern College for Residential and Community Adult Education by Lou Mycroft and the TeachNorthern teacher education team in 2010. The Workers Educational Association also use the term to describe a similar, empowerment approach to adult education.\n\nSocial Purpose Education as a pedagogy is concerned with social change via the growth in confidence, agency and self-belief of individuals. As such, it can be said to be in the tradition of transformational leadership, rather than the transformational learning of Jack Mezirow, as the desired impact is intended to be on communities, rather than remaining within the individual. This makes it a particularly effective pedagogy for workforce development programmes. Social Purpose Education combines pro-social pedagogies such as The Thinking Environment, Restorative Practice, Community Philosophy and Non-Violent Communication with open digital approaches, designed to build \"communities of praxis\". It comprises four cornerstones of praxis: \n\n1. Teaching (to) Your Values\nSocial Purpose Education is explicitly values-based. Participants are invited to regularly check in with their personal values and how these connect with practice principles. The language of values continues to be explicated throughout. Values work is the cornerstone of any transformational education programme, such as the Thinking Environment, Training for Transformation, and Freirean based education (see, for example, the Paulo Freire Institute and Highlander Center).\n\n2. Reflexive Practice\nReflexion is defined as a broader practice than the commonly understood practice reflection. Introspection is cut with making connections with theory and with the experience of other participants (students, colleagues), leading to an experience of praxis which avoids solipsism and connects with broader social, political and economic factors. In this way, it leans towards the 'Four Lenses' work of Stephen Brookfield.\n\n3. Win/Win/Win\nInspired by Nigel Cutts’s leadership handbook ‘Love at Work', which is in turn inspired by the Thinking Environment, Win/Win/Win refers to the impact of social purpose education on the teacher, the student and the wider communities of both. It is an element of what Hannah Arendt called vita activa, or the active life.\n\n4. Embedding Diversity\nAn assumption of social purpose education is that it has a responsibility to challenge the social, political and economic \"status quo\", by using a posthuman approach to challenge axiomatic thinking. Gramsci and others wrote about ‘\"hegemony\"’ – a difficult word to say, spell or understand but one which has no equal in explicating the cultural blindness of contexts and organisations which, without even realising, can exclude diversity by assuming we are all the same.\n\n"}

It is located on the third floor of Beverley Street Public School, an elementary school for disabled children. Subway II (as it is referred to by many students) offers an unconventional approach to schooling, with a more flexible schedule, and one on one sessions with teachers. The school received its name from Subway Academy I, as it was an offshoot of that school. Despite the name, it is not accessible by the subway, and most students take the Spadina streetcar via the Nassau Street stop to get to school. Nearby landmarks include Kensington Market, the University of Toronto, and the Art Gallery of Ontario.\n\nStudents arrive between 9:00 and 11:00. When they arrive, they sign in on a whiteboard. Teachers then see students on a first-come-first-served basis. Consequentially, students who arrive at 9:00 may be finished for the day by 9:30, while students who show up closer to 11:00 may have to wait until well into the afternoon to be seen. During a typical meeting, the student will hand in completed assignments, discuss projects, work on new ideas and concepts, then pick up new assignments. Almost all work is done independently. Students are only scheduled to attend three days per week, but they are allowed to attend all five if they like.\n\nThe school environment includes a half-dozen computers, a blackboard for group collaboration, a VCR/DVD player, a full kitchen, and a sizable lending library. Subway II is a very small school, and the lack of a science lab or gymnasium limits course offerings. However, Subway does offer a number of higher-level philosophy, sociology and law courses—as well as hands-on courses like parenting and nutrition—that many mainstream high schools are unable to provide.\n\nThe flexible nature of Subway II's teaching has attracted a wide and eclectic student body despite its incredibly small size. Subway II is multicultural and has students from every walk of life. 49% of the student population is female, while 51% is male. 31% have a first language other than English. Subway II's style of teaching makes it uniquely well-suited to students who are involved with acting, professional sports, artistic endeavours or other time-consuming activities that would make mainstream schooling difficult.\n\nSubway II has relatively few extracurricular activities, largely due to the combination of an absence of pre-defined \"extracurricular time\" (i.e.: there isn't a pre-defined and universal \"lunch hour\" when extra-curriculars can be scheduled) as well as the small number of students (no more than 80 at any given time) and the fact that only two thirds of the students are required to be present on any given day of the week. Subway attempts to address this with guest speakers and field trips, both of which are typically open to anyone wishing to attend, though it should noted that many of Subway II's students have a distaste for \"mainstream\" high schools, and this often carries over into distaste for extracurricular activities, and even a distaste for showing up when not required to.\n\nSubway II currently has four teachers, for a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:20.\n\n\n\n"}

The SI program provides peer support by having students who succeeded in traditionally difficult academic courses (e.g., Organic Chemistry, Biology 101, Logic) help other students complete these courses. SI is a non-remedial approach that provides regular review sessions outside of class in which students work collaboratively by discussing readings, comparing notes, working together to predict test items, and sharing ideas for improving class material. Courses selected for SI tend to be “gatekeeper” courses for first and second year students—generally those classes that have a 30% or higher proportion of students who receive a “D”, fail, or withdraw (the \"DFW\" rate) from the course. Out-of-class review sessions are led by “SI leaders,” students who took the class already and did well. SI leaders attend all class lectures, take notes, and act as models to those currently taking the course. The SI model is used for selected courses at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional school levels, and has been adopted by colleges and universities in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe SI model is based on a collection of learning theories. SI borrows from behavioral learning principles from Skinner, Bandura, Ausubel, and Herbart; from cognitive development principles from Bruner, Piaget, and Flower and Hayes; from social interdependence principles from Geertz, Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and Erickson; and from interpretive-critical principles from Freire, Apple, and Kozol.\n\nIn the early 1990s the U.S. Department of Education validated three specific claims about the effectiveness of SI:\nA more recent review of all published SI research between 2001 and 2010 found studies in support of all three of these claims, and no studies contradicting them.\n\nThe International Center for SI is located at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in Kansas City, Missouri within the Center for Academic Development. The International Center for SI hosts and conducts regular trainings on the SI model and has trained people in over 2,000 institutions in more than 29 countries.\n\nThere are national centers for SI at the University of Wollongong, Australia, the University of Guelph, Canada, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, South Africa, Lund University, Sweden. Outside of the United States, SI is also known as PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) and PAL (Peer Assisted Learning). Each national center is responsible for supervision and training interested institutions in their areas the SI model.\n\nEvery two years, the International Center for SI hosts a conference where administrators, educators, SI leaders, and students gather to share new research and ideas that pertain to SI.\n\nVideo-based Supplemental Instruction (VSI) is a model that combines course content with SI study sessions University professors capture video recordings of their lectures. Trained facilitators, using the recorded lectures and the SI model, guide students through the learning process while emphasizing critical thinking and study skills. Assessment is provided by the professor keeping the facilitator in the role as a peer supporter and not an evaluator.\n\n\n"}

It can be chosen by VWO and HAVO students. Scientific subjects form the basis of this teaching method. It can be compared to grammar school, which includes the subjects Latin and Greek. Technasium, however, includes the examination subject “Research and Design” (Dutch: \"Onderzoeken en Ontwerpen\"). Students can start this course from the first year to the fourth year of high school. Schools are recommended to schedule about 4–6 hours of Research and Design class a week, but this may vary among different high schools. In the first three years, the course is optional and is an addition to the standard curriculum. To prevent the students from having too many study-hours, the schools are free to drop certain other subjects. After the third form, Research and Design becomes a supplementary course, which students can choose within their study program.\n\nTechnasium was started as a project in 2004 by Judith Lechner and Boris Wanders at five different schools in the Dutch province of Groningen. Due to a lot of interest from other schools in the Netherlands, this project has developed into a form of education. Technasium can be attended in around sixty schools in the Netherlands, and is still developing, especially the subject Onderzoeken en Ontwerpen.\n\nA part of Technasium is the subject Research and Design. This subject can be taught starting from the first class of pre-university education or HAVO (higher general continued education). It is possible to start the course at a later stage, when choosing the courses to follow in the last three years of high school. A couple of projects are done each year within the O&O course. The Technasium education course mostly works with practical assignments, commissioned by real companies. These companies ask the students to design something, to do research on a certain topic or to think of solutions for problems they are struggling with. The students present their findings at the end of the project.\nOften, these projects are composed for a group of students. The number of students depends on the assignment and varies, but is mostly from two to four students. It is up to the teacher to decide who forms the groups. It’s either the teacher himself who does, or the students can try to form groups with their classmates. Working together in a team is of major importance and the students learn to do this from the start.\nIn the first three years, four technasium projects are done each year. An assignment has to be finished in 7 or 8 weeks, with 5 to 6 hours of O&O a week. In the pre-senior year, students get to choose two projects. They look for a company or institution which wants them to undertake a project from within the company. In the final year, the students will take their Mastertest. The students can once again decide what kind of project they like to do. Students have to spend 40 hours of work on a normal project, and 200 hours on the Mastertest.\n\nEach year, a national project for the second-year students is launched, with which they can win a big prize. This competition is called the Technasium Top Award.\nThe event is hosted once a year and can be watched live on-stream. Each group of students gets to show and present their design. The jury decides which design wins the competition at the end of the day.\nA lot of technical systems and designs are on show during the day.\nThe Idea of the Technasium Top Award is to activate children’s interest in science. Their mindset is as following: “Participating is always more important than winning”.\nIn 2013 the subject of the competition was “saving time in case of fire”. The aim was to think of ways to make escaping from fire easier for the disabled.\nIn 2014, the assignment was to design and build an energy neutral building in Dronten. In 2015, CAH Vilentum demands an energy-producing building in Almere. They want the students to base their ideas on the solutions nature has been giving for millions of year, the biomimicry. Another goal they would like to achieve is getting the building to be a part of a cradle to cradle system. This means that every part of the building can, and probably will be, recycled in the future.\nWinners of the Technasium Top Award 2015:\n1. Calandlyceum, Amsterdam\n2. Melanchthon, Bergschenhoek\n3.

The primary aim of the foundation is to recognise and encourage the development of youths who show excellence in both academic and extra-curricular pursuits through the provision of scholarships for higher education.\n\nThe current Chief Executive of the foundation is Tengku Abdul Aziz Tengku Zainal.\n\nOn the occasion of the 63rd birthday of the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, on February 8, 1966, the Malay language newspaper, Utusan Melayu, launched a fund-raising exercise to set up a proposed education fund to provide for the higher education of Malay youths. Initially named the Tunku Abdul Rahman Education Fund (), it gained the support of a broad segment of Malaysian society.\n\nAs a result, the federal government of Malaysia decided to formally establish a national foundation and open the fund to Malaysian applicants regardless of their ethnicity or creed. This was made possible with the passage of the \"Tunku Abdul Rahman Foundation Fund Act 1966\" by Parliament on July 28, 1966.\n\nMohd Khir Johari was appointed as the first chairman of the board of trustees upon the establishment of the foundation. On April 16, 1974, the cabinet decided that the seat of the chairman would be held by the office of the Minister of Education. On March 26, 2004 the jurisdiction of the foundation was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the newly devolved Ministry of Higher Education.\n\nThe scholarship (not to be mistaken with other Tunku Abdul Rahman scholarships) was established in 2006 to replace a previous financial aid program that was in the form of a loan.\n\nThe awarding of the scholarship is the main endowment by the foundation and is open for applications annually. Applications for the scholarship is open to academically outstanding Malaysian undergraduates below 25 years of age who meet specific criteria set by the foundation.\n\nRecipients of this scholarship are known as Tunku Scholars.\n\nAfter several batch of scholarship recipients, Tunku Scholars Association Malaysia was established in fostering network and bonding among current scholarship recipients and alumni. More information can be found on the Association's official website.\n\nOn January 5, 1985, the foundation gave an endowment of RM 1,000,000 to the University of Malaya to establish an academic chair in the Faculty of Law. This became known as the Tunku Abdul Rahman Chair of International Law. In June 1985, the Senate of the University of Malaya appointed Ian Campbell MacGibbon as the first holder of the chair. The current Tunku Abdul Rahman Professor of International Law is Herbert Victor Morais.\n\nApart from the two main disbursements described above, the foundation also grants the following awards and prizes:\n\nThis award is in the form of a gold medal, a certificate, and a unit trust certificate from Amanah Saham Gemilang worth RM 3,000 awarded to one graduate from a local institution of higher education annually. Nominations are received from the respective institutions and selected based on specific criteria set by the foundation.\n\nThis award is in the form of a certificate and a cash award of RM 2,500 and is awarded to one academically excellent student who has fulfilled specific academic criteria despite personal infirmities or disabilities.\n\nThis benefaction is awarded to foundation sponsored students who successfully attain a First Class Distinction in an academic year.\n\nThis was a cash prize of RM 500 awarded to the best first year undergraduate student of the Faculty of Human Ecology a Universiti Putra Malaysia. The prize is no longer awarded.\n\nThis was a scholarship awarded to academically excellent students intending to pursue postgraduate education. The awarding of this scholarship is currently suspended.\n\nThe foundation is governed by a board of trustees made up of the following:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "345905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=345905", "title": "Understanding Comics", "text": "Understanding Comics\n\nUnderstanding Comics: The Invisible Art is a 1993 non-fiction work of comics by American cartoonist Scott McCloud. It explores formal aspects of comics, the historical development of the medium, its fundamental vocabulary, and various ways in which these elements have been used. It expounds theoretical ideas about comics as an art form and medium of communication, and is itself written in comic book form.\n\n\"Understanding Comics\" received praise from notable comic and graphic novel authors such as Art Spiegelman, Will Eisner, Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, and Garry Trudeau (who reviewed the book for the \"New York Times\"). Although the book has prompted debate over many of McCloud’s conclusions, its discussions of \"iconic\" art and the concept of \"closure\" between panels have become common reference points in discussions of the medium.\n\nThe title of \"Understanding Comics\" is an homage to Marshall McLuhan's seminal 1964 work \"Understanding Media\".\n\nExcerpts from \"Understanding Comics\" were published in \"Amazing Heroes\" #200 (Apr. 1992); that issue later won the 1992 Don Thompson Award for Best Non-Fiction Work. McCloud previewed the book at the August 1992 Comics Arts Conference.\n\n\"Understanding Comics\" was first published by Tundra Publishing; reprintings have been released by Kitchen Sink Press, DC Comics' Paradox Press, DC's Vertigo line, and HarperPerennial. The book was edited by Mark Martin, with lettering by Bob Lappan.\n\n\n\nMcCloud has followed up \"Understanding Comics\" with \"Reinventing Comics\" (2000), in which he suggested ways for the medium to change and grow; and \"Making Comics\" (2006), a study of methods of constructing comics.\n\n\"Understanding Comics\" is a wide-ranging exploration of the definition, history, vocabulary, and methods of the medium of comics. An attempt to formalize the study of comics, it is itself in comics form.\n\nThe book's overarching argument is that comics are defined by the primacy of sequences of images. McCloud also introduced the concept of \"closure,\" to refer to a reader's role in closing narrative gaps between comics panels. The book argues that comics employ nonlinear narratives because they rely on the reader's choices and interactions.\n\nThe book begins with a discussion of the concept of visual literacy and a history of narrative in visual media. McCloud mentions, among other early works of graphic narrative, the Bayeux Tapestry, as an antecedent to comics. \"Understanding Comics\" posits Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe Töpffer as in many ways \"the father of the modern comic.\" McCloud emphasizes Töpffer's use of \"cartooning and panel borders\" along with \"the first interdependent combination of words and pictures seen in Europe.\"\n\nMcCloud also highlights the differences between iconic and realistic figures. Iconic figures can be compared to your standard cartoon, while realistic figures focus more on photo-quality in terms of detail. He states that our culture is captivated by iconic images more so due to their simplicity. He provides a full comparison and breakdown of iconic and realistic images and gives an interesting explanation of his reasoning behind this statement.\n\nOne of the book's key concepts is that of \"masking,\" a visual style, dramatic convention, and literary technique described in the chapter on realism. It is the use of simplistic, archetypal, narrative characters, even if juxtaposed with detailed, photographic, verisimilar, spectacular backgrounds. This may function, McCloud infers, as a mask, a form of projective identification. His explanation is that a familiar and minimally detailed character allows for a stronger emotional connection and for viewers to identify more easily.\n\nOne of the book's concepts is \"The Big Triangle,\" a tool for thinking about different styles of comics art. McCloud places the realistic representation in the bottom left corner, with iconic representation, or cartoony art, in the bottom right, and a third identifier, abstraction of image, at the apex of the triangle. This allows placement and grouping of artists by triangulation.\n\n\"Understanding Comics\" won multiple Harvey Awards in 1994 for Best Graphic Album/Original Material and Best Biographical, Historical or Journalistic Presentation. In addition, McCloud won the 1994 Harvey Award for Best Writer. \n\n\"Understanding Comics\" won the 1994 Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related Book.\n\nAuthor McCloud won the 1994 Adamson Award for Best International Comic-Strip [or comic book] Cartoonist. The book was a finalist for the 1994 Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book.\n\nThe Swedish translation of the book, \"Serier: Den Osynliga Konsten\", published in 1995 by Häftad, was awarded the 1996 Urhunden Prize.\n\nThe French translation of the book, titled \"L'Art invisible\" and published by Vertige Graphic, won the Prix Bloody Mary at the 2000 Angoulême International Comics Festival. In addition, it was nominated for that year's Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album.\n\nAlong with Will Eisner's \"Comics and Sequential Art\", \"Understanding Comics\" is considered to form the foundations for formal comics studies in English.\n\nThe book was called \"one of the most insightful books about designing graphic user interfaces ever written\" by Apple Macintosh co-creator Andy Hertzfeld.\n\n\"Understanding Comics\" was parodied by Dylan Sisson in his \"Filibusting Comics: The Next Chapter\", published by Fantagraphics in 1995, and later translated into Spanish.\n\nIt was parodied again, in Tim Heiderich and Mike Rosen's \"Misunderstanding Comics\", self-published via Kickstarter in 2012.\n\n\n\n \n"}
