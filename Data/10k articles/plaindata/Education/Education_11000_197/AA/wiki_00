In the UK A-Level exams are traditionally taken by 17-18 year-olds after a two-year course at a sixth form or college. Advanced Level Further Mathematics is often taken by students who wish to study a mathematics based degree at university.\nLike other A-level subjects, mathematics has been assessed in a modular system since the introduction of Curriculum 2000, whereby each candidate must take six modules, with the best achieved score in each of these modules (after any retakes) contributing to the final grade. Most students will complete three modules in one year, which will create an AS-level qualification in their own right and will complete the A-level course the following year with three more modules.\n\nThe system in which mathematics is assessed is changing for students starting courses in 2017 (part of the A-level reforms first introduced in 2015), where the reformed specifications have reverted to a linear structure with exams only taken at the end of the course in a single sitting. In addition, whereas in the older modular specification schools could choose freely between taking Statistics, Mechanics or Discrete Mathematics (also known as Decision Mathematics) modules with the ability to specialise in one branch of applied Mathematics, the new specifications make both Mechanics and Statistics compulsory, with Discrete Mathematics being made exclusive as an option to students pursuing a Further Mathematics course. The first assessment opportunity for the new specification is 2018 and 2019 for A-levels in Mathematics and Further Mathematics respectively.\n\nThe basic A-Level course consists of six modules, four standard (C1, C2, C3, and C4) and two modules that can be chosen by the student or school/college, etc. The C1 through C4 modules are referred to by A-level textbooks as \"Core\" modules, encompassing the major topics of mathematics such as logarithms, differentiation/integration and geometric/arithmetic progressions. \n\nThe two chosen modules for the final two parts of the A-Level are determined either by a student's personal choices or the course choice of their school/college, but commonly take the form of S1 (Statistics) and M1 (Mechanics)\n\nSome mathematics students will choose to take an A-level in Further Mathematics which requires taking a further 6 modules to give a second qualification. The grades of the two A-levels will be independent of each other. Further Mathematics requires students to take a minimum of two Further Pure modules, one of which must be FP1, and the other either FP2 or FP3, which are simply extensions of the four Core modules from the normal Maths A-Level. Four more modules need to be taken; those available vary with different specifications.\n\nNot all schools are able to offer Further Mathematics, due to low student numbers meaning the course is not financially viable, or due to a lack of suitably experienced teachers. To fulfil the demand extra tutoring is available, with providers such as the Further Mathematics Support Programme.\n\nSome students can also take a third maths qualification, \"Additional Further Mathematics\", which adds more modules from those not used for Mathematics or Further Mathematics. Schools that offer this qualification usually only take this to AS-level, taking three modules, but some students can go further, taking the extra six modules to gain another full A-Level qualification. Additional Further Mathematics is offered by Edexcel only. Lastly, a Pure Mathematics A-level is available for those students who (on the Edexcel exam board) take the modules C1, C2, C3, C4, FP1 and either FP2 or FP3.\n\nEach module carries a maximum of 100 UMS points towards the total grade and each module is also given a separate grade depending on its score. The number of points required for different grades are defined below:\n\nThe proportion of candidates acquiring these grades in 2007 are below:\n\nIt has been suggested by The Department for Education that the high proportion of candidates who obtain grade A makes it difficult for universities to distinguish between the most able candidates. The 2010 exam session has introduced an A* grade that distinguishes between better candidates.\n\nThe A* grade in maths is awarded to candidates who achieve an A (480/600) in their overall A Level as well as achieving a combined score of 180/200 in modules Core 3 and Core 4.\n\nThe A* grade in further maths is awarded slightly differently. The same minimum score of 480/600 is required across all six modules, however a 90% average (or a score of 270/300) must be obtained across the candidate's best 'A2' modules. A2 modules include any modules other than those with a '1' (FP1, S1, M1 and D1 are not A2 modules, whereas FP2, FP3, FP4 (from AQA only), S2, S3, S4, M2, M3 and D2 are).\n\n"}

The original was developed by Spellbound, and published by Infogrames, however, the succeeding versions were published by a variety of publishers. The original \"Airline Tycoon\" was created for Windows, however, the later \"Deluxe\" version was also ported to Linux, Mac OS X, MorphOS, ZETA, iOS and Android. In this game, like all Tycoon computer games, the objective is to become a tycoon, and in this case, an “Airline Tycoon.” This is achieved through the balance of income and expenditures.\n\nA simulation computer game where the player acts as manager of an airline, competing against three other tycoons. The names of the four tycoons are: Tina Cortez (Sunshine Airways), Siggi Sorglos (Falcon Lines), Igor Tuppolevsky (Phoenix Travel) and Mario Zucchero (Honey Airlines). The player must keep their aircraft in good shape and equip them at such a level as to keep the customers satisfied, buy new planes (from the expensive Airplane Agency or from Mr Schlauberger at the museum who sells old planes at a much lower cost) and take out bank loans if required.\nThe player must also manage their personnel, plan flights, buy fuel, attend meetings in the airport manager's office and, if there is the time, slip into Rick's café for a quick cup of coffee. The player can also perform sabotages on the other players. The graphics are bright and decidedly tongue in cheek: the tycoon Igor Tuppolevsky has a set of Russian dolls on his desk—and an open tin of caviar, while Tina Cortez has a picture of a matador and a bull's head.\n\nWith a network, up to four people can play at once and the game status can be saved (as it can in single-player mode) for longer games.\n\nThe original game was released in August 1998 in Germany. It was not released in any English-speaking country; however, there was an official English demo.\nThe first Airline Tycoon title to be released in United States and the United Kingdom was \"Airline Tycoon First Class\". It was published in 2001 by Monte Cristo; however, the publisher decided to remove \"First Class\" subtitle from the game box and manuals, though it remained in-game. Features added in First Class include ten brand new missions, multiplayer mode with up to 4 players, new MIDI music, cargo transportation and more.\nIn 2002, \"Airline Tycoon Evolution\", second Airline Tycoon re-release was published by Monte Cristo. The game introduced ten new missions, possibility of buying self-designed aircraft (and possibility of sharing these planes via Internet), possibility of hiring aircraft security agents, five new sabotages and more.\n\nIn 2003, Spellbound released a third Airline Tycoon addition, named \"Airline Tycoon Deluxe\". It included all of previous versions, the only new part of the game was twenty new airports and possibility of accepting cargo from remote estates. Originally it was released in limited edition of 5000 items. It was available only in Germany, though it was not translated into other languages. However, Linux, Mac OS X and ZETA versions released in Autumn 2005 and Winter 2006 by RuneSoft are available in English, German and French.\n\nOn 24 March, 2015 Airline Tycoon Deluxe was re-released on the digital distribution platform gog.com, including the source code.\n\nOn May 24, 2006 Spellbound announced it would be releasing a full sequel to Airline Tycoon, Airline Tycoon II due to be released in Germany sometime in the second half of 2007. The release date was, however, not met. Spellbound stated they could not find a publisher for the game and announced no new release date. On October 22, 2009 Airline Tycoon II was announced by Kalypso Media and scheduled to be released in late 2011. It was scheduled to be released in the United States On October 2, 2011 by Amazon.com, however, Kalypso Media scheduled their North American release for October 14, 2011. The Game as of date has been released and includes a demo version which the original lacked.\n\nThe first extra content or expansion for the game was announced on March 29, 2012. Honey Airlines DLC finally became available on April 19 of the same year. It would feature a new character, new airline company, two additional campaign missions and a Cargo area for the airport. The second one, announced on May 31, 2012 called Falcon Lines DLC was eventually released on June 14 of that year. This DLC would add another character and airline company, another two additional campaign missions, the Last-Minute Counter as a new airport area and the ability to open branch offices anywhere throughout the world.\n\nSales of \"Airline Tycoon\" surpassed 150,000 units worldwide by 2001.\n\nIn 2001 an IGN review gave Airline Tycoon a good rating with 7.9/10. Airline Tycoon 2 received on Metacritic a mediocre score of 57/100 from four reviews.\n\n"}

The Thinking Skills Admissions Testing (TSAT) unit was responsible for administering the Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) and the first BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT), which had been introduced in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, interest in fair admissions to higher education was fuelled by the Schwartz Report. This led to a collaboration between TSAT and the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) and the development of uniTEST. uniTEST explored whether a single test could be used for admission to a broad range of courses and higher education institutions. uniTEST was introduced by some Australian universities, but there was relatively little demand in the UK.\n\nOther projects followed, including work with the Faculty of English at the University of Oxford to develop an admissions test for undergraduate courses in English. Following a successful trial in autumn 2006, the English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT) was introduced in the 2007–08 admissions cycle.\n\nIn recent years there has been more work with the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge to administer their own admissions tests/pre-interview assessments.

It assesses whether applicants have the critical thinking and problem-solving skills which universities consider to be essential for success in higher education. In the UK, it is used by the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and University College London (UCL). It is also used by Stockholm School of Economics, Sweden and Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Malaysia. \n\nCPSQ is designed to assess behavioural styles, specifically focusing on how people approach tasks and interact with others. This includes key areas such as thinking and learning, motivation, self-management, resilience and interpersonal values and attitudes. CPSQ has been specifically created for use within two areas: healthcare education and employment, higher education and schools.

She is a two-time winner of the Greater Hartford Arts Council Fellowship for Poetry. Her book of poetry and short stories \"The Box Under the Bed\" won the 2015 Paranormal Poetry and Prose Prize. Her debut novel \"The Windsome Tree: a ghost story\" has received much critical acclaim. Albrizio has taught poetry and creative writing in several colleges and cultural institutions as well as the York Correctional Institute, Connecticut’s only maximum-security prison for women.\n\nIn 2005, Albrizio left a twelve-year career as a radio news host and broadcast journalist, where she worked for ABC and NPR News.

Description: There are ghosts in the tree who would kill to get home! Unable to crawl out of her grief after losing her youngest child to leukemia, Mercy Amoretto, mother of four, takes her therapist's advice and starts to clean out the clutter in her life. In the garage, she finds an old tire and rope and, in a fanciful moment, creates a tire swing. Unknown to her, the rope, the tire, and the tree share a violent history. Once they are connected, that history is unleashed in the form of two child spirits from decades past. While on the swing, Mercy begins hearing cryptic messages from the spirits and is quick to believe the voices are key to finding her dead daughter. Hope turns to horror when two of her children appear to taunt her in tortuous ways. And when her children go missing, all eyes turn to Mercy. She's convinced the ghosts are to blame, but how can anyone believe her when she's the only one who hears their voices? \n\n\"The Box Under the Bed\" is a collection of haunting tales and tidbits pulled from under the bed. These compelling little poems and stories explore the dark side of the human psyche and the ghostly side of life. Winner of the 2015 Paranormal Poetry and Prose Prize.\n\n\"Messy on the Inside\" was published in 1998. Albrizio's first book of poetry, it consists of 60 poems written entirely in formal verse. Utilizing such traditional forms as the English sonnet, pantoum, villanelle, sestina and haiku, this book spotlights Albrizio's ability to master form without losing the poem's accessibility. From the success of this book, Albrizio created an acclaimed formal verse workshop.\n\n\"Rain – Dark as Water in Winter\" was published in 2001. This book consists of a one-act play written in verse and 30 poems written in traditional forms. The play, \"Rain\", was honored by the \"Writer’s Digest\" as one of the best written one-act plays of 1997. The two-character play focuses on the cycle of an emotionally abusive relationship between Rain and her lover, Perfidy. The play has a profound iambic rhythm, while the rhyme, although consistently placed, is only subtly heard.\n\n\"Perennials: New & Selected Poems\" marks Albrizio’s break from traditional forms. It was published in 2007. Although it includes some of her most well received poems from her previous two books, it also consists of over 30 new poems that are largely written in free verse or in forms of her own creation. She continues to teach poetry workshops, but has since added a segment on applying the rhetorical devices used in formal verse to free-verse writing.

{"id": "441201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441201", "title": "Hazing", "text": "Hazing\n\nHazing (US English), initiation ceremonies (British English), bastardisation (Australian English), ragging (South Asia), or deposition, refers to the practice of rituals, challenges, and other activities involving harassment, abuse or humiliation used as a way of initiating a person into a group including a new fraternity, sorority, team, or club.\n\nHazing is seen in many different types of social groups, including gangs, sports teams, schools, military units, and fraternities and sororities. The initiation rites can range from relatively benign pranks, to protracted patterns of behavior that rise to the level of abuse or criminal misconduct. Hazing is often prohibited by law or prohibited by institutions such as colleges and universities because it may include either physical or psychological abuse. It may also include nudity or sexual assault.\n\nIn some languages, terms with a religious theme or etymology are preferred, such as baptism or purgatory (e.g. in Belgian French, in Belgian Dutch) or variations on a theme of naïveté and the rite of passage such as a derivation from a term for freshman, for example in French French, (de-green[horn]ing) in Netherlandic Dutch and Afrikaans (South Africa and Namibia), in Spanish, from , meaning newcomer or rookie or a combination of both, such as in the Finnish (literally \"moped baptism\", \"moped\" being the nickname for newcomers, stemming from the concept that they would be forced to drive a child's bicycle or tricycle). In Latvian, the word , which literally means \"in-blessings\", is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially confirmation. In Swedish, the term used is , literally \"zeroing\" (from the fact that when you start your first year, you're a \"one'er\", but before passing the rite you are a \"zero\"). In Portugal, the term , which literally means \"practice\" or \"habit\", is used for initiation. In Brazil, it is called and is usually practiced at universities by older students ( and ) against newcomers () in the first week of their first semester. In the Italian military, instead, the term used was , from (literally \"grandfather\"), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the Russian military, where a hazing phenomenon known as exists, meaning roughly \"grandfather\" or the slang term \"gramps\" (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of conscription). At education establishments in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, this practice involves existing students baiting new students and is called ragging. In Polish schools, hazing is known as (literally \"catting\", coming from the noun cat). It often features cat-related activities, like competitive milk drinking. Other popular tasks include measuring a long distance (i.e. hallways) with matches.\n\nOften most or all of the endurance or the more serious ordeal is concentrated in a single session, which may be called \"hell night\", or prolonged to a \"hell week\", sometimes again at the pledge's birthday (e.g. by birthday spanking), but some traditions keep terrorizing pledges over a long period, resembling fagging.\n\nIn Israel, the practice is called (an Arabic-derived Hebrew slang word roughly equivalent to 'willie') and exists primarily in Israeli Defense Force combat units and the Israel Air Force. Unlike hazing in many other places, is typically used to mark the achievement of important milestones (in an ironic 'don't get too big for your britches' way), such as after a pilot's first solo flight.\n\nHazing activities can involve forms of ridicule and humiliation within the group or in public, while other hazing incidents are akin to pranks. A snipe hunt is such a prank, when a newcomer or credulous person is given an impossible task. Examples of snipe hunts include being sent to find a \"dough repair kit\" in a bakery, while in the early 1900s rookies in the Canadian military were ordered to obtain a \"brass magnet\" when brass is not magnetic.\n\nSpanking is done mainly in the form of paddling among fraternities, sororities and similar clubs, sometimes over a lap, a knee, furniture or a pillow, but mostly with the victim \"assuming the position\", i.e., simply bending over forward. A variation of this (also as punishment) is trading licks. This practice is also used in the military. Alternative modes (including bare-buttock paddling, strapping and switching, as well as mock forms of antiquated forms of physical punishments such as stocks, walking the plank and running the gauntlet) have been reported.\n\nThe hazee may be humiliated by being hosed or by sprinkler or buckets; covered with dirt or with (sometimes rotten) food, even urinated upon. Olive or baby oil may be used to \"show off\" the bare skin, for wrestling or just slipperiness, e.g., to complicate pole climbing. Cleaning may be limited to a dive into water, hosing down or even paddling the worst off. They may have to do tedious cleaning including swabbing the decks or cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush. In fraternities, pledges often must clean up a mess intentionally made by brothers which can include fecal matter, urine, and dead animals.\n\nServitude such as waiting on others (as at fraternity parties) or various other forms of housework, often with tests of obedience. In some cases, the hazee may be made to eat raw eggs, peppers, hot sauce, or drink too much alcohol. Some hazing even includes eating or drinking vile things such as bugs or rotting food.\nThe hazee may have to wear an imposed piece of clothing, outfit, item or something else worn by the victim in a way that would bring negative attention to the wearer. Examples include a uniform (e.g. toga); a leash or collar (also associated with bondage); infantile and other humiliating dress and attire.\n\nMarkings may also be made on clothing or bare skin. They are painted, written, tattooed or shaved on, sometimes collectively forming a message (one letter, syllable or word on each pledge) or may receive tarring and feathering (or rather a mock version using some glue) or branding.\n\nSubmission to senior members of the group is common. Abject \"etiquette\" required of pledges or subordinates may include prostration, kneeling, literal groveling, and kissing body parts.\n\nOther physical feats may be required, such as calisthenics and other physical tests, such as mud wrestling, forming a human pyramid, or climbing a greased pole. Exposure to the elements may be required, such as swimming or diving in cold water or snow.\n\nOrientation tests may be held, such as abandoning pledges without transport. Dares include jumping from some height, stealing from police or rival teams and obedience. Blood pinning among military aviators (and many other elite groups) to celebrate becoming new pilots is done by piercing their chests with the sharp pins of aviator wings.\n\nOn a pilot's first solo flight, they are often drenched with water, as well as having the back of their shirt cut off to celebrate the achievement. Cutting off the back of the shirt originates from the days of tandem trainers, where the instructor sat behind the student and tugged on the back of their shirt in order to get their attention. Cutting off the back of the shirt symbolizes that the instructor has no need to do that anymore. \n\nOn their first \"crossing the equator\" in military and commercial navigation, each \"pollywog\" is subjected to a series of tests usually including running or crawling a gauntlet of abuse and various scenes supposedly situated at King Neptune's court. A \"pledge auction\" is a variation on the slave auction, where people bid on the paraded pledges.\n\nHazing may also include subjecting the pledge to severe sleep deprivation until physical or mental impairment or hallucinations, including cardiac, digestive or excretory disturbances, are induced, and deliberate food poisonings unbeknownst to the pledge, sometimes through food outlets that are owned or franchised by members of the group, as well as public incidents, stunt accidents and vehicle collisions directed at the pledge by other persons using false identities who are unfamiliar to the pledge, and the practice of \"The Silence\", which is to gaslight the hazee, pretending not to know anything about the hazing or anything about the arguments being presented by the hazing, in order to force the pledge to doubt his or her sanity or self-worth. \"The Silence\" is exercised through covert means of infliction, at a distance, which makes it difficult for the victim to prove to law enforcement or to others. This method usually attempts to make everything that could go wrong, go wrong to the fault of the pledge, even when such errors are discreetly inflicted by the hazers. The hazers may deny the validity of the pledge's witness to events, discoveries, ideas and inventions, tangible reality, or falsify personal relationships.\n\nWhen the hazers are associated with a larger organization, for instance, a major university that controls the local public hospitals, a pledge may encounter abusive behaviors or neglect when seeking needed medical help when the doctors or personnel are of the fraternity. This may also occur when the pledge seeks help from public employees who are also associated. This is done in order to isolate the pledge from their personal identity, their needs and others.\n\nHazings may occur in the home against nonconsenting, involuntary pledges when the family or cohabitants are already members of an organization or group that exercises hazing as a prerequisite for membership, even when \"the pledge\" has refused to join the group. The pledge may not have previously been informed of his or her cohabitant's association, particularly when such associations involve a covert organization. The hazers may attempt to inflict guilt on a sleep-deprived and beleaguered pledge \"for providing a home\", or they may fake \"family emergencies or tragedies\" against any prevailing medical needs of the pledge due to neglect and abuse.\nIn this instance, the subject may be branded as \"pariah\" or as an \"outcast\", in which case they are then subjected to neglect, abuse, violence, or methods such as \"The Silence\", and at risk of persecution if and when they speak of their hazing experiences to others outside of the group. This may be particularly true when the organization or group has violated civil rights, or the law. \"The Silence\" may include the hazers speaking in cryptic puns and double-entendre in order to either communicate their instructions to the pledge in a manner that they cannot be held accountable for, or to mislead the pledge. They may mislead the pledge due to a financial conflict of interest, for instance, a hazing by a family who is in charge of a guardian trust belonging to the pledge, or due to taking unlawful advantage of the pledge, their person or their property rights. This form of hazing may be unlawfully executed in order to force the pledge to release the hazers from their liabilities, as an act of extortion.\n\nHazing also occurs for apprentices in some trades. In printing, it consists of applying bronze blue to the apprentice's penis and testicles, a color made by mixing black printers ink and dark blue printers ink, which takes a long time to wash off. Similarly, mechanics get their groins smeared with old dirty grease.\n\nHazing by women of their suitors, often assisted by the women's friends, can also play a role in budding romantic relationships, usually taking mental and psychological rather than physical forms, and apparently for the same basic purposes as other hazing.\n\nHazing supposedly serves a deliberate purpose of building solidarity. Psychologist Robert Cialdini uses the framework of consistency and commitment to explain the phenomenon of hazing and the vigor and zeal to which practitioners of hazing persist in and defend these activities even when they are made illegal. Cialdini cites a 1959 study in which the researchers observed that \"persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.\" The 1959 study shaped the development of cognitive dissonance theory by Leon Festinger.\n\nPsychologists excel at understanding and explaining why certain group behaviors occur, especially when it comes to hazing; there are studies that better explain what actually happens psychologically and provide more insight into what happens within themselves. There are many different types of hazing. It can be seen in fraternities and sororities, sports teams, and other social clubs/organizations; within these organizations, there are psychological effects that both the hazer and hazee endure. In an article published by Raalte, Cornelius, Linder, and Brewer, they used team sports as a sample of their study. In the article, there seemed to be a more positive outlook of the idea of hazing. During the hazing process, there was a bond between the two parties (the hazer and the hazee) that grew and, in turn, created a more positive influence in the specific community; naturally, people would do it more because it’s seen as positive People want to be accepted and sometimes, people will do anything to get it. Maybe someone is a social outcast and their only way to gain recognition is to join a certain club or organization. If they were to haze that person, it would show to himself and the others that his means to be accepted knows no bounds. If this person were not to join, they would probably be outed and/or ostracized from that community to many others which could lead to other psychological effects.Beyond a legal approach, eliminating or lessening the dangers of hazing requires an understanding and application of psychological and sociological factors. This is especially critical when many view hazing as an effective way to teach respect and develop discipline and loyalty within the group, and believe that hazing is a necessary component of initiation rites. Hazing is a way of building conformity into a social group, something that can be seen in many sociological studies. Moreover, initiation rituals when managed effectively can serve to build team cohesion and improve team performance, while negative and detrimental forms of hazing alienate and disparage individuals.\n\nDissonance can produce feelings of group attraction or social identity among initiates after the hazing experience because they want to justify the effort used. Rewards during initiations or hazing rituals matter in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity. As well as increasing group attraction, hazing can produce conformity among new members. Hazing could also increase feelings of affiliation because of the stressful nature of the hazing experience. Also, hazing has a hard time of being extinguished by those who saw it to be potentially dangerous like administration in education or law enforcement. In an article published by Linda Wilson, she and the National Pan-Hellenic Council Leaders at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University gave their perspectives and opinions on hazing at their institution, and she discussed why hazing is so hard to discontinue. The reason why is because the act of hazing is deeply rooted traditionally, so it becomes hard to break those traditional actions. For example, York College in Pennsylvania tried to solve this issue with suspending students who partake in the act. However, it's hard to dismantle not only because of tradition, but also because it's meant to be done in private spaces. It isn't meant to be public which makes getting rid of it even harder.\n\nA 2014 paper by Harvey Whitehouse discusses theories that hazing can cause social cohesion though group identification and identity fusion. A 2017 study published in \"Scientific Reports\" found that groups that share painful or strong negative experiences can cause visceral bonding, and pro-group behavior. Students of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu who had experienced painful belt-whipping gauntlets had a higher willingness to donate time or risk their lives for the club.\n\nAccording to one of the largest US National Surveys regarding hazing including over 60,000 student athletes from 2,400 colleges and universities:\n\nThe survey found that 79% of college athletes experienced some form of hazing to join their team, yet 60% of the student-athletes respondents indicated that they would not report incidents of hazing.\n\nA 2007 survey at American colleges found 55% of students in \"clubs, teams, and organizations\" experienced behavior the survey defined as hazing, including in varsity athletics and Greek-letter organizations. This survey found 47% of respondents experienced hazing before college, and in 25% of hazing cases, school staff were aware of the activity. 90% of students who experienced behavior the researchers defined as hazing did not consider themselves to have been hazed, and 95% of those who experienced what they themselves defined as hazing did not report it. The most common hazing-related activities reported in student groups included alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts.\n\nSome chapters of fraternities and sororities have developed complex hazing rituals that range from demeaning tasks to embarrassing ceremonies. These practices are most common in, but not limited to, North American schools. Other groups within university life that have hazing rituals include competition teams, fan clubs, social groups, secret societies and even certain service clubs. While hazing is less common in high schools, some secondary education institutions have developed hazing rituals.\n\nThe armed forces have long had hazing rituals, which often involve violence and punishments. The United States military defines hazing as unnecessarily exposing a fellow soldier to an act which is cruel, abusive, oppressive, or harmful. In the modern western military, which combines discipline with welfare priorities, initiation practices can cause controversy. There is a tradition in many military – especially elite – corps of subjecting the newly trained ranks to a hell night-like \"joining run\", a macho preparation of men in the prime of their lives for the ordeals of warfare, going beyond what most civilians (and even many service personnel) would find acceptable; it usually combines humiliation (such as nudity) with physical endurance.\n\nPolice forces, especially those with a paramilitary tradition, or sub-units of police forces such as tactical teams, may also have hazing rituals. Rescue services, such as lifeguards or air-sea rescue teams may have hazing rituals.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the so-called 'traditional fraternities' have an introduction time which includes hazing rituals. The pledges go for a few days to a camp during which they undergo hazing rituals but are meanwhile introduced in the traditions of the fraternity. After camp, there are usually evenings or whole days in which the pledges have to be present at the fraternity, although slowly the pressure is released and the relations become somewhat more equal. Often, pledges collect or perform chores to raise funds for charity. At the end of the hazing period, the inauguration of the new members take place.\n\nIncidents have occurred resulting in injuries and death. Often these incidents occur when members wish to join a house, (prestigious) sub-structure or commission for which they undergo a second (and usually heavier) hazing ritual. Incidents mostly occur during hazing rituals for these sub-structures, since there is less or no control from the fraternity board. Also, these sub-structure hazing rituals involve often excessive alcohol abuse, even when alcohol has become a taboo in hazing of the fraternity itself. Other situations causing additional risks for incidents are members (often joining the hazing camp but not designated with any responsibility) separating pledges and taking them away from the main group to 'amuse themselves' with them.\n\nIn 1965 a student at Utrecht University choked to death during a hazing ritual (\"Roetkapaffaire\"). There was public outrage when the perpetrators were convicted to light conditional sentences while left-wing Provo demonstrators were given unconditional prison sentences for order disturbances. The fact that the magistrates handling the case were all alumni of the same fraternity gave rise to accusions of nepotism and class justice. Two incidents in 1997, leading to one heavy injury and one death, lead to sharpened scrutiny over hazing. Hazing incidents have nevertheless occurred since, but justice is becoming keener in persecuting perpetrators.\n\nThe Netherlands has no anti-hazing legislation. Hazing incidents can be handled by internal resolution by the fraternity itself (the lightest cases), and via the criminal justice system as assault or in case of death negligent homicide or manslaughter. Universities as a rule support student unions (financially and by granting board members of such union a discount on the required number of ECTS credits) but can in the most extreme case suspend or withdraw recognition and support for such union.\n\nAccording to R. Dayao, hazing, usually in initiation rites of fraternities, has a long history in the Philippines, and has been a source of public controversy after many cases that resulted to death of the neophyte. The first recorded death due to hazing in the Philippines was recorded in 1954, with the death of Gonzalo Mariano Albert. Hazing was regulated under the Anti-Hazing Act of 1995, after the death of Leonardo Villa in 1991, but many cases, usually causing severe injury or death, continued even after it was enacted, the latest involving Horacio Castillo III, a College of Law student from the University of Santo Tomas.\n\nRagging is a practice similar to hazing in educational institutions in South Asia. The word is mainly used in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Ragging involves existing students baiting or bullying new students. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to psychological or physical torture.\n\nIn 2009 the University Grants Commission of India imposed regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging, and launched a toll-free 'anti ragging helpline'.\n\nThe practice of ritual abuse among social groups is not clearly understood. This is partly due to the secretive nature of the activities, especially within collegiate fraternities and sororities, and in part a result of long-term acceptance of hazing. Thus, it has been difficult for researchers to agree on the underlying social and psychological mechanisms that perpetuate hazing. In military circles hazing is sometimes assumed to test recruits under situations of stress and hostility. Although in no way a recreation of combat, hazing does put people into stressful situations that they are unable to control, which allegedly should weed out the weaker members prior to being put in situations where failure to perform will cost lives. A portion of the military training course known as Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) simulates as closely as is feasible the physical and psychological conditions of a POW camp.\n\nThe problem with this approach, according to opponents, is that the stress and hostility comes from \"inside\" the group, and not from \"outside\" as in actual combat situation, creating suspicion and distrust towards the superiors and comrades-in-arms. Willing participants may be motivated by a desire to prove to senior soldiers their stability in future combat situations, making the unit more secure, but blatantly brutal hazing can in fact produce negative results, making the units more prone to break, desert or mutiny than those without hazing traditions, as observed in the Russian army in Chechnya, where units with the strongest traditions of dedovschina were the first to break and desert under enemy fire. At worst, hazing may lead into fragging incidents. Colleges and universities sometimes avoid publicizing hazing incidents for fear of damaging institutional reputations or incurring financial liability to victims.\n\nIn a 1999 study, a survey of 3,293 collegiate athletes, coaches, athletic directors and deans found a variety of approaches to prevent hazing, including strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases, implementation of athletic, behavioral, and academic standards guiding recruitment; provisions for alternative bonding and recognition events for teams to prevent hazing; and law enforcement involvement in monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting hazing incidents. Hoover's research suggested half of all college athletes are involved in alcohol-related hazing incidents, while one in five are involved in potentially illegal hazing incidents. Only another one in five was involved in what Hoover described as positive initiation events, such as taking team trips or running obstacle courses.\n\nHoover wrote: \"Athletes most at risk for any kind of hazing for college sports were men; non-Greek members; and either swimmers, divers, soccer players, or lacrosse players. The campuses where hazing was most likely to occur were primarily in eastern or southern states with no anti-hazing laws. The campuses were rural, residential, and had Greek systems.\" (Hoover uses the term \"Greek\" to refer to U.S.-style fraternities and sororities.) Hoover found that non-fraternity members were most at risk of hazing, and that football players are most at risk of potentially dangerous or illegal hazing. In the May issue of the \"American Journal of Emergency Medicine\", Michelle Finkel reported that hazing injuries are often not recognized for their true cause in emergency medical centers. The doctor said hazing victims sometimes hide the real cause of injuries out of shame or to protect those who caused the harm. In protecting their abusers, hazing victims can be compared with victims of domestic violence, Finkel wrote.\n\nFinkel cites hazing incidents including \"beating or kicking to the point of traumatic injury or death, burning or branding, excessive calisthenics, being forced to eat unpleasant substances, and psychological or sexual abuse of both males and females\". Reported coerced sexual activity is sometimes considered \"horseplay\" rather than rape, she wrote. Finkel quoted from Hank Nuwer's book \"Wrongs of Passage\" which counted 56 hazing deaths between 1970 and 1999.\n\nIn November 2005, controversy arose over a video showing Royal Marines fighting naked and intoxicated as part of a hazing ritual. The fight culminated with one soldier receiving a kick to the face, rendering him unconscious. The victim, according to the BBC, said \"It's just Marine humour\". The Marine who leaked the video said \"The guy laid out was inches from being dead.\" Under further investigation, the Marines had just returned from a six-month tour of Iraq, and were in their \"cooling down\" period, in which they spend two weeks at a naval base before they are allowed back into society. The man who suffered the kick to the head did not press charges.\n\nIn 2008, a national hazing study was conducted by Dr Elizabeth Allan and Dr Mary Madden from the University of Maine. This investigation is the most comprehensive study of hazing to date and includes survey responses from more than 11,000 undergraduate students at 53 colleges and universities in different regions of the U.S. and interviews with more than 300 students and staff at 18 of these campuses. Through the vision and efforts of many, this study fills a major gap in the research and extends the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding about hazing. Ten initial findings are described in the report, Hazing in View: College Students at Risk. These include:\n\nWith hazing, there have been countless instances where it has been taken too far and has resulted in death or near death experiences. Sometimes people who haze others are too indulged in the act of doing it that they’re not attentive to possible harm to the other person.\n\n\n"}

Paul Reddam\n\nJohn Paul Reddam B.A. M.A. Ph.D. (born July 28, 1955) is a Canadian businessman, Thoroughbred racehorse owner and a former professor of philosophy at California State University, Los Angeles.\n\nKnown by his middle name, J. Paul Reddam was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and graduated from the University of Windsor with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He then obtained a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Toronto. In 1979, he moved to California to earn his Ph.D. at the University of Southern California and made his home in the state. Reddam wrote his Ph.D. dissertation, entitled \"Pragmatics and the Language of Belief,\" in 1982, focusing on \"pragmatic theories of belief ascription.\" \n\nIn 1995, he established a mortgage lending company, Ditech, and sold the business to General Motors in 1999. \"The New York Times\" reported that Governor of California Jerry Brown characterized Reddam's company's debt collection methods as loan sharking.\n\nHe now owns CashCall, Inc., another firm specializing in small loans at very high interest rates.\n\nAs a young man, Reddam became interested in the harness races held at Windsor Raceway that eventually led to his involvement as an owner while working as a university professor in Los Angeles. He used to have Standardbred horses competing at Windsor Raceway (has since closed down) and at Cal Expo in Sacramento, California. In 1988 he acquired his first Thoroughbred and has expanded his involvement to a current forty-horse racing stable plus twenty broodmares for his own breeding operations through arrangements with breeding farms in California and Kentucky.\n\nWidely respected in the industry for his strong support of Thoroughbred racing, Reddam's first major success came in 2004 with a win by 75%-owned Wilko in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and his next in 2006 with Red Rocks in the Breeders' Cup Turf. His Thoroughbred racing stable is led by head trainer Doug O'Neill, with several horses being conditioned by Craig Dollase. His greatest achievement came when his colt I'll Have Another, from 19th position, won the 2012 Kentucky Derby and the 2012 Preakness Stakes. \"The New York Times\" reported that the trainer used by Reddam was suspended for drug violation. His horse Nyquist won the Kentucky Derby in 2016. Nyquist and I'll Have Another were both trained by Doug O'Neill and won the 2012 and 2016 Kentucky Derby races with jockey Mario Gutierrez.\n\nReddam resigned from Ditech in May 2000 after three of his top managers were indicted for extortion. Gregory Kenneth DeLong, Vincent Pozzuoli and Jay David Marx were arrested for allegedly soliciting kickbacks from a Pittsburgh company that provided services for Ditech.\n\nReddam sued GMAC Mortgage Corp in 2000, alleging that the company failed to pay $200 million that it owed after acquiring Ditech.\n\nIn 2013, Reddam was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for violating consumer protection laws in a case related to Cashcall and other companies he was involved in.\n"}

He is also known as an internet performance artist, who has organized two relatively high-profile stunts, \"Paint the Moon\" and \"Nobel Prize for Jo\". In addition, he is one of the principals behind the ballistics research project \"Ballistics by the Inch\" and a writer for Guns.com.\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Downey graduated from Grinnell College in Iowa, and did graduate work in English Literature at the University of Iowa. While there he discovered the Iowa Center for the Book, where he learned bookbinding, papermaking and book conservation, launching his career as a book and paper conservator. While at Iowa he also took classes with the Iowa Writers' Workshop, which furthered his desire to write.\n\nDowney's first novel, \"Communion of Dreams\" was published in January 2012. Set in 2052, when the human race is still struggling to recover from a massive pandemic flu some 40 years earlier. When an independent prospector on Saturn's moon Titan discovers an alien artifact, assumptions that we are alone in the universe are called into question. Knowing that news of such a discovery could prompt chaos on Earth, a small team is sent to investigate and hopefully manage the situation. What they find is that there's more to human history, and human abilities, than any of them ever imagined. And that they will need all those insights, and all those abilities, to face the greatest threat yet to human survival.\n\nDowney has also written, with co-author John Bourke, a memoir of care giving for their respective mothers-in-law. That memoir, \"Her Final Year\", was published in July 2011. The book offers some perspective on the experience of caregiving for a victim of dementia from the point of view of people living it. It is part memoir, part journal, and all based on blog posts, e-mails, and journal entries they and their wives wrote at the time. The authors were both full-time in-home care givers and felt that reading about their experiences, their difficulties and decisions, and their recoveries, would be helpful to others currently in a care giving role.\n\nDowney organized two relatively high-profile internet projects which gained some notoriety at the time.\n\nIn 2001, working off an idea in a novel he was writing (\"Communion of Dreams\"), Downey theorised that there may be enough laser powered pens to show a red spot on the Moon. He created a simple website and dubbed the project \"Paint the Moon\". As a 'collective lyric fantasy', he encouraged anyone in possession of a laser pen to point it at the Moon at a specified time on a certain date, theoretically to create a dot on the Moon's surface. \"Uniting millions of people around the globe to attempt this ostensibly impossible task is a new kind of performance art,\" Downey wrote on his site. The idea was picked up on the web and in the media, and generated a lot of worldwide attention, including interviews with Howard Stern and on Weekend Edition Saturday. Though many responded back with e-mails notifying Downey of their participation, the project was a failure in its ostensible goal. Eric Van Stryland, director of Center for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers at the University of Central Florida noted to USA Today that although it's \"still a fun idea\", such a project would need \"at least a few million billion red laser pointers to see a big red spot on the moon.\"\n\nIn 2003, Downey attempted to win Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling a 2004 Nobel Prize for Literature, by organising a letter writing campaign via e-mail. Attempting to get author Rowling considered for the prestigious award, he created a website launched in July 2003 called the \"Nobel Prize For Jo\", urging the global community to participate. On his web page, he was quoted as saying that \"I bet if we sent them a few hundred thousand letters, they'd pay attention.\" Hailed by the BBC as an \"Internet crusade\", it failed to get any letters sent in, and Downey happily concedes that it is probably his greatest failure to date. \"Even the Harry Potter fans hated the idea,\" said Downey. Only one hundred people are reported to have e-mailed to the address provided.\n\nOnly literary professors, members of literature academies, and past winners of the prize may submit suggestions for Nobel recipients. A fan-based campaign alone would not have caused Rowling to win the prize.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "71394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71394", "title": "Jane Jacobs", "text": "Jane Jacobs\n\nJane Jacobs (\"née\" Butzner; May 4, 1916 – April 25, 2006) was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist who influenced urban studies, sociology, and economics. Her book \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" (1961) argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. It also introduced the sociological concepts \"eyes on the street\" and \"social capital\".\n\nJacobs organized grassroots efforts to protect neighborhoods from \"slum clearance\", in particular Robert Moses' plans to overhaul her own Greenwich Village neighborhood. She was instrumental in the eventual cancellation of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have passed directly through SoHo and Little Italy. She was arrested in 1968 for inciting a crowd at a public hearing on that project. After moving to Toronto in 1968, she joined the opposition to the Spadina Expressway and the associated network of expressways in Toronto planned, and under construction.\n\nAs a mother and a writer who criticized experts in the male-dominated field of urban planning, Jacobs endured scorn from established figures. She did not have a college degree or any formal training in urban planning, and her lack of credentials was seized upon as grounds for criticism.\n\nJacobs was born Jane Butzner in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Bess Robison Butzner, a former teacher and nurse and John Decker Butzner, a physician. They were a Protestant family in a heavily Roman Catholic town. Her brother, John Decker Butzner, Jr., served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. After graduation from Scranton High School, she worked for a year as the unpaid assistant to the women's page editor at the \"Scranton Tribune\".\n\nIn 1935, during the Great Depression, she moved to New York City with her sister Betty. Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's Greenwich Village, which did not conform to the city's grid structure. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.\n\nDuring her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a stenographer and freelance writer, writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \"gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\" Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the \"Sunday Herald Tribune\", \"Cue\" magazine, and \"Vogue\".\n\nShe studied at Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, taking courses in geology, zoology, law, political science, and economics. About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:\n\nFor the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.\n\nAfter attending Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, Butzner found a job at \"Iron Age\" magazine. Her 1943 article on economic decline in Scranton was well-publicized and led the Murray Corporation of America to locate a warplane factory there. Encouraged by this success, Butzner petitioned the War Production Board to support more operations in Scranton. Experiencing job discrimination at \"Iron Age\", she also advocated for equal pay for women and for the right of workers to unionize.\n\nShe became a feature writer for the Office of War Information, and then a reporter for \"Amerika\", a publication of the U.S. State Department. While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for Grumman. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 Hudson St. Jane continued to write for \"Amerika\" after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect.\n\nThe Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as \"parasitic\", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village. They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard.\n\nWorking for the State Department during the McCarthy era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the Federal Workers Union because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of Saul Alinsky; therefore she was under suspicion. On March 25, 1952, Jacobs delivered her response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the United States Department of State. In her foreword to her answer, she said:\n\nThe other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ...\n\nJacobs left \"Amerika\" in 1952 when it announced its relocation to Washington, D.C. She found a well-paying job at \"Architectural Forum\", published by Henry Luce of Time Inc. After early success on the job, Jacobs began to take assignments on urban planning and \"urban blight\". In 1954, she was assigned to cover a development in Philadelphia designed by Edmund Bacon. Although her editors expected a positive story, Jacobs criticized Bacon's project, reacting against its lack of concern for the poor African Americans who were directly affected. When Bacon showed Jacobs examples of undeveloped and developed blocks, she determined that \"development\" seemed to end community life on the street. When Jacobs returned to the offices of \"Architectural Forum\", she began to question the 1950s consensus on urban planning.\n\nIn 1955, Jacobs met William Kirk, an Episcopal minister who worked in East Harlem. Kirk came to the \"Architectural Forum\" offices to describe the impact that \"revitalization\" had on East Harlem, and he introduced Jacobs to the neighborhood.\n\nIn 1956, Jacobs delivered a lecture at Harvard University, standing in for Douglas Haskell of \"Architectural Forum\". She addressed leading architects, urban planners, and intellectuals (including Lewis Mumford), speaking on the topic of East Harlem. She urged this audience to \"respect – in the deepest sense – strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order.\" Contrary to her expectations, the talk was received with enthusiasm, but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners, real estate owners, and developers. \"Architectural Forum\" printed the speech that year, along with photographs of East Harlem.\n\nAfter reading her Harvard speech, William H. Whyte invited Jacobs to write an article for \"Fortune magazine\". The resulting piece, \"Downtown Is for People\", appeared in a 1958 issue of \"Fortune\", and marked her first public criticism of Robert Moses. Her criticism of the Lincoln Center was not popular with supporters of urban renewal at \"Architectural Forum\" and \"Fortune\". C.D. Jackson, the publisher of \"Fortune\", was outraged and demanded of Whyte over the phone: \"Who is this crazy dame?\"\n\nThe \"Fortune\" article brought Jacobs to the attention of Chadbourne Gilpatric, then associate director of the Humanities Division at the Rockefeller Foundation. The foundation had moved aggressively into urban topics, with a recent award to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for studies of urban aesthetics that would culminate in the publication of Kevin A. Lynch's \"Image of the City\". In May 1958, Gilpatric invited Jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals. Later that year, the Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the U.S. (From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the foundation's Humanities Division sponsored an \"Urban Design Studies\" research program, of which Jacobs was the best known grantee.) Gilpatric encouraged Jacobs to \"explor[e] the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which may improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life, including cultural and humane value.\" Affiliating with The New School (then called The New School for Social Research), she spent three years conducting research and writing drafts. In 1961, Random House published the result: \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\".\n\n\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" remains one of the most influential books in the history of American city planning. She coined the terms \"social capital\", \"mixed primary uses\", and \"eyes on the street\", which were adopted professionally in urban design, sociology, and other fields. Jacobs painted a devastating picture of the profession of city planning, labeling it a pseudoscience. This angered the male-dominated urban planning profession. Jacobs was criticized as a \"militant dame\" and a \"housewife\": an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline. The book was criticized from the left for leaving out race and accepting gentrification.\n\nIn 1962 she resigned her position at \"Architectural Forum\" to become a full-time author and mother. In other political activities she became an opponent of the Vietnam War, marched on the Pentagon in October 1967 and criticized the construction of the World Trade Center as a disaster for Manhattan's waterfront.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Jacobs' home neighborhood of Greenwich Village was being transformed by City and State efforts to build housing (see, for example, Jacobs' fight to build the West Village Houses in lieu of large apartment houses), private developers, the expansion of New York University (NYU), and by the urban renewal plans of Robert Moses. Moses' plan, funded as \"slum clearance\" by Title I of the Housing Act of 1949, also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises. The plan forced 132 families out of their homes and displaced 1,000 small businesses—the result was Washington Square Village.\nAs part of his efforts to revitalize the area, Moses proposed the extension of Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park in 1935. In the face of community opposition, Moses shelved the project, but revived the idea in the 1950s. Moses argued that the Fifth Avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX), which would connect the Manhattan Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge with the Holland Tunnel.\n\nIn response, local activist Shirley Hayes created the \"Committee to Save Washington Square Park\", a coalition of dozens of local neighborhood groups that opposed the roadway extension. Raymond S. Rubinow eventually took over the organization, changing its name to the \"Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square to Traffic.\" Jacobs had joined the committee under Hayes, but took a more prominent role under Rubinow, reaching out to media outlets such as \"The Village Voice\", which provided more sympathetic coverage than \"The New York Times\". The committee gained the support of Margaret Mead, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lewis Mumford, Charles Abrams, and William H. Whyte, as well as Carmine De Sapio, Greenwich Village resident and influential Democratic leader. De Sapio's involvement proved decisive. On June 25, 1958, the city closed Washington Square Park to traffic, and the joint committee held a ribbon tying (not cutting) ceremony.\n\nPlans for LOMEX expressway continued despite growing community opposition in areas such as Little Italy. In the 1960s, Jacobs chaired the Joint Committee to Stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway. \"The New York Times\" was sympathetic to Moses, while \"The Village Voice\" covered community rallies and advocated against the expressway. Jacobs continued to fight the expressway when plans resurfaced in 1962, 1965, and 1968, and she became a local hero for her opposition to the project. She was arrested by a plainclothes police officer on April 10, 1968, at a public hearing during which the crowd had charged the stage and destroyed the stenographer's notes. She was accused of inciting a riot, criminal mischief, and obstructing public administration. After months of trials conducted in New York City (to which Jacobs commuted from Toronto), her charge was reduced to disorderly conduct.\n\n\"\" devoted an hour of the eight-part, seventeen-and-a-half-hour series to the battle between Moses and Jacobs. Robert Caro's biography of Moses, \"The Power Broker\", gives only passing mention to this event, despite Jacobs's strong influence on Caro. In 2017, Caro told an interviewer about the difficulty in cutting more than 300,000 words from his initial manuscript: \"The section that I wrote on Jane Jacobs disappeared. To this day, when someone says: \"There's hardly a mention of Jane Jacobs,\" I think, \"but I wrote a lot about her.\" Every time I'm asked about that, I have this sick feeling.\"\n\nSoon after her arrest in 1968, Jacobs moved to Toronto, eventually settling at 69 Albany Avenue in The Annex from 1971 until her death in 2006. She decided to leave the U.S. in part because she opposed the Vietnam War, she worried about the fate of her two draft-age sons, and she did not want to continue fighting the NYC government. She and her husband chose Toronto because it was pleasant and offered employment opportunities, and they moved to an area of Toronto that included so many Americans avoiding the draft it was called the \"American ghetto\".\n\nShe quickly became a leading figure in her new city and helped stop the proposed Spadina Expressway. A frequent theme of her work was to ask whether we are building cities for people or for cars. She was arrested twice during demonstrations. She also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the St. Lawrence neighborhood, a housing project regarded as a major success. She became a Canadian citizen in 1974, and she later told writer James Howard Kunstler that dual citizenship was not possible at the time, implying that her U.S. citizenship was lost.\n\nIn 1980, she offered an urbanistic perspective on Quebec's sovereignty in her book \"The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Separation\". Jacobs was an advocate of a Province of Toronto to separate the city proper from Ontario. Jacobs said, \"Cities, to thrive in the twenty-first century, must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas.\" \n\nShe was selected to be an officer of the Order of Canada in 1996 for her seminal writings and thought-provoking commentaries on urban development. The community and urban sociology section of the American Sociological Association awarded her its Outstanding Lifetime Contribution award in 2002. In 1997, the city government of Toronto sponsored a conference entitled \"Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter\", which led to a book by the same name. At the end of the conference, the Jane Jacobs Prize was created. It includes an annual stipend of $5,000 for three years to be given to \"celebrate Toronto's original, unsung heroes – by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city's vitality\".\nJacobs never shied away from expressing her political support for specific candidates. She opposed the 1997 amalgamation of the cities of Metro Toronto, fearing that individual neighbourhoods would have less power with the new structure. She backed an ecologist, Tooker Gomberg, who lost Toronto's 2000 mayoralty race, and was an adviser to David Miller's successful mayoral campaign in 2003, at a time when he was seen as a longshot. During the mayoral campaign, Jacobs helped lobby against the construction of a bridge to join the city waterfront to Toronto City Centre Airport (TCCA). Following the election, the Toronto city council's earlier decision to approve the bridge was reversed and bridge construction project was stopped. TCCA did upgrade the ferry service and the airport was still in operation as of 2018. In lieu of the bridge, a pedestrian tunnel broke ground in March 2012. The tunnel opened on July 30, 2015.\n\nJacobs also was active in a campaign against a plan of Royal St. George's College (an established school very close to Jacobs' residence in Toronto's Annex district) to reconfigure its facilities. Jacobs suggested not only that the redesign be stopped, but also, that the school be forced from the neighborhood entirely. Although Toronto council initially rejected the school's plans, the decision later was reversed – and the project was given the go-ahead by the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) when opponents failed to produce credible witnesses and tried to withdraw from the case during the hearing.\n\nShe also had an influence on Vancouver's urban planning. Jacobs has been called \"the mother of Vancouverism\", referring to that city's use of her \"density done well\" philosophy.\n\nJacobs died in Toronto Western Hospital aged 89, on April 25, 2006, apparently, of a stroke. She was survived by a brother, James Butzner (d. 2009); her two sons, James and Ned of Vancouver, and a daughter, Burgin Jacobs; by two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Upon her death her family's statement noted: \"What's important is not that she died but that she lived, and that her life's work has greatly influenced the way we think. Please remember her by reading her books and implementing her ideas\".\n\nJacobs is credited, along with Lewis Mumford, with inspiring the New Urbanist movement. She has been characterized as a major influence on decentralist and radical centrist thought. She discussed her legacy in an interview with \"Reason magazine\".\n\nWhile Jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory, it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive impact. Her observations about the ways in which cities function revolutionized the urban planning profession and discredited many accepted planning models that dominated mid-century planning. The influential Harvard Economist Edward Glaeser, known for his work on urban studies, acknowledged that Jane Jacobs (1960s) had been prescient in attacking Moses for \"replacing well-functioning neighborhoods with Le Corbusier-inspired towers.\" Glaeser agreed that these housing projects proved to be Moses' greatest failures, \"Moses spent millions and evicted tens of thousands to create buildings that became centers of crime, poverty, and despair.\"\n\nShe also was famous for introducing concepts such as the \"Ballet of the Sidewalk\" and \"Eyes on the Street\", a reference to what would later be known as natural surveillance. The concept had a huge influence on planners and architects such as Oscar Newman, who operationalized the idea through a series of studies that would culminate in his defensible space theory. Jacobs's and Newman's work would go on to affect American housing policy through the HOPE VI Program, an effort by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to demolish the high-rise public housing projects so reviled by Jacobs, and to replace them with low-rise, mixed-income housing.\n\nThroughout her life, she fought to alter the way in which city development was approached. By arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems, she advocated ideas such as \"mixed use\" development and bottom-up planning. Furthermore, her harsh criticisms of \"slum clearing\" and \"high-rise housing\" projects were instrumental in discrediting these once universally-supported planning practices.\n\nJacobs is remembered as being an advocate for the mindful development of cities, and for leaving \"a legacy of empowerment for citizens to trust their common sense and become advocates for their place\".\n\nDespite the fact that Jacobs mainly focused on New York, her arguments have been identified as universal. For instance, her opposition against the demolition of urban neighbourhoods for projects of urban renewal had \"special resonance\" in Melbourne, Australia. In Melbourne in the 1960s, resident associations fought against large-scale high-rise housing projects of the Housing Commission of Victoria, which they argued had little regard for the impact on local communities.\n\nJacobs fought an uphill battle against dominant trends of planning despite the United States remaining very much a suburban nation, the work of Jacobs has contributed to city living being rehabilitated and revitalized. Because of her ideas, today, many distressed urban neighbourhoods are more likely to be gentrified than cleared for redevelopment.\n\nSamuel R. Delany's book \"Times Square Red, Times Square Blue\" relies heavily on \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" in its analysis of the nature of social relations within the realm of urban studies.\n\nAfter Jacobs' death in April 2006, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a Jane Jacobs Day, held on June 28, 2006. The City of Toronto proclaimed her birthday the following year, May 4, 2007, as Jane Jacobs Day.\n\nIn connection with Jane Jacobs Day in Toronto, two dozen free neighborhood walks in the city were offered that weekend (May 5, 2007) as an active memorial to Jacobs, and were dubbed Jane's Walks. A Jane's Walk event was later held in New York on September 29 and 30, 2007. In 2008, the event spread to eight cities and towns throughout Canada, and by 2016, Jane's Walks were taking place in 212 cities in 36 countries, on six continents. The interpretive walks typically apply ideas Jacobs identified or espoused to local areas, which are explored on foot and sometimes by bicycle. The walks normally take place in early May, on or close to her May 4 birthday. Walks are organized and led by local volunteers, coordinated by a headquarters office in Toronto. There are more than 200 walks offered in Toronto, alone, in 2016, taking place May 6, 7 and 8.\n\nIn 2016, to mark the 100th anniversary of Jacobs' birth, a Toronto gallery is staging \"Jane at Home\", an exhibition running from April 29 to May 8. Curated by Jane's son, Jim Jacobs, it offers glimpses of her home life, where she also worked. Her Toronto living room is represented, based on the one at her Albany Avenue house in The Annex, where she often spoke with noted thinkers and political leaders including Marshall McLuhan, Paul Martin, and the Queen of the Netherlands. On display are her typewriter, original manuscripts, rediscovered photographs demonstrating her distinctive styles, and personal mementos. The exhibit includes furniture from previous homes in New York (her dining room is set up) and from Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2007, the Municipal Art Society of New York partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation to host an exhibit focusing on \"Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York,\" which opened at the society in September that year. The exhibit aimed to educate the public on her writings and activism and used tools to encourage new generations to become active in issues involving their own neighborhoods. An accompanying exhibit publication includes essays and articles by such architecture critics, artists, activists, and journalists as Malcolm Gladwell, Reverend Billy, Robert Neuwirth, Tom Wolfe, Thomas de Monchaux, and William McDonough. Many of these contributors participated in a series of panel discussions on \"Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York\".\n\nAs a tribute to Jacobs, the Rockefeller Foundation, which had awarded Jacobs grants in the 1950s and 1960s, announced on February 9, 2007, the creation of the Jane Jacobs Medal, \"to recognize individuals who have made a significant contribution to thinking about urban design, specifically in New York City\". Recipients:\n\nThe Canadian Urban Institute offers an award in Jacobs' name, the Jane Jacobs Lifetime Achievement Award, to recognize a person \"who has had significant impact on the health of their region consistent with Jane Jacob's belief that successful cities foster a place-based, community-centred approach.\"\n\nThe 2011 winner was Eberhard Zeidler, while his daughter, Margie Zeidler, won the 2015 award.

Robert Moses has generally been identified as her archrival during this period. Since then, Jacobs' ideas have been analysed many times, often in regard to the outcomes that their influences have produced.\n\nIn places such as the West Village, the factors that she argued would maintain economic and cultural diversity have led instead to gentrification and some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Her family's conversion of an old candy shop into a home is an example of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of Jacobs's ideas.\n\nGentrification also was caused, however, by \"the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city\". The extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable. For example, she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, she saw them as \"guarantors of social diversity\" (Klemek, 2011:76). That many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane Jacobs' planning ideas.\n\nHer concepts have also been criticized more broadly. Economist Tyler Cowen has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure, and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development. For example, although her ideas of planning were praised at times as \"universal\", they are now thought inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million (as has happened many times in developing nations). Such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of New York, where Jacobs developed many of her ideas.\n\nJane Jacobs spent her life studying cities. Her books include:\n\n\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" is her single-most influential book and possibly the most influential book on urban planning and cities. Published in 1961, this book was widely read by both planning professionals and the general public; the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s, which, she claimed, destroyed communities and created isolated, unnatural urban spaces. Jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land, which would result in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods and frequently cited New York City's Greenwich Village as an example of a vibrant urban community.\n\nRobert Caro has cited it as the strongest influence on \"The Power Broker\", his Pulitzer-winning biography of Robert Moses, though Caro does not mention Jacobs by name even once in the book despite Jacobs' battles with Moses over his proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway. Caro reportedly cut a chapter about Jacobs due to his book's length.\n\nBeyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that \"Death and Life\" offers, the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes.\n\nThe thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement. Import replacement occurs when a city begins to produce goods locally that it formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.\n\nIn an interview with Bill Steigerwald in \"Reason Magazine\", Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of import replacement. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.\n\nIn the second part of the book Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition. Another interpretation of history, generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to Jacobs' is supported by Marxist archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe and in recent times by another historical materialist Charles Keith Maisels These writers argue that agriculture preceded cities. The apparent opposition between Childe and Jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city,' 'civilization,' or 'urban.' Childe, like other materialists such as Maisels or Henri Lefebvre defines 'urban' or 'civilization' as Synoecism—as a literate, socially stratified, monolithic political community, whereas, as one can see from \"The Economy of Cities\" or from \"Cities and the Wealth of Nations\", Jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor. Without the requirements of literacy, monumental building, or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces, 'cities' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when Childe and Maisels place them. However, Jacobs' definition is supposition, since 'city' is defined simply as a large town or \"a large human settlement\" indicating permanence. The earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement, implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found.\n\n\"The Question of Separatism\" incorporated and expanded Jacobs' presentation of the 1979 Massey Lectures, entitled \"Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association\". It was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously-unpublished 2005 interview with Robin Philpot on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership. This was in fact the first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist Richard Gwyn advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking Canadians readers thought she did not understood how Canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the 1980 referendum was just defeated by a vote of 60%). \"The Question of Separatism\" was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in \"The Globe and Mail\".\n\nJacobs' book advances the view that Quebec's eventual independence is best for Montreal, Toronto, the rest of Canada, and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites Norway's secession from Sweden and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the Quiet Revolution are examined, along with Canada's historical reliance on natural resources and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own economic development. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its skis and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of René Lévesque, Claude Ryan, and then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent currencies are essential to the success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of Québécois culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward regional-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the Enlightenment, which perceived nature as a force for \"standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability.\" Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, \"diversity itself is of the essence of excellence.\" The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.\n\n\"Cities and the Wealth of Nations\" attempts to do for economics what \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists. Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in macroeconomics. Jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state, rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book \"The Economy of Cities\", while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second, or not at all.\n\n\"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics\" moves outside of the city, studying the moral underpinnings of work. As with her other work, she used an observational approach. This book is written as a Platonic dialogue. It appears that she (as described by characters in her book) took newspaper clippings of moral judgments related to work, collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behaviour that were mutually exclusive. She calls these two patterns \"Moral Syndrome A\", or commercial moral syndrome, and \"Moral Syndrome B\", or guardian moral syndrome. She claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners, scientists, farmers, and traders. Similarly, she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government, charities, hunter-gatherers, and religious institutions. She also claims that these Moral Syndromes are fixed, and do not fluctuate over time.\n\nIt is important to stress that Jane Jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral ideas that are not included in her syndrome are applicable to both syndromes.\n\nJane Jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed, showing the work underpinnings of the Mafia and communism, and what happens when New York subway Police are paid bonuses here – reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis.\n\n\"The Nature of Economies\", a dialog between friends concerning the premise: \"human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect\" (p. \"ix\"), argues that the same principles underlie both ecosystems and economies: \"development and co-development through differentiations and their combinations; expansion through diverse, multiple uses of energy; and self-maintenance through self-refueling\" (p. 82).\n\nJacobs' characters discuss the four methods by which \"dynamically stable systems\" may evade collapse: \"bifurcations; positive-feedback loops; negative-feedback controls; and emergency adaptations\" (p. 86). Their conversations also cover the \"double nature of fitness for survival\" (traits to avoid destroying one's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed, p. 119), and unpredictability including the butterfly effect characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause, and self-organization where \"a system can be making itself up as it goes along\" (p. 137).\n\nThrough the dialogue, Jacobs' characters explore and examine the similarities between the functioning of ecosystems and economies. Topics include environmental and economic development, growth and expansion, and how economies and environments keep themselves alive through \"self-refueling.\" Jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems.\n\nThe book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples, which help keep the book \"down to earth\" and comprehensible, if dense. Concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples, showing their coherence in both worlds.\n\nOne particularly interesting insight is the creation of \"something from nothing\" – an economy from nowhere. In the biological world, free energy is given through sunlight, but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy, or at least starter energy. Another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies, for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system: this can lead to the creation of \"new species of work\".\n\nPublished in 2004 by Random House, \"Dark Age Ahead\" posits Jacobs' argument that \"North American\" civilization shows signs of a spiral decline comparable to the collapse of the Roman empire. Her discussion focuses on \"five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm,\" which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community; quality in education; free thought in science; representational government and responsible taxes; and corporate and professional accountability. As the book's title suggests, Jacobs' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works. However, in the conclusion she admits: \"At a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture? Arguably, either could turn out to be true.\"\n\nJane Jacobs says in her work \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" that the sources of orthodox urbanism are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its release was delayed to take advantage of publicity for her second film, \"Smithy\", directed by Hall, a biopic of Charles Kingsford-Smith (played by Randell) where Steinbeck played his wife. The film was a big commercial success but Australia made so few films at the time Steinbeck focused on radio and theatre work.\n\nShe continued to work at the Minerva, appearing in \"Dangerous Corner\" (1946), \"The Third Visitor\" (1946), \"Clutterbuck\" (1947), and \"I Have Been Here Before\" (1948).\n\nAt the Independent she was in \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1951). She appeared in numerous radio serials in the 1950s including \"Blue Hills\", \"Portia Faces Life\" and \"Gabrielle\".\n\nSteinbeck had roles in a horse racing melodrama, \"Into the Straight\" (1949), and another biopic, \"Wherever She Goes\" (1951), playing the mother of Eileen Joyce.\n\nShe was in the film \"Long John Silver\" (1954) and the ensuring series \"The Adventures of Long John Silver\" (1954), playing the wife of the governor.\n\nSteinbeck starred in Australia's first TV serial, \"Autumn Affair\" (1958).\n\nShe was in two one-off TV dramas, \"Reflections in Dark Glasses\" (1960) and \"Thunder on Sycamore Street\" (1961) and had a recurring role in a serial, \"Stormy Petrel\" (1960).\n\nIn 1961 she was in \"Merchant of Venice\" at the Elizabethan Theatre Trust.\n\nFrom 1963 she was a regular member of the ABC's program 'English for New Australians' and she compared \"Woman's World\".\n\nShe was in \"Heartbreak House\" (1964) at the Old Tote.\n\nHer final film role was in \"They're a Weird Mob\" (1966) playing the wife of Chips Rafferty.\n\nShe was married to her first husband, a journalist, from 7 July 1934 until their divorce in 1949. They had a daughter, born in 1939.\n\nShe then married company manager and engineer Brian Dudley Nicholson in 1951.\n\nRetiring from acting in 1966, she accompanied her husband to Orange, New South Wales, and became a teacher of the arts, including running a drama school and authoring a book titled \"On Stage: A Practical Guide To the Actor's Craft\".\n\nShe died of cancer on 20 July 1982, a day before her 69th birthday.\n\n"}
{"id": "55791680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55791680", "title": "Nepal Open University", "text": "Nepal Open University\n\nNepal Open University formally established in 2016 in Nepal, with endorsement of Nepal Open University act by the parliament of Nepal. This is the premier Open University in Nepal with a legal status on par with other universities in the country. It has its main campus in Lalitpur, Nepal.\n\nThe initial formal endeavor of establishing an Open University in Nepal can be traced to 1999, the year when the Government became a signatory of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Consortium to Open and Distance Education. In the Fiscal Year 2008/09, the then Finance Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai in his annual budget speech allocated funding to implement Open University concept in order to provide an opportunity to youths who were deprived of getting education during the conflict period. However, the Nepali government took no concrete action due to the lack of a proper institutional body to initiate implementation of the plan.\n\nMeanwhile, a Canada based non-profit organization, Canada Forum for Nepal (CFFN) brewing the idea of delivering education to the people living in the economically deprived regions of Nepal since 2007, brought together three North American Nepali Diaspora leaders Dr. Ambika P. Adhikari, Dr. Drona P. Rasali and Dr. Pramod Dhakal and an Australian Nepali Diaspora leader Dr. Raju Adhikari to initiate the issue of establishing Open University in Nepal as one of the prime agenda for the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA)’s International Coordination Council (ICC), which endorsed the Open University of Nepal (OUN) Initiative as its flagship project in 2010.\n\nThe NRNA commissioned a Task Force to undertake the tasks of OUN Initiative under the leadership of Dr. Pramod Dhakal. The Task Force worked closely with the Nepalese Ambassadors in Canada and the United States of America as the Government of Nepal’s representatives for coordination in the initial work. Later, the NRNA signed an agreement with the Nepal’s Ministry of Education that provided official mandate of working on the OUN agenda to NRNA. Nepali Diaspora academics around the world rallied behind the OUN initiative, which turned into an important Diaspora project. Later, a series of Memoranda of Understandings were signed between the Government of Nepal and NRNA (2013, 2014 and 2015) and many workshops, webinars and symposia were held in different parts of the world including Canada, US, Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, and Nepal between 2010 and 2016. The places of these meetings, workshops and symposia included Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Houston, Sydney, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Kathmandu. Athabasca University (AU), Canada’s Open University, located near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, provided technical support, and academic impetus throughout the process of formulating the plan and in the implementation of the program for the OUN. AU’s leaders, including its president, vice president and director for distance education travelled to Kathmandu on two occasions and attended several other OUN meetings including in Ottawa, Houston, Sydney and Vancouver. The OUN’s original proponents visited the AU, and held several meetings with the AU leaders to understand the working of an open university. Other universities, such as California State University Long Beach in the initiative of Dean Jeet Joshee, and University of Houston also provided technical and moral support in various stage of the development of OUN. In the initiative of Dean Joshee, an online library portal for the Open University of Nepal within Merlot platform has been created for open access \n\nIn 2011, Dr. Pramod Dhakal moved from Canada to Nepal to work solely on volunteering basis to lead the OUN Initiative. In 2011 and 2012, the OUN Initiative team lobbied with the then Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and several other Nepali leaders and policy makers to establish an interim institutional structure known as Open University Nepal Infrastructure Development Board (OUNIDB) to undertake OUN development activities until the OUN bill was passed by the Nepal’s Parliament. Dr. Pramod Dhakal was inducted as NRNA representative to the OUNIDB. He along with and several NRNA leaders and academics met numerous times with the Nepali parliamentarians, ministers, political and academic leaders, and senior level officials to discuss and promote the OUN. This group also intensely lobbied for the passage of the OUN Bill in the Nepali parliament. Dr. Pramod Dhakal worked full time to move the OUN agenda forward and wrote numerous reports, policy documents, and contributed in the development of drafts of the OUN bill, agreements between NRNA and the Government of Nepal and Athabasca University, and several other background documents.\n\nIn two instances, the legislative bills for OUN were tabled in the Legislature Parliament of Nepal. First one was aborted due to dissolution of the Parliament in May 2012. The second bill was passed by the Parliament on June 30, 2016. In this process, the Himalyan Times, a national daily in Kathmandu underscored the efforts of the NRNA’s Open University of Nepal Initiative Task Force as commendable work by working together with the Ministry of Education since 2011 to bring the Bill. Finally, the OUN was established under the Nepal Open University Act 2073, signed by the President of Nepal on July 14, 2016.\n\nAdditional documented information:\n\nThe factual information materials on various efforts made in the development processes before the passing of the legislation for the Open University are listed below:\n\n\"I.

The software is similar to SuperMemo, Anki or Mnemosyne.\n\nThe flashcards are saved as PowerPoint presentation files and may include text, images, sounds and LaTeX equations. The learning states are saved in hidden meta-data files in the same directory as the flashcards files. OpenCards implements learning schemes for short-term and long-term memorization.\n\nOpenCards uses PowerPoint ppt-files as flashcard sets. Thereby, slide-titles are considered as questions and the slide contents as their answers. OpenCards also supports a reversed mode in which slide contents are treated as questions and the slide title as their answers, which allows creating image, formula or sound questions.\n\nBy allowing users to create flashcard files in ppt-format with PowerPoint or LibreOffice, it overcomes the major limitation of other flashcard software, which usually rely on custom formats and flashcard editors. Internally, OpenCards relies on Apache POI to render slides from ppt-files.\n\nOpenCards implements two different learning models. A box-based short-term learning procedure, called last-minute learning, and a more sophisticated long-term memorization model based on the principles of active recall and the forgetting model. The latter is implemented as an improved version of the SuperMemo2 algorithm. The SM2 algorithm had been created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, but still forms the basis of many spaced repetition software applications. OpenCards's implementation of the algorithm has been modified to allow priorities on cards, and to show cards in order of their urgency.\n\nOpenCards started as flashcard learning extension for OpenOffice Impress in spring 2008, from which it inherited the first part of its name. In 2008 it won a Bronze award in the OpenOffice.org Community Innovation Program.\n\nIn 2011, OpenCards was redesigned to work as stand alone software and to support PowerPoint PPT files as the main flashcard set file format.\n\nOpenCards implements no synchronization mechanism, but flashcard sets including their learning states can be synced using services like DropBox. This allows the user to keep their flashcard sets synchronized across multiple computers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35660273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35660273", "title": "Open educational practices", "text": "Open educational practices\n\nOpen educational practices (OEP) is the use of Open educational Resources for teaching and learning in order to innovate the learning process (Ehlers 2010). They are represented in teaching techniques that draw upon open technologies and high-quality open educational resources (OER) in order to facilitate collaborative and flexible learning. They may involve students participating in online, peer production communities within activities intended to support learning or more broadly, any context where access to educational opportunity through freely available online content and services is the norm. Such activities may include (but are not limited to ), the creation, use and repurposing of open educational resources and their adaptation to the contextual setting. OEP can also include the open sharing of teaching practices and aim \"to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on an institutional, professional and individual level\". The OEP community includes policy makers, managers/ administrators of organisations, educational professionals and learners. OEP are also viewed as the next phase in OER development that continues to transform 21st century learning and learners.\n\nA database or repository of open educational resources is not open educational practice (Ehlers 2011). OER have a lifecycle of creation, use, and management. Open educational practices aim to take the focus beyond building further access to OER and consider how in practice, such resources support education and promote quality and innovation in teaching and learning. They focus on reproduction/understanding, connecting information, application, competence and responsibility rather than the availability of good resources.\n\nThere is no canonical definition of open educational practice, however various groups and scholars have given their definition or view. One such scholar is Ehlers (2011) who defines OEP \"as practices which support the (re)use and production of OER through institutional policies, promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect and empower learners as co-producers on their lifelong learning path\". A definition used by others either in its entirety or as basis for further development.\n\nBest practice case studies identify a number of OEP areas.\n\nThese areas surround the following topics, with other studies identifying categories and elements of Open Educational Practices.\n\"topics\"\n\n\"categories\"\n\n\"elements\"\nAdopting OEP can lead to opportunities for collaborative learning through the affordances of Web 2.0 tools. In this context, open also refers to the learning environment where learner's set their own objectives rather than being restricted by those set externally (a closed environment).\n\nOpen educational practices can also provide the experience and tools to help bridge the gap between formal and informal learning, and potentially an open source curriculum or emergent curriculum.\n\nThe trajectory to Open Education Practices lies between the use of open pedagogical models and, resource use and creation.:\n\nThe \"Open Educational Quality (OPAL) Initiative\" define Open Educational Practices (OEP) as \"the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on institutional, professional and individual level\".\n\nFor the mainstreaming of Open Educational Practices OPAL recommends:\n\nThe International Council for Open and Distance Education sees OEP as those practices which support the production, use and reuse of high quality open educational resources and regards that OEP are often achieved through institutional policies, which promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect. Learners are empowered as co-producers on their lifelong learning path. The scope of OEP covers all areas of OER governance: policy makers, managers and administrators of organizations, educational professionals and learners.\n\nOpen e-Learning Content Observatory Services (OLCOS) project is a Transversal Action under the European eLearning Programme.\n\nThe OLCOS Roadmap focuses on Open Educational Practices, providing orientation and recommendations to educational decision makers on how to develop the use of OER. To further benefit from OERs one needs to better understand how their role could promote innovation and change in educational practices.\n\nThe Roadmap states that; delivering OER to the dominant model of teacher-centred knowledge transfer will have little effect in equipping teachers, students and workers with the knowledge and skills required in the knowledge economy and, lifelong learning. Downloading Web-accessible, open teaching materials for classes and, continuing a one-way channel of content provision, will likely mirror the little impact achieved with regard to changing educational practices following the massive investments in the e-learning infrastructure by educational institutions. Open Educational Practices aim to deliver a competency-focused, constructivist paradigm of learning and promote a creative and collaborative engagement with digital content, tools and services to meet knowledge and skills required today.\n\nThe Support Centre for Open Resources in Education (SCORE) at the Open University (UK), was the second major initiative to be funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). (The first being the UKOER programme, jointly run by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Higher Education Academy (HEA)).\n\nDiscussions and actions were moving on from how open educational resources are published to how they are used. Placing OER as an enabler, within a wider set of open educational practices. Over a period of three years, SCORE, initiated a series of activities and events that involved several hundred educational practitioners from the majority of the higher education institutions in England.\n\nThere has been interest in how educational practitioners would accept and embed open resources into their practices (Geser, 2007 in ). Sharing is at the heart of the philosophy OER and probably OEP and thus collective and cooperative activities between people and institutions are likely to be a key factor in the sustainability of such practices. SCORE reports it succeeded in raising the profile of OER and OEP within UK higher education institutions by assisting existing communities of practice and by creating new communities of practice to form a much larger network of practice that will be sustained by its participants.\n\nThere are many challenges to the adoption of open educational practices. Certain aspects like technology have received greater attention than others but all of the factors below inhibit widespread use of open educational practices:\n\nIn order for there to be widespread adoption of OEP, legal and educational policy must change and OEP needs to become sustainable.\n\n In search for the Open Educator: Proposal of a definition and a framework to increase Openness adoption among university educators. \n"}

{"id": "24413702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24413702", "title": "Pedagogical Sketchbook", "text": "Pedagogical Sketchbook\n\nPedagogical Sketchbook is a book by Paul Klee. It is based on his extensive lectures on visual form at Bauhaus Staatliche Art School where he was a teacher in between 1921-1931.\nOriginally handwritten – as a pile of working notes he used in his lectures – it was eventually edited by Walter Gropius, designed by László Moholy-Nagy and published in 1925 as a Bauhaus student manual (Bauhausbucher No.2, as the second in the series of the fourteen Bauhaus books) under the original title: \"Pädagogisches Skizzenbuch\".\nIt was translated into English by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy (in 1953), who also wrote an introduction for it.\n\nAlong with other Bauhaus books such as \"Theory of Color\" (by Johannes Itten) and \"Point and Line to Plane\" (by Wassily Kandinsky), \"Pedagogical Sketchbook\" is a legacy of teaching methods on art theory and practice at Bauhaus Staatliche Art School.\n\nThe book is still in print.\n\nDuring his teaching career at Bauhaus, Klee reflected on his own working methods and techniques.\n“When I came to be teacher”, he wrote, “I had to account explicitly for what I had been used to doing unconsciously.” \nHe left over 3000 handwritten pages developed as a theoretical basis for his lectures, some of which are still unpublished.\nFrom the same period comes another one of his books: \"The thinking Eye\", dealing with the same issues as \"Pedagogical Sketchbook\", but much more extensive in scope. However, this book was published and translated later, after his death (1956; trans. 1961).\n\n\"Pedagogical Sketchbook\" is an intuitive art investigation of dynamic principles in visual arts. Klee takes his students on an ‘adventure in seeing’ guiding them step-by-step through a challenging conceptual framework. Objects are rendered in a complex relation to physical and intellectual space concepts. It is an exercise in modern art thinking.\n\nIn her introduction, Sibyl Moholy-Nagy divides the book into 4 different parts corresponding to the 4 conceptual frameworks. Each framework is illustrated by intricate drawings (mixture of what looks like creative arithmetic or geometry sketches, scribbles and mental notes).\n\nStarting chapter concerns ‘Line and Structure’. A dot goes for a walk… freely and without a goal.\nDot is a “point of progression” and by shifting its position forward becomes a line. Line variations lead to even more complex structures. It can move freely in a calligraphic stroke, or circumscribe, act as a planar definition, as a mathematical structural element (as in Golden Section) or as a path in motion (when it coordinates kinetic movements such as in muscle contraction). Artist's world is dynamic – in the state of becoming – rather than static.\n\nIn ‘Dimension and Balance’, the line is related to psychological and social concepts of space. Klee explains subjectivity of our perception by comparing examples of optical illusion with horizon and perspective. We use them as orientation points within the space. As an illustration, Klee uses a stylized drawing representing a tightrope walker with a bamboo stick as a ‘horizon’ point, keeping his balance. These examples evoke our reality as constructed and arbitrary. “Dimension is in itself nothing but an arbitrary expansion of form into height, width, depth and time”. By challenging conventional perception of his students, Klee shows them a way ‘beyond’ physical realm, into the world of metaphysical and spiritual. It is an invitation to approach art intuitively, since outer perception can be deceptive (socially constructed).\n\nThe third part is about “Gravitational Curve”. A very first drawing of a strong black arrow pointing downwards postulates man as a tragic figure always brought down by a plummet (a black arrow) of a gravitational force. However, Klee also points that water and atmosphere are transitional regions, where spirit gets lighter and breaks free.

During this time, he worked as a caricaturist with the satirical newspapers \"Il Babau\", \"A quel paese\", and \"Il Guerin Meschino\".\n\nIn September 1910, he graduated as an architect and won the Gold Medal of the College of Engineers and Architects of Milan, as its laureate. For the electrical company Conti, he worked on hydroelectric plants, mostly located in Formazza. The most famous are in Verampio (1912–1917), Valdo (1920–1923), Crevoladossola (1923–1924), and Cadarese (1925–1929). For the Azienda Electrica Municipale di Milano, he designed the plant of Grosio (1918–1920).\n\nDuring the First World War, Portaluppi worked for the military in the Veneto and Friuli Regions. He resumed his professional activity after the war, rebuilding la Pinacoteca di Brera, the villa Fossati, and the Casa degli Atellani in Corso Magenta, the home of Ettore Conti. Conti introduced Portaluppi to Milan's high society and started to have the city's most important families as clients such as Borletti, Fossati, Venti and Crespi, Angelo Campiglio, and Mino Brughera. In 1920, Portaluppi designed two projects that are viewed as emblematic of his architecture: the skyscraper S.K.N.E. for the area of Allabanuel, and an utopian city, Hellytown.\n\nOther projects during this period were the Palazzo della Banca Commerciale Italiana (1928–1932), the Planetarium Hoepli (1929–1930), residential buildings for the Buonarroti-Carpaccio-Giotto family (1926–1930), the house Crespi on corso Venezia (1927–1930), and the palazzo Crespi on piazza Crispi (1928–1932). He designed the Italian Pavilion for the Universal Exposition in Barcelona in 1929.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1938, he work on the historic restoration of the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie and he continued that work after the war. Among his most important works are the Palazzo INA, piazza Diaz (1932–1937), the (1932–1935), and the palazzo Ras on via Torino (1935–1938).\n\nFollowing the Second World War, he devoted himself increasingly to teaching and professional organizations. He continued to design and collaborated on later architectural projects with Gio Ponti (1956–1962).\n\nIn July 1913, Portaluppi married Lia Baglia. They had three children: Luisa, Oreste and Tuccio. His son Tuccio died in the Second World War. On 6 July 1967, Piero Portaluppi dies in his house on corso Magenta in Milan.\nIn the 1950s he collaborated with several projects together with Gualtiero Galmanini.\n\nThe Villa Necchi Campiglio was a principal shooting location for Luca Guadagnino's film \"I Am Love\" (2009).\n\n \n\nBelow are some of the main works by the architect Portaluppi, listed in chronological order.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is run by the government-controlled Korean Christian Federation (KCF) and trains pastors and evangelists for it.\n\nFounded in 1901 as the Pyongyang Chosun Jesus Presbyterian Seminary, the seminary has historically been associated with Presbyterianism. It became the center of Korean Christianity of the early 20th century. By 1916 its founder Samuel Austin Moffett was in disagreement over practical matters with another teacher, James Scarth Gale. The row developed into a schism on doctrinal matters and in 1959 the seminary split into the conservative Chongshin University and the liberal Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1938, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, the seminary had been temporarily closed down after students defied orders to bow to Shinto shrines. After the division of Korea, the seminary was relocated to Seoul in South Korea and renamed the Presbyterian Theological Seminary.\n\nThe Pyongyang-based seminary resumed operations in 1972 after having been assumed by the KCF. When its funds ran out in 1995, the Korean Methodist Church (KMC) of South Korea assumed a share of its financial responsibilities.\n\nOriginally called the Pyongyang Chosun Jesus Presbyterian Seminary, it was founded in 1901 by Samuel Austin Moffett, the father of Samuel H. Moffett. Samuel Austin was motivated to found the seminary in Pyongyang because the city had been badly damaged in the First Sino-Japanese War. Initially, the seminary would consist of two years of preparatory courses and the actual seminary lasting three years. In the beginning, Samuel Austin taught his students at home. He was its first president until 1918 and a faculty member until 1935. The Seminary was the center of Korean Christianity of the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1905 the seminary became affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in the United States. The first class graduated in 1907. A building was constructed in 1909 and renewed in 1922. By 1916 Moffett was in disagreement with a teacher at the school, James Scarth Gale. Their differences concerning the quality of teaching, materials, and admission would develop into a schism between conservatives and liberals. Initially, the seminary remained conservative and mission-oriented.\n\nThe seminary was temporarily closed in 1938 following the Japanese occupation of Korea. The Japanese occupiers demanded that students of the seminary would bow to Shinto shrines, something that they could not agree to. Until 1940, the seminary had been the only seminary in Korea maintained by the Presbyterian Church. After the division of Korea, the seminary was relocated to Seoul in South Korea in 1948 and renamed the Presbyterian Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1959 the seminary finally split due to the doctrinal differences into the conservative Chongshin University and the more moderate Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1972, the seminary was reopened and assumed by the government-controlled Protestant body Korean Christian Federation (KCF). The seminary operated under KCF until 1995 when it ran out of funds. In April 1999, the Korean Methodist Church (KMC) of South Korea offered to fund the seminary to secure the continuation of its operation. KMC bid $600,000 to provide funding for three years. It reopened in 2000, and a new building was completed in 2003.\n\nThe Seminary is run by the KCF, which chooses its students and devises its curriculum. KMC, however, is consulted each semester. The seminary is located in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea.\n\nThe seminary trains pastors and evangelists for the KCF. Before 1995, the seminary had produced some 60 graduates.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3924102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3924102", "title": "Recognition of prior learning", "text": "Recognition of prior learning\n\nRecognition of prior learning (RPL), prior learning assessment (PLA), or prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR), describes a process used by regulatory bodies, adult learning centres, career development practitioners, military organizations, human resources professionals, employers, training institutions, colleges and universities around the world to evaluate skills and knowledge acquired outside the classroom for the purpose of recognizing competence against a given set of standards, competencies, or learning outcomes. RPL is practiced in many countries for a variety of purposes, for example an individual's standing in a profession, trades qualifications, academic achievement, recruitment, performance management, career and succession planning.\n\nMethods of assessing prior learning are varied and include: evaluation of prior experience gained through volunteer work, previous paid or unpaid employment, or observation of actual workplace behavior. The essential element of RPL is that it is an assessment of evidence provided by an individual to support their claim for competence against a given set of standards or learning outcomes.\n\nRPL is sometimes confused with Credit Transfer, assessments conducted in order to recognize advanced standing or for assigning academic credit. The essential difference between the two is that RPL considers evidence of competence that may be drawn from any aspect of an applicant's professional or personal life. Credit Transfer and advanced standing deal primarily with an evaluation of academic performance as it relates to a particular field of study and whether or not advanced standing may be granted towards the gaining of additional qualifications. Some academic institutions include Credit Transfer within their overall RPL umbrella, as the process still involves assessment of prior learning, regardless of how achieved.\n\nRPL is known by many names in different countries. It is APL (Accreditation of Prior Learning), CCC (Crediting Current Competence), or APEL (Accrediting Prior Experiential Learning) in the UK, RPL in Australia and New Zealand, and PLAR (Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition) in Canada (although different jurisdictions within Canada use RPL and RCC (Recognition of Current Competence). France has a more sophisticated system in which assessment is known as 'Bilan de competences', 'Bilan des competences approfondi', or 'Validation de Acquis des Experiences (VAE)'. Regardless of the title, all are the same and all are RPL.\n\nRPL has been the mainstay of all assessments conducted under national vocational education and training systems since the late 1980s and continues to evolve as different VET systems evolve. The concept of RPL can be traced back to the earliest guilds when master craftsmen inspected the work of apprentices in order to determine their competence against the high standards demanded of the different professions of the period. This process was continued during the Industrial Revolution when the first formal apprentice programs were established and realistic workplaces created to train young men and women in the skills and knowledge required of their trade. It was first introduced into the UK by Susan Simosko, a consultant with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, who adapted it as the central element of all competency-based assessments.\n\nSimosko was employed by the British government to provide support to the creation of the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQ) systems during the late 1980s and early 1990s. She introduced and managed the Access to Assessment Initiative project which introduced the concept of Accreditation of Prior Learning as an important pathway for employed and unemployed people to gain formal recognition of their skills and knowledge against standards demanded of employers across the United Kingdom.\n\nOther countries adopted the same processes when developing their own competency-based vocational education and training systems, some aligned solely with the need to assess competence in line with the needs of private and public sector organizations, and others as a critical element of the assessment of skills and knowledge in order to grant vocational qualifications. The National Training Board in Australia was one of the first outside of the UK to develop such a system as a framework for the transition towards the implementation of new apprentice programs and workplace training and assessment under the National Training Reform Agenda. RPL was incorporated under the National Framework for the Recognition of Training and has since remained an important element of all competency-based assessments.\n\nRPL is a very simple and straightforward process of assessing someone's skills or knowledge, regardless of where and how these were learned. Unlike other forms of assessment it doesn't judge someone's evidence of competence solely by the credentials or qualifications they have achieved, although this can form part of their claim. Nor does it consider where a person worked, their age, gender or physical attributes.\n\nWhat RPL does is allow people to demonstrate that they are capable of undertaking specific tasks or working in certain industries based on evidence of skills and knowledge gained throughout their life.\n\nRPL is similar to criterion-referenced assessment – assessment of skills and knowledge against certain criteria. However, while such criteria is generally less descriptive than that used in competency standards, it is outcomes-based (i.e., the outcome of somebody doing something, such as the outcome of writing is a letter, or the outcome of making something which results in an end product), not process-based such as learning.\n\nIn teaching or traditional training, the criteria against which formative and summative assessments are conducted is known as teaching or training objectives. (Sometimes these are also referred to as learning objectives but these are really the outcome the learners seeks to achieve, not the teacher or trainer.) They may be written in different ways but in all cases they include the behaviour to be observed, the conditions under which such behaviour is to be performed, and the standards or criteria which the performance must meet. These are the standards to be achieved as a result of the learning or training activity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4840792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4840792", "title": "Rick Snyder", "text": "Rick Snyder\n\nRichard Dale Snyder (born August 19, 1958) is an American politician, business executive, venture capitalist and accountant serving as the 48th Governor of Michigan. He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Snyder served as the chairman of the board of Gateway, Inc., based in Irvine, California. Prior to his election as governor, he co-founded Ardesta, LLC, a venture capital firm and HealthMedia, Inc., a digital health coaching company, both based out of Ann Arbor, Michigan. He gained national attention during the Flint water crisis, in which he was accused of mishandling the situation; however, no legal charges were lodged against him.\n\nSnyder was considered a possible Republican Party candidate for Vice President of the United States in 2012, although ultimately Paul Ryan was selected.\n\nOn February 3, 2014, Snyder announced his candidacy for re-election as Governor of Michigan in 2014. He was elected to a second term in the November 2014 vote, defeating his major challenger, Democrat Mark Schauer. Snyder was term limited and could not seek re-election in 2018. He will be succeeded on New Year's Day of 2019 by Democrat Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nSnyder was born to Dale F. and Helen Louella Snyder in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he was raised. His father owned a small, local window-cleaning company in Battle Creek. He has an elder sister. When he was 16, he took a business class at Kellogg Community College on weekends. By his senior year at Lakeview High School in Calhoun County, Snyder had earned 23 college credits.\n\nSnyder visited the admissions office of the University of Michigan in November 1975 and spoke with the admissions director, who recommended that Snyder attend Michigan and create his own degree. Snyder earned his B.G.S. degree in 1977, an M.B.A. degree in 1979, and a J.D. degree in 1982, all from the University of Michigan. Snyder is also a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).\n\nHe resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan with his wife Sue and their three children and has a vacation home near Gun Lake. The couple were married in 1987 at Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church in Dearborn, Michigan. Snyder has indicated he is a practicing Presbyterian.\nCoopers & Lybrand -\nSnyder was employed with Coopers & Lybrand, from 1982 to 1991, beginning in the tax department of the Detroit office. Snyder was named partner in 1988. The next year, Snyder was named partner-in-charge of the mergers and acquisitions practice in the Chicago office. He served as an adjunct assistant professor of accounting at the University of Michigan from 1982–84.\n\nGateway, Inc. -\nSnyder joined the computer company Gateway (based in Irvine, California) in 1991 as the executive vice president. He served as president and chief operating officer from 1996 to 1997. He remained on the board of directors until 2007. From 2005 to 2007, Snyder served as the chairman of the board. During 2006, Snyder served as interim chief executive officer while a search for a permanent replacement was made. His tenure on the Gateway board ran from 1991 to 2007 until Gateway was sold to Acer Inc. Snyder stated that he did not vote for outsourcing while he was a Gateway board director and he worked to bring jobs to America as the interim CEO of Gateway.\n\nVenture Capital / Investments -\nIn 1997, Snyder returned to Ann Arbor to found Avalon Investments Inc., a venture capital company with a $100 million fund, along with the co-founder of Gateway, Ted Waitt. Snyder was president and chief executive officer of Avalon from 1997 to 2000. He then co-founded Ardesta LLC, an investment firm, in 2000 along with three co-founders, which invested in 20 start-up companies through 2011. He was chairman and chief executive officer of the company.\n\nHealthMedia, Inc. -\nIn 1998, Snyder angel funded and co-founded, with University of Michigan (U-M) School of Public Health professor Victor J. Strecher , HealthMedia Incorporated (HMI), a developer of digital health coaching applications for health promotion, disease prevention, behavioral health, and disease management. The U-M's Office of Technology Transfer played an integral role in helping HMI get started with Vic Strecher as the founding CEO and the U-M's publicly funded Health Media Research Laboratory (founded and directed by Strecher and now called the Center for Health Communications Research ) providing the new company with exclusive research and development findings into health-related computerized tailored messaging and the exclusive licence to sell that content . Despite these university-based start-up and R&D advantages, HMI got off to a poor performance start and in 2001 Snyder replaced the founding CEO (Strecher remained on the HMI board) and personally rescued the company from insolvency with more of his own money. After multiple rounds of more additional financing through venture capital (Arboretum Ventures, Ardesta, Avalon Capital Group, AvTech Ventures, Chrysalis Ventures, Princeton Fund) and yet never achieving profitability, HMI was sold in 2008 for a reported $200 million to Johnson & Johnson. The sale of HMI transferred the ownership of all the personal health information accrued from their millions of users to Johnson & Johnson and played a key role in the negotiated price. At the time of the reported $200 million deal, U-M President Mary Sue Coleman was on Johnson & Johnson's board of directors and the U-M secured millions of dollars with its equity stake in the company. When campaigning for Michigan governor in 2010, Snyder was quoted as saying, \"That company (HMI) is one of the best success stories in the state.\" Following Snyder's election as Michigan governor, Johnson & Johnson then folded HMI into a subsidiary (Wellness & Prevention, Inc. ) and is no longer operating in the state of Michigan.\n\nNon-Profit Service -\nSnyder serves on the boards of the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village (a National Historic Landmark), the Michigan chapter of the Nature Conservancy, and several boards associated with his alma mater the University of Michigan. He was also first chair of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation in 1999 under Republican Governor John Engler and was also the chair of Ann Arbor SPARK.\n\nSnyder competed with Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard, state Senator Tom George, United States Congressman Peter Hoekstra, and Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox as candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Bill Ford Jr., Chairman of the Ford Motor Company, endorsed Snyder for the Republican nomination for governor. He campaigned as \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, [and] pro-family,\" with a focus on the economy. His campaign emphasized his experience in growing business and creating jobs in the private sector, saying that his opponents were mainly career politicians. Snyder favors the standard exceptions on abortion for rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother (he signed legislation banning partial birth abortion in October 2011); he opposes federal funding of abortions; he would not ban embryonic stem cell research; he supports upholding traditional marriage, but would allow civil unions.\n\nIn August 2010, Snyder won the primary to secure the Republican nomination with a plurality of 36% of the vote. In the general election in November, Snyder faced Democratic nominee Virg Bernero, the mayor of Lansing, and three minor party candidates. In October 2010, Snyder's campaign total exceeded $11.6 million, outpacing his opponent. Snyder released his tax returns for 2007 and 2008. Snyder won with 58 percent of the vote.\n\nWith Snyder's election in 2010, Republicans gained a majority in the Michigan House and increased the Republican majority held in the Michigan Senate. Snyder is the first Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to be elected governor of the state and the only CPA serving as a governor in the United States.\n\nIn January 2014, Snyder launched his campaign for a second term as governor. He was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced Democratic former United States Representative Mark Schauer for the general election. Snyder was considered vulnerable in his bid for a second term, as reflected in his low approval ratings, however, Schauer suffered from a lack of name recognition. He garnered approximately 51% of the vote in the November 2014 election, defeating Schauer and earning a second term.\n\nSnyder was inaugurated as governor on January 1, 2011, at the Capitol in Lansing. His first executive order as governor was to divide the Department of Natural Resources and Environment into two distinct departments as they were a few years ago: the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, Snyder announced he was appointing Michigan Supreme Court Justice Maura D. Corrigan to head the Department of Human Services and appointed Michigan Appeals Court Judge Brian K. Zahra to fill the resulting Supreme Court vacancy. Snyder delivered his first State of the State address on January 19, the earliest Michigan State of the State since Governor John Engler's 1996 address on January 17. He endorsed the Detroit River International Crossing for the first time publicly in the address, which was received favorably by Republicans. Snyder appointed Andy Dillon, a pro-life Democrat, and formerly Speaker of the House, to serve as state treasurer in his administration.\n\nSnyder presented his first budget to the legislature on February 17, 2011, calling it a plan for \"Michigan's reinvention,\" and saying it would end Michigan's deficits. He described the budget as containing \"shared sacrifice\" but added that his budget plan would create jobs and spur economic growth. The $46 billion budget reduced $1.8 billion in spending, raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions on pensions, while at the same time abolished the state's complex business tax, replacing it with a significantly reduced flat tax on the profits of C corporations. This shift in tax burden led State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer to criticize the budget, saying that it did not involve \"shared sacrifice,\" but instead was balanced \"on the backs of our kids, working families, and our seniors\" and \"picks out who he's willing to leave behind.\" Snyder supported the government backed rescue of the American auto industry. This reflected the view of a 56% of Americans in 2012 who supported the 2009 auto bailout according to a Pew Research Center poll (63% support in Michigan).\n\nOn March 16, 2011, Snyder signed a controversial bill into law that gave increased powers to emergency managers of local municipalities to resolve financial matters. The bill was repealed by voter initiative in November 2012. However, weeks later in December 2012 Snyder signed a revised version of the bill back into law.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Snyder signed into law The Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act, which prevents the same-sex domestic partners of public employees at both the state and local level from receiving health benefits. In January 2012, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Snyder and the state of Michigan in federal court on behalf of five Michigan same-sex couples, each with one spouse working for local public schools or municipalities in Michigan. The suit alleges that the law violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. On June 28, 2013, a federal judge struck down the law.\n\nIn April 2012, Snyder made a surprise trip to Afghanistan to thank and pledge support for United States troops. He traveled to Kuwait and then to Germany where he visited injured United States soldiers at the United States Military hospital. He has also engaged in trade missions to Europe, Asia, and around the world in order to improve international business relations as well as research and development opportunities associated with Michigan universities. Snyder has focused efforts to attract companies such as Chrysler.\n\nFollowing approval from the legislature, Snyder signed the fiscal year 2012 budget in June, the earliest it has been completed in three decades. In May 2012, Snyder joined a bipartisan effort urging the U.S. Congress to pass a measure to affirm that States can collect sales taxes on online purchases.\n\nAs governor, Snyder abolished the state's complex business tax in favor of a flat tax, and signed a bill which raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions for pensions. For years Snyder had said anti-union legislation was not on his agenda, when on the morning of December 6, 2012, during a lame duck session of the Republican-controlled Michigan legislature, Snyder called a joint press conference with the legislative leadership to announce fast-track right-to-work legislation. The legislation passed both houses of the Michigan legislature that day, without committee votes or public hearings. A $1 million appropriation added to the legislation made it ineligible for repeal via referendum. On December 10, President Barack Obama visited Daimler AG's Detroit Diesel factory in Redford, Michigan, and told employees the legislation was about the \"right to work for less money.\" The law effectively provides that payment of union dues cannot be required as a condition of employment. After a required four-day wait between the houses of the legislature passing each other's bills, Snyder signed the legislation into law on December 11, 2012, making Michigan the 24th right-to-work state in the United States as part of a plan to attract business and jobs to the state. The Employee Free Choice Act, as it was named, has received mixed results in polls.\n\nA Market Research Group poll conducted in March 2012 showed Snyder's approval rating rising to 50% among likely voters, which matched that of President Barack Obama, placing Snyder among the most popular Republican governors in a state carried by Obama in the 2008 election cycle. Snyder was briefly mentioned as a possible pick to be the Republican Party candidate for Vice President of the United States in 2012. His business executive background and 'positive' style have been cited as political assets, with his deeds seen as strengthening the case for electing a business executive candidate as President of the United States. He was also mentioned as a potential Republican Party candidate for President of the United States in 2016.\n\nIn December 2012, Snyder signed legislation requiring facilities where at least 120 abortions are performed annually to obtain a state license as freestanding surgical facilities. Planned Parenthood had urged Snyder to veto the bill claiming it unnecessarily increases costs.\n\nIn January 2013, Snyder traveled to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was last in Israel in 1999 as a venture capitalist. \"I had a chance to see the start of high-tech boom in Israel and that's great to see. This is really a startup nation. They've done a great job of being entrepreneurial, innovative, and that's a major part of their economy now and the good part is we can learn from that.\"\n\nIn March 2013, Snyder announced a financial emergency for the city of Detroit and appointed an emergency manager, Kevyn Orr. As a result of emergency manager appointments under Snyder's watch, over half of the state's black population lives in cities where the local government was appointed rather than elected by the voters.\n\nOn December 27, 2013, Snyder signed a bill into law which nullifies Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which contains a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.\n\nOn January 23, 2014, Snyder announced plans to offer visas to 50,000 immigrant workers with advanced degrees to help jumpstart the Detroit economy. The program's advocates claim the program is expected to bring an influx of new jobs and a more stable tax base.\n\nOn September 10, Detroit reached a deal with three Michigan counties over regional water and sewer services that could eliminate one roadblock to federal court approval of the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit bankruptcy. The deal with Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties creates a regional water and sewer authority, but allows Detroit to maintain control of its local system. The deal was crucial to adjusting the city's $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy.\n\nOn December 18, the Governor issued an executive order to establish the Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development to house a new state agency, Talent Investment Agency, created from the merger of Michigan State Housing and Development Authority, the Workforce Development Agency, the Governor's Talent Investment Board and the Unemployment Insurance Agency. Over objections from the state legislature, the Department would come into effect 60 days after the start of the next legislative session.\n\nIn November 2015, Governor Rick Snyder declared his opposition to permitting Syrian refugee relocation to the state of Michigan.\n\nAs of April 2018, Snyder's approval rating is below 40 percent.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015, Snyder appointed several individuals as Emergency Managers for Flint, Michigan. In 2014, emergency manager Darnell Earley was responsible for changing the source of drinking water for the city to the Flint River, which has trihalomethanes (TTHM) in it. It was later discovered that the water was too corrosive, and leached lead out of the service lines that was then ingested by the people of the city. In September 2015, a study by the Hurley Medical Center found that the community's children were being poisoned by the lead. While Flint transitioned back to its prior source of water in October 2015, lead levels in the city's water remain above the federal action level.\n\nAmid allegations that the Michigan Health Department was stalling water treatment expert Marc Edwards' effort to obtain public records, journalists have asked when the State of Michigan knew about the lead poisoning. Details were released by the \"Detroit Free Press\" and \"The Detroit News\" on 26 February 2016 that Valerie Brader, Snyder's senior policy adviser and deputy legal counsel, and his chief legal counsel Mike Gadola had expressed concerns to him about Flint's water in October 2014, nearly six months after Flint had begun using the river water to save money, despite Governor Snyder claiming he was unaware of the issue until very recently.\n\nA petition from Angelo Scott Brown, a Flint pastor and former Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate, to recall Snyder was denied by the Board of State Canvassers. Filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore has called for Snyder's arrest on charges of corruption and assault, and has started a petition on his website.\n\nOn November 13, 2015, four families filed a federal class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit against Snyder and thirteen other city and state officials, including former Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and ex-emergency financial manager Darnell Earley. The complaint alleges that the officials acted recklessly and negligently, leading to serious injuries from lead poisoning, including autoimmune disorders, skin lesions, and \"brain fog.\"\n\nOn December 15, 2015, Mayor Weaver declared the water issue as a citywide public health state of emergency to prompt help from state and federal officials. Snyder apologized for the incident. Snyder declared a State of Emergency on January 5, 2016 for Genesee County, Michigan.\n\nOn January 16, 2016, Snyder requested that the federal government declare a state of emergency in Flint.\n\nIn mid-April 2016, Snyder initiated his own 30-Day Flint Challenge. \"The plan was to drink solely Flint tap water for an entire month to show residents that the water was safe and that he cared about the people.\" However, the Detroit Metro Times reported that the governor left town on April 23 to spend the week touring Europe for trade discussions, breaking his promise.\n\n"}

In particular, she established support for European refugees.\n\nBorn on 3 April 1884 in Brooklyn, Rose Brenner, the eldest of six siblings, was the daughter of Judge Jacob Brenner and his wife Louise née Blumeneau. Her father played a leading role in local religious activities and politics. Brenner graduated in 1908 with a BA from Adelphi College.\n\nShe became active in the Brooklyn Section of the National Council of Jewish Women, serving as president from 1912 to 1918. She went on to become vice-president of the national council in 1915, later becoming national president in 1920. Under her leadership, the organization not only almost doubled membership but established a National Speakers Bureau and expanded its services for immigrant assistance. It also published Jewish prayer courses, including a prayer book in Braille. One of her main concerns was to provide support for Jewish immigrants in rural communities in the United States. As a result, in 1920 a Department of Farm and Rural Work was established.\n\nIn 1921, she also strengthened the organization by publishing \"The Jewish Woman\", a quarterly, and the monthly \"The Immigrant\". She set up services in support of refugees and created NCJW affiliates in Europe, caring for emigrants intending to go to America. Although she was unable to attend the First World Congress of Jewish Women in 1923 in Vienna, she sent a strong message of support through her representative Estelle Sternberger.\n\nBrenner was also an active supporter of the Beth Elohim Temple where she taught for 20 years and chaired its sisterhood. She served as director of the Women's Foundation for Health under the Brooklyn Board of Education.\n\nRose Brenner died in Brooklyn of a stroke on 5 April 1926, aged only 42.\n"}

The eight affiliates rotate hosting the annual Australian National Schools Debating Championships (NSDC), which is contested by eight teams selected, trained and managed by each of eight state and territory affiliate associations.\n\nOver 28,000 students across Australia take part in debating events organised by the ADF and its affiliates each year.\n\nThe ADF has an Executive Committee which is responsible for the Federation's administration and the development of debating on a national level. The Executive is elected at an AGM comprising representatives from each affiliate organisation, held annually during the NSDC.\n\nThe Australian Debating Federation holds an annual Australian National Schools Debating Championships. The championships, which are contested by eight teams of high school students from each of Australia's eight states and territories, date back to 1971. The tournament uses the World Schools Debating style, and each debate is adjudicated by three nationally accredited adjudicators (with five for the preliminary final, and seven for the Grand Final).\n\nWhile team selection methods vary from state to state, debaters are generally chosen through trials and workshops held by their state's affiliate to the Australian Debating Federation. Each team consists of four members and (generally) two reserves who may or may not elect to accompany the team to the NSDC tournament. Teams typically train intensively for 3–5 months prior to the tournament.\n\nThe tournament is held annually over 8–10 days, roughly rotating around the state and territory capitals. Teams compete in a seven-round competition, with each team debating each other once. At the end of these rounds, the four top-performing teams progress to the final rounds, where they compete in semi-finals, a preliminary final, and a Grand Final.\n\nDuring the NSDC, five outstanding individual debaters are selected by the official adjudicators to form the National Schools Team which represents Australia at the World Schools Debating Championships.

Of the five colleges, the largest is The mighty Polytechnic in Blantyre. It is part of the Malawian government educational system. The present Vice Chancellor is Ucizi Mughogho. UNIMA celebrated its golden jubilee from the 24 to the 26 September 2015.\n\nThe vision of the University of Malawi is to provide \"relevant, world-class education, research and services for the sustainable development of Malawi and the world.\"\n\nThe university is the center of knowledge, development of skills values, ideas and attitudes for engaging developmental challenges in the country.\n\nThe University of Malawi was founded a few months after Malawi Independence. The first enrollment consisted of 90 students in Blantyre. Teaching began in 1965 in Blantyre, and within two years the Institute of Public Administration at Mpemba, the Soche Hill College of Education and the Polytechnic in Blantyre, and Bunda College in Lilongwe became colleges of the university. In 1973, all the constituents of the university apart from the polytechnic and Bunda College moved to Zomba and were merged into Chancellor College. In 1979, Kamuzu College of Nursing became a college of the university, and in 1991 the College of Medicine in Blantyre was formed as a further constituent college.\n\nDuring the movement towards multiparty rule, UNIMA students participated in a protest that was organized by themselves as a part of fighting for their educational freedom. In March 1992, when Catholic Bishops in Malawi issued a Lenten Pastoral Letter that criticized Banda and his government, students of the University of Malawi at Chancellor College and the Polytechnic joined in through protests and demonstrations in support of the letter. This forced the authorities to close the campuses.\n\nYouth for Freedom and Democracy (YFD) is a student political pressure group on campus. They publish the \"Weekly Political Update\" that is circulated to students on campus. They have been critical of Malawi's governance, and of the Paladin Energy mining company. In mid September, Malawian police arrested several members of the group. They also arrested 21-year-old Black Moses, president of the YFD and interrogated him. A week later, 25-year-old Robert Chasowa, a fourth-year engineering student at the Malawi Polytechnic was found dead. Police ruled this a suicide but critics believe that he was murdered.\n\nBunda College of Agriculture offers BSc's, MSc's and PhD degrees in Agriculture, Environmental Sciences and Development Studies. Its mission is to advance and promote knowledge,skills,self-reliance and sound character for \"sustainable food production and utilization; Improving income, food security and nutrition; and Conservation and management of biodiversity, the environment and natural resources.\nIt is situated in Lilongwe 35.2 km from the capital city center.

Out of about 250 doctors that had graduated from the University of Malawi-College of Medicine between 1992 and 2005, 25 (10%) were reported to be registered with the UK General Medical Council which has contributed to a healthcare worker brain drain in Malawi.\n\nThe College of Medicine has seen tremendous advancement in its board of administrators and infrastructure ever since its introduction in 1992. The college now has Four undergraduate courses which include the five-year-long Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS), and the four-year-long programs of Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences (BMLS), Bachelor of Physiotherapy (Hon) and Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hon).

In addition, the college has a long stating relationship with the University of St Andrews School of Medicine in Scotland. In 2011, 10 students from the University of St Andrews School of Medicine visited the college on exchange. Both schools run the Global Health Education Workshops/Module (GHEP) which seeks to provide a forum for discussion of pressing global health issues like climate change, overpopulation, epidemics and the concept of good aid.\n\nEntry requirements for nursing and paramedical training institutions is the\nMalawi School Certificate of Education (Ordinary Level).

The scheme was first outlined in the 1980 white paper \"A New Training Initiative: A Programme for Action\", and it was brought into operation in 1983 to replace the Youth Opportunities Programme by the government of Margaret Thatcher. Initially lasting one year or 6 months, the scheme was amended in 1986 to be so that it could be extended to two years.\n\nThe 1981 England riots encouraged that, by bringing into sharp focus the results of large numbers of unskilled unemployed finding their own solutions.\nThe scheme promised training to its applicants and made use of a variety of different training locales such as businesses, colleges of further education or training workshops run by voluntary organisations. Since the training place was guaranteed by the government and trainees were to be paid if they were on the course, eligibility for social security unemployment benefit was withdrawn.\n\nAccredited organisations were required to provide at least 13 weeks per year of training away from the job and include life skills and social skills. A standardised form of certification was issued at the end of the training period.\n\nIn 1989, it was renamed Youth Training and was placed under the management of local Training and Enterprise Councils. The trainees on the schemes could be classified as either trainee status or employed status.\n\nThe difference was distinguished by whether the trainee was recruited by an employer and provided with training for the company needs or if the trainee was being trained by a training organisation using employers as training placements. Often, employed status trainees would have their training allowance improved by the employer.\n\nThe YTS attracted political and social criticism from an early point. Critics claimed that the scheme enabled employers to exploit school leavers for cheap labour, and it provided little substance in the way of genuine education. The broad left alliance of musicians, artists, comedians and writers, \nRed Wedge, criticised YTS for its discriminatory nature toward black people and women. The government's line was that the scheme was an effective counter to the drop in apprenticeships and marked rise in youth unemployment that was seen in the early 1980s.\n\n"}
