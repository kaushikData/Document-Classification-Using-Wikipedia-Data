Together with \"Suske en Wiske\" and \"De Rode Ridder\" it was once one of his most popular and best-selling series, with successful translations in Dutch, French, German and Swedish. It was terminated in 1997.\n\nInspired by the success of \"Lassie\", Willy Vandersteen and Karel Verschuere decided to make a comic strip series about a female collie. Contrary to the original \"Lassie\" series, though, it didn't feature any child characters and was set in the Wild West rather than the present time. Bessy was given an owner, Andy Cayoon, with whom she had many adventures involving cowboys and Native Americans.\n\n\"Bessy\" was first published in the French-language Belgian newspaper \"La Libre Belgique\" on December 24, 1952 and translated into Dutch a year later, when the comics were published in \"De Standaard\" and \"De Katholieke Illustratie\". The series were also a tremendous success in Germany, where they were published in the youth magazines \"Pony\" and \"Felix\". So much in fact, that Vandersteen's studio had a separate team drawing new titles, many of which were never translated in Dutch. With 992 different titles, reissues included, \"Bessy\" has the most album titles of all of Vandersteen's series. 164 albums of these were Dutch, 151 were French. The series was also published in Sweden under the name \"Bessie\", which spawned 92 albums.\n\nThe high production unfortunately also had an effect on the quality of the stories and drawings. As a result, the German editions were discontinued by 1985. One of Vandersteen's assistants, Jeff Broeckx, then created a reboot \"Bessy Natuurkommando\" (\"Bessy Nature Commando\") (1984-1992), where Andy and Bessy were reimagined as present-day conservators of animals and nature. Andy received a love interest, Aneka, and a little street boy named Kid, who travelled along with them on their missions. The scripts were written by Marck Meul. Twenty-three albums were drawn before the series was terminated in 1992. Broeckx tried a new reboot and redrew the first seven stories of the original series, as well as the twelfth story from the first series. By 1997 the series came to a definite halt.\n"}

{"id": "22742864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22742864", "title": "Deltopia", "text": "Deltopia\n\nDeltopia, originally known as Floatopia, is a social event that has taken place in Santa Barbara, California since 2004. Floatopia was originated in 2003 by University of California, Santa Barbara students. In early years attendance usually maxed out with 500–1,000 participants.\n\nParticipants consist primarily of college students. The title \"Floatopia\" describes the main activity the event is known for—floating on rafts and other home-made or store bought floating devices along the coast and partying on the beach. Floatopia has drawn college and highschool students from all over California, although it is patronized largely by students from the Santa Barbara City College and the University of California, Santa Barbara. The title also references the word utopia, the state of ideal perfection. Original Floatopia activities included sand-built beer pong tables and a number of loosely organized 'floating parties,' in which beer kegs were used as central flotation devices for 'flotillas' of underage students who had originally taken to the water in order to avoid being ticketed by (terrestrial) IVFP officers. \n\nFloatopia occurs at the start of spring quarter \"along the beach and in the water in the 6500 and 6600 blocks of Del Playa Drive.\" In 2007, Floatopia attracted just over 300 students, in 2008 it grew to almost 1,000 people, and in 2009 it continued to grow to approximately 12,000. Floatopia 2009 was so popular amongst attendees that plans were made for a Floatopia 2 to occur in May. Furthermore, various college campuses made plans to imitate the event, such as Slotopia, which was planned at California Polytechnic State University. Floatopia also popped up as a major event in San Diego after alcohol was banned on the beaches in 2008. San Diego Floatopia, taking place in Mission Bay, had grown to attract over 10,000 in 2009. Although Floatopia attracts many party goers who enjoy the event, others point out the adverse environmental effects and legal consequences related to minors and alcohol consumption.\n\nThe unprecedented attendance at Floatopia, approximately 12,000 people, is likely attributable to Facebook. Facebook includes an application that allows users to create \"events\" and send out \"event invitations\" to any number of \"friends.\" Using this feature, the UCSB Excursion Club created an event invitation entitled \"Floatopia.\" This invitation was \"open,\" allowing any other user on Facebook to view the event's details and RSVP. The event ultimately listed 9,675 confirmed guests. As many as 67 results appear when searching for \"Floatopia\" on Facebook; although many of the groups promote the event, a number of the groups are dedicated to either preventing a sequel or organizing clean-up crews.\n\nThroughout Floatopia a number of accident reports and citations were issued. At the event 78 alcohol citations were issued and 13 arrests were made under the charges of drunk in public or disorderly conduct (throwing bottles from the bluffs towards the crowd below). Because of the large number of people concentrated in one area, most of whom were under the influence of alcohol, many injuries occurred. Two party goers were taken to the Cottage Hospital trauma center after falling from the cliffs and 33 people received treatment for head injuries, alcohol poisoning, and lacerations. The police also received a 9-1-1 call reporting a drowning person, but after they dispatched two engines and a truck to Del Playa and interviewed surrounding witnesses, no injury was actually apparent. The police stated a prevalent problem they encountered was attempting to determine which reports they received were valid.\n\nDuring its peak hours, Floatopia was patrolled by a dozen Foot Patrol officers, Goleta deputies, and officers from the UCSB police department, 4 county fire engines, 2 ambulances, a search and rescue crew, and a helicopter. Lt. Brian Olmstead of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol stated that about 20 county firefighters were assigned to the event. The main problem was that Floatopia required so many officials to be present that it caused a redistribution of safety personnel. Olmstead stated,\"this event had an impact on the county as a whole.\" The increased size of Floatopia caught emergency officials off guard and cost an estimated $20,000 in taxpayer money to patrol.\n\nAs attendees dispersed and debris remained, many people began to focus their attention on the aftermath of Floatopia. UCSB's Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Michael D. Young, sent out an email to UCSB students the first Wednesday following Floatopia regarding the event. Young expressed his concerns regarding the number of party goers who likely \"urinate[d] in our ocean, destroy[ed] vegetation on the cliffs, drop[ped] broken glass and plastics of all shapes, sizes and varieties onto the sand and into the water, allow[ed] garbage to be strewn along the shoreline down to Santa Barbara and beyond, destroy[ed] habitat for any number of species, and kill[ed] untold numbers of fish and birds.\" Young concluded the letter asking students to \"organize against the event\" by discouraging potential participants and encouraging awareness.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the environmental impact of Floatopia, the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, Surfrider Foundation Isla Vista, and Coastal Fund organized beach cleanups. This is thought to have been relatively unsuccessful considering much of the debris was carried out to sea as a result of the high tide. After seeing the aftermath of Floatopia, Bradley Cardinale, a professor of ecology, revealed that even though he has \"traveled all over the world for [his] research…, [he has] only seen dumping like this in third world countries.\" Cardinale urged students to consider \"how much urine went into our coastal zone… You just don't clean that up. Sure we can pick up the beer cans, but the other stuff is out there permanently\".\n\nFollowing Floatopia, a number of college students in the central coast hoped to continue the party 100 miles north, in San Luis Obispo. The event was dubbed \"Slotopia.\" Ryan Magill, a senior at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, created the \"Slotopia\" event on Facebook. The event was to take place at Shell Beach, an unincorporated community in Pismo Beach, on May 2, 2009. Initially, the event was sponsored by Obsession Entertainment. Obsession Entertainment agreed to shuttle students from Cal Poly to Shell Beach throughout the day, as a measure to prevent drinking and driving.\n\nAfter the large number of injuries and citations and the excessive environmental pollution of Floatopia, the Pismo beach police, university officials, and a campaign led by a Cal Poly student named Ryan Featherson, all combined to stop the event. T Ryan Featherson created his own event on Facebook entitled \"Stop Slotopia.\" Once the event drew the negative attention of the media, Slotopia's sponsor, Obsession Entertainment, pulled out, along with the many deejays that were scheduled to play music that day. Unlike Floatopia, which took place on the beaches of Isla Vista, Slotopia was scheduled to occur at Shell Beach, which is not as heavily populated by college students. Shell Beach is a relatively small location in comparison to the beaches in Isla Vista, which could have potentially magnified the environmental impact and further upset the community of Shell Beach. The efforts to stop Slotopia were ultimately successful and Slotopia was cancelled. On May 2, 2009, Shell Beach had an unusually low number of college attendees for a weekend day. The low attendance is largely attributable to the poor weather.\n\nDespite the controversy over Floatopia, students from UCSB chose to plan a sequel, Floatopia 2. This event was planned to take place May 9, 2009. The event originated on Facebook once again, urging for a bigger and better beach party than the last, quickly drawing approximately 12,000 confirmed guests. The creators of the event sent out 25,000 invitations to Facebook users. In response to the initial Floatopia, authorities took serious steps in order to prevent a sequel. These efforts mainly consisted of a potential emergency ordinance that would ban alcohol on beaches surrounding the seaside enclave. The ordinance would have been effective from the beach stretching to the west from 6885 Del Playa Dr., to the 6500 block of that same street, on the coastal bluffs to the north, and the properties fronting Del Playa Drive in the 6500 to 6800 blocks. The fines for violating this potential ordinance would have been $100 for the first citation, $200 for the second if it occurred within one year of the first, and up to $500 for each additional violation within one year. Floatopia 2 had an estimated cost of $50,000 to fully staff emergency personnel.\n\nFloatopia 2 never occurred, because of the publicized controversial issues, but some UCSB students believe other factors also contributed to its cancellation. Tommy Curran of the Daily Nexus claimed that Mother's Day, bad weather, and the Jesusita Fire were the real reasons Floatopia 2 did not occur.\n\nOn Tuesday April 6, 2010, Santa Barbara officials told county supervisors that they planned to barricade beach access points around UC Santa Barbara in an effort to stop Floatopia 2010 scheduled for Saturday April 10. In response, local Isla Vista residents staged \"Deltopia\" demonstrations to take place on Del Playa street to protest the decision to close public beach access. Furthermore, several block parties (dubbed as \"ragers\") took place on April 10 along Del Playa.\n\nFloatopia 2011, scheduled for April 9, 2011, had over 14,248 confirmed guests on the official Facebook fanpage as of March 30, 2011, suggesting that attendance would set a new record. Also on March 30, 2011, Dustin Olson, UC Santa Barbara Chief of Police issued a campus-wide email alert stating that \"campus beaches will be closed Saturday, April 2 and Sunday, April 3, 2011 and not accessible to the public or campus community. This beach closure is in response to unsafe and unsanitary conditions that have been associated with this unplanned event in the past.\"\n\nThe Facebook page for the event stressed that participants would be required to enter the beaches empty-handed with the exception of a towel and a float, and leave with the items (towel and float) that they brought in. Participants were also given strict warnings on conduct and the prohibition on alcohol at the event. However, the page also advertised that \"ragers\" (house parties) would be thrown all day until midnight.\n\nAuthorities arrested about 100 attendees of Deltopia 2014. According to police, the party turned violent after some of the approximately 15,000 attendees objected to the arrest of a partygoer by the University of California Santa Barbara Police.\n\n\n"}

In the late phase of World War II his mother send him with help of the Red Cross to Switzerland to escape the bombing raids in war torn Germany. In Switzerland Schwanitz stayed for six years with Mennonite mountain farmers rather isolated from society and without attending a school. He returned to his parents in 1950 and school director who took a liking in him (seeing him as a modern \"Kaspar Hauser\") got him accepted directly into a gymnasium (highschool) and helped him to catch up with the curriculum. Schwanitz graduated ultimately as best of his class and went on to pursue English studies, history and philosophy at universities in Münster, London, Philadelphia and Freiburg. In 1971 he received his PhD from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg for thesis on George Bernard Shaw. In 1978 he became a tenured professor for English studies at the University of Hamburg where he stayed until his early retirement in 1997 due to health issues.\n\nAfter his retirement Schwanitz moved to Southern Germany. He continued to write and in 2001 he purchased the \"Salmen\" in Hartheim am Rhein, a restaurant with a theater stage.

{"id": "31612781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31612781", "title": "Education Reform in Kentucky", "text": "Education Reform in Kentucky\n\nEducation reform has been a topic for Kentucky government officials and citizens for over 20 years. The most significant piece of reform legislation was passed in 1990, and was known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA). This act instituted six basic initiatives, some of the most important being a focus on core subjects, community service, and self-sufficiency. Kentucky education has seen improvements in terms of equalizing funding among various schools, but still has a long way to go in becoming nationally competitive in its educational outcomes and standardized test scores.\n\n One viable reform option that has gotten little attention is the possibility of voluntary charter schools, especially in areas of poor public school opportunities. The U.S. Department of Education defines charter schools as “tuition-free public schools freed from regulation in exchange for greater accountability.” In the charter school system, individual schools and administrations have more control over the structure of various curricula and school programs which provides for a more tailored emphasis for each student. And, by and large, students and parents felt that the students “{received} more individualized attention at the charter school than they did at their previous school.” These same parents said that they felt their students were able to learn more efficiently because teachers were more able to adapt their methods to fit the child’s individual learning style.\n\nAnother benefit of charter schools is their effect on the competitiveness of the education market. Recent research conducted by the U.S. Department of Education proves that voluntary charter schools will provide greater educational choices and help to create a more competitive educational market that encourages all schools to improve. The Department of Education’s research shows that the creation and inclusion of charter schools in school systems led to visible improvements in the test scores and student behaviors of almost every school in that school system, whether they were public, private, charter, or anything else.\n\n Voluntary charter schools certainly provide one aspect to bettering the educational system in Kentucky. But while charter schools benefit students by creating a more competitive educational marketplace, one still needs to consider how to institute reform that better prepares Kentucky students for post-secondary education, should they choose to pursue it. One of the ways that absolutely every school in Kentucky can improve its educational standards is with the greater inclusion of advanced placement (or AP) classes. Advanced placement classes are those with a higher degree of difficulty that seek to prepare high school students for post-secondary education. One college admissions website says that some of the reasons AP classes are important are because they impress college admissions offices, help better prepare students for college-level curriculum, and help students to make better decisions after high school.\nWith a proven record of helping to better prepare students for post-secondary education, AP classes are being discussed more and more by Kentucky high school teachers and administrators. This open dialogue about AP classes is extremely important as current data from Western Kentucky University’s Center of Gifted Studies reveal that “college students who have not taken an AP course have only a 33 percent chance of completing a bachelor’s degree.” But, that success rate increases exponentially with the inclusion of AP courses in Kentucky students’ high school educations. The Center of Gifted Studies reports that “College students who have completed one AP course have a 59 percent chance of completing a four-year degree, while students with two or more AP courses under their belt have a 76 percent chance of completing a bachelor’s degree” (Switzer).\n\nResearch institutes aren’t the only entities supporting the greater inclusion of AP courses in high school curricula though; in fact, some of the biggest advocates for an increased number of AP courses are the teachers who would be charged with leading said classes. Vicki Schmitt, an AP English and literature teacher at Greenwood High School in Bowling Green, Kentucky, believes that AP courses are the very best way to prepare students for a college education (Switzer). On the benefits of AP classes for both the students and teachers, Schmitt said, “AP helps teachers teach kids how to think. Students tell me there was not a class in high school that prepared them for college except for their AP classes” (Switzer). At Greenwood High School, where Schmitt has taught for the past 12 years, there are currently 14 AP classes offered for students. However, that number is much higher than the vast majority of Kentucky schools, and there is much more work to be done to make Kentucky public schools look more like Greenwood High School. Based on the research provided and the opinions of many teachers like Schmitt, it seems that if more schools were to include AP options in their programs, Kentucky students would be more ready for post-secondary education, and become more successful members of society.\n\n Another form of education reform that may require legislative action is the granting of greater authority to superintendents. One of the effects of the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 was the creation of “site-based councils at each school . . . {which} generally consists of the principal, three teachers and two parents.” These site-based councils would be charged with the hiring of all new principals for whatever school it represented. But Wilson Sears, executive director of the Kentucky Association of School Superintendents, believes that KERA’s reliance on these site-based councils to hire principals is misplaced. Instead, Sears believes that superintendents should have the responsibility of hiring principals, and he has lobbied tirelessly for the recently passed Kentucky Senate Bill 12 which says that superintendents will temporarily replace fired principals and will also have a vote in choosing who the subsequent principal will be (Croyle). Like Sears, Campbell County Schools Superintendent Anthony Strong also thinks superintendents should have greater authority in personnel hiring. Strong says that the “superintendent of a school district {is} similar to the CEO of a company, and . . . it would be unheard of for a CEO not to have input into who runs his or her company’s different divisions” (Croyle).\n\nGranting superintendents greater authority in choosing school principals is only one of the ways to increase autonomy at the local school board level. Another means of increasing local autonomy is to give principals and school administrators greater authority over the spending of instructional funds and resources. One 2011 Kentucky Gubernatorial candidate, David L. Williams, believes that local administrators should have greater “input on how to use the funds they are provided to ensure children are getting the best possible education.” Williams’ assertion that principals and local school administrators should have greater power in deciding how funds are spent is supported by research by the National Governors Association’s Center for Best Practices. NGA research proves that “Principals need discretion to direct resources in ways that match curriculum, instruction, and support services with students’ identified needs.” This research also suggests that “decentralized budget authority is a contributing factor to school effectiveness,” primarily in high-performing, high-poverty schools (Conklin and Smith, 1). Bearing this research in mind, it seems as if granting greater authority to local school administrators in terms of personnel hiring and budget distribution may lead to a more successful Kentucky educational system for all.\n"}

These are elements of an effective education sector response which include\n\nSubstance use is one of several important social and health issues that society calls on the education sector to address through the curriculum, along with other behavioural prevention areas, for example, mental health, sexual health, nutrition and bullying. In a curriculum, substance use prevention education is usually and most appropriately accommodated in a health-related subject area (variously termed healthy active living, health and family living, health and physical education, personal and social skills education, health and career education, life-skills education, etc.).\n\nMany schools choose also to supplement or replace the standard life-skills or other health-related curriculum with a manualized programme, i.e., a programme standardized through the creation of manuals and protocols for those who implement it. This has been shown by research to be effective in preventing substance use later in life and/ or supporting resilient mental health or acquiring life or academic skills.\n\nCurriculum aiming to prevent substance use before the typical age of first use within the school system is directed at children who are around 6–12 years old. The typical age of first use of any substance will vary according to the national or local situation. Prevention education curriculum during this period is centred on what is referred to as ‘skills-based health education’. It aims to develop key personal and social skills such as those that support healthy emotional and social development during this period, and protect against later substance use.\n\nIn addition to protecting against later substance use, skills-based education has also been shown to have a positive effect on general problem behaviours, commitment to school, academic performance, self-esteem, mental well- being, self-management and other social skills (besides Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States, the evidence also originates from Africa, Latin America and India).\n\nResearch has found that training increases the likelihood that a teacher will actually deliver skills-based prevention content, and do it in the way it was intended. Training can help teachers adapt programme methods to their own teaching styles and aptitudes, while retaining the core components of the programme.\n\nAt the school level, approaches to responding to substance use can be broken down into two categories: Universal prevention and selective and indicated prevention.\n\nUniversal prevention aims to prevent substance use in the school population at large. This approach aims to reduce risks across the school or target age/ year group by providing knowledge and skills that are protective towards substance use, or by changing school policies and environment in ways that prevent and reduce substance use among all students.\n\nSelective and indicated prevention targets individuals or groups deemed at particular risk of initiating substance use or who are already involved in substance use behaviours. These approaches involve identifying at-risk individuals or groups and targeting prevention efforts towards them, or identifying those who are showing early signs of substance use and then intervening.\n\nSchool health services are most commonly led by nurses, but doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, dentists, social workers and counsellors may also be involved. By virtue of their professional training, nurses are very well positioned to provide a central role with school-based health services and with substance use prevention. Their professional role permits them to:\n\nAt the national level, education sector involvement is most effective in the context of a long-term integrated substance use prevention and control system or strategy that targets various ages and levels of vulnerability through a full range of sectors. A majority of countries have national policies or strategies/ action plans concerned with tobacco and the reduction of supply and demand of drugs, and many have a separate alcohol policy or strategy. However, the trend is toward comprehensive and balanced policies or strategies that integrate the various substances.\n\nCurrent substance use control strategies increasingly understand substance use to be first and foremost a health issue that is best addressed through a range of demand reduction measures including: early intervention; treatment; rehabilitation; recovery and social reintegration measures; and measures to minimize the public health and social consequences of substance abuse. All of these functions, including prevention, can fall within the purview of a public health system.\n\nThe national education sector derives a clear mandate to respond to substance use through policy language that typically calls the sector to take responsibility for promoting ‘health and safety’, ‘healthy lifestyles’ or ‘life- skills’ among students. For example, within the Eastern European and Central Asian region, most countries address the primary goal of substance use prevention by establishing education laws that oblige schools to build skills and foster a culture of healthy lifestyles and safe behaviour among children and young people. Within this context, national education sector substance use prevention policy has taken a number of forms, and can be categorized as follows:\n\nNational substance policies may mandate school policies to prevent substance use and its health and social consequences within schools. This typically includes bans on substances (use, selling and advertising) on school premises or surrounding properties. School rules relating to substance use often include the behaviours of teachers and other adults, and policies regarding dealing with substance use-related incidents.\n\nNational education policies may enshrine the duty of schools to provide health and/or substance use- related education and training. Such training is often incorporated within other subject headings such as science or physical education, or in free-standing health or personal skills curricula. This often implies that prevention methodologies and contents are part of the mandatory teacher training.\n\nNational policies may mandate the implementation of school health services. These services allow for the provision of an accessible range of health services including preventive, routine and acute health services for students. They may include a range of personnel, including school nurses, advisors and counsellors and mental health professionals. The services provided often contribute to preventive education, the development of school health and substance use policies, early identi cation and interventions and connections with the social and health sectors.\n\nSchool substance use prevention can be encouraged and guided by quality standards. They are increasingly available (e.g. European drug prevention quality standards; Canadian Standards for School-based Youth Substance Abuse Prevention), and typically advocate for evidence-based programming, sound planning and design, comprehensive activity, monitoring, evaluation, professional development and sustainability. Quality standards help to support national policy initiatives and guide schools in meeting their mandate to promote health and prevent substance use.\n\nSome countries participate in global or regional monitoring or conduct national- level monitoring of substance use prevalence among children and adolescents. This is not an education sector activity per se but it does indicate that the issue is a priority, providing a measure of endorsement and most importantly, guidance, for school prevention activity.\n\nA number of international statutes stipulate the responsibility of various sectors, including the education sector, to prevent and minimize harm from substance use among children and young people. Most relevant are the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "185793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185793", "title": "Emeritus", "text": "Emeritus\n\nEmeritus (), in its current usage, is an adjective used to designate a retired professor, pastor, bishop, pope, director, president, prime minister, rabbi, or other person.\n\nIn some cases, the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank, but in others, it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded to only a few on retirement. It is also used when a person of distinction in a profession retires or hands over the position, enabling their former rank to be retained in their title, e.g., \"Professor Emeritus\". The term \"emeritus\" does not necessarily signify that a person has relinquished all the duties of their former position, and they may continue to exercise some of them.\n\n\"Emerere\" is a compound of the Latin prefix \"e-\" (a variant of \"ex-\") meaning \"out of, from\" and \"merere\" meaning \"earn\"; \"emeritus\" is the past participle of the verb. The female equivalent, emerita (), is also sometimes used, but as is often true of loanwords, the use of the donor language's inflectional system faces limits in the recipient language; in English, \"emeritus\" is often unmarked for gender.\n\nIn the United States, a fully tenured professor who retires from an educational institution in good standing may be given the title \"professor emeritus\" regardless of gender. The title \"professor emerita\" is sometimes used for women. In most systems and institutions, the rank is bestowed on all professors who have retired in good standing, while at others, it needs a special act or vote. Professors emeriti may, depending on local circumstances, retain office space or other privileges. The word is used either as a postpositional adjective (e.g., \"professor emeritus\", Noam Chomsky, the renowned scholar and MIT professor emeritus), or as a prepositional adjective (e.g., \"emeritus professor\"). The concept has in some places been expanded to include tenured associate professors or non-tenure-track faculty.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and most other parts of the world, the term \"emeritus professor\" is given only to a person of outstanding merit who had full professorial status before he or she retired. The possession of a PhD or other higher degree, or even full professorial status, is not sufficient for calling oneself \"emeritus professor\" upon retirement. The term \"Professor Emeritus\" is also recognised in the United Kingdom. The word is capitalized when it forms part of a title which is capitalized. Oxbridge colleges may appoint distinguished fellows who have retired as \"Emeritus Fellow\".\n\nWhen a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, the word \"emeritus\" is added to his former title, i.e., \"Archbishop Emeritus of ...\", \"Bishop Emeritus of ...\", or \"Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus of ...\" Examples of usage are: \"The Most Reverend (or Right Reverend) John Jones, Bishop Emeritus of Anytown\"; and \"His Eminence Cardinal James Smith, Archbishop Emeritus of Anycity\". The term \"Bishop Emeritus\" of a particular see can apply to several people, if the first lives long enough. The sees listed in the 2007 Annuario Pontificio as having more than one (Arch)Bishop Emeritus included Zárate-Campana, Villavicencio, Versailles, and Uruguaiana. There were even three Archbishops Emeriti of Taipei. The same suffix was applied to the Bishop of Rome, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, on his retirement. In the Roman Catholic Church the word \"emeritus\" does not imply that the person in question is no longer a priest.\n\nSince 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has been given to a Senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate. The position has been held by Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) (2001-2003), Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia) (2003-2007), Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) (2007-2009), and Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) (2015-present).\n\nIt is also commonly used in business and nonprofit organizations to denote perpetual status of the founder of an organization or individuals who moved the organization to new heights as a former key member on the board of directors (e.g., chairman emeritus; director emeritus; president of the board emeritus).\n\nIn Community of Christ, the status of emeritus is occasionally granted to senior officials upon retirement. In 1938, Frederick A. Smith was given the title of \"president emeritus\" of the Order of Evangelists (one of the presiding councils of the church), though the president of that body at that time was more commonly known as Presiding Patriarch. Roy A. Cheville became Presiding Patriarch Emeritus in 1974. W. Wallace Smith became the first person to retire as President of the Church (all prior presidents having served until death), and was accorded the title President Emeritus in 1978. His successor, Wallace B. Smith, was also given the title of President Emeritus, upon his own retirement in 1996. He continues to hold that status to this day.\n\n\n"}

This applied capacity of the humanities is not itself a novel idea; however, the construct of the health humanities has only recently begun to emerge over the first decade of the 21st Century. Historically, the roots informing the health humanities can be traced back to, and can now be considered to include, such multidisciplinary areas as the medical humanities and the expressive therapies/creative arts therapies.\n\nIn the health humanities, health (and the promotion of health) is understood according to the constructivist (and other non-positivist) principles indigenous to the humanities, as opposed to the positivism of science. The health humanities are rooted in dialogical (negotiated, intersubjective voices of multiple truths), versus monological (a singular, authoritative voice of \"the\" truth) perspectives on health. As such, evidence upon which health practices are based is generally considered axiological (based in meanings, values, and aesthetics), versus epistemological (based in factual knowledge), in orientation. The health humanities are not an alternative to the health sciences, but rather offer a contrasting paradigm and pragmatic approach with respect to health and its promotion, and can function in a manner that is complementary and simultaneous relative to the health sciences. \n\nThe health humanities are a growing movement internationally. A conference on the health humanities was held October 13–15, 2006, at Green College, University of British Columbia. The conference was co-organized by Judy Segal (UBC English) and Alan Richardson (UBC Philosophy) and featured presentations by Jacalyn Duffin, Carl Elliott, Nicholas King, Lorelei Lingard, Robert Proctor, Susan Squier, Andrea Tone, and Kathleen Woodward. In January 2009, Paul Crawford became the world's first Professor of Health Humanities at The University of Nottingham, and with Dr Victoria Tischler, Charley Baker, Dr Brian Brown, Dr Lisa Mooney-Smith and Professor Ronald Carter created an international health humanities initiative that included the AHRC-funded International Health Humanities Conference (IHHC). The first field description for Health Humanities was presented in the key article \"Health Humanities: The future of Medical Humanities\" (Crawford, Brown, Tischler, & Baker, 2010), published in the Mental Health Review Journal.\n\nThe 1st International Health Humanities Conference was held 6–8 August 2010, at The University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. The conference opened with Professor Crawford's address entitled ‘Health humanities: Literature and Madness’ and included keynote lectures by Professor Kay Redfield Jamison and Professor Elaine Showalter. Mark A. Radcliffe, who also spoke at the conference, reported on 'health humanities' in his weekly column for the Nursing Times. The conference was also reported in the Bethlem Blog. The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference was hosted in the USA, 9–11 August 2012, at Montclair State University in New Jersey, with the theme of \"Music, Health, and Humanity.\" The 3rd International Health Humanities Conference was held 5-7 September 2014, once again at the University of Nottingham, and featured the theme of \"Traumatextualities: Trauma in the Clinical, Arts and Humanities Contexts.\" The 4th International Health Humanities Conference was held 30 April and 1-2 May 2015, at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Denver, featuring the theme of \"Health Humanities: The Next Decade (Pedagogies, Practices, Politics).\" The 5th International Health Humanities Conference will be held 15-17 September 2016, at the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, featuring the theme of \"Arts and Humanities for Improving Social Inclusion, Education, and Health: Creative Practice and Mutuality.\" \n\nTextbooks on the health humanities include \"Health Humanities Reader\" and \"Health Humanities\".\n\nIn 2015 a Health Humanities Centre was established at University College London, dedicated to research and teaching in the Health Humanities, including an MA in Health Humanities.\n\n\nJones T, Blackie M, Garden R, and Wear D.

It comprises those fields of business administration that are necessary for the success of companies within the manufacturing sector and the encompassing services (primarily operations management, marketing, and financial management).\n\nThe term industrial company is generally applied to a manufacturing firm that – contrary to a crafts business – produces consumer durables in factories from raw materials in mass and serial production (division of labour) using modern manufacturing machines.\n\nThe precursor of the study field industrial management was factory management. It had a strong similarity with technical management and was geared towards the engineering fields. Parallel to this, there was also a factory management that was more in the area of business economics. This dealt with the organizational questions of factory and office administration as well as financial accounting, e.g. the factory bookkeeping and late also management accounting.\n\nThe term and the contents of present-day industrial management were strongly influenced by the establishment of MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 (renamed the Sloan School of Management in 1964 after its benefactor, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., MIT graduate and then-chairman of General Motors). MIT School of Industrial Management set itself the goal of educating the \"ideal manager\" through this (post)graduate management program.\n\nGraduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and sustainability topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.\n\nMost graduate studies in industrial management are full-time MBA degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.\n\nStudy programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like M.Eng.- programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and universities of applied sciences in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.\n\nIndian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "573174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573174", "title": "Interior design", "text": "Interior design\n\nInterior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. An interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.\n\nIn the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building. The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes. The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of \"interior decorator\", a term commonly used in the US. The term is less common in the UK where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.\n\nIn ancient India, architects used to work as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect - one of the gods in Indian mythology. Additionally, the sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen in palaces built in 17th-century India.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, \"soul houses\" or models of houses were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings. From these, it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.\n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century, interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed upholsterer or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the middle class in industrial countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large furniture firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public. To meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as offices, hotels, and public buildings, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners, plasterers, textile designers, artists, and furniture designers, as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job. Firms began to publish and circulate catalogs with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes.\n\nAs department stores increased in number and size, retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers. One particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international exhibitions in showrooms for the public to see. Some of the pioneering firms in this regard were Waring & Gillow, James Shoolbred, Mintons, and Holland & Sons. These traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style, and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in Britain.\n\nThis type of firm emerged in America after the Civil War. The Herter Brothers, founded by two German emigre brothers, began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and interior decorators. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers were prepared to accomplish every aspect of interior furnishing including decorative paneling and mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, and carpets and draperies.\nA pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect Owen Jones, one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century. Jones' first project was his most important—in 1851 he was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton’s gigantic Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within. He chose a controversial palette of red, yellow, and blue for the interior ironwork and, despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers, was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim. His most significant publication was \"The Grammar of Ornament\" (1856), in which Jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration.\n\nJones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day; in the 1860s he worked in collaboration with the London firm Jackson & Graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector Alfred Morrison and the Khedive of Egypt, Ismail Pasha.\n\nIn 1882, the London Directory of the Post Office listed 80 interior decorators. Some of the most distinguished companies of the period were Crace, Waring & Gillow and Holland & Sons; famous decorators employed by these firms included Thomas Edward Collcutt, Edward William Godwin, Charles Barry, Gottfried Semper, and George Edmund Street.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English feminist author Mary Haweis wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers. She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer:\n\nThe move towards decoration as a separate artistic profession unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers, received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the Institute of British Decorators; with John Dibblee Crace as its president it represented almost 200 decorators around the country. By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of William Morris. In 1876, their work - \"Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture\" - spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience.\n\nBy 1900, the situation was described by \"The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder\":\n\nIn America, Candace Wheeler was one of the first woman interior designers and helped encourage a new style of American design. She was instrumental in the development of art courses for women in a number of major American cities and was considered a national authority on homedesign. An important influence on the new profession was \"The Decoration of Houses\", a manual of interior design written by Edith Wharton with architect Ogden Codman in 1897 in America. In the book, the authors denounced Victorian-style interior decoration and interior design, especially those rooms that were decorated with heavy window curtains, Victorian bric-a-brac and overstuffed furniture. They argued that such rooms emphasized upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and were, therefore, uncomfortable and rarely used. The book is considered a seminal work and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors, most notably Elsie de Wolfe.\nElsie De Wolfe was one of the first interior designers. Rejecting the Victorian style she grew up with, she chose a more vibrant scheme, along with more comfortable furniture in the home. Her designs were light, with fresh colors and delicate Chinoiserie furnishings, as opposed to the Victorian preference of heavy, red drapes and upholstery, dark wood and intensely patterned wallpapers. Her designs were also more practical; she eliminated the clutter that occupied the Victorian home, enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably. In 1905, de Wolfe was commissioned for the interior design of the Colony Club on Madison Avenue; its interiors garnered her recognition almost over night. She compiled her ideas into her widely read 1913 book, \"The House in Good Taste\".\n\nIn England, Syrie Maugham became a legendary interior designer credited with designing the first all-white room. Starting her career in the early 1910s, her international reputation soon grew; she later expanded her business to New York City and Chicago. Born during the Victorian Era, a time characterized by dark colors and small spaces, she instead designed rooms filled with light and furnished in multiple shades of white and mirrored screens. In addition to mirrored screens, her trademark pieces included: books covered in white vellum, cutlery with white porcelain handles, console tables with plaster palm-frond, shell, or dolphin bases, upholstered and fringed sleigh beds, fur carpets, dining chairs covered in white leather, and lamps of graduated glass balls, and wreaths.\n\nThe interior design profession became more established after World War II. From the 1950s onwards, spending on the home increased. Interior design courses were established, requiring the publication of textbooks and reference sources. Historical accounts of interior designers and firms distinct from the decorative arts specialists were made available. Organisations to regulate education, qualifications, standards and practices, etc. were established for the profession.\n\nInterior design was previously seen as playing a secondary role to architecture. It also has many connections to other design disciplines, involving the work of architects, industrial designers, engineers, builders, craftsmen, etc. For these reasons, the government of interior design standards and qualifications was often incorporated into other professional organisations that involved design. Organisations such as the Chartered Society of Designers, established in the UK in 1986, and the American Designers Institute, founded in 1938, governed various areas of design.\n\nIt was not until later that specific representation for the interior design profession was developed. The US National Society of Interior Designers was established in 1957, while in the UK the Interior Decorators and Designers Association was established in 1966. Across Europe, other organisations such as The Finnish Association of Interior Architects (1949) were being established and in 1994 the International Interior Design Association was founded.\n\nEllen Mazur Thomson, author of \"Origins of Graphic Design in America\" (1997), determined that professional status is achieved through education, self-imposed standards and professional gate-keeping organizations. Having achieved this, interior design became an accepted profession.\n\nInterior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.\n\nInterior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning, functional design and the effective use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fineline design can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning, acoustics, and lighting. Although an interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects, engineers and contractors.\n\nInterior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior environments that are functional, safe, and adhere to building codes, regulations and ADA requirements. They go beyond the selection of color palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of construction documents, occupancy loads, healthcare regulations and sustainable design principles, as well as the management and coordination of professional services including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life safety—all to ensure that people can live, learn or work in an innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing.\n\nSomeone may wish to specialize and develop technical knowledge specific to one area or type of interior design, such as residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, furniture design, and spatial branding. \nInterior design is a creative profession that is relatively new, constantly evolving, and often confusing to the public. It is not an artistic pursuit and relies on research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how people are influenced by their environments.\n\nColor is a powerful design tool in decoration, as well as in interior design which is the art of composing, and coordinating colors together to create a stylish scheme on the interior architecture of the space.\n\nIt is essential to interior designers to acquire a deep experience with colors, understand their psychological effects, and understand the meaning of each color in different locations and situations in order to create suitable combinations for each place.\n\nCombining colors together could result in creating a state of mind as seen by the observer, and could eventually result in positive or negative effects on them. Colors make the room feel either more calm, cheerful, comfortable, stressful, or dramatic. Color combination make a tiny room seem larger or smaller. So it is the Interior designer profession to choose appropriate colors for a place in a way people want to look and feel in the space.\n\nResidential design is the design of the interior of private residences. As this type design is very specific for individual situations, the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design. The interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the remodelling of an existing structure. It is often a very involved process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client.\n\nCommercial design encompasses a wide range of subspecialties.\n\nOther areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design, museum and exhibition design, exhibit design, event design (including ceremonies, weddings, baby and bridal showers, parties, conventions, and concerts), interior and prop styling, craft styling, food styling, product styling, tablescape design, theatre and performance design, stage and set design, scenic design, and production design for film and television. Beyond those, interior designers, particularly those with graduate education, can specialize in healthcare design, gerontological design, educational facility design, and other areas that require specialized knowledge. Some university programs offer graduate studies in theses and other areas. For example, both Cornell University and the University of Florida offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies.\n\nThere are various paths that one can take to become a professional interior designer. All of these paths involve some form of training. Working with a successful professional designer is an informal method of training and has previously been the most common method of education. In many states, however, this path alone cannot lead to licensing as a professional interior designer. Training through an institution such as a college, art or design school or university is a more formal route to professional practice.\n\nIn the UK and the U.S, several university degree courses are now available, including those on interior architecture, taking three or four years to complete.\n\nA formal education program, particularly one accredited by or developed with a professional organization of interior designers, can provide training that meets a minimum standard of excellence and therefore gives a student an education of a high standard. There are also university graduate and Ph.d. programs available for those seeking further training in a specific design specialization (i.e. gerontological or healthcare design) or those wishing to teach interior design at the university level.\n\nThere are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms and online renovation platforms usually work on a contract or per-job basis. Self-employed designers, which make up 26% of interior designers, usually work the most hours. Interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines, stay on budget, and meet clients' needs.\n\nIn some cases, licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for approval by clients or construction permisioning. The need for licensed review and signature varies by locality, relevant legislation, and scope of work. Their work can involve significant travel to visit different locations. However, with technology development, the process of contacting clients and communicating design alternatives has become easier and requires less travel.\nThey also renovate a space to satisfy the specific taste for a client.\n\nThe Art Deco style began in Europe in the early years of the 20th century, with the waning of Art Nouveau. The term \"Art Deco\" was taken from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a world’s fair held in Paris in 1925. Art Deco rejected many traditional classical influences in favour of more streamlined geometric forms and metallic color. The Art Deco style influenced all areas of design, especially interior design, because it was the first style of interior decoration to spotlight new technologies and materials.\n\nArt Deco style is mainly based on geometric shapes, streamlining, and clean lines. The style offered a sharp, cool look of mechanized living utterly at odds with anything that came before.\n\nArt Deco rejected traditional materials of decoration and interior design, opting instead to use more unusual materials such as chrome, glass, stainless steel, shiny fabrics, mirrors, aluminium, lacquer, inlaid wood, sharkskin, and zebra skin. The use of harder, metallic materials was chosen to celebrate the machine age. These materials reflected the dawning modern age that was ushered in after the end of the First World War. The innovative combinations of these materials created contrasts that were very popular at the time - for example the mixing together of highly polished wood and black lacquer with satin and furs. The barber shop in the Austin Reed store in London was designed by P. J. Westwood. It was soon regarded as the trendiest barber shop in Britain due to its use of metallic materials.\n\nThe color themes of Art Deco consisted of metallic color, neutral color, bright color, and black and white. In interior design, cool metallic colors including silver, gold, metallic blue, charcoal grey, and platinum tended to predominate. Serge Chermayeff, a Russian-born British designer made extensive use of cool metallic colors and luxurious surfaces in his room schemes. His 1930 showroom design for a British dressmaking firm had a silver-grey background and black mirrored-glass wall panels.\n\nBlack and white was also a very popular color scheme during the 1920s and 1930s. Black and white checkerboard tiles, floors and wallpapers were very trendy at the time. As the style developed, bright vibrant colors became popular as well.\n\nArt Deco furnishings and lighting fixtures had a glossy, luxurious appearance with the use of inlaid wood and reflective finishes. The furniture pieces often had curved edges, geometric shapes, and clean lines. Art Deco lighting fixtures tended to make use of stacked geometric patterns.\n\n\"Modern design grew out of the decorative arts, mostly from the Art Deco, in the early 20th century.\" One of the first to introduce this style was Frank Lloyd Wright, who hadn't become hugely popularized until completing the house called Fallingwater in the 1930s. \"Modern art reached its peak in the 1950s and 60s which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being \"mid-century.\" Modern Art does not refer to the era or age of design. \"Modern art is not the same as contemporary design, which is a term that interior designers apply to a shifting group of recent styles and trends.\"\n\n“Majlis painting”, also called nagash painting, is the decoration of the majlis or front parlor of traditional Arabic homes in the Asir province of Saudi Arabia and adjoining parts of Yemen These wall paintings, an arabesque form of mural or fresco, show various geometric designs in bright colors: “Called 'nagash' in Arabic, the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house.”\n\nThe geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns. “In contrast with the sobriety of architecture and decoration in the rest of Arabia, exuberant color and ornamentation characterize those of 'Asir. The painting extends into the house over the walls and doors, up the staircases, and onto the furniture itself. When a house is being painted, women from the community help each other finish the job. The building then displays their shared taste and knowledge. Mothers pass these on to their daughters. This artwork is based on a geometry of straight lines and suggests the patterns common to textile weaving, with solid bands of different colors. Certain motifs reappear, such as the triangular mihrab or 'niche' and the palmette. In the past, paint was produced from mineral and vegetable pigments. Cloves and alfalfa yielded green. Blue came from the indigo plant. Red came from pomegranates and a certain mud. Paintbrushes were created from the tough hair found in a goat's tail. Today, however, women use modern manufactured paint to create new looks, which have become an indicator of social and economic change.”\n\nWomen in the Asir province often complete the decoration and painting of the house interior. “You could tell a family’s wealth by the paintings,” Um Abdullah says: “If they didn’t have much money, the wife could only paint the motholath,” the basic straight, simple lines, in patterns of three to six repetitions in red, green, yellow and brown.” When women did not want to paint the walls themselves, they could barter with other women who would do the work. Several Saudi women have become famous as majlis painters, such as Fatima Abou Gahas.\n\nThe interior walls of the home are brightly painted by the women, who work in defined patterns with lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns. “Some of the large triangles represent mountains. Zigzag lines stand for water and also for lightning. Small triangles, especially when the widest area is at the top, are found in pre-Islamic representations of female figures. That the small triangles found in the wall paintings in ‘Asir are called banat may be a cultural remnant of a long-forgotten past.”\n\n\"Courtyards and upper pillared porticoes are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood (jiss) and painted window shutters, which decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the majlis, around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this \"parquetting of jis\", this \"gypsum fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed\" originated from India. However, the Najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and Oman, which are linked to Indian traditions, and rather resembles the motifs and patterns found in ancient Mesopotamia. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns, and can be found all over the Middle East of antiquity. Al-Qassim Province seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white plaster (though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth). In Riyadh, examples can be seen in unadorned clay.\n\nInterior design has become the subject of television shows. In the United Kingdom (UK), popular interior design and decorating programs include \"60 Minute Makeover\" (ITV), \"Changing Rooms\" (BBC), and \"Selling Houses\" (Channel 4). Famous interior designers whose work is featured in these programs include Linda Barker and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. In the United States, the TLC Network aired a popular program called \"Trading Spaces\", a show based on the UK program \"Changing Rooms\". In addition, both HGTV and the DIY Network also televise many programs about interior design and decorating, featuring the works of a variety of interior designers, decorators, and home improvement experts in a myriad of projects.\n\nFictional interior decorators include the Sugarbaker sisters on \"Designing Women\" and Grace Adler on \"Will & Grace\". There is also another show called \"Home MADE\". There are two teams and two houses and whoever has the designed and made the worst room, according to the judges, is eliminated. Another show on the Style Network, hosted by Niecy Nash, is \"Clean House\" where they re-do messy homes into themed rooms that the clients would like. Other shows include \"Design on a Dime\", \"Designed to Sell\", and \"The Decorating Adventures of Ambrose Price\". The show called \"Design Star\" has become more popular through the 5 seasons that have already aired. The winners of this show end up getting their own TV shows, of which are \"Color Splash\" hosted by David Bromstad, \"Myles of Style\" hosted by Kim Myles, \"Paint-Over!\" hosted by Jennifer Bertrand, \"The Antonio Treatment\" hosted by Antonio Ballatore, and finally \"Secrets from a Stylist\" hosted by Emily Henderson. Bravo also has a variety of shows that explore the lives of interior designers. These include \"Flipping Out\", which explores the life of Jeff Lewis and his team of designers; \"Million Dollar Decorators\" explores the lives of interior designers Nathan Turner, Jeffrey Alan Marks, Mary McDonald, Kathryn Ireland, and Martyn Lawrence Bullard.\n\nInterior design has also become the subject of radio shows. In the U.S., popular interior design & lifestyle shows include \"Martha Stewart Living\" and \"Living Large\" featuring Karen Mills. Famous interior designers whose work is featured on these programs include Bunny Williams, Barbara Barry, and Kathy Ireland, among others.\n\nMany interior design magazines exist to offer advice regarding color palette, furniture, art, and other elements that fall under the umbrella of interior design. These magazine often focus on related subjects to draw a more specific audience. For instance, architecture as a primary aspect of \"Dwell\", while \"Veranda\" is well known as a luxury living magazine. \"Lonny Magazine\" and the newly relaunched, \"Domino Magazine\", cater to a young, hip, metropolitan audience, and emphasize accessibility and a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to interior design.\n\nOther early interior decorators:\n\nMany of the most famous designers and decorators during the 20th century had no formal training. Some examples include Sister Parish, Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade, Kerry Joyce, Kelly Wearstler, Stéphane Boudin, Georges Geffroy, Emilio Terry, Carlos de Beistegui, Nina Petronzio, Lorenzo Mongiardino, and David Nightingale Hicks.\n\nNotable interior designers in the world today include Scott Salvator, Troy Adams, Jonathan Adler, Michael S. Smith, Martin Brudnizki, Mary Douglas Drysdale, Kelly Hoppen, Kelly Wearstler, Nina Campbell, David Collins, Nate Berkus, Sandra Espinet, Jo Hamilton and Nicky Haslam.\n\n\n"}

Adult education focuses on the unique needs and characteristics of students who are not children or adolescents. The focus of ISCAE then is the study of the education of adults as practiced in various countries; it also explores the methods, problems and pitfalls of international comparative research in general.\n\nISCAE serves as a network of contacts for professionals in the field of comparative adult education; such networking encourages research assistance and cross-fertilization, exchange of information, international cooperation, and similar activities. There are no statutes and no membership fees. Most of the printing and distribution of newsletters and conference proceedings is done by members from the United States, Germany, or Australia.\n\nISCAE's origins can be traced back to 1960, when Dr. Alexander N. Charters, professor of adult education at Syracuse University, and Canadian scholar of adult education J. Roby Kidd formed a working group on international and comparative adult education at the first world conference of the World Council for Comparative Education in Ottawa. They named their group the Committee for Study and Research in Comparative Adult Education (CSRCAE). \nThe growing International interest in comparative adult education led, in 1992, to a restructuring with a new board and a new president: Jost Reischmann, Chair of Andragogy at Bamberg University, Germany), and to a renaming into \"International Society for Comparative Adult Education ISCAE\". The upcoming new Internet-technology with an homepage and a mailing list allowed much easier and faster communication and access for scholars from many countries around the globe. These new developments and the conferences increased the number of members from about 50 in 1992 to 250 in 2012. In 2009 Michal Bron Jr, Assoc. Professor Södertörn University, Sweden became new president.\n\nISCAE publishes a newsletter, \"ISCAE-Communication\", irregularly (once or twice a year). Members meet at international conferences, held every three or four years in locations around the world: in Bamberg, Germany 1995, Radovljica, Slovenia 1998, St. Louis, Mo, USA 2002, Bamberg, Germany 2006, Las Vegas, USA 2012. At the conferences, individuals present papers on completed (or nearly complete) research; others present research in progress or ideas for future research. Studies must include two or more countries in the research in order to qualify as \"comparative.\"\nISCAE published two volumes with papers from their conferences:\n\nComparative Adult Education 1998.

{"id": "36888232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36888232", "title": "International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz", "text": "International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz\n\nThe International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz is an educational institution whose campus lies between the center of the Polish city of Oświęcim and the former German concentration camp of Auschwitz. More than one million persons, mostly Jewish and Polish, were murdered at Auschwitz during the Second World War (1939–1945). Proposed in 1971, the Center was opened in 1986 following years of planning, negotiations, and fundraising. It seeks to \"develop the understanding of National Socialism and its consequences, particularly among young Germans, through dialogue and encounter between people of different origins\", and is particularly engaged with Germans and Poles, Christians and Jews. In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs. Many young Germans and Austrians have held year-long voluntary positions at the Center that satisfy their civilian service (\"Zivildienst\") responsibility. One of these, Robert Thalheim, wrote and directed the German-language dramatic film \"And Along Come Tourists\" (2007) that features the Center and its activities.\n\nThe Polish and German names for the Center are Międzynarodowy Dom Spotkań Młodzieży w Oświęcimiu and Internationale Jugendbegegnungsstätte in Oświęcim/Auschwitz, respectively; the two names are conjoined in the abbreviation MDSM/IJBS for the Center.\n\nThe idea for the construction of a youth meeting center in Poland came from (1934–1980), who saw an opportunity for creating it following the signing of the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland. von Törne was a poet and then business manager of the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP), which is a private German organization (\"Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienst\") working towards reconciliation with countries and peoples harmed during German occupation in World War II. Following von Törne's death in 1980, led the project for ARSP. In a 1986 interview, Heubner explained the importance of placing the Center near Auschwitz, which \"symbolized the lowest point in German-Polish history, the lowest point in Jewish-German relations, one of the lowest points in man's inhumanity to man. The motivation to speak with one another is greater there. The greater emotion opens people up more for dialogue than would be the case in Masuria [an area in northeast Poland] or in some sunny mountain meadow.\"\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s the proposal was very controversial. The location of the buildings, the architecture of the project, the operations as well as the Polish partner for the ARSP were contentious issues. In 1978, Andreas Maislinger unsuccessfully approached President Rudolf Kirchschläger about Austrian support for the project.\n\nThe project received the support of many survivors of the concentration camps at Dachau, Stutthof, Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and by December 1985 a turning point was reached. Alfred Przybylski, former prisoner #471 at the Auschwitz camp and the representative of the Union of Polish Architects, supported by the plans drawn up by German architect Helmut Morlok, contributed decisively to the realization of the project.\n\nAfter obtaining contributions of 4.6 million Deutschmarks ($2.1 million), sufficient for 2/3 of the construction costs, ground was finally broken in May 1986. The handoff of the initial buildings to the foundation that operates it was celebrated on December 7, 1986, which was the sixteenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw. The entire building project was completed in October, 1998. The Center is primarily supported by the Polish municipality of Oświęcim and by the ARSP, which sponsors three such centers. In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs.\n\nThe Center has become well known in German-speaking Europe following release of the dramatic film \"Am Ende kommen Touristen\" (2007) (\"And Along Come Tourists\"), which was partly filmed at the Center. The film was written and directed by Robert Thalheim. While the film's characters and story are fictional, in writing the screenplay Thalheim drew from his own experience as a German civilian service worker at the Center in 1996-97.\n\nThe Center is on one bank of the Soła river, and consists of several pavilions laid out around a large garden. There is a forum, a multi-purpose room, a library, and four seminar rooms. There are about one hundred beds, as well as a campground and a sports field.\n\nKatrin Buchholz has described the architecture as follows: \"Modesty in construction and form, simplicity in the interior furnishings, ... the center of the campus is a meeting place that is open in all directions ... where all can move or loiter freely and unobserved, and in which one can find community but also security, as well as time and space to be alone.\"\n\nThe Center sponsors activities of several types, including workshops to bring together groups of Polish and German students, seminars and development programs for adults and teachers, and exhibitions for general visitors. Groups using the Center typically stay for four or five days. In addition to visits to the remains of the concentration camps Auschwitz I, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Auschwitz III-Monowitz, groups can plan excursions in the area, especially to the city of Kraków, and conversations can be arranged with experts on the major concerns of the Center.\n\nThe Center has been among the sites for the work of young German and Austrian citizens doing civilian service (\"Zivildienst\") sponsored by the ARSP, the German \"\", and by the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3765577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3765577", "title": "Jon Sudbø", "text": "Jon Sudbø\n\nJon Sudbø (born May 3, 1961) is a Norwegian dentist, physician, and former medical researcher, who was exposed as a scientific fraudster in 2006. Over a period of several years, he fabricated results in the field of oncology which he published in leading medical journals. The article that led to his downfall, which was published in \"The Lancet\", was based on 900 patients Sudbø had fabricated entirely. The editor of \"The Lancet\" described this as the biggest scientific fraud conducted by a single researcher ever.\n\nSudbø graduated from the University of Oslo faculty of dentistry in 1989 and the faculty of medicine in 1994, both top of his class.\n\nSudbø was formerly employed as a consultant oncologist at the Radium Hospital in Oslo and as an associate professor at the University of Oslo, but as a result of the fabrication scandal, he resigned from these positions in 2006. The same year, his licenses to practice medicine and dentistry were revoked. An inquiry by the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Oslo found that most of Sudbø's work, including his doctoral dissertation, were based on fraud, and the University of Oslo revoked his doctorate in medicine in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he was granted a strictly limited license to work as an assistant dentist under supervision, and in 2009, he regained licenses to practice medicine and dentistry with some restrictions. He is currently working as an assistant dentist in Seljord, Telemark.\n\nHis wife Wanja Kildal was his co-author of 7 of the articles that were found to be fraudulent and subsequently retracted, while his brother Asle Sudbø was a co-author of two of these articles.\n\nIn January 2006 it was revealed that his October 2005 fast track submission to \"The Lancet\" was based upon fraudulent patient data. The article had suggested that non-COX2-NSAIDs like ibuprofen diminish the risk of oral cancer in smokers. However, it turned out that the whole patient material was fictional.\nThe leader of the epidemiology division at Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Camilla Stoltenberg, found the article suspicious at the end of 2005 because the data was supposedly from a cancer patient database which had not yet opened. The Norwegian newspaper \"Dagbladet\" reported that of the 908 subjects in the Lancet study 250 had the same birthday.\n\nSudbø has later acknowledged that he has used fictional data in at least two more\npapers, published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" and the \"Journal of Clinical Oncology\".\n\nAn independent Commission of Inquiry led by Swedish Professor Anders Ekbom, that also included a member from the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was set up by Rikshospitalet and the University of Oslo to discern the details of the fraud. They were also to try to identify the role of the co-authors, which included, among others, Jon Sudbø's brother and wife.\n\nIn May 2006, Norwegian and Swedish media reported that the committee was investigating some 60 scientists from 6 countries, and a total of 38 articles.\n\nThe commission reported on 30 June 2006. The commission deemed much of Sudbø's work invalid because of manipulation and fabrication of raw data: of the 38 articles he had published since 1993, 15 were condemned as fraudulent, including his doctoral dissertation. Because of this, the dissertation and the other fraudulent articles will be rescinded. The commission also criticised the co-authors of Sudbø's papers. Professor Anders Ekbom, the Chair of the Commission, said: \"One explanation of this catastrophe was that Sudbø was a lone wolf. Few or anyone had insight into his work\". The commission found no evidence that any of his co-authors had taken part in the fraud or otherwise been party to the deceit, although Sudbø's supervisor accepted criticism for lack of vigilance and follow-up.\n\nIn November 2006 his authorizations as a physician and a dentist were revoked by the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, but in 2007 he was granted a strictly limited authorization to work as an assistant dentist. In 2009 he was granted restricted authorizations to practice as dentist and as a physician, however he cannot involve himself in research.\n\nRikshospitalet and the University were both criticized for \"a lack of preliminary control and organization with a view to the researcher's [Sudbø's] PhD project\". The hospital was also criticized for \"a lack of training and consciousness-raising in respect of the researcher and other employees with a view to the rules for handling patient material, preliminary assessments of research projects and authorship\" and for \"a lack of leadership and routines designed to expose and deal with non-conformance with its rules of procedure\".\n\nThe fraud may also have had international effects. The commission could not rule out that Sudbø's false conclusions could have affected cancer patients around the world, because his findings were used by other scientists and incorporated into cancer treatments, although Sudbø's solicitor Erling O. Lyngtveit had said on behalf of his client that none of the fraudulent articles had had any consequences for patients. Norway's scientific reputation could also be damaged by the affair, and \"massive lawsuits\" may be imminent from the national and international organisations that funded Sudbø's fraudulent papers.\n\nAccording to the Norwegian news website \"Depesjer\" (\"Dispatches\"), scientific experts they consulted felt that Sudbø's co-authors were \"severely exploited\", but also that closer observations of the Vancouver guidelines and other rules by co-authors would \"hamper future attempts at publishing fabricated material\". Dr. Atle Klovning, a leading European authority on evidence-based medicine, said in the article that Sudbø's co-authors had probably not lived up to their responsibilities according to the Vancouver rules.\n\n\n\n"}

She was a grandchild of the founder of the Timpson shoe repair business, who had moved to Manchester from Kettering and established the business there by 1870. Deaf since the age of eight, her fascination with mathematics was inspired by her Lady Barn headmistress, Miss Jenkin Jones. It was during her time at Lady Barn that she met her future husband, Robert Ollerenshaw. Today, Lady Barn House School recognises her as a 'Lady Barn legend' and she features heavily in a major historical display in the school Dining Room.\n\nAs a young woman, she attended St Leonards School and Sixth Form College in St Andrews, Scotland where today the house of young male boarders is named after her. At the age of 19 she gained admittance to Somerville College, Oxford, to study mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Somerville in 1945 on \"Critical Lattices\" under the supervision of Theo Chaundy. She wrote five original research papers which were sufficient for her to earn her DPhil degree without the need of a formal written thesis.\n\nWhile an undergraduate, she became engaged to Colonel Robert Ollerenshaw, who became a distinguished military surgeon, a pioneer of medical illustration. They married in September 1939 and had two children, Charles (1941–1999) and Florence (1946–1972). In 1942 she suffered a miscarriage and \"cried nonstop for three days\" as a result of stress when her husband was suddenly mobilised and deployed for war.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Ollerenshaws moved to Manchester, where Kathleen worked as a part-time lecturer in the mathematics department at Manchester University while raising her children and continued her work on lattices. In 1949, at the age of 37, she received her first effective hearing aid. \nOutside of academics, Ollerenshaw served as a Conservative Councillor for Rusholme for twenty-six years (1956–1981), Lord Mayor of Manchester (1975–1976), High Sheriff of Greater Manchester from 1978 to 1979, and the prime motivator in the creation of the Royal Northern College of Music. She was made a Freeman of the City of Manchester and was an advisor on educational matters to Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.\n\nShe was President of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications from 1978 to 1979. She published at least 26 mathematical papers, her best-known contribution being to most-perfect pandiagonal magic squares. Upon her death, she left a legacy in trust to support distinguished research visitors and public engagement activities at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester. An annual public lecture at the University is named in her honour.\nAn amateur astronomer, Ollerenshaw donated her telescope to Lancaster University, and an observatory there bears her name. She was an honorary member of the Manchester Astronomical Society and held the post of Vice-President for a number of years.\n\nOllerenshaw attended St Leonards School in St Andrews, Fife, and served as the school's president from 1981 to 2003. She was succeeded by Baroness Byford, Conservative spokeswoman in the House of Lords. She turned 100 in October 2012.\n\nShe died in Didsbury on 10 August 2014, at the age of 101. Her husband and both their children had predeceased her.\n\n\nIn 1970, Ollerenshaw was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to education.\n\n\n"}

She has now been converted to a hotel and restaurant ship, riding at anchor at the Riddarholmen in Stockholm since 1982. In addition to its size and proximity to the old city, much of her fame is tied to Barbara Hutton, for whom the ship is named.\n\nWith a 240-foot (73m) steel-and-nickel hull, this 1924 motor yacht was \"the largest of its day.\"\n\nIt was originally named \"Vanadis\", was ordered by C. K. G. Billings. The diesel-driven vessel was his second yacht by that name..\n\nIn 1926 she was owned by Harrison Williams, who took his new bride on a year-long around-the-world honeymoon cruise on the \"Warrior\".\n\nBarbara Hutton, Woolworth heiress, reputedly received the vessel in 1930 as a present from her father on her 18th birthday.\n\nThe yacht was twice eponymously named in Hutton's honor, and she is \"Vanadis\"'s most celebrated owner. Though Hutton is popularized as though she is the current owner (by the ship's operators), she \"only kept it\" for one year.\n\nIn 1940 the yacht was sold to the British Royal Navy. After the Second World War, it was stationed in Panama and also used as a schoolship in Norway from 1948. At the start of the 1950s it was renamed \"Cort Adeles\" at Stadsgårdskajen, Sweden. The vessel was also used as a regular passenger ship to and from Åbo, Finland.\n\nThe yacht was later slated for scrap, but was purchased by a group of Swedish businessmen who spent more than $2.5 million to renovate her.\n\nBegun in 1980, the renovation and rebuilding as a hotel for business travelers and a restaurant ship was completed in 1982. Most of the rooms or cabins are comparatively small. The vessel includes meeting facilities for up to 20 people and a Finnish sauna. The yacht is registered as the \"Lady Hutton\", and this name appears on the stern, but the name on the prow is \"Mälardrottningen\" (the Queen of Lake Mälar). And Barbara Hutton's name is used once again, as the ship is renamed \"Lady Hutton\".\n\nSince September 1982, the yacht has been docked at Riddarholmen in Stockholm. It is owned by the family company Mälardrottningen Holding AB; \"Mälardrottningen\" has been a nickname for the city of Stockholm since the end of the 1800s.\n\nThe lounge is glass-floored, so that the guests can view the engine room below. The Captain's Lounge has the best view, overlooking city hall. The 59 eccentric rooms are generally described as \"tiny.\" On the other hand, one writer notes that parents traveling with their children will probably opt for separate rooms for their offspring. And sleeping in a floating palace is proferred as a unique way to calm them down.\n\nThe hotel has conference rooms which will hold up to 20 guests. Meals are said to be relatively expensive at the gourmet restaurant.\n\nA positive attraction is its central location. It combines easy access with ample parking, and is just a brief jaunt to the Gamla stan, the Old Town city core. It is near Stockholm Palace and City Hall where the Nobel Prize award dinners are fêted.\n\nBefore the yacht had its current name, it was changed no less than ten times:\n\n"}

His career included service with the Michigan Department of Mental Health and academic posts at the University of Michigan, Vanderbilt University and Rush University. In 1967, Christman became the first man to hold the position of dean at a nursing school.\n\nWhile serving as vice president for nursing affairs at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Christman implemented the Rush Model of Nursing, an influential model for delivering hospital nursing services. He was involved in the founding of the National Male Nurse Association, which later became the American Assembly for Men in Nursing. After his 1987 retirement, Christman received several awards and honors for his contributions to nursing. He died in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2011.\n\nChristman earned a diploma from the Pennsylvania Hospital School of Nursing for Men in 1939. He received an undergraduate degree from Temple University in 1948, then an Ed.M. degree in clinical psychology from the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute. He completed a Ph.D. from Michigan State University, where he studied anthropology and sociology. Christman overcame gender discrimination during his own education; he was refused admission to two university nursing programs because he was male. While a nursing student, he was denied a maternity clinical rotation for the same reason.\n\nChristman said that he faced hostility from female coworkers early in his career, and that night shift positions in psychiatric nursing and urology were virtually the only openings for men. Christman was denied admission to the U.S. Army Nurse Corps on the basis of his gender; instead, he served in the U.S. Maritime Service as a pharmacist's mate during World War II. After returning from the war, Christman worked as a private duty nurse and assistant head nurse at Pennsylvania Hospital. After completing his Ed.M., he became director of nursing at Yankton State Hospital in South Dakota.\n\nIn 1956, Christman went to work for the Michigan Department of Mental Health. In that position, he coordinated nursing school training at hospitals in the state. Christman was named associate professor of psychiatric nursing at the University of Michigan in 1963. In 1967, he assumed a dual role as nursing school dean at Vanderbilt University and director of nursing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. In 1972, he took on similar responsibilities at Rush University and Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. While Christman was at Rush, the school and hospital implemented the Rush Model of Nursing. The model highlighted the importance of clinical expertise among faculty members, which was similar to the established practice in medicine. His faculty practice model required that nursing professors spend most of their time in clinical practice. He retired in 1987.\n\nDuring his career, Christman advocated for the advancement of nursing education. In the late 1960s, Christman predicted increased specialization in the next generation of nurses; he advocated for nurses to be freed of non-clinical tasks so that they could keep up with the nursing demands in an increasingly technological environment. In a 1978 presentation in Australia, he argued against systems which utilized a combination of registered nurses, nurse aides and student nurses; he highlighted statistics which showed that nurse aides were unoccupied up to 25 percent of the typical work day. Christman served multiple terms as president of the Michigan Nurses Association and he proposed the idea that led to the founding of the American Academy of Nursing.\n\n\nEven after his retirement, Christman remained an active participant in nursing affairs for many years. He died of pneumonia on June 7, 2011 in Nashville. He was predeceased by his wife, Dorothy Black, in 2003. They had married in 1939 and had three children.\n\nIn 1975, the American Assembly for Men in Nursing established the Luther Christman Award. The award recognizes \"an individual or individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to nursing that also reflects highly on men in nursing or significantly contributes to the purposes of this organization.\" In 2007, the American Nurses Association introduced a separate Luther Christman Award which \"recognizes the significant contribution an individual man has made to the nursing profession.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875303", "title": "Michael Pollan", "text": "Michael Pollan\n\nMichael Pollan is an American author, journalist, activist, and the Lewis K. Chan Arts Lecturer and Professor of Practice of Non-Fiction at Harvard University. Pollan is also professor of journalism at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nPollan was born to a Jewish family on Long Island, New York. He is the son of author and financial consultant Stephen Pollan and columnist Corky Pollan. Pollan received a B.A. in English from Bennington College in 1977 and an M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1981.\n\nIn \"The Botany of Desire\", Pollan explores the concept of co-evolution, specifically of humankind's evolutionary relationship with four plants — apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes — from the dual perspectives of humans and the plants. He uses case examples that fit the archetype of four basic human desires, demonstrating how each of these botanical species are selectively grown, bred, and genetically engineered. The apple reflects the desire for sweetness, the tulip beauty, the marijuana intoxication, and the potato control. Pollan then unravels the narrative of his own experience with each of the plants, which he intertwines with a well-researched exploration into their social history. Each section presents a unique element of human domestication, or the \"human bumblebee\" as Pollan calls it. These range from the true story of Johnny Appleseed to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana hybrids in Amsterdam, to the alarming and paradigm-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes.\n\nIn \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\", Pollan describes four basic ways that human societies have obtained food: the current industrial system, the big organic operation, the local self-sufficient farm, and the hunter-gatherer. Pollan follows each of these processes—from a group of plants photosynthesizing calories through a series of intermediate stages, ultimately into a meal. Along the way, he suggests that there is a fundamental tension between the logic of nature and the logic of human industry, that the way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world, and that industrial eating obscures crucially important ecological relationships and connections. On December 10, 2006, \"The New York Times\" named \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" one of the five best nonfiction books of the year. On May 8, 2007, the James Beard Foundation named \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" its 2007 winner for the best food writing. It was the book of focus for the University of Pennsylvania's Reading Project in 2007, and the book of choice for Washington State University's Common Reading Program in 2009–10.\n\nPollan's discussion of the industrial food chain is in large part a critique of modern agribusiness. According to the book, agribusiness has lost touch with the natural cycles of farming, wherein livestock and crops intertwine in mutually beneficial circles. Pollan's critique of modern agribusiness focuses on what he describes as the overuse of corn for purposes ranging from fattening cattle to massive production of corn oil, high-fructose corn syrup, and other corn derivatives. He describes what he sees as the inefficiencies and other drawbacks of factory farming and gives his assessment of organic food production and what it's like to hunt and gather food. He blames those who set the rules (e.g., politicians in Washington, D.C., bureaucrats at the United States Department of Agriculture, Wall Street capitalists, and agricultural conglomerates like Archer Daniels Midland) of what he calls a destructive and precarious agricultural system that has wrought havoc upon the diet, nutrition, and well-being of Americans. Pollan finds hope in Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm in Virginia, which he sees as a model of sustainability in commercial farming. Pollan appears in the documentary film \"King Corn\" (2007).\n\nPollan's book \"In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto\", released on January 1, 2008, explores the relationship with what he terms \"nutritionism\" and the Western diet, with a focus on late 20th century food advice given by the science community. Pollan holds that consumption of fat and dietary cholesterol does not lead to a higher rate of coronary disease, and that the reductive analysis of food into nutrient components is a mistake. He questions the view that the point of eating is to promote health, pointing out that this attitude is not universal and that cultures that perceive food as having purposes of pleasure, identity, and sociality may end up with better health. He explains this seeming paradox by vetting, and then validating, the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western framework through which we intellectualize the value of food is more a religious and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research. Pollan spends the rest of his book explicating his first three phrases: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have recognized as food.\nIn 2009, \"\" was published. This short work is a condensed version of his previous efforts, intended to provide a simple framework for a healthy and sustainable diet. It is divided into three sections, further explicating Pollan's principles of \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" It includes his rules (\"i.e.,\" \"let others sample your food\" and \"the whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead\").\n\nIn \"\", published in 2013, Pollan explores the methods by which cooks mediate \"between nature and culture.\" The book is organized into four sections corresponding to the classical elements of Fire (cooking with heat), Water (braising and boiling with pots), Air (breadmaking), and Earth (fermenting), and features Samin Nosrat, who later became known for the bestselling cookbook \"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\" as \"the chef who taught Michael Pollan how to cook.\"\n\nIn 2018, Pollan wrote \"How to Change Your Mind,\" a book about the history and future of mind-altering substances. He argues that psilocybin and LSD are not drugs that make people crazy, which he calls the biggest misconception people have about psychedelics, but rather drugs that can help a person become \"more sane,\" for example by eliminating a fear of death. While promoting his book on national TV, he explained that along with LSD and psilocybin, his research included ingesting ayahuasca and 5-MeO-DMT, and that he experienced a dissolution of ego.\n\nPollan is a contributing writer for the \"New York Times Magazine\" and a former executive editor for \"Harper's Magazine\". His first book, \"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education\", was published in 1991. \n\nPollan has contributed to \"Greater Good\", a social psychology magazine published by the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. His article \"Edible Ethics\" discusses the intersection of ethical eating and social psychology.\n\nIn his 1998 book \"A Place of My Own: The Education of an Amateur Builder\", Pollan methodically traced the design and construction of the out-building where he writes. The 2008 re-release of this book was re-titled \"A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams.\"\n\nIn 2014, Pollan wrote the foreword in the healthy eating cookbook \"The Pollan Family Table\". The book is co-authored by his mother, Corky Pollan, and sisters, Lori Pollan, Dana Pollan, and Tracy Pollan.\n\nPollan also co-starred in the documentary, \"Food, Inc.\" (2008), for which he was also a consultant. In 2010 Pollan was interviewed for the film \"Queen of the Sun: What are the bees telling us?\", a feature-length documentary about honey bees and colony collapse disorder. He was also interviewed for \"Vanishing of the Bees\", a documentary also about colony collapse, directed by Maryam Henein and George Langworthy. In 2015, a documentary version of Pollan's book \"In Defense of Food\" premiered on PBS. In 2016, Netflix released a four-part documentary series, which was based on Pollan's book, \"Cooked\" (2013), and was directed by Alex Gibney.\n\nIn 2015, Pollan received the Washburn Award from the Boston Museum of Science, awarded annually to \"an individual who has made an outstanding contribution toward public understanding and appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in our lives\" and was named as a fellow at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He has also won the James Beard Leadership award, the Reuters World Conservation Union Global Awards in environmental journalism, the James Beard Foundation Awards for best magazine series in 2003, and the Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States. His articles have been anthologized in \"Best American Science Writing\" (2004), \"Best American Essays\" (1990 and 2003), \"The Animals: Practicing Complexity\" (2006), and the \"Norton Book of Nature Writing\" (1990).\n\nIn the American Enterprise Institute's magazine, Blake Hurst argues that Pollan offers a shallow assessment of factory farming that does not take cost into account. Daniel Engber criticized Pollan in \"Slate\" for arguing that food is too complex a subject to study scientifically and blaming reductionism for today's health ills, while using nutritional research to justify his own diet advice. Engber likened Pollan's \"anti-scientific method\" to the rhetoric used by health gurus who peddle diet scams.\n\nPollan's work has also been discussed and criticized by Jonathan Safran Foer in his non-fiction book \"Eating Animals\".\nFoer criticizes Pollan's argument regarding table-fellowship. According to Foer, Pollan claims that a vegetarian dinner guest causes socially reprimandable inconvenience for the host. Foer responds that in the year 2010 it is easier for hosts to accommodate vegetarians than locavores as hosts will need to do extensive research to find (expensive) non factory-farmed meat.\n\nPollan has been accused by Jon Entine, who supports GMOs (genetically modified organisms), of using his influence to promote \"anti-GMO junk science\". A number of scientists and journalists have similarly characterized Pollan's work as biased against GMOs. For example, after Pollan posted a tweet that was critical of a \"New York Times\" article on GMOs, U.C. Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen posted a tweet calling Pollan's comment \"a new low even in Pollan's 'anti-GMO crusade'\". In response to Pollan's statement that GMOs have been one \"tremendous disappointment,\" food writer James Cooper criticized Pollan's tendency to cite poor or selected scientific sources.\n\nIn 2014, Pollan co-hosted a discussion and informal debate on the topic of genetic modification at UC Berkeley featuring prominent plant geneticist Pamela Ronald, professor at UC Davis, whose research-based position \"strongly disagrees with Pollan’s view that G.M.O. crops, broadly, are failing.\" A \"New Yorker\" reporter observed that Pollan's largely anti-GMO student base at the discussion itself constituted, \"a kind of monoculture,\" yet that Pollan sought \"to introduce an invasive species\" by engaging Ronald. The event, while predictably contentious, reportedly produced a rare instance of courteous, productive exchange between the two main sharply-opposed viewpoints on genetically-modified crops.\n\n\n\n"}

Narkompros was a Soviet agency founded by the State Commission on Education () and charged with the administration of public education and most of other issues related to culture.\n\nIts first head was Anatoly Lunacharsky. However he described Nadezhda Krupskaya as the \"soul of Narkompros\". Mikhail Pokrovsky and Evgraf Litkens also played important roles.\n\nLunacharsky protected most of the avant-garde artists such as Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Despite his efforts, the official policy after Joseph Stalin put him in disgrace.\n\nNarkompros had a number of sections, in addition to the main ones related to general education, e.g.,\nSome of these evolved into separate entities, others discontinued.\n\nThe Ministry's predecessor, the People's Commissariat for Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), was established by a decree of the second convocation of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets on and was part of the Sovnarkom. The first Commissar was Anatoly Lunacharsky appointed in 1917.\n\nThe Ministry of Education, at the all-Union level, was established on 3 August 1966. It was merged, on 5 March 1988, with the Ministry of Higher and Middle Special Education and the State Committee for Vocational and Technical Education to form the State Committee for People's Education of the Soviet Union headed by from 11 March 1988 to 10 December 1991.\n\nThe following persons headed the Commissariat/Ministry as commissars (narkoms) and ministers:\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education of the Russian Empire, which was formed by combining:\nand directed the spiritual affairs of all faiths in Russia and the institutions of public education and science, trying to restore rights in East Slavic culture of Russian Federation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46508543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46508543", "title": "Post-law school employment in the United States", "text": "Post-law school employment in the United States\n\nPost-law school employment in the United States reflects the extent to which students who obtain a law degree after attending law school in the United States are able to find employment which pays well enough to enable them to at least recoup the costs of their degrees. \n\nAccording to the Employment Summary Report prepared by the ABA's Section on Legal Education, around 86% of recent law graduates were employed 9 months after graduation, but only 62% of U.S. law school graduates who graduated in May 2016 were employed in full-time, long term positions that required a law degree. This is consistent with findings in labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre's peer-reviewed study of U.S. Census Bureau data from 1996 to 2013, \"The Economic Value of a Law Degree\" which found that 40 percent of law school graduates do not practice law.\n\nThe \"National Law Journal\" compiles employment information tracking the proportion of recent graduates working in the 250 largest law firms in the country. Although relatively few law graduates obtain these highly paid positions, law graduates, even graduates of low-ranked law schools, have much lower student loan default rates than average according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. \n\nProfessor Simkovic & McIntyre's study found that law graduates who do not practice law still derive substantial benefits from their law degrees. Law graduates earn around $30,0000 to $60,000 more per year than they likely would have been had they never attended law school. Unemployment and underemployment rates are higher for similar undergraduates than for law graduates. Long term earnings data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, a nationally representative survey first used to measure law degree holder earnings premiums in a widely cited study by Simkovic and McIntyre.\n\nA separate study of law graduates earnings sponsored by the American Bar Foundation and National Association for Law Placement, \"After the JD\", came to substantially similar conclusions. \"After the JD II\" and \"After the JD III\" found that law graduates, even from low ranked law schools, typically had six figure incomes within 12 years of graduation and made substantial progress toward paying down their debts. \n\nA working paper by University of Chicago economics graduate student David Burk used another Census data source and came to conclusions broadly similar to those of Simkovic & McIntyre and \"After the JD\".\n\nSome critics, such as Brian Tamanaha, questioned whether a law degree would continue to provide similar benefits to law graduates who graduated during a recession.\n\nSubsequent peer reviewed research by McIntyre and Simkovic using U.S. Census data and \"back testing\" investigated differences in earnings premiums between law school graduates graduating into strong and weak economies to try to better understand the impact of the 2008-2009 recession. Simkovic & McIntyre found that over the course of a lifetime, the differences were too small to sway the decision about whether or not law school was a good financial investment. Even for those graduating into high unemployment and close to the bottom of the earnings distribution, a law degree still typically provided greater benefits than it cost. The second Simkovic & McIntyre study also found that current unemployment does not predict future unemployment in 3 or 4 years when those currently entering law school would graduate.\n\nSubsequent research by McIntyre and Simkovic investigated variability in earnings for law graduates by college major and race. These studies found that law degrees tend to benefit humanities majors more than STEM majors and tend to benefit whites more than unrepresented minorities. However, the benefits to STEM majors and minorities still usually exceed the costs of law degrees.\n\nIn 2010, law professor Brian Tamanaha had questioned the accuracy of employment statistics provided by some law schools to the National Association for Law Placement and the American Bar Association. He noted that employment and salary information provided by law schools was based on surveys of recent graduates. This information is consolidated and made available by the American Bar Association. In his book entitled \"Failing Law Schools,\" Tamanaha explained that he would advise members of his own family against attending the law schools where he has taught because they are too expensive relative to the financial benefits they provide.\n\nLabor Economist Frank McIntyre and Michael Simkovic criticized Professor Tamanaha's research, noting it had factual errors, misleading and selective citations to sources that contradicted the proposition for which Tamanaha cited them, and inappropriate and misleading uses of data. However, Simkovic and McIntyre praised Tamanaha for his lively writing style and creative policy proposals.\n\nAccording to a peer reviewed study published in the University of Chicago's Journal of Legal Studies and authored by labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre, a law degree increases lifetime earnings by $1,000,000 compared to a bachelor's degree. This is present value, as of the start of law school, and includes opportunity costs and financing costs. After taxes, the mean present value will be around $700,000. At the median, or 50th percentile, the pretax present value is $610,000 and the after tax value is $430,000. After tuition, the median law graduate becomes around $330,000 richer. Even toward the bottom of the distribution, the value of a law degree will typically exceed its costs by hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average salary for lawyers in 2016 was $140,000. Salaries vary by geography, with higher average salaries in big cities—especially New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles—and lower salaries in rural areas. An unpublished table produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced lawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations. BLS data also suggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other occupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the last decade.\n\nBLS figures exclude law firm partner profits. Profits per partner at the 200 largest law firms by revenue are reported by the \"American Lawyer\" magazine in its AmLaw 100 and AmLaw 200 rankings. According to \"American Lawyer\", profits per partner at these firms have ranged from around $300,000 at the least profitable to $5,000,000 at the most.\n\nNot all law school graduates work as lawyers. According to Simkovic and McIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents with law degrees do not practice law.\n\nLaw graduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business and government. The National Association for Legal Career Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of recent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of graduation. Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although from 2009 to 2011, the numbers were lower, at around 86 to 88 percent. Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in non-professional jobs. Approximately 75 to 85 percent work in jobs classified by NALP as \"JD required\" or \"JD preferred\", and another 5 percent work in other professional jobs. A law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not practice law.\n\nBecause federal tax rates are around 30 percent, and the mean value of a law degree is $1,000,000, the benefit to the federal government's budget is on average $300,000 per law student. In addition, student loans to law students are profitable because of low default rates relative to other degree programs, high interest rates on loans to graduate students, and high recovery rates on defaulted loans. Default rates on loans to law students were low both before and after the availability of programs such as Income Based Repayment.\n\nMcIntyre and Simkovic report that the expected value of a law degree is different depending on college major, economic conditions at graduation, and race.\n\nIn 2011, several law schools were sued by plaintiffs who alleged fraud and misleading job placement statistics. Most of these suits have been dismissed on the merits. In December 2016, students of the for-profit Charlotte Law School filed a class action lawsuit against the school, alleging among other things that Charlotte had failed to inform them that it was at risk of losing its access to federal student loans.\n"}

{"id": "2567188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2567188", "title": "Reflective practice", "text": "Reflective practice\n\nReflective practice is the ability to reflect on one's actions so as to engage in a process of continuous learning. According to one definition it involves \"paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight\". A key rationale for reflective practice is that experience alone does not necessarily lead to learning; deliberate reflection on experience is essential.\n\nReflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal learning or knowledge transfer. It may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice; through reflection a person is able to see and label forms of thought and theory within the context of his or her work. A person who reflects throughout his or her practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to his or her existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding.\n\nDonald Schön's 1983 book \"The Reflective Practitioner\" introduced concepts such as \"reflection-on-action\" and \"reflection-in-action\" which explain how professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of improvisation that is improved through practice. However, the concepts underlying reflective practice are much older. Earlier in the 20th century, John Dewey was among the first to write about reflective practice with his exploration of experience, interaction and reflection. Soon thereafter, other researchers such as Kurt Lewin and Jean Piaget were developing relevant theories of human learning and development. Some scholars have claimed to find precursors of reflective practice in ancient texts such as Buddhist teachings and the \"Meditations\" of Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius.\n\nCentral to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of lessons learned from experience. Since the 1970s, there has been a growing literature and focus around experiential learning and the development and application of reflective practice.\n\nAs adult education professor David Boud and his colleagues explained: \"Reflection is an important human activity in which people recapture their experience, think about it, mull it over and evaluate it. It is this working with experience that is important in learning.\" When a person is experiencing something, he or she may be implicitly learning; however, it can be difficult to put emotions, events, and thoughts into a coherent sequence of events. When a person rethinks or retells events, it is possible to categorize events, emotions, ideas, etc., and to compare the intended purpose of a past action with the results of the action. Stepping back from the action permits critical reflection on a sequence of events.\n\nThe emergence in more recent years of blogging has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age.\n\nMany models of reflective practice have been created to guide reasoning about action.\n\nTerry Borton's 1970 book \"Reach, Touch, and Teach\" popularized a simple learning cycle inspired by Gestalt therapy composed of three questions which ask the practitioner: \"What\", \"So what\", and \"Now what\"? Through this analysis, a description of a situation is given which then leads into the scrutiny of the situation and the construction of knowledge that has been learnt through the experience. Subsequently, practitioners reflect on ways in which they can personally improve and the consequences of their response to the experience. Borton's model was later adapted by practitioners outside the field of education, such as the field of nursing and the helping professions.\n\nLearning theorist David A. Kolb was highly influenced by the earlier research conducted by John Dewey and Jean Piaget. Kolb's reflective model highlights the concept of experiential learning and is centered on the transformation of information into knowledge. This takes place after a situation has occurred, and entails a practitioner reflecting on the experience, gaining a general understanding of the concepts encountered during the experience, and then testing these general understandings in a new situation. In this way, the knowledge that is formed from a situation is continuously applied and reapplied, building on a practitioner's prior experiences and knowledge.\n\nManagement researchers Chris Argyris and Donald Schön pioneered the idea of \"single-loop learning\" and \"double-loop learning\" in 1978. Their theory was built around the recognition and correction of a perceived fault or error. Single-loop learning is when a practitioner or organisation, even after an error has occurred and a correction is made, continues to rely on current strategies, techniques or policies when a situation again comes to light. Double-loop learning involves the modification of objectives, strategies or policies so that when a similar situation arises a new framing system is employed.\n\nSchön claimed to derive the notions of \"reflection-on-action, reflection-in-action, responding to problematic situations, problem framing, problem solving, and the priority of practical knowledge over abstract theory\" from the writings of John Dewey, although education professor Harvey Shapiro has argued that Dewey's writings offer \"more expansive, more integrated notions of professional growth\" than do Schön's.\n\nSchon advocated 2 types of reflective practice. Firstly, reflection-on-action, which involves reflecting on an experience that you have already had, or an action that you have already taken, and considering what could have been done differently, as well as looking at the positives from that interaction. The other type of reflection Schon notes is reflection-in-action, or reflecting on your actions as you are doing them, and considering issues like best practice throughout the process.\n\nFor Schön, professional growth really begins when a person starts to view things with a critical lens, by doubting his or her actions. Doubt brings about a way of thinking that questions and frames situations as \"problems\". Through careful planning and systematic elimination of other possible problems, doubt is settled, and people are able to affirm their knowledge of the situation. Then people are able to think about possible situations and their outcomes, and deliberate about whether they carried out the right actions.\n\nLearning researcher Graham Gibbs discussed the use of structured debriefing to facilitate the reflection involved in Kolb's experiential learning cycle. Gibbs presents the stages of a full structured debriefing as follows:\n\nGibbs' suggestions are often cited as \"Gibbs' reflective cycle\" or \"Gibbs' model of reflection\", and simplified into the following six distinct stages to assist in structuring reflection on learning experiences:\n\nProfessor of nursing Christopher Johns designed a structured mode of reflection that provides a practitioner with a guide to gain greater understanding of his or her practice. It is designed to be carried out through the act of sharing with a colleague or mentor, which enables the experience to become learnt knowledge at a faster rate than reflection alone.\n\nJohns highlights the importance of experienced knowledge and the ability of a practitioner to access, understand and put into practice information that has been acquired through empirical means. Reflection occurs though \"looking in\" on one's thoughts and emotions and \"looking out\" at the situation experienced. Johns draws on the work of Barbara Carper to expand on the notion of \"looking out\" at a situation. Five patterns of knowing are incorporated into the guided reflection: the aesthetic, personal, ethical, empirical and reflexive aspects of the situation. Johns' model is comprehensive and allows for reflection that touches on many important elements.\n\nAdult education scholar Stephen Brookfield proposed that critically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complementary lenses: the lens of their autobiography as learners of reflective practice, the lens of other learners' eyes, the lens of colleagues' experiences, and the lens of theoretical, philosophical and research literature. Reviewing practice through these lenses makes us more aware of the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings. It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions—assumptions that we think are in our own best interests, but actually work against us in the long run. Brookfield argued that these four lenses will reflect back to us starkly different pictures of who we are and what we do.\n\nReflective practice has been described as an unstructured or semi-structured approach directing learning, and a self-regulated process commonly used in health and teaching professions, though applicable to all professions. Reflective practice is a learning process taught to professionals from a variety of disciplines, with the aim of enhancing abilities to communicate and making informed and balanced decisions. Professional associations such as the American Association of Nurse Practitioners are recognizing the importance of reflective practice and require practitioners to prepare reflective portfolios as a requirement to be licensed, and for yearly quality assurance purposes.\n\nThe concept of reflective practice has found wide application in the field of education, for learners, teachers and those who teach teachers. Hadiya Habib(2017) assert that there is one quality above all that makes a good teacher -the ability to reflect on what, why and how we do things and to adopt and develop our practice within lifelong learning. Reflection is the key to successful learning for teachers and for learners.\n\nStudents can benefit from engaging in reflective practice as it can foster the critical thinking and decision making necessary for continuous learning and improvement. When students are engaged in reflection, they are thinking about how their work meets established criteria; they analyze the effectiveness of their efforts, and plan for improvement. Rolheiser and et al. (2000) assert that \"Reflection is linked to elements that are fundamental to meaningful learning and cognitive development: the development of metacognition – the capacity for students to improve their ability to think about their thinking; the ability to self-evaluate - the capacity for students to judge the quality of their work based on evidence and explicit criteria for the purpose of doing better work; the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making; and the enhancement of teacher understanding of the learner.\" (p 31-32)\n\nWhen teachers teach metacognitive skills, it promotes student self-monitoring and self-regulation that can lead to intellectual growth, increase academic achievement, and support transfer of skills so that students are able to use any strategy at any time and for any purpose. Guiding students in the habits of reflection requires teachers to approach their role as that of \"facilitator of meaning-making\" – they organize instruction and classroom practice so that students are the producers, not just the consumers, of knowledge. Rolheiser and colleagues (2000) state that \"When students develop their capacity to understand their own thinking processes, they are better equipped to employ the necessary cognitive skills to complete a task or achieve a goal. Students who have acquired metacognitive skills are better able to compensate for both low ability and insufficient information.\" (p. 34)\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Education (2007) describes many ways in which educators can help students acquire the skills required for effective reflection and self-assessment, including: modelling and/or intentionally teaching critical thinking skills necessary for reflection and self-assessment practices; addressing students' perceptions of self-assessment; engaging in discussion and dialogue about why self-assessment is important; allowing time to learn self-assessment and reflection skills; providing many opportunities to practice different aspects of the self-assessment and reflection process; and ensuring that parents/guardians understand that self-assessment is only one of a variety of assessment strategies that is utilized for student learning.\n\nThe concept of reflective practice is now widely employed in the field of teacher education and teacher professional development and many programmes of initial teacher education claim to espouse it. In education, a minimalist understanding of reflective practice is that it refers to the process of the educator studying his or her own teaching methods and determining what works best for the students and the consideration of the ethical consequences of classroom procedures on students; a broader understanding would accept that it also involves questioning the organisational, social and political context in which the teaching takes place. Education professor Hope Hartman has described reflective practice in education as teacher metacognition.\n\nThere is broad consensus that teaching effectively requires a reflective approach. However, reflective practice \"is a term that carries diverse meaning\" and about which there is not complete consensus. Teaching and learning are complex processes, and there is not one right approach. Reflecting on different approaches to teaching, and reshaping the understanding of past and current experiences, can lead to improvement in teaching practices. Schön's reflection-in-action can help teachers explicitly incorporate into their decision-making the professional knowledge that they gain from their experience in the classroom.\n\nAs professor of education Barbara Larrivee argues, reflective practice moves teachers from their knowledge base of distinct skills to a stage in their careers where they are able to modify their skills to suit specific contexts and situations, and eventually to invent new strategies. In implementing a process of reflective practice teachers will be able to move themselves, and their schools, beyond existing theories in practice. Larrivee concludes that teachers should \"resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become a reflective practitioner, continuously engaging in a critical reflection, consequently remaining fluid in the dynamic environment of the classroom\".\n\nVideo recordings of classroom activities have been used to help trainee teachers / education interns develop more detailed reflective practice.\n\nAccording to physiotherapists Colin Paterson and Judith Chapman, reflection or learning from experience is key to staying accountable, and maintaining and developing aptitude throughout a teacher's practice. Without reflection, teachers are not able to look objectively at their actions or take into account the emotions, experience, or consequences of actions to improve their practice. It is argued that, through the process of reflection, teachers are held accountable to the standards of practice for teaching, such as those in Ontario: commitment to students and student learning, professional knowledge, professional practice, leadership in learning communities, and ongoing professional learning. Through reflective practice, teachers look back on their practice and reflect on how they have supported students by treating them \"equitably and with respect and are sensitive to factors that influence individual student learning\". By doing this, teachers ask themselves: \"Have I to the best of my abilities supported student learning, and provided all of my students with an entry point into learning?\" Through reflection, and sharing their reflection, teachers show strong leadership because they show that they are willing to learn from their mistakes and improve their practice for everyone affected by it.\n\nFor students to acquire necessary skills in reflection, their teachers need to be able to teach and model reflective practice (see above); similarly, teachers themselves need to have been taught reflective practice during their initial teacher education, and to continue to develop their reflective skills throughout their career.\n\nHowever, Mary Ryan has noted that students are often asked to \"reflect\" without being taught how to do so, or without being taught that different types of reflection are possible; they may not even receive a clear definition or rationale for reflective practice. Many new teachers do not know how to transfer the reflection strategies they learned in college to their classroom teaching.\n\nSome writers have advocated that reflective practice needs to be taught explicitly to student teachers because it is not an intuitive act; it is not enough for teacher educators to provide student teachers with \"opportunities\" to reflect: they must explicitly \"teach reflection and types of reflection\" and \"need explicitly to facilitate the process of reflection and make transparent the metacognitive process it entails\". Larrivee notes that (student) teachers require \"carefully constructed guidance\" and \"multifaceted and strategically constructed interventions\" if they are to reflect effectively on their practice.\n\nRod Lane and colleageues list strategies by which teacher educators can promote a habit of reflective practice in pre-service teachers, such as discussions of a teaching situation, reflective interviews or essays about one's teaching experiences, action research, or journaling or blogging.\n\nNeville Hatton and David Smith, in a brief literature review, conclude that teacher education programmes do use a wide range of strategies with the aim of encouraging students teachers to reflect (e.g. action research, case studies, video-recording or supervised practicum experiences), but that \"there is little research evidence to show that this [aim] is actually being achieved\".\n\nThe implication of all this is that teacher educators must also be highly skilled in reflective practice. Andrea Gelfuso and Danielle Dennis, in a report on a formative experiment with student teachers, suggest that teaching how to reflect requires teacher educators to possess and deploy specific competences. However, Janet Dyment and Timothy O'Connell, in a small-scale study of experienced teacher educators, noted that the teacher educators they studied had received no training in using reflection themselves, and that they in turn did not give such training to their students; all parties were expected to know how to reflect.\n\nMany writers advocate for teacher educators themselves to act as models of reflective practice. This implies that the way that teacher educators teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; teacher educators should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that teacher educators need to be aware of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory. However, some teacher educators do not always \"teach as they preach\"; they base their teaching decisions on \"common sense\" more than on public theory and struggle with modelling reflective practice.\n\nTom Russell, in a reflective article looking back on 35 years as teacher educator, concurs that teacher educators rarely model reflective practice, fail to link reflection clearly and directly to professional learning, and rarely explain what they mean by reflection, with the result that student teachers may complete their initial teacher education with \"a muddled and negative view of what reflection is and how it might contribute to their professional learning\". For Russell, these problems result from the fact that teacher educators have not sufficiently explored how theories of reflective practice relate to their own teaching, and so have not made the necessary \"paradigmatic changes\" which they expect their students to make.\n\nReflective practice is viewed as an important strategy for health professionals who embrace lifelong learning. Due to the ever-changing context of healthcare and the continual growth of medical knowledge, there is a high level of demand on healthcare professionals' expertise. Due to this complex and continually changing environment, healthcare professionals could benefit from a program of reflective practice.\n\nAdrienne Price explained that there are several reasons why a healthcare practitioner would engage in reflective practice: to further understand one's motives, perceptions, attitudes, values, and feelings associated with client care; to provide a fresh outlook to practice situations and to challenge existing thoughts, feelings, and actions; and to explore how the practice situation may be approached differently. In the field of nursing there is concern that actions may run the risk of habitualisation, thus dehumanising patients and their needs. In using reflective practice, nurses are able to plan their actions and consciously monitor the action to ensure it is beneficial to their patient.\n\nThe act of reflection is seen as a way of promoting the development of autonomous, qualified and self-directed professionals, as well as a way of developing more effective healthcare teams. Engaging in reflective practice is associated with improved quality of care, stimulating personal and professional growth and closing the gap between theory and practice. Medical practitioners can combine reflective practice with checklists (when appropriate) to reduce diagnostic error.\n\nActivities to promote reflection are now being incorporated into undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education across a variety of health professions. Professor of medical education Karen Mann and her colleagues found through a 2009 literature review that in practising professionals the process of reflection appears to include a number of different aspects, and practicing professionals vary in their tendency and ability to reflect. They noted that the evidence to support curricular interventions and innovations promoting reflective practice remains largely theoretical.\n\nSamantha Davies identified benefits as well as limitations to reflective practice:\n\nBenefits to reflective practice include:\n\nLimitations to reflective practice include:\n\nThe use of reflective practice in environmental management, combined with system monitoring, is often called \"adaptive management\". There is some criticism that traditional environmental management, which simply focuses on the problem at hand, fails to integrate into the decision making the wider systems within which an environment is situated. While research and science must inform the process of environmental management, it is up to the practitioner to integrate those results within these wider systems. In order to deal with this and to reaffirm the utility of environmental management, Bryant and Wilson propose that a \"more reflective approach is required that seeks to rethink the basic premises of environmental management as a process\". This style of approach has been found to be successful in sustainable development projects where participants appreciated and enjoyed the educational aspect of utilising reflective practice throughout. However, the authors noted the challenges with melding the \"circularity\" of reflective practice theory with the \"doing\" of sustainability.\n\nReflective practice provides a development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made.\n\nReflective learning organizations have invested in coaching programs for their emerging and established leaders. Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over-reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding. Coaching can help support the establishment of new behaviours, as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life, as well as habits of mind that define their world. Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined habits of mind. The goal is for leaders to maximize their professional potential, and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions.\n\nReflective practice can help any individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider new ways to interact with their colleagues. David Somerville and June Keeling suggested eight simple ways that professionals can practice more reflectively:\n\n"}

{"id": "50080189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50080189", "title": "School organizational models", "text": "School organizational models\n\nSchool organizational models are methods of structuring the curriculum, functions, and facilities for schools, colleges, and universities. The organizing of teaching and learning has been structured since the first educational institutions were established. With greater specialization and expertise in a particular field of knowledge, and a gathering of like-minded individuals, instructors clustered into specialized groups, schools, and eventually departments within larger institutions. This structure spread rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries with factory model schools and their \"assembly-line\" method of standardized curriculum and instructional methods. Beginning with the progressive educational movement in the early-mid 20th century, and again with similar trends in the late 20th and early 21st century, alternative models structured towards deeper learning, higher retention, and 21st century skills developed. The organizational models of schools fall into several main categories, including: departmental, integrative, project-based, academy, small learning communities, and school-within-a-school.\n\nThe departmental model is an organization where the departments and faculties of different academic subjects are separate and distinct. Each department (e.g. Math, Humanities, Science) may also have its own head (or manager or dean) that is responsible for different aspects of the department. Educators in that department may report to that head who in turn reports to a higher level administration, such as a school or college in a university, or directly to the main administration, such as the principal or head of a school. Educational institutions using the departmental model often provide traditional education. This is a traditional form of organization with an emphasis on traditional classroom forms and organizations that has been the dominant organizing model of high or secondary schools, colleges, and universities since the late 19th and early 20th century. This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with separate faculty buildings on a campus, or in a wing or cluster of standard classrooms or laboratories in a high school (e.g. science labs, vocational shops).\n\nThe integrative model is an interdisciplinary organization that combines, rather than separates, academic subjects, faculties, and disciplines. A departmental structure may be in place for each field or discipline, but the physical organization of the educational facilities may place different subject-based classrooms or labs in groupings, such as in a defined area, wing, or small learning community. For example, each grouping may contain co-located classrooms with different instructors focusing on math, English, and Social Sciences near to a Science lab, Makerspace, or Vocational shop. Support spaces for instructors, such as offices or workrooms, and for students, such as seminar rooms and common workspaces, may also be located directly adjacent or nearby. \n\nThe project-based learning model is a model that supports students \"learning by doing.\" It may or not be fully interdisciplinary in its organization of subjects. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom-based instruction, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class, with an emphasis on student collaboration and hands-on work. It involves independent research, real-world experiences, opportunities and requirements for students to present and defend their learning, to practice and rehearse. Student projects are at the core of their learning. This is reflected in the design of educational facilities appearing similar to the integrative model, but with a de-emphasis on traditional instructional spaces such as classrooms and labs, and a greater emphasis on student collaboration spaces and workspaces, such as individual study and group seminar rooms, and workspaces such as Makerspaces and rooms with 2D or 3D printing and production. The design is student-centered, meaning it is to support the project work, not primarily the convenience of the teachers (e.g. classrooms). A noted example of this model is High Tech High. \n\nThe Academy model is an organization that includes specific themes or grades-based organizational groupings within a single institution. These are sometimes referred to as \"Career Academies\" or \"Career Pathways\". The school may be organized along largely departmental or integrated models, with specially courses geared towards the theme or focus of each academy provided within each academy and the students be enrolled and following their academy's prescribed course of study as they take courses in different departments. Alternatively, the school may be organized with each academy providing its own core and specialty themed courses. This can be reflected in the design of educational facilities in several ways: a departmental-type configuration with specialty spaces located in separate areas, or along a single common area with each academy's themed spaces adjacent and observables by students in other academies; or in a similar manner to a SLC or school-within-a-school, with each academy co-located with their specialty space. For example, a justice-themed academy may have a fully functioning country courtroom off of the commons, such as along the \"Main Street\" in the Jack E. Singley Academy. In England, \"Academy\" normally refers to an entire institution offering a distinct program or theme, not a separate division within.\n\nThe Small Learning Community (SLC) model is an organization geared towards providing a more personalized learning environment. A cohort of students and instructors may stay within a given SLC from grade to grade. Teachers in the SLC usually have common planning time to foster collaboration, development of interdisciplinary projects, and to track progress of individual students across subjects. These include several types, including: Theme-Based SLCs or Focus Schools, usually formed around a specific curricular theme, such as \"Success Academy\" or \"Humanities\"; grade-based SLCs or Houses, such as Freshman Academies which are structured to support students transitioning into higher-level schools; Career Academies, developed around a career theme or Career Clusters; Magnet Schools, career-themed SLCs that include accelerated course-work for Gifted & Talented students. This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with SLCs designed into separate clusters or groupings, often with a central common or flexible learning area at its heart of the cluster, with a variety of learning and group meeting rooms opening onto it, including several classrooms or learning studios, a science lab, and potentially a makerspace or vocational shop. A school would have multiple SLCs, often with between 100 and 200 students.\n\nThe school-within-a-school model is similar to the Small Learning Communities model of personalization for both students and schools, but with additional administrative and support functions located within each school or \"community\". Each school has both multiple disciplines as well as separate administrators, either fully stand-alone or as subordinate to a whole-school administration or principal. This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with a larger school building, or a campus, with separate identities, entries, and often names for each small school. An example of this model is the Marysville Getchell Campus with separate buildings for each of the three small schools as well as a common a shared facility for the physicals.education, cafeteria, and services functions not as easily supported by smaller schools.\n\n\n"}

It was devised by Robert Slavin and his associates at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSTAD is considered as one of the most researched, simplest and straightforward of all the cooperative learning. It was established based on the fulfillment of instructional pedagogy. It is used in meeting well-defined instructional objectives. It is a learning strategy in which there are small group of learners with different levels of abilities, wherein they all come together to accomplish a shared learning goal.\n\nThe students are placed in small groups or teams. The class in its entirety is presented with a lesson and students are subsequently tested. Individuals are graded on the team's performance . Although the tests are taken individually, students are encouraged to work together to improve the overall performance of the group. It is basically a team work, but students are graded individually according to their contribution that they make towards their team. Usually in STAD students are assigned 4 to 5 members in a group that are mixed in performance level, gender and ethnicity. The teacher teaches a lesson to the students and they then work in teams and ensure that they have mastered the lesson. Then finally students take individual quizzes on the material, at which they may not help each other. Then their scores are compared to their own past averages and points are awarded on the basis of the degree to which students meet or exceed their own earlier performance. It encourages the students to take up responsibility for other members in their group as well as themselves.Thus in this way it is guaranteed that all group members with different levels are equally motivated to do their best. \nSlavin (1995) enumerated three main concepts of STAD as team rewards, individual accountability and for equal opportunities for success . Team rewards are certificates or either rewards which are given if a STAD group achieves higher than predetermined level . In this way a spirit of positive competition is reinforced and all or none of the groups would be rewarded based on how they score. In terms of individual accountability, the individual learning of each of the group members determines the success of the terms.\nSTAD has been used in a wide variety of subjects from mathematics to language, arts to social science and used from 2nd grade in schools through college. It is the most appropriate for teaching well defined objectives by incorporating more open-ended assessments, such as essays or performance.\n\nIn STAD, students are assigned to 4 or 5-member heterogeneous groups. Once these assignments are made, a four-step cycle is initiated: (i) teach, (ii) team study, (iii) test and (iv) recognition.\n\nIn the teaching stage, the teacher presents materials usually in a lecture-discussion format. Students should be told what it is they are going to learn and why it is important.\n\nIn the team study stage, group members work cooperatively with teacher-provided worksheets and answer sheets.\n\nIn the testing stage, each student individually takes a quiz. The teacher grades the quiz and notes the current scores as well as the improvement over previous quizzes.\n\nEach team receives recognition awards depending on the average scores of each team. For example, teams that average 15 to 19 improvement points receive a GOOD TEAM certificate, teams that average 20 to 24 improvement points receive a GREAT TEAM certificate, and teams that average 25 to 30 improvement points receive a SUPER TEAM certificate.\n\n Class presentation\n\n Group has greater information resources than individuals do\n\n An individual group member may dominate the discussion.\n"}

This concern led to the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals (CVCP) setting up an ad hoc committee in 1957 to review the matter; this committee in its Third Report of January 1961 recommended the setting up of a central agency, which subsequently became known as UCCA. Its First and Second Reports had already made a number of recommendations aimed at harmonising admissions procedures across different universities.\n\nThe name UCCA referred originally to the management board (the Central Council) overseeing the new process, but soon came to refer to the organisation responsible for its day-to-day operation. This was based initially in London, and moved to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1968 . The new scheme had a pilot year handling a subset of applications for entry in 1963, and its first full year of operation handled admissions for 1964.\n\nThe scheme was essentially a collaborative venture between independent universities, and membership was voluntary. Most English universities joined from the start. Oxford and Cambridge joined (with slightly modified procedures) for the 1966 entry; the London medical and dental schools, as well as Belfast and Stirling for 1967. By 1968 the office was handling 592,000 applications from 110,400 candidates to 80 institutions.\n\nInitially, processing of applications was carried out using punched card technology. In 1964, UCCA started using the services of a computer bureau with a Univac machine; in 1967 it installed its own Univac computer.\n\nThe actual application process remained largely unchanged during the life of the organisation, except for minor details. Candidates submitted a single application listing six (later five) universities. Copies of the application were sent to these universities (unlike UCCA's modern counterpart, UCAS), which could make various kinds of offer: unconditional, or conditional on grades achieved in the subsequent A-level examinations. Students could hold a maximum of two of these offers, a first choice, plus a reserve choice held in case they failed to achieve the grades asked by their first choice (if they received an unconditional or a pass-level offer from the university listed first on their application, no reserve could be held). In August, when the exam results were published, students who achieved their required grades (or who fell short of them, if the University had enough places available) would receive confirmation of their offer.
