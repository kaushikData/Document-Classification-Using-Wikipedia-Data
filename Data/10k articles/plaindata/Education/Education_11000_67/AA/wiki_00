The word \"maisu\" in the name of the canoe comes from the Satawalese word for breadfruit. In particular, the word refers to breadfruit that has been knocked down by storm winds and is therefore available for anyone to take. The name is said to symbolize the knowledge of navigation that is made freely available.\n\nThe concept for \"Alingano Maisu\" came about in 2001 when two Hawaiian voyaging groups, the Polynesian Voyaging Society and Na Kalai Waa Moku o Hawaii, met with Piailug. The two hulls of the vessel were fabricated by the Friends of \"Hōkūlea\" and \"Hawaiiloa\" on Oahu and shipped to the Island of Hawaii where Na Kalai Waa completed construction of the canoe. The Polynesian Voyaging Society provided much of the funding for the voyaging aspect of the project as well as an escort boat to help sail the canoe to Satawal.\n\nThe canoe is home-ported on the island of Yap under the command of Piailug's son, Sesario Sewralur.\n\nAccompanied by \"Hōkūlea\", the \"Maisu\" left Kawaihae, Hawaii on January 18, 2007. After stops in the Marshall Islands, Pohnpei, and Chuuk, the Maisu reached Satawal on March 15, 2007. On March 18, while on Satawal, five native Hawaiian navigators on the voyage were inducted into pwo, a sacred Micronesian brotherhood of master navigators.\n\n\"Hōkūlea\" and \"Maisu\" both left Satawal on March 20 and made stops in Woleai, Ulithi and Yap before reaching Palau. From there, the \"Maisu\" remained in Micronesia, returning to Yap state, while the \"Hōkūlea\" continued on to Japan.\n\nIn June 2008, Palau Community College announced that there will be a one-year program in traditional non-instrumental navigation on the \"Alingano Maisu\" under Sesario Sewralur.\n\n"}

He graduated from St Chad's College, University of Durham. Besides his television career, he acted on the stage regularly, also being a trained life coach. He lived in Manchester for a long time.\n\nBostrom had a recurrent character in \"'Allo 'Allo!\", first appearing midway through the second series and remaining until the show's finale. Officer Crabtree was played as an idiotic British undercover officer, disguised constantly as a French local police agent during the Second World War. Much of the character's humour derived from his supposed inability to pronounce French words correctly in conversation, which, on an English-language television programme, was represented by ludicrous exaggeration and mispronunciation of ordinary English words. For example, \"Good morning\" would be pronounced as \"Gid moaning\", \"I was just passing round the corner\" would be \"I was just pissing roond the corner\", and famously, \"The bombers were being chased by fighters when they dropped their bombs on the London docks\" became \"The bummers were being chased by farters when they drooped their bums on the London dicks'. Bostrom actually speaks fluent French.\n\nIn 2005, Bostrom guest-starred in \"Dead Man Walking\", an audio drama based on the television series \"Sapphire and Steel\". From December 2007 to January 2008, he continued his pantomime run when he appeared in a production as an ugly sister in \"Cinderella\" in Middlesbrough. On 8 January 2008, he appeared in an episode of \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\" on E4. He discussed events in the house after introducing the show in the familiar character of Officer Crabtree.\n\nOn 3 March 2010 he appeared as a vicar in the BBC One daytime soap opera \"doctors\" and again in \"doctors\" (17:163) on 25/01/2016 as sommelier Murray Bathurst.\n\nBostrom appeared (alongside fellow \" 'Allo 'Allo!\" alumnus Sam Kelly) in the BBC radio dramatisation of \"The Good Soldier Švejk\" by Jaroslav Hašek in November 2008, playing the part of Wendler.\n\nIn November 2012, Bostrom appeared in Hebburn (TV series) as a newspaper editor.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared in the BBC series \"Father Brown\" as Richie Queen in episode 5.12 \"The Theatre of the Invisible\"\n\nIn 2017 he appeared on Celebrity Pointless\n\n"}

It consists of a narrator talking through the presentation, describing what is happening on the screen or stage\nduring the natural pauses in the audio, and sometimes during dialogue if deemed necessary.\n\nFor the performing arts (theater, dance, opera), and media (television, movies and DVD), description is a form of audio-visual translation, using the natural pauses in dialogue or between critical sound elements to insert narrative that translates the visual image into a sense form that is accessible to millions of individuals who otherwise lack full access to television and film. Occasionally when there is dialogue that is in another language from the main one of the film and subtitled on screen, the subtitles are read in character by the describer.\n\nIn museums or visual art exhibitions, audio described tours (or universally designed tours that include description or the augmentation of existing recorded programs on audio- or videotape), are used to provide access to visitors who are blind or have low vision. Docents or tour guides can be trained to employ audio description in their presentations. Audio description of sporting events is now becoming more common, in particular at soccer stadiums.\n\nResearchers are working to show how description, through its use of varied word choice, synonyms, metaphor and simile, not only benefits children who are blind and others who have learning disabilities but can also boost literacy for all children.\n\nIn early 2009, the American Council of the Blind (ACB) established the Audio Description Project (ADP) to boost levels of description activity and disseminate information on that work throughout the United States and worldwide.\n\nWith respect to description and media, broadcast systems in Canada and the United States are transmitted digitally and access to description on the former SAP secondary audio program channel is no longer available. Ideally, it is now possible to access multiple streams of audio, e.g., Spanish translation, audio description, audio description in Spanish, etc. In the United States, affiliates in the top 25 markets and the top five-rated cable network are required to provide 50 hours of video-described programming per quarter under the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010. Descriptive Video Service (DVS) is a popular producer of audio description for shows on television.\n\nSimilarly, the limited number of DVDs available with description in North America (less than 100—as compared to over 500 in the United Kingdom and over 700 in Australia) is further complicated by the lack of an audio menu on no more than a handful of those DVDs.\n\nIn August 2009, BBC iPlayer became the first video on demand service to offer Audio Description.\n\nIn December 2015, The Wiz Live! was the first live TV program to contain audio description in the United States.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, Pornhub announced that it would launch a collection of pornographic videos with audio descriptions. The initiative is sponsored by the website's philanthropic arm Pornhub Cares.\n\nBroadcast audio description in the U.K. is delivered digital terrestrially on a separate track containing the narration only, making it possible to adjust the AD volume separately from that of the main audio track from the television programme before the receiver mixing is performed. However, on digital receivers that lack any kind of audio pre-mixing ability such as is the case with a number of digital satellite television or cable television or ATSC receivers, the AD track is provided with the narration already mixed in and has to be manually selected as either a SAP for ATSC or another language for DVB.\n\nIn movie theaters, audio description can be heard using DVS Theatrical and similar systems (including DTS-CSS and Dolby Screentalk). Users listen to the description on a wireless headset.\nIn live theaters, patrons also receive the description via a wireless device, a discreet monaural receiver. However, the description is provided live by describers located in a booth acoustically insulated from the audience, but from where they have a good view of the performance. They make their description which is fed to a small radio transmitter. It is possible to provide the facility to a theater entirely with portable equipment, delivered to the theater in two equipment cases of suitcase size.\n\nThe description of the performance can be augmented with tactile tours of the stage or costumes or both.\n\nAudio description logo can be used by equipment manufacturers i.e., television and set top box manufacturers, broadcasters, cinemas, theatres, DVD and Blu-ray disc production companies to convey that their services or products offer audio description. The logo makes it easier for people with sight loss to identify products which would be available with an additional audio description track.\n\nThis is a standard logo that has been in the UK for many years but it is now being adopted by service providers across countries to indicate that a product or service has audio description. Other countries can have different logos, such as for example Sweden where different TV channels and organizations together created a Swedish standard.\n\nThe logo is available to download in various formats and sizes, as well as horizontal or vertical versions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the United States, bursars usually exist only at the level of higher education (4-year colleges and universities) or at private secondary schools. In Australia, Great Britain, and other countries, bursars are common at lower levels of education.\n\nThe Office of the Bursar is responsible for billing of student tuition accounts. This responsibility involves sending bills and making payment plans; the ultimate goal is to bring all student accounts to a \"paid off\" status. Bursars are not necessarily involved in the financial aid process. Bursars' duties vary from one institution to another. At many institutions, bursars deal only with student finances. At other institutions, bursars also deal with some faculty finance issues. Elsewhere, they also oversee accounts receivable, or the payments that the university receives from outside organizations for which it performs services. In some institutions, all money held by the institution is the bursar's responsibility. Some Bursars (in the UK for instance) also have responsibility for payroll, investments, facilities, IT, HR, Health and Safety and oversight of admin functions at an institution.\n\nThe Bursar Statement is also known as a tuition bill or a student account bill.\n\nThe bursar often reports to a comptroller. For example, Barnard College employs an Associate Comptroller–Bursar. In other cases, the bursar has the same level as the comptroller, and both report to the director or vice president of finance. Some universities in the United States still have a Director of Student Financial Services whose role is similar to that of a bursar. The University of Pennsylvania employs an associate vice president who essentially combines the role of a bursar (using the student financial services title) and that of a registrar.\n\n\nTerry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novels contain a character called \"The Bursar\". This character, like most other faculty members of Pratchett's Unseen University, is almost always referred to by his job title.\n\nIn the \"Hamilton (musical)\" in the song \"Aaron Burr, Sir\", it is mentioned that Alexander Hamilton punched the bursar.\n\n"}

The four departments housed in the school are for art, dance, drama, and music. CTSA has undergraduate programs, masters programs, and a doctoral program in drama conducted jointly with UC San Diego.\n\nThe school was named in honor of Academy Award-winning Hollywood actress Claire Trevor (1910-2000). The school represents the largest contribution to the campus by architect William Pereira, who oversaw its construction in 1970. It features a distinctive \"modular\" design in which individual buildings are connected by an overhead network of pillar-supported canopies. In 2005, the school's landscape was redesigned by Maya Lin in a retro-futuristic style, featuring an outdoor theater, fountains, decorative LED lighting and landscaping with native grasses and wildflowers. In fall 2011, the new \"green\" Contemporary Arts Center opened in the heart of the school, a $42.35-million building equipped with state-of-the-art studios and spaces for displaying, staging, and producing art. It serves as the new anchor for the art school complex.\n\nEarly CTSA professors included Mehli Mehta (father of Zubin Mehta), choral master; Eugene Loring, dance master with James Penrod as an assistant; Frank Stella, Henry Clay, Tony DeLap and John McCracken, who were art instructors; and Robert Cohen, founding chair of the drama department.\n\nFounded under the name Studio Art, the department renamed itself in 2012. It teaches a wide range of contemporary media, including drawing, electronic art and design, new genres, painting, performance, photography, sculpture, and video and digital filmmaking. The department has around 20 full-time faculty members and accepts about 10 graduate students each year into its three-year M.F.A. program. In addition to those listed above, notable faculty members have included Bruce Nauman, Vija Celmins, David Hockney, Chris Burden, Catherine Opie, Robert Irwin, Larry Bell, Eleanor Antin, John Mason, Ed Bereal, Michael Asher, John McCracken, and Yvonne Rainer.\n\nM.F.A. in Critical and Curatorial Studies\nThe Critical & Curatorial Studies program educates graduate students to pursue a career in the field of curatorial practice, art criticism and public programming. The University Art Gallery serves as a 'laboratory' for research by Critical & Curatorial students and faculty. Critical & Curatorial students engage in a rigorous curriculum consisting of a collaboration between Visual Studies and Department of Art.\n\nThe UCI Dance department teaches ballet, modern dance, improvisation, and jazz performance and choreography, as well as courses in the history of dance, dance medicine and science, and the integration of dance with interactive technologies such as motion capture and telematics. The department has about 15 full-time faculty and accepts about 10 students a year into its two-year M.F.A. program. Notable faculty members have included the African-American choreographer Donald McKayle.\n\nRobert Cohen organized an undergraduate repertory company that took \"Oedipus Rex\" on the road to UC San Diego and UC Santa Cruz in the department's early years. Other early productions included \"The Assassination of Jean Paul Marat by the Marquis de Sade\", \"Little Mary Sunshine\", \"Night of the Iguana\" and \"Midsummer Night's Dream\". William Inge, author of such plays as \"Bus Stop, Picnic, \" and \"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs\" taught playwriting in the drama department in the 1970s. Jerzy Grotowski, acting theorist and founder of the Polish Laboratory Theater, joined the drama faculty in 1983, and conducted his Objective Drama project in the fields and barn south of the main campus. UCI graduate drama student James Slowiak was his chief assistant during the project years. Many fellow artists and students, from the UCI student body and around the world, came to Irvine to work with him and explore experimental theatrical exercises in what has come to be known as the \"Grotowski Barn.\" In addition to Cohen and Grotowski, other drama faculty notables have included Stephen Barker, Keith Fowler, G. Cameron Harvey, William Needles, C.M., Bryan Reynolds, and . Choreographer Donald McKayle was a joint member of the dance and drama faculties until his retirement.\n\nThe Music department follows a conservatory model and offers both a B.A. and a B.Mus at the undergraduate level, as well as a two-year M.F.A. degree program. Emphases at the graduate level include choral conducting,\ncollaborative piano, guitar/lute performance, instrumental and piano performance, and vocal arts. There is also a two-year master's degree in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology (ICIT). The faculty consists of composers, scholars, musicologists, music theorists, conductors, and concert and recording artists. Notable faculty include jazz pianist and composer Kei Akagi, composer and trombonist Michael Dessen, computer music expert Chris Dobrian, and Ensemble-in-Residence Trio Céleste. \n\n"}

It also examines what happens to writing when cultures come into contact with each other, situations often referred to as \"contact zones\".\n\nCultural studies arose in the 1970s and 1980s as a way of empowering otherwise disenfranchised voices: those who did not follow common or accepted political or social norms. It is a way of challenging an established power by investigating issues of \"multiculturalism, the politics of literacy, and the implications of race, class, and gender\". Within the discipline exists a variety of agendas and methods, but the fundamental idea behind cultural studies is to give voice to \"the masses\" and encourage representation of all cultures within a society.\n\nCultural studies pedagogy tends to include examinations of pop culture and media texts and rhetoric. Cultural studies is influential in the composition classroom because it enables instructors to help students write about subjects they were familiar with and to \"teach close reading and interpretation of texts...substituting popular culture or media for literary texts\"; allows for the idea that we are inundated by culture in everything we see and read, and so it is useful in the composition classroom to analyze, examine, close-read, and understand the meaning in and around the texts.\n\nCultural studies composition instructors can use a variety of genres for students to work within and between. They include:\n-- Production-based studies (emphasizes the producer; the \"political organization of the conditions of production\")\n-- Text-based studies (i.e. literary criticism)\n-- Studies of lived culture (ethnographic, historic, semiotic looks at how people are enculturated or contextualized)\n\nClassroom methods include using pop culture and media studies into composition classrooms. Often these sources tend to allow students to write about what they know and to close-read and interpret texts about culture instead of literature. It helps students contextualize their own experiences. Teachers use multicultural texts that introduce and encourage discussions of multiple literacies, the implications of power, and the \"contact zones\" where cultures overlap and potentially collide.\n\nWhen it comes to the personal essay, students from different multicultural backgrounds will bring different approaches, from the way the begin their stories to the information they choose to address. This means that workshopping the personal narrative (or, perhaps, any writing) in a classroom full of diversity can bring challenges, not just with understanding each other's words, but also with understanding meaning.\n\nCritics have debated the ethics of professors pitching their soapboxes in class. Others accuse cultural studies compositionists as teaching an ideology, not writing.\n\nOne of the directions cultural studies is taking, is for civic- and community-service-oriented composition classes.\n"}

According to Art. 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Community \nThe EU also funds educational, vocational and citizenship-building programmes which encourage EU citizens to take advantage of opportunities which the EU offers its citizens to live, study and work in other countries. The best known of these is the Erasmus programme, under which more than 3,000,000 students have taken part in inter-university exchange and mobility over the last 20 years.\nSince 2000, conscious of the importance of Education and Training for their economic and social objectives, EU Member States have begun working together to achieve specific goals in the field of Education. By sharing examples of good policy practice, by taking part in Peer Learning activities, by setting benchmarks and by tracking progress against key indicators, the 28 Member States aim to respond coherently to common challenges, whilst retaining their individual sovereignty in the field of Education policy. This strategy is referred to as the Education and Training 2020 programme (ET2020), which is an update of the Education and Training 2010 programme.\nThe European Union is also a partner in various inter-governmental projects, including the Bologna Process whose purpose is to create a European higher education area by harmonising academic degree structures and standards as well as academic quality assurance standards throughout EU Member States and in other European countries.\n\nThe European Union adopted its first education programme (the COMETT programme, designed to stimulate contacts and exchanges between universities and industry) in July 1987. This programme was rapidly followed by the ERASMUS programme, which promoted inter-university contacts and cooperation, as well as substantial student mobility (as, in 1989, did the \"Youth for Europe\" programme, the EU's first youth exchange support scheme). These programmes were adopted by the EU countries but with considerable support from the European Parliament which made budgets available even before the legal instruments had been adopted.\n\nThe European Union has two different types of instrument to increase the quality and openness of the education and training systems of the EU's Member States: a set of policy instruments through which EU countries are encouraged to develop their own education systems and to learn from each other's successes; and a substantial programme to support exchanges, networks and mutual learning between schools, universities or training centres as well as between the political authorities responsible for these areas in the different Member States.\n\nThe European Union's interest in Education policy (as opposed to Education programmes) developed after the Lisbon summit in March 2000, at which the EU's Heads of State and Government asked the Education Ministers of the EU to reflect on the \"concrete objectives\" of education systems with a view to improving them. The European Commission and the European Union's Member States worked together on a report for the Spring 2001 European Council, and in 2002 the Spring Summit approved their joint work programme showing how they proposed to take the report's recommendations forward. Since then they have published a series of \"Joint Reports\" every other year.\n\nThe Commission seeks to encourage Member States to improve the quality of their education and training systems in two main ways: through a process of setting targets and publishing the position of Member States in achieving them and by stimulating debate on subjects of common interest. This is done using the process known as the Open Method of Coordination.\n\nAs regards target setting, the Member States agreed in the Council on 5 May 2003 on five benchmarks on : early school leavers; number of graduates and decrease of gender imbalance in maths, science and technology; upper secondary education completion; low achievers in reading literacy; lifelong learning.\n\nUnder the current policy framework in Education and Policy (ET2020), the seven benchmarks require that by 2020:\n\n1 - \"Early School Leavers\" : less than 10% of school pupils should leave school before the end of compulsory schooling\n\n2 - \"Tertiary education attainment\" : at least 40% of the population aged 30–34 years should have completed tertiary education\n\n3 - \"Early childhood education and care\" : 95% of children aged 4 to the age when primary education starts should participate in early education\n\n4 - \"Low achievement in Reading, Maths and Science\" : no more than 15% of 15-year-olds should be low-achievers in reading, maths and science as measured at level 2 in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment\n\n5 - \"Employment rate of recent graduates\" : 82% of the population aged 20–34, who are no longer in education or training and have successfully completed upper secondary or tertiary education, should be employed\n\n6 - \"Adult participation in life-long learning\" : participation of the 25-64 age group in lifelong learning (i.e. formal or non-formal continuing education or training including in-company skills development) should be not less than 15% per annum\n\n7 - \"Mobility between countries\" : at least 20% of higher education graduates and 6% of 18- to 34-year-olds with an initial vocational qualification should have spent some time studying or training abroad\n\nSince 2012, progress against benchmarks and core indicators is yearly assessed in the \"Education and Training Monitor\", published every autumn by the Directorate-General for Education and Culture in replacement of the \"Progress Report\". The benchmark on \"Early school leavers\" and the benchmark on \"Tertiary education attainment\" are also Europe 2020 targets.\n\nIn addition to the measurement of progress, the Commission also publishes policy papers designed to encourage the EU's Member States to look more closely at particular areas of their education and training policy. The Commission has published such papers over many years, but until the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, few were widely followed. Since then, however, Member States have become more open to mutual exchange and learning, and a number of Commission papers have had significant impact. A recent example (late 2006) may be found in the Communication on \"Efficiency and equity in European education and training systems\". This paper was generally welcomed by Member States but it drew criticism from some (in particular Germany and Austria) who felt that it commented negatively on their education and training systems.\n\nFinally, the Commission has supported a variety of networking systems between Ministers (and Ministries) in the EU's Member States, in addition to the thrice yearly meetings of the \"Education Council\" within the EU's own institutional system. These range from biennial meetings of Ministers responsible for Vocational Education and Training (the \"Copenhagen Process\"), through regular meetings of Director Generals for Higher Education or for Vocational Education and Training to more specialised networks or \"clusters\" within the \"Education and Training 2010 programme\" in areas such as key competences, foreign language learning or the recognition of informal and non-formal qualifications.\n\nThe first European Union exchange programmes were the COMETT Programme for Industry-University links and exchanges, launched in 1987 (and discontinued in 1995); the Erasmus university exchange programme was launched in the same year. Similar programmes have been running ever since, and as from 2007 all the education and training programmes were brought together in one single programme; the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013. The Lifelong Learning programme comprises separate sub-programmes for schools; universities and higher education; vocational education and training; adult education; teaching about the EU in universities; and a 'horizontal' programme for policy development.\n\nThe schools exchange programme, named after the 15th century Czech teacher, scientist and educator John Amos Comenius, has helped over 2.5 million school students take part in joint projects across boundaries. The Erasmus programme (named after Desiderius Erasmus, the 16th century Dutch humanist and theologian), has been the icon of university exchange programmes since its launch in 1987. Some two million students have so far spent a fully accredited period of between 3 months and an academic year in another EU university under the programme, which has become a symbol of Europe in universities. The vocational education and training programme is named after the renaissance inventor and all-rounder Leonardo da Vinci. It currently helps around 75,000 young people each year to do an apprenticeship or internship in another EU country. The adult education programme, named after Pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig, the 19th century Danish theologian, poet, philosopher and thinker, helps those involved in adult education to have access to similar international experience. The sub-programme which supports teaching about Europe in higher education is named after the French politician and architect of European Unity, Jean Monnet.\n\nThe programme entered into force on 1 January 2007, and will continue until projects launched in its final year 2013 are closed - probably in 2016.\n\nThe first EU programme to promote educational exchange and cooperation between educational institutions inside the EU and those outside it was the TEMPUS programme, adopted on 7 May 1990 by the Council as part of the assistance provided by the European Community of the day to the countries breaking free of Soviet rule.\n\nThe idea behind TEMPUS was that individual universities in the European Community could contribute to the process of rebuilding free and effective university systems in partner countries; and that a bottom-up process through partnerships with individual universities in these countries would provide a counterweight to the influence of the much less trusted Ministries, few of which had by then undergone serious change since Soviet domination. The programme was an immediate success; and by 1993 the number of participating countries had grown from five at the start to eleven. The programme was subsequently enlarged to include the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union; again to include the countries of the Western Balkans; and finally to cover the Mediterranean countries.\n\nThe TEMPUS programme currently supports projects run by consortia of universities in the EU and in partner countries which aim to update curricula and teaching methods; to improve academic management (e.g., strategic development plans, systems of quality assessment and assurance); and to promote the higher education priorities of its partner countries. It also provides Individual Mobility Grants to enable individuals to travel to or from Europe in connection with these themes. The TEMPUS programme is still running, but will be renewed and revised as from 2007.\n\nTEMPUS was followed by a series of smaller programmes built more round the mobility of academics towards the EU. These included the ALFA/ALBAN programmes with Latin American universities; the Asia-Link programme; and others, sometimes time-limited. A number of these appear to have been set up as a means of development assistance rather than with the development of universities as such, an impression strengthened by the fact that they were managed by the European Commission's development assistance service EuropeAid rather than (like TEMPUS or Erasmus Mundus programme) by its Education and Culture department.\n\nFinally, in 2003 the European Union launched the Erasmus Mundus programme, a project to ensure the place of European Universities as centres of excellence across the world; to attract the best students from around the world to Europe; and to enable partnerships between European universities and those in other countries. The programme had strong support both from the Council of Ministers and from the European Parliament. The first phase of Erasmus Mundus will finish in 2008. The Commission has announced its intention to propose a further period. Europe Study Centre (ESC) has lately come up as a reputed and dependable company in Indian providing end to end services in the European overseas education field helping Indian students to avail the Erasmus Mundus benefits.\n\n\n"}

Most of her career was spent in New York.\n\nEmily Verdery was born in Belair, near Augusta, Georgia. She married a physician, George Magruder Battey, who died in 1856. \n\nIt was shortly after the Civil War that Battey began writing for several Georgia newspapers and became a traveling correspondent for the \"Ladies Home Gazette\", which was edited by her brother-in-law. Around 1870, she moved to New York, where she did editorial work and wrote for a range of periodicals, including the \"Morning Telegraph\", the \"New York Star\", the \"New York Herald\", and \"Harper's Magazine\". \"Harper's\", for example, published a story she wrote that required her to climb around among the steeples of New York's churches.\n\nThe \"New York Sun\" in particular often printed special articles and editorials by Battey. The \"Sun\"'s editor, Charles Anderson Dana, thought highly of her, and in 1875 he offered her a salaried staff position at his paper. Battey took the position and remained at the \"Sun\" until 1890. One of the earliest salaried women reporters in the United States, she wrote on women's rights, general news, fashion, and religion. She was referred to as the \"female Nestor of the New York Press\", and in her day she was called one of the top women writers from Georgia, along with Mary Edwards Bryan.\n\nDuring her 15 years at the \"Sun\", she also wrote under various pen names for other newspapers around the country as well as for several syndicates. Through her work at the \"Sun\", she became very knowledgeable about the history of women's organizations, the temperance movement, and other aspects of the social and political history of American women in the 19th century. She later spoke about her experiences in journalism in a lecture entitled \"The Woman's Century\". \n\nAround 1891, her health broke down and she had to give up her newspaper work. She opened a journalism school in New York, but continuing health issue made her decide to move back to the South to convalesce, bringing the school with her to Atlanta, Georgia. By 1892, her school had several students. While she held that the best place to train reporters was in a newspaper room, she felt that through a journalism school she could teach the basics, including the ability to recognize what makes a good news story.\n\nShe died in 1912 and is buried in Decatur Cemetery. Some correspondence related to Battey and her husband forms part of the Robert Battey papers at Emory University. Robert Battey was George Magruder Battey's nephew and ward.\n"}

He graduated in architecture from the Porto School of Fine Arts (which later became the school of architecture of the University of Porto) in 1952. Having sat the examination in Fine Composition for Professor of Architecture, he was later invited to become a Professor at the school. Participating in several Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) and Team 10 meetings, he became a key person in the modernization of the Porto School. Two of his former students, Álvaro Siza (who also worked in his architecture office) and Eduardo Souto de Moura, have been awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize.\n\nLater on, Távora became \"President of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Porto\" and university professor at the same faculty, as well as professor of the Department of Architecture at the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra. He took part in the late 1950s \"Survey on Portuguese Architecture\" and was the author of several essays, namely \"O Problema da Casa Portuguesa\" (Lisbon, 1947) and \"Da Organização do Espaço\" (Porto, 1962 and 1982). One of his most important works in the 1980s was the renovation and extension of the Pousada de Guimarães, a former convent which at the time was transformed into the Sta. Marinha Historic Hotel.\n\nBesides his academic career, Távora worked as an architect for Porto Town Council, consultant to Vila Nova de Gaia Town Council, consultant in the \"Commissariat on the Urban Renovation of the Ribeira/Barredo\" (Porto) project, consultant in the \"Technical Bureau of the Northern Planning Commission\", and consultant in the \"Local Technical Bureau of Guimarães Town Council\".\n\n\nTávora's work was exhibited at exhibitions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, Washington; \"Artes Plásticas I and II\" at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon; \"Eleven Architects from Oporto\", Lisbon; \"Architectures à Porto\", Clemont Ferrand; Europália 1991, Brussels; and the Venice Biennial.

GoldieBlox launched in 2012 and went from a prototype on Kickstarter to more than $1m of pre-orders placed in under a month. In just under two years, GoldieBlox has made its way to Toys \"R\" Us, Amazon, and more than 6,000 retailers worldwide, including Canada, Australia, and the UK. The company was founded by Debbie Sterling, a Stanford engineering graduate and entrepreneur, and is based in Oakland, CA. GoldieBlox pairs a construction kit with a storybook. \nWhile Sterling was a student at Stanford, she noticed her classes were predominantly male. This ratio was indicative of a larger gender gap; while she was at Stanford, the percentage of women in engineering in the United States was only 11% After research, Sterling found that girls begin to lose interest in math and science as young as age 8. She set out to create a solution, but knew that creating a pink construction toy wasn’t enough. She spent two years studying early child development, specifically in girls and the gender marketing of toys, and learned that girls excel in verbal skills, reading and writing. The breakthrough of GoldieBlox marries the story of Goldie, a girl inventor who loves to build, with a construction kit.\n\nTo fund her first round of production, Sterling created a Kickstarter campaign in 2012. The project reached its funding goal of $150,000 in 4 days, and went on to raise a total of $285,881 with 5,519 backers by the end of the campaign. In just under two years, GoldieBlox has made its way to Toys “R” Us, Amazon, and more than 1,000 retailers nationwide and in Canada, the U.K. and Australia.\n\nGeared toward ages (4-12), toys in the GoldieBlox series introduce engineering concepts to girls through storytelling and building. Each toy introduces new characters and concepts, and there are currently six sets in the series.\n\nIn 2014, GoldieBlox also began introducing digital content. The company’s first mobile app, GoldieBlox and the Movie Machine, was introduced in October 2014. The app features the company’s first-ever animated cartoon, and was named by Apple as one of the Best Apps of 2014. Bloxtown.com, GoldieBlox’s digital playground, houses original content and videos of new design ideas for kids to watch and build at home.\n\nGoldieBlox’s “Princess Machine” video launched on YouTube in November 2013, garnering over 8 million views in 4 days. The video features three young girls building a Rube Goldberg machine built by Brett Doar, and was set to a parody tune of the Beastie Boys song \"Girls\". Shortly after the release, the Beastie Boys reached out to GoldieBlox, inquiring about the use of their song without their permission. Goldieblox responded by suing for declaratory judgment in U.S. District Court of San Francisco seeking declaration of fair use due to parody. GoldieBlox claimed fair use on the grounds that they had \"created its parody video specifically to comment on the Beastie Boys song, and to further the company's goal to break down gender stereotypes and to encourage young girls to engage in their intellect.\" The Beastie Boys responded with an open letter, in which they lauded \"the creativity and message behind the ad,\" voiced their support for GoldieBlox's mission, but ultimately declared that the band did not permit their \"music and/or name to be used in product ads,\" a claim which was further bolstered by a stipulation in deceased band member Adam Yauch's will. The Beastie Boys concluded their letter by stating, \"when we tried to simply ask how and why our song 'Girls' had been used in your ad without our permission, YOU sued US.\" GoldieBlox responded positively by taking down the video and writing their own open letter (which has since been taken down) stating that, \"although we believe our parody video falls under fair use, we would like to respect [Yauch's] wishes and yours.\" Regardless, the Beastie Boys went ahead with the counter lawsuit and a settlement was ultimately reached. The settlement granted GoldieBlox a retroactive license for the song, in exchange GoldieBlox \"agreed to make annual payments of 1% of its gross revenue, until the total payments reached $1 million, to a charitable organization chosen by the Beastie Boys and approved by GoldieBlox which supports ‘science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics education for \"girls’.\"\n\n“This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)” video launched on YouTube in April 2014. The video spotlights the difference between a young girl’s brain “on princess” vs. her brain “on engineering.” It’s an eye opener to the gender norms placed on young girls at an early age, and uses wheels, axles and engineering to highlight some statistics related to the dearth of women in engineering.\n\n“GoldieBlox vs. the Big Sister Machine” launched on YouTube in November 2014, demonstrating the need for female role models inspired by ingenuity and creativity. In the video, Big Sister prescribes her ideals of beauty and perfection to young girls. Little Sister - a girl inspired by Goldie - rebels against the mantra, breaking the girls free and leading them to a world of possibilities. The video is set to Metric's \"Help I'm Alive\" hit.\n\nGoldieBlox released their first single and animated music video, \"Lightning Strikes,\" in December 2014. The track is an original song written and performed by Emily Haines, the lead singer of Canadian rock band Metric. The video and song feature Goldie, a strong female character who comes up with a great idea and strives to accomplish it, despite whatever set-backs occur along the way. GoldieBlox and Emily created the song as a message to girls, showing them that with confidence and ingenuity they can accomplish anything.\n\nIn February 2014, GoldieBlox won Intuit’s Small Business, Big Game contest, earning a 30-second commercial spot during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVIII. The commercial airtime was valued at $4 million, and with the advertisement, GoldieBlox became the first small business to air an ad in the Super Bowl. The ad was set to a parody of the Slade/Quiet Riot song, \"Come on Feel the Noize,\" changing the words to \"Come On Bring the Toys.\" The ad depicted hundreds of little girls ditching their pink toys, while singing \"More than pink, pink, pink, we want to think,\" and that \"girls build like all the boys.\" \n"}

She later became a symbol of protest against the Nicolás Maduro government during the time of demonstrations in the country.\n\nBorn and educated in Carabobo, Carmona majored in Social Studies at Universidad Tecnológica del Centro, a local polytechnic located in Valencia's eastern satellite Alianza City, in the metropolitan capital region of the state of Carabobo in Venezuela. \n\nShe had initially participated in fashion events held in the city of Valencia, such as \"Venezuela Moda\" and \"Fashion Week Valencia\". In 2010, she was a pre-candidate for Miss Venezuela 2010, though she did not qualify to participate in the pageant. In 2013, as a 21-year-old, she entered a regional beauty contest for her native state of Carabobo, winning one of the titles and becoming crowned \"2013 Miss Turismo Carabobo\".\n\nOn 18 February 2014, Carmona participated in an anti-government demonstration. Protesters, dressed in white, planned to march down Cedeño Avenue to the Plaza de Toros. The march encountered military barricades and prevented the hundreds of demonstrators from advancing, with participants deciding to protest in the space in which they were confined. At 3:30pm, pro-government colectivos arrived on the scene and began to attack the protest with \"[b]ottles, stones and gunfire\". As shots rang out, individuals scattered into Cedeño Mall, seeking shelter from bullets.\n\nThe attack resulted in several opposition protesters injured, 8 of those injured from gunshot wounds, including Carmona, who suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head. Witnesses described that she sunk to the ground after a bullet penetrated her left occipital skull area.\n\nCarmona was then placed in the ICU. A day later on 19 February at 12:15 p.m, she died from \"significant\" brain damage due to gunshot trauma and loss of blood the following day. Dr. Carlos Rosales explained that the bullet was still in Carmona's brain and that if she had survived, she would have been blind.\n\nIn an interview with Spanish newspaper \"ABC\", Carmona's friend and fellow protester Héctor Rotunda said Carmona was shot when a group of about 50 individuals outfitted in red (and thus believed to be government supporters) approached the demonstration and fired a burst of about 10 rounds at protesters. Mourners at Carmona's funeral stated she was \"killed by government mercenaries.\" Some foreign news sources said that pro-government paramilitaries were the ones who shot and killed her. Carmona's mother has also stated that the attackers were clearly identifiable in videos as Venezuelan government supporters and that Venezuelan authorities did \"nothing\" to clarify Carmona's death.\n\nSome have blamed Francisco Ameliach for Carmona's death. Days before Carmona was killed, the governor of the state of Carabobo, Francisco Ameliach, called on Unidades de Batalla Bolívar-Chávez (\"Units of Battle Hugo Chávez\", UBCh), in a tweet, asking UBCh to launch a rapid counterattack against protesters saying that the order would come from the President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello. After Carmona's death, Venezuela's anti-government protesters placed posters in various areas of Valencia, condemning Ameliach's tweet and linked it to the killing of Carmona.\n\nThe President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, expressed his condolences to Carmona's family and to the people who loved her. He also said that it had been \"well-established\" by the government's CIPC ballistic research and witnesses that violent groups from the opposition were responsible for her death. Minister of the Interior, Miguel Rodríguez Torres, reported that the bullet that killed her came from her own ranks during the anti-government march.\n\nOnly one PSUV member, Juan Maza, was placed on parole, having to report every 15 days. However as of 18 February 2017, three years after Carmona's death, the Venezuelan has never resolved the case surrounding her death.\n\nMayor Alejandro Feo La Cruz paid tribute to those who had died during protests in Carabobo, naming an avenue \"Genesis Carmona Avenue\" and named a park after another protester, Geraldin Moreno.\n\nIn December 2014, Carmona's mother, María Eugenia Tovar, as well as her sister, Alejandra Carmona, moved to the United States seeking asylum. As of February 2017, the family has remained private, residing in the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13988", "title": "Hans-Georg Gadamer", "text": "Hans-Georg Gadamer\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer (; ; February 11, 1900 – March 13, 2002) was a German philosopher of the continental tradition, best known for his 1960 \"magnum opus\" \"Truth and Method\" (\"Wahrheit und Methode\") on hermeneutics. He was a Protestant Christian.\n\nGadamer was born in Marburg, Germany, the son of Johannes Gadamer (1867–1928), a pharmaceutical chemistry professor who later also served as the rector of the University of Marburg. He resisted his father's urging to take up the natural sciences and became more and more interested in the humanities. His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869–1904) died of diabetes while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision to not pursue scientific studies. Jean Grondin describes Gadamer as finding in his mother \"a poetic and almost religious counterpart to the iron fist of his father\". Gadamer did not serve during World War I for reasons of ill health and similarly was exempted from serving during World War II due to polio.\n\nHe grew up and studied classics and philosophy in the University of Breslau under Richard Hönigswald, but soon moved back to the University of Marburg to study with the Neo-Kantian philosophers Paul Natorp (his doctoral thesis advisor) and Nicolai Hartmann. He defended his dissertation \"The Essence of Pleasure in Plato's Dialogues\" () in 1922.\n\nShortly thereafter, Gadamer moved to Freiburg University and began studying with Martin Heidegger, who was then a promising young scholar who had not yet received a professorship. He and Heidegger became close, and when Heidegger received a position at Marburg, Gadamer followed him there, where he became one of a group of students such as Leo Strauss, Karl Löwith, and Hannah Arendt. It was Heidegger's influence that gave Gadamer's thought its distinctive cast and led him away from the earlier neo-Kantian influences of Natorp and Hartmann. Gadamer studied Aristotle both under Edmund Husserl and under Heidegger.\n\nGadamer habilitated in 1929 and spent most of the early 1930s lecturing in Marburg. Unlike Heidegger, who joined the Nazi Party in May 1933 and continued as a member until the party was dissolved following World War II, Gadamer was silent on Nazism, and he was not politically active during the Third Reich. Gadamer did not join the Nazis, and he did not serve in the army because of the polio he had contracted in 1922. He joined the National Socialist Teachers League in August 1933.\n\nIn 1933 Gadamer signed the \"Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State\".\n\nIn April 1937 he became a temporary professor at Marburg, then in 1938 he received a professorship at Leipzig University. From an SS-point of view Gadamer was classified as neither supportive nor disapproving in the \"SD-Dossiers über Philosophie-Professoren\" (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the SS-Security-Service (SD). In 1946, he was found by the American occupation forces to be untainted by Nazism and named rector of the university.\n\nThe level of Gadamer's involvement with the Nazis has been disputed in the works of Richard Wolin and Teresa Orozco. Orozco alleges, with reference to Gadamer's published works, that Gadamer had supported the Nazis more than scholars had supposed. Gadamer scholars have rejected these assertions: Jean Grondin has said that Orozco is engaged in a \"witch-hunt\" while Donatella Di Cesare said that \"the archival material on which Orozco bases her argument is actually quite negligible\". Cesare and Grondin have argued that there is no trace of antisemitism in Gadamer's work, and that Gadamer maintained friendships with Jews and provided shelter for nearly two years for the philosopher Jacob Klein in 1933 and 1934. Gadamer also reduced his contact with Heidegger during the Nazi era.\n\nThe communist DDR was no more to Gadamer's liking than the Third Reich, and he left for West Germany, accepting first a position in Goethe University Frankfurt and then the succession of Karl Jaspers in the University of Heidelberg in 1949. He remained in this position, as emeritus, until his death in 2002 at the age of 102. He was also an Editorial Advisor of the journal Dionysius. It was during this time that he completed his \"magnum opus\", \"Truth and Method\" (1960), and engaged in his famous debate with Jürgen Habermas over the possibility of transcending history and culture in order to find a truly objective position from which to critique society. The debate was inconclusive, but marked the beginning of warm relations between the two men. It was Gadamer who secured Habermas's first professorship in the University of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1968, Gadamer invited Tomonobu Imamichi for lectures at Heidelberg, but their relationship became very cool after Imamichi alleged that Heidegger had taken his concept of \"Dasein\" out of Okakura Kakuzo's concept of \"das in-der-Welt-sein\" (to be in the being in the world) expressed in \"The Book of Tea\", which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before. Imamichi and Gadamer renewed contact four years later during an international congress.\n\nIn 1981, Gadamer attempted to engage with Jacques Derrida at a conference in Paris but it proved less enlightening because the two thinkers had little in common. A last meeting between Gadamer and Derrida was held at the Stift of Heidelberg in July 2001, coordinated by Derrida's students Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. This meeting marked, in many ways, a turn in their philosophical encounter. After Gadamer's death, Derrida called their failure to find common ground one of the worst debacles of his life and expressed, in the main obituary for Gadamer, his great personal and philosophical respect. Richard J. Bernstein said that \"[a] genuine dialogue between Gadamer and Derrida has never taken place. This is a shame because there are crucial and consequential issues that arise between hermeneutics and deconstruction\".\n\nGadamer received honorary doctorates from the University of Bamberg, the University of Breslau, Boston College, Charles University in Prague, Hamilton College, the University of Leipzig, the University of Marburg (1999) the University of Ottawa, Saint Petersburg State University (2001), the University of Tübingen and University of Washington.\n\nOn February 11, 2000, the University of Heidelberg celebrated Gadamer's one hundredth birthday with a ceremony and conference. Gadamer's last academic engagement was in the summer of 2001 at an annual symposium on hermeneutics that two of Gadamer's American students had organised. On March 13, 2002, Gadamer died at Heidelberg's University Clinic at the age of 102. He is buried in the Köpfel cemetery in Ziegelhausen.\n\nGadamer's philosophical project, as explained in \"Truth and Method\", was to elaborate on the concept of \"philosophical hermeneutics\", which Heidegger initiated but never dealt with at length. Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In \"Truth and Method\", Gadamer argued that \"truth\" and \"method\" were at odds with one another. For Gadamer, \"the experience of art is exemplary in its provision of truths that are inaccessible by scientific methods, and this experience is projected to the whole domain of human sciences.\" He was critical of two approaches to the human sciences (\"Geisteswissenschaften\"). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modeled themselves on the natural sciences, which simply sought to “objectively” observe and analyze texts and art. On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approaches to the humanities, represented for instance by Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm Dilthey, who believed that meaning, as an object, could be found within a text through a particular process that allowed for a connection with the author’s thoughts that led to the creation of a text (Schleiermacher), or the situation that led to an expression of human inner life (Dilthey).\n\nHowever, Gadamer argued meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena. Hermeneutics is not a process in which an interpreter finds a particular meaning, but “a philosophical effort to account for understanding as an ontological—the ontological—process of man.” Thus, Gadamer is not giving a prescriptive method on how to understand, but rather he is working to examine how understanding, whether of texts, artwork, or experience, is possible at all. Gadamer intended \"Truth and Method\" to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): \"My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing\".\n\nAs a result of Martin Heidegger’s temporal analysis of human existence, Gadamer argued that people have a so-called historically-effected consciousness (\"wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein\"), and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. However the historical consciousness is not an object over and against our existence, but “a stream in which we move and participate, in every act of understanding.” Therefore, people do not come to any given thing without some form of preunderstanding established by this historical stream. The tradition in which an interpreter stands establishes \"prejudices\" that affect how he or she will make interpretations. For Gadamer, these prejudices are not something that hinders our ability to make interpretations, but are both integral to the reality of being, and “are the basis of our being able to understand history at all.” Gadamer criticized Enlightenment thinkers for harboring a \"prejudice against prejudices\".\n\nFor Gadamer, interpreting a text involves a fusion of horizons (\"Horizontverschmelzung\"). Both the text and the interpreter find themselves within a particular historical tradition, or “horizon.” Each horizon is expressed through the medium of language, and both text and interpreter belong to and participate in history and language. This “belongingness” to language is the common ground between interpreter and text that makes understanding possible. As an interpreter seeks to understand a text, a common horizon emerges. This fusion of horizons does not mean the interpreter now fully understands some kind of objective meaning, but is “an event in which a world opens itself to him.” The result is a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nGadamer further explains the hermeneutical experience as a dialogue. To justify this, he uses Plato’s dialogues as a model for how we are to engage with written texts. To be in conversation, one must take seriously “the truth claim of the person with whom one is conversing.” Further, each participant in the conversation relates to one another insofar as they belong to the common goal of understanding one another. Ultimately, for Gadamer, the most important dynamic of conversation as a model for the interpretation of a text is “the give-and-take of question and answer.” In other words, the interpretation of a\ngiven text will change depending on the questions the interpreter asks of the\ntext. The \"meaning\" emerges not as an object that lies in the text or in the interpreter, but rather an event that results from the interaction of the two.\n\n\"Truth and Method\" was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's Collected Works includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on Celan (entitled \"Who Am I and Who Are You?\") has been considered by many—including Heidegger and Gadamer himself—as a \"second volume\" or continuation of the argument in \"Truth and Method\".\n\nGadamer's \"Truth and Method\" has become an authoritative work in the communication ethics field, spawning several prominent ethics theories and guidelines. The most profound of these is the formulation of the dialogic coordinates, a standard set of prerequisite communication elements necessary for inciting dialogue. Adhering to Gadamer's theories regarding bias, communicators can better initiate dialogic transaction, allowing biases to merge and promote mutual understanding and learning.\n\nGadamer also added philosophical substance to the notion of human health. In \"The Enigma of Health\", Gadamer explored what it means to heal, as a patient and a provider. In this work the practice and art of medicine are thoroughly examined, as is the inevitability of any cure.\n\nIn addition to his work in hermeneutics, Gadamer is also well known for a long list of publications on Greek philosophy. Indeed, while \"Truth and Method\" became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered around studying Greek thinkers, Plato and Aristotle specifically. In the Italian introduction to \"Truth and Method\", Gadamer said that his work on Greek philosophy was \"the best and most original part\" of his career. His book \"Plato's Dialectical Ethics\" looks at the \"Philebus\" dialogue through the lens of phenomenology and the philosophy of Martin Heidegger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After a brief career in the 1940s, she returned to dance in 1973 and became a notable teacher of \"abhinaya\".\n\nShe was awarded the Padma Bhushan Award, India's third highest civilian honour in 1985, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Bharatnatyam in 1990, given by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama and Kalidas Samman (1998). She was also conferred Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna for Dance in 2011.\nBorn Kalanidhi Ganapathi in the Brahmin household of Sumitra and Ganapati, her mother was keen on getting her dance education, and this was supported by her father. Thus starting at the age of seven she trained intensively under various gurus, this included Kamakshi Ammal, daughter of Veena Dhanam, for Padams and Javalis and Manakkal Sivarajan for vocal lessons. Noted guru Kannappa Pillai, from Kanchipuram was her main teacher of \"nritta\" (dance), he was also teacher to Balasaraswati, while Chinnayya Naidu and Mylapore Gauri Ammal taught her \"Abhinaya\" (Art of expression). Later was to add a new dimension to \"abhinaya\" herself.\n\nShe made her stage-debut (Arangetram) at the age of 12 at the Senate House in Chennai, for the Madras Music Academy. While still in her teens, she gave to two notable recitals, one with Dhanamanikkam and another with Nattuvanar K. Ganesan, son of the Kandappa Pillai.\n\nShe died in February 2016.\n\nShe had a brief dance career in the 1940s, before she stepped out at the age of sixteen when her mother died and she was married into a conservative family. She returned to dance when in 1973, when noted art-patron, Y. G. Doraiswamy, who had seen her performances as a teen, asked to instruct dancer Alarmel Valli in \"abhinaya\", to which she agreed, encouraged by her sons who had by now grown up. This started the second phase of her career after a gap of 30 years at the age of 46. She also started to reeducate herself in dance, luckily her books from her my younger days had survived, she started attending dance performances and \"Arangetram\" in the city, also enrolled in a course on dance theory on Bharatanatyam by Dr. Padma Subramanium..Gradually more students started coming to her and in the coming decades she became \"the most sought after teacher for \"abhinaya\"\".\n\nIn 7 December 2003, various dance teachers and her disciples, celebrated her 75th birthday at Luz Community Hall in Chennai, it was marked by a two-day seminar on abhinaya, where in prominent gurus of Bharatanatyam participated. On the occasion, a set of 4 CDs on \"Padams\"was also released. \n\nAmongst her noted disciples are, A.Lakshmanaswamy (India), Bragha Basel (India), Subashree Narayanan (USA), Minal Prabhu (India), Priya Govind (India), Sharmila Biswas, Meenakshi Chitharanjan (\"abhinaya\"), (Russia) to name a few. She has taught numerous disciples over the years, many of whom have personalised her philosophies.\n\n\n"}

These principles, competences and models may originate from coaching organisations themselves such as the International Coach Federation in the USA or from particular coaching models or practices such as GROW.\n\nThus, the whole process behind life coaching, such as goal setting, action and strategy setting, reviewing goals and really getting coachees to focus on personal development and accomplish feats step by step is then transported into the language learning process. \n\nThe development of language coaching in the language teaching world is on the rise and more and more language teachers appear to be calling themselves language coaches. It is often difficult to distinguish between unqualified language teachers, qualified language teachers, language teachers with a specialization such as ESP (English for Specific Purposes) and now language coaches. It is also not clear if so called language coaches have any coaching qualifications or experience as life coaches. \n\nNeurolanguage Coaching \n\nIn 2012, Rachel Marie Paling from Efficient Language Coaching™ defined Neurolanguage Coaching as follows:\n\n“\"Neurolanguage Coaching™ is the efficient and fast transfer of language knowledge and skills from the Language Coach to the Language Coachee with sustainable effects facilitated by brain-based coaching and coaching principles and neuroscience\".” \n© 2012 Rachel M.

Taken together, the book and the triggered a response across the German speaking world: the annual meetings became a protected space in which lesbian churchwomen were able, for the first time, to create networks and collaborative quasi-political structures.

It is a subarea of music education.\n\nThere are many benefits that music provides for children as they continue to grow. The benefits that young children acquire through music include social skills, emotional self-regulating abilities, cognitive benefits, and physical benefits. Socially, children have the opportunity to learn how to take turns and play with others while still playing individually, for example a band of little players each playing their instrument but yet looking at the big picture of playing with a group of little friends as well. Music also allows a smooth transitioning throughout daily activities, whether it be at home or in a classroom setting children get the idea of the following activity. Allowing children to play with others, including adults or older siblings also gives them a boost of self-esteem. Also, different songs show children the different words used for emotions and body awareness, as well as extending their vocabulary in general. Additionally, by extending children’s vocabulary they can also learn of different cultural music and languages, for some the benefit to integrate home within their care-giving setting. Cognitive benefits also include learning how to count, recognizing sequencing and patterns, phonemic awareness, memorizing different songs for different experiences, and simply memorizing songs and their pace and tone. Physically, children’s all around gross and fine motor skills grow rapidly by learning how to move their body to music, moving their bodies to actions of a song, and as they grow by learning how to hold and play an instrument.\n\nMusic education for young children is offered privately through classes and music organizations or integrated into educations private and public schools. Activities and classes can start as early as prenatally or newborn and in private education, music programs are often integrated in as early as preschool. Early childhood music education in public school settings widely varies, but music programs have been established in some schools starting in kindergarten even in remote areas.\n\nMost early childhood music education is accomplished through parent or teacher guided interactive play. Prenatal activities can include singing and playing music so that it can be heard in the womb and continued on with newborns. From birth, children can listen to music and observe other children in music classes and participate in tactile and parent assisted activities. With parental assistance, infants can partake in body movement and rhythm exercises to sung songs and recorded music and through play. As these children develop independent motor skills, they progress to doing these activities on their own. Infants and toddlers are often encouraged to sing and explore rhythm through body movements and percussion instruments such as egg shakers, drums, and xylophones. As young children progress, activities can include concepts that introduce counting, solfege, and notation. Some programs then allow for young children to shift easily into more formalized dance and instrumental instruction starting at a very early age.\n\nSeveral pedagogies exist which promote specific methods of training young children in music including Orff, Kodály, Dalcroze, and the Suzuki Method are among the most widely recognized of these methods. Many of these pedagogies share commonalities such as music and rhythm development through body movements, folk songs, aural training, and belief that music literacy from an early age is beneficial. Each is known for particular characteristics, such as in Dalcroze Eurhythmics the use of lifelong body movement and expression through music and private instrumental instruction as early as age two in the Suzuki Method. institutions and teachers often use a combination of these pedagogies even if they might be affiliated with only one.\n\nStudies done on children who have had a musical background, have shown that it increases brain function as well as brain stimulation. When children are exposed to music from other countries and cultures, they are able to learn about the instrument while at the same time being educated about a different part of the world.\n\n\n"}

King) how malnutrition among young children in the Philippines impairs their academic achievements by delaying the age at which they enroll into school and causing them to learn more slowly, though not by decreasing their effort exerted at school (in terms of attendance, homework, etc.). Looking into the link between child health and maternal education, Glewwe argues based on evidence from Morocco that mothers' health knowledge, which is generally correlated with (though not necessarily caused by) their schooling, is probably the main pathway how maternal education achieves its strongly positive impact on child health and nutrition in developing countries, which consequently suggests large public health payoffs to female health education in school.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Glewwe has used randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order to investigate the impact of the quality of the supply of education, e.g. in terms of school supplies or the quality of teaching, on learning outcomes. For example, Glewwe finds (with Michael Kremer, Sylvie Moulin, and Eric Zitzewitz) that in Kenya neither the provision of textbooks nor of flipcharts was effective in raising average student scores and that generally only the best students were able to take advantages of the improvement in school supplies. This in turn raises the question of whether the emphasis of many developing countries' (strongly centralized) education systems on top-down improvements to the supply of education may be guided rather by elite bias than by a concern for broad increases in students' learning outcomes. In another RCT, Glewwe (with Michael Kremer and Nauman Ilias) finds that rewarding primary school teachers in Kenya based on students' test scores and penalizing them based on their students not attending the exam leads teachers to increase the number of test preparation sessions (but not teacher attendance or homework assignments), which then increases students' test scores and exam participation, but is ineffective in reducing dropout rates. Earlier on, having found school characteristics in Ghana to be highly correlated with student achievement, e.g. via average grade attainment, Glewwe (with Hanan Jacoby) had argued that improvements to school quality, such as repairs of classrooms, may be a cost-effective investment into education in Ghana relative to the provision of more teaching materials and better trained teachers.\n\nGlewwe's other findings include the following:\n\nFinally, taking stock of the literature on the supply of education in developing countries, Glewwe (with Michael Kremer) criticizes that, although school enrollment rates have risen rapidly in the developing world between 1960 and 2000, dropout rates remain high and learning outcomes disappointing, and thus argues that the primary policy question should be which policies most effectively improve learning, with RCTs as the preferred tool to conduct that investigation. More recently, Glewwe has emphasized (with Karthik Muralidharan) that educational spending in developing countries could be much more cost effective, as improvements to pedagogy (e.g. remedial classes for children lagging behind) as well as improvements to school governance and teacher accountability tend to be much more cost effective than mere (yet widespread) increases in \"standard\" school inputs (e.g. more books); by contrast, interventions aimed at increasing the demand for education by raising students' returns to (or decreasing households' costs of) school enrollment and effort are also generally effective in improving learning outcomes, but vary widely in terms of cost effectiveness.\n\n\n"}

He currently resides with his wife, Cathy Kramer, in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nPeter Block completed his undergraduate studies in Industrial Management at the University of Kansas in 1961 and obtained a Master's degree in Industrial Administration from Yale University in 1963. He started his career as an organizational consultant in 1963 in the information service department at Esso (today ExxonMobil). In the early 1970s Peter co-founded the consulting firm \"Block Petrella Weisbord\" with Tony Petrella and Marvin Weisbord. He is also founder of The School for Managing of the Association for Quality and Participation as well as the training company Designed Learning. \nPeter serves on the Board of Directors of Cincinnati Classical Public Radio, the Advisory Board for The Festival in the Workplace Institute as well as the Board of Elementz Hip Hop Center in Cincinnati. Together with other volunteers, Peter started \"A Small Group\", that aims to facilitate discourse towards a new community narrative as underscored by Peter's work on civic engagement. PR Newswire recently reported that Peter Block joined LivePerson Inc's Board of Directors.\n\nPeter Block is the recipient of the Organization Development Network's 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004 he received their first place Members' Choice Award in recognition of his book, \"Flawless Consulting: A Guide to Getting Your Expertise Used (1999)\" as the most influential book for Organizational Development practitioners over the past 40 years. Among other national awards, he also received the American Society for Training and Development Award for Distinguished Contributions, the Association for Quality and Participation President's Award, and he was entered into Training Magazine's HRD Hall of Fame.\n\nPeter Block's work generally focuses on alternatives to patriarchal beliefs pervasive in Western culture and his ideas proffer that cultural change can be brought about through consent and connectedness as opposed through mandate and force. Peter contends that cultural change is only possible when it is preceded by relationship and connectedness among its members. Peter is the author and co-author of several books (see Selected Bibliography below). His most recent, \"The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods (2010)\", is co-authored with John McKnight, emeritus professor of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. This book is a culmination of Peter's work on community and the cultural change needed for the creation of a more sustainable future.\n\nRegarding the changing of cultural beliefs, Peter Block argues that a \"culture of accountability\" is needed and feasible if attention is diverted away from leaders and refocused on citizens with a commitment towards the creation of a deeper sense of community and citizenship. Peter's conceptualization of community is more complex, but he generally connects the term with reality outside of systems and institutions. He also uses the term in reference to an aggregation of people or neighborhoods that have something in common. Peter builds on Robert D. Putnam's ideas around the practical importance inherent in a \"sense of community\". As Peter explains, a community’s well-being relies on the quality of the relationships and the cohesion that exists among its citizens, known as a community's \"social capital\".\n\nUltimately, Peter Block challenges communities and their leaders to transform the isolation, fear, and self-interest prevalent in Western culture into connectedness and caring for the whole by starting with accountability and generosity amongst its members. This is his notion of the \"ideal world\" where accountability is abundant, commitment is authentic, and a community consciousness is prevalent throughout the global village.\n\nPeter Block's notion of a citizen is someone accountable and committed to the well-being of the whole and a participant in a democracy, regardless of their legal status. Peter stated that a citizen is \"one who chooses to create the life, the neighborhood, the world from their own gifts and the gifts of others\". However, he points to a paradox: in the realization of citizenship today, many who have full citizenship rights wait for others to contribute to their life and yet themselves contribute little to democracy or the well-being of their community. Others without citizenship rights are major contributors to community and democracy. Nevertheless, Peter generally attributes citizenship to those functioning as full participants in a democracy.\n\nHis conceptualization of a \"consumer\" might be regarded as more contentious. In his words, \"a consumer is one who has surrendered to others the power to provide what is essential for a full and satisfied life\" and he goes as far as saying, \"Consumerism is not about shopping, but about the transformation of citizens into consumers\". Moreover, Peter believes there is a growing movement of people who believe that a full and satisfied life is obtained within their communities rather than in the market place.\n\nPeter Block conceives of \"stewardship\" as an umbrella term that encapsulates the means towards the achievement of fundamental change in the manner in which we govern institutions. His conceptualization of \"service\" is more complex. He argues that service is realized in both the \"language of service\" and the \"experience of service\". The problem however, as he argues, is that we have the language of service, but lack the experience of it. He attributes this lack to self-interest present in ourselves as well as our institutions. He believes service is only truly realized when it is \"authentic\" and when the following characteristics are present: there is a balance of power; the primary commitment is to the larger community; and there is a balanced and equitable distribution of rewards.\n\nPeter argues that these notions of stewardship and service (see aforementioned definitions) are, however, not characteristic of how organizations are currently being run. He explains that although these notions are reflective of our intentions towards governing, they are not reflective of the reality. Block is regarded as a notable supporter, with others like Margaret Wheatley, Max DePree, and James Autry, of the basic premise inherent \"servant-leadership\" implying that leaders should put the needs of followers ahead of their own needs.\n\nIn collaboration with Werner H. Erhard, Peter Block designed courses and trained clergy and grassroots leaders in transformation skills and perspectives in leadership and integrity to effect peace and reconciliation in the Northern Ireland Peace Process.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dobyns was raised in New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. He was educated at Shimer College, transferred to and graduated from Wayne State University in 1964, and received an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1967. He has worked as a reporter for the \"Detroit News\".\n\nHe has taught at various academic institutions, including Sarah Lawrence College, the Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers, the University of Iowa, Syracuse University, and Boston University.\n\nIn 1995, as a professor of English at Syracuse University, he was involved in a sexual harassment scandal. Francine Prose defended him by portraying his accuser and the school as having reacted to outdated neo-Victorian victim-feminism policies.\n\nIn much of his poetry and some works of non-genre fiction, Dobyns employs extended tropes, using the ridiculous and the absurd as vehicles to introduce more profound meditations on life, love, and art. He shies neither from the low nor from the sublime, and all in a straightforward narrative voice of reason. His journalistic training has strongly informed this voice.\n\nFor example, in the poem \"Missed Chances\" in \"Cemetery Nights\", the nameless speaker wanders through a metaphorical city in which those who missed their big opportunities futilely rehearse for opportunity's next arrival.\n\nHis poetic works count among them the 1971 Lamont Poetry Selection (\"Concurring Beasts\"), a National Poetry Series award winner (\"Black Dog, Red Dog\"), and a Melville Cane Award winner (\"Cemetery Nights\").\n\nDobyns has written many detective stories about a private detective named Charlie Bradshaw who works out of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York. Bradshaw is unusual as a private eye protagonist, an ordinary man who was once a police officer. All the books have the word \"Saratoga\" in the title.\n\nIn the comic novel \"The Wrestler's Cruel Study\", the protagonist roams through a modern cityscape governed by fairy-tale rituals, searching for his missing fiancée. He is alternately aided or hindered by a Friedrich Nietzsche -quoting manager and his Hegelian nemesis, to find that his wrestling matches are choreographed by a shadowy organization that enacts their various Gnostic theological debates through the pageantry and panoply of the ring. He eventually learns to resolve his own dualistic nature and determine who he is despite the role he plays.\n\n\"Cold Dog Soup\" has been made into two films, the American \"Cold Dog Soup\" and the French \"Doggy Bag\". \"Two Deaths of Señora Puccini\" has been made into the film \"Two Deaths\".

Its purpose is to support and encourage research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large-scale \"evaluation\" of text retrieval methodologies and to increase the speed of lab-to-product transfer of technology.\n\nEach track has a challenge wherein NIST provides participating groups with data sets and test problems. Depending on track, test problems might be questions, topics, or target extractable features. Uniform scoring is performed so the systems can be fairly evaluated. After evaluation of the results, a workshop provides a place for participants to collect together thoughts and ideas and present current and future research work.\n\n\"New tracks are added as new research needs are identified, this list is current for TREC 2016.\"\n\n\nIn 1997, a Japanese counterpart of TREC was launched (first workshop in 1999), called NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Systems), and in 2000, CLEF, a European counterpart, specifically vectored towards the study of cross-language information retrieval was launched.\n\nNIST claims that within the first six years of the workshops, the effectiveness of retrieval systems approximately doubled. The conference was also the first to hold large-scale evaluations of non-English documents, speech, video and retrieval across languages. Additionally, the challenges have inspired a large body of publications. Technology first developed in TREC is now included in many of the world's commercial search engines. An independent report by RTII found that \"about one-third of the improvement in web search engines from 1999 to 2009 is attributable to TREC. Those enhancements likely saved up to 3 billion hours of time using web search engines. ... Additionally, the report showed that for every $1 that NIST and its partners invested in TREC, at least $3.35 to $5.07 in benefits were accrued to U.S. information retrieval researchers in both the private sector and academia.\"\n\nWhile one study suggests that the state of the art for ad hoc search has not advanced substantially in the past decade, it is referring just to search for topically relevant documents in small news and web collections of a few gigabytes. There have been advances in other types of ad hoc search in the past decade. For example, test collections were created for known-item web search which found improvements from the use of anchor text, title weighting and url length, which were not useful techniques on the older ad hoc test collections. In 2009, a new billion-page web collection was introduced, and spam filtering was found to be a useful technique for ad hoc web search, unlike in past test collections.\n\nThe test collections developed at TREC are useful not just for (potentially) helping researchers advance the state of the art, but also for allowing developers of new (commercial) retrieval products to evaluate their effectiveness on standard tests. In the past decade, TREC has created new tests for enterprise e-mail search, genomics search, spam filtering, e-Discovery, and several other retrieval domains.\n\nTREC systems often provide a baseline for further research. Examples include:\n\nThe conference is made up of a varied, international group of researchers and developers.

{"id": "11456490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11456490", "title": "The Fairground Park Riot", "text": "The Fairground Park Riot\n\nThe Fairground Park Riot was a race riot that broke out on June 21, 1949 at a newly integrated public swimming pool.\n\nThe Fairground Pool, in St. Louis Missouri, was one of the largest pools in the American Midwest measuring 440 feet. The pool was able to hold from 10,000 to 12,000 swimmers at a time. During this time period much of the country was suffering from segregation. Missouri was among one of the states that was still segregated. Pickets had been put up at the Fairground Park to protest the segregation of pools. At the time; however, the federal law did not support segregation of public facilities. O'Toole, who at the time made the decision regarding the pools and parks, realized that the pools could not continue to be segregated. He said, \"I can't oppose anyone from lawfully using a swimming pool. They are taxpayers and citizens, too.\" On June 21, 1949, African Americans were allowed access to the city pool for the first time. Until that day, the Fairground Park swimming pool was only open to white patrons. On the first day that it was open to African Americans too, only 30 to 40 African Americans showed up. They swam alongside white children without any problem until a group of white teenagers surrounded the fence that enclosed the pool and began to shout threats to the African American swimmers. The black children had to be taken to a changing room until they could be escorted out by police. Some eye witness reports contradict each other some saying that the children were not placed in harm's way, while others say that the police escorts did not stop the white teenagers from physically attacking the black children. Some witnesses reported that by 6:45 p.m. that day the crowd escalated to several hundred and of those people only 20 to 30 were African American. The riot escalated rapidly when a rumor got around that a black man had killed a white man. The black boys were surrounded by the white boys who had arrived with baseball bats. It appeared that one of the boys even had a knife. One of the African American children was beat until an officer fell on top of him to stop the white child from attacking him. By now, the crowd had turned into thousands. Approximately 150 police officers were at the scene. By 10 o'clock that night, the situation mellowed down; however, the crowd did not fully disappear until after midnight. To avoid another eruption, the mayor decided that the best decision would be to segregate the pools again. Ultimately, in 1950, it was ordered by the federal court to integrate the pools of St. Louis.\n\nWhen the race riot occurred, Robert Gammon was only a teenager. All he wanted to do wash cool down at the Fairground Park swimming pool. Sixty years later, he can still remember the fear he endured. He remembers the taunts, the bricks, and the fights. When he heard the radio announcement that the pool would be open for blacks as well, he did not think it would cause such backlash. For the longest time, all he wanted to do was swim in the outdoor pool that had the wooden diving platform. However, he had never experienced such fear as he did when he headed home that night. When he along with the other black kids were escorted to the changing room, he remembers a white woman spitting at him. Once the police escorts separated, Gammon and his friends were chased by whites to St. Louis Avenue before giving up. He even recalls one of his friends getting hit in the head by a brick that was thrown at him. After the riot, he felt that it would be a long time before he could trust white people again. He said, \"I thought all white people hated us.\" To this day Gammon cannot understand why the riot happened. He wonders, \"Just because I'm black?\" He remembers the crowds continuing to get larger and larger as the day went on and more fights kept breaking out. Time magazine published an article about the riot in the days following the riot and described the scene as, \"Negro boys were chased and beaten by white gangs. In the gathering dusk, one grown-up rabble-rouser spoke out. 'Want to know how to take care of those niggers?' he shouted. 'Get bricks. Smash their heads, the dirty, filthy \"-\".'\" Years later Gammon visited the Fairground Park and leaned against the fence that once had enclosed the original pool. As the years have gone by, he does not see race the same way. He does not continue to hold the belief that all whites hate him; however, he does wish that the whole incident would have never happened. In his eyes, he sees things are better nowadays, but the issue is still prevalent and there is still progress to be made. J.C. Tobias recalls being chased by a mob of white teenagers when he and some friends were walking back home from the park's baseball diamond. He said, \"When you're a kids, you don't think much about it. As you age, you realize it didn't make much sense. We were just up there to swim.\" J.C. Tobias was just a teenager when the riot occurred and sixty years later he still has a vivid recollection of the event.\n\nStar-Times' also made a report about the riot. The report included what one middle-aged man at the riot said. According to the report, the man said, \"Kill a nigger and make a name for yourself,\" the other man said. \"Kill the black bastards.\" Star Times' even included a photograph of white mothers carrying their young children along with them to miss the excitement. White teenagers went around with their weapons. They carried with them baseball bats and broom sticks. One reporter stated that they overheard one of the white teenagers say, \"This is a waiting party. Waiting until it gets dark,\" and another white teenager replied with, \"I'll kill the bastards.\" Someone from the crowd spotted some African Americans and shouted, \"There's some niggers!\" Like a swarm of ants, the proceeded towards the African American boys and surrounded them. They saw an African American boy pull a knife and they began to attack him. They used their clubs, bats, sticks, and their fist to attack the young boy. Despite police effort to protect the boy, the whites continued to attack him as he laid on the ground.\n\nIn Eddie Silva's, \"The Longest Day,\" he shares his feeling about the race riot and believes that the race riot \"has been erased from the city's collective memory.\" This part of history is overlooked and not talked about because it forces the people to confront the city's racial divisions. Silva believes that ignoring the riot does not change that fact that it happened and it is something that needs receive the attention it deserves because its effects still continue currently. Some choose to forget or not believe that on the night of the riot approximately 4,000 to 5,000 whites roamed the grounds of the Fairground Park and assaulted any and every African American that crossed their path.\n\nAfter the nearly twelve hours and 400 officers it took to restore order, there were over a dozen people injured and at least eight were arrested. No deaths resulted in the melee, however, ten black people and two white people were hospitalized for injuries sustained in the event. Official reports state that out of the seven people that were arrested that day, three were white and four were black. Of those seven however, three blacks and one white was ultimately arrested and charged with initiating the riot. Attendance at the Fairground Park Pool dropped so significantly that it no longer made a profit and ultimately was closed down.\n\n\n\n\"The Atlantic\". Atlantic Media Company, n.d.

Tonal memory assists with staying in tune and may be developed through ear training. Extensive tonal memory may be recognized as an indication of potential compositional ability.\n\nTonal memory may be used as a strategy for learning to identify musical tones absolutely. Although those who attempt the strategy believe they are learning absolute pitch, the ability thus is generally not musically relevant, and their absolute tonal memory declines substantially or completely over time if not constantly reinforced. Short term memory can also play a role with tonal memory as well. To figure out what the tones/pitches in a phrase are either similar or different. Having the memory to recall the pitches will help make the distinction.\n\n"}

It is not called preschool because it is state funded and is in the schools.\n\nA school's bridge program may go by a different name, and may be positioned as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten or between kindergarten and first grade.\nWhile the stated function of transitional kindergarten is to allow students to make up for a lack of development, it actually sets students back an academic year, without providing the assurance that they'll be able to make up for lost ground later .\n\nIn California, the grade was created by the Kindergarten Readiness Act (SB 1381), which was authored by Senator Joseph Simitian and Senate President pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, and signed into law in 2010 by Gov. Schwarzenegger. The act also changed California's relatively late kindergarten entry date from December 2 to September 1, so that around 95% of children will have completed five years of age on the first day of kindergarten (any time in mid/late August), and those few that haven't yet would complete the fifth year \"at least soon\" after the first day. A child is automatically eligible for transitional kindergarten if the child will turn five between September 2 and December 2. Parents of children who turn five on December 3 or later may petition the school district to have their child admitted into transitional kindergarten, because they will still start regular kindergarten with the same batch of children who attend regular preschool instead (December 3 - September 1). However, by law, parents \"may not\" petition the school district to have their child admitted to regular kindergarten if the child is born on September 2 or later.\n\nTransitional kindergarten is a part of the public school system and is free for families. Classes are taught by credentialed teachers from the K–12 system. Existing funding for these children with fall birthdays that would have been eligible for kindergarten under the old kindergarten entry dates is redirected to transitional kindergarten and used to employ existing teachers and classroom facilities.\n\nThe law phases in the new age requirement by moving the cutoff date one month a year for three years, beginning in the fall of 2012. In the fall of 2014, at full implementation, approximately 125,000 children – including more than 52,000 English language learners and about 79,000 who attend Title I schools – will benefit from transitional kindergarten.\n\nAIR, the American Institutes for Research, recently released a report on the first year of statewide TK, which finds that 89% of districts reported they offered transitional kindergarten, representing 96% of the state's kindergarten population. An estimated 39,000 four-year-olds were served in the first year of implementation.\n\n"}

{"id": "3603358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3603358", "title": "Waldsee (camp)", "text": "Waldsee (camp)\n\nWaldsee (\"Lake of the Woods\") is the German immersion program offered by Concordia Language Villages. Located near Bemidji, Minnesota, Waldsee is also the site of North America's first certified passive house, which uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.\n\nWaldsee is America's oldest and largest immersion program for German language and culture. Over 1,550 young people participate yearly, coming together from all 50 of the United States and many foreign countries. In 2009 Waldsee was recognized as a U.S. National Center of Excellence for its cultural immersion program by the American Association of Teachers of German.\n\nWaldsee was the brainchild of professors Gerald Haukebo and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, USA. In 1961, the first two-week session of \"Camp Waldsee\" was held for 72 villagers. The tuition was $75 and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer served as the dean of the program. Over the next decade, Waldsee began to grow in both the number of villagers attending as well as the number of weeks that the camp ran each summer. Waldsee's first \"adventure program,\" Alpenland, was held at the Rising Wolf Ranch in Montana, where villagers learned German while enjoying hikes in the mountains and horseback riding. \n\nIn 1970, the high school credit program was launched, providing a four-week intensive instruction for high-school students equivalent to a full year's instruction in a traditional classroom. In 1973, Waldsee launched its first study abroad program, offering backpacking and biking trips to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. \n\nIn the early 1980s, the permanent Waldsee site began to be built on Turtle River Lake, near Bemidji, Minnesota. \n\nIn 2010, Waldsee celebrated its 50th anniversary. Events in 2010 included a major \"Waldseefest\" on July 24, 2010 and six different alumni weekends.\n\nWaldsee enjoys a continuing sister city relationship with the German town of Bad Waldsee, located in Baden-Württemberg. \n\nHorst Köhler, the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was the official patron (Schirmherr) of Waldsee, as was his predecessor, Roman Herzog. Many German Ambassadors and other dignitaries have visited Waldsee. World leaders have endorsed Concordia Language Villages, notably former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose daughter Chelsea attended Waldsee for six summers.\n\n\nWaldsee offers one-, two- and four-week living and learning experiences in German language and culture for beginning through advanced 7- to 18-year-olds.\n\nThe German Language Village has been cited as a model of innovative education by a wide variety of educators and organizations, including the American Association of Teachers of German and the Goethe Institut Inter Nationes. It has also been featured in such media as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Basler Zeitung, ZDF German Television, CBS American Television, \"The New York Times\", \"Time\", \"German Life Magazine\", \"Oskar's\" and \"Deutschland\" magazines, and been the subject of award-winning journalistic essays and various doctoral dissertations. \n\nWaldsee offers programs that serve youth (7–18 years old), families of all ages, and adults; one of the high school credit programs travels abroad. During the academic year, Waldsee also hosts school groups.\n\nThe Waldsee credit program offers traditional instruction as well as credit programs in environmental learning and German (\"die Gruene Welle\") and in medieval history and theater (\"der Maerchenwald\"). In the German apprentice program, starting in 2010, participants work half-time in the village stores, in gardening and green roof maintenance, music, the arts and the kitchen and bakery, and also learn half-time in intensive German language groups. \n\nWaldsee's non-credit programs include programs that focus on producing FM radio broadcasts at a live radio station, learning about Swiss culture in tandem with the nearby French village Lac du Bois and the Italian village Lago del Bosco, learning about the environment, performing improvisational theater based on medieval lore and legends, and exploring German grammar in depth. \n\nVillagers can choose different activities every day. Waldsee offers a wide range of European sports from soccer to fencing. There is also traditional American camp activities such as swimming and canoeing at the beach. Waldsee also has a few giant chess sets and a giant Mühle (Nine Men's Morris) game.\n\nWaldsee is currently located at a culturally authentic site on Turtle River Lake north of Bemidji, Minnesota. Since its founding in 1961, Waldsee has also leased numerous sites across Minnesota. It also offers a credit program that travels abroad.\n\nThe Waldsee permanent site, which opened in 1982, is located at near Bemidji, Minnesota on Turtle River Lake, along with six other Concordia Language Village sites. In all, Waldsee can house up to 240 people (typically, there are about 170 students and 40-50 counselors).\n\nThe site is styled after a typical German village and is centered around a \"Marktplatz\", which is the center of most activity at \"Waldsee\". The \"Bahnhof\" is a large building near the entrance of the village that houses class and administrative rooms. The \"Gasthof\" is another building that serves as a dining hall and houses most indoor activities. There is an artists' colony, named \"Worpswede\", which has about 6 small cabins and houses the arts and crafts activities. \n\nThe first building on the campsite was \"Haus Katja\", which is a log cabin that was built by a group of villagers. The first professionally built building was the \"Schwarzwaldhaus\" or Black Forest house, which can house 64 people in four units as well as several more in separate sleeping rooms on the first floor. A twin to the \"Schwarzwaldhaus\" is the \"Max Kade Haus\", which was built a few years after the SWH and is very similar in design. \n\nTwo new medium-sized residences have been recently built. The \"Erich Markel Haus\" (Oberammergau and Unterammergau) has room for 24 people in two units. The \"Robert Bosch Haus\" houses the healthcare center (\"Heilbronn\") and another residence (\"Stuttgart\"). The newest building at \"Waldsee\" is the \"BioHaus\", the first certified passive house in North America. The \"BioHaus\" is an integrated environmental learning center and residence for up to 30 people, including a small apartment upstairs. There is also \"Café Einbeck\", where villagers can sample candy, soft drinks, and other foods from Europe or listen to a jukebox playing German-language music. \"Waldsee\" also has a \"Laden\" at which villagers can make purchases using \"Euro\".\n\nWaldsee has also operated at leased sites since its founding in 1961. Waldsee has been located in Alexandria, Minnesota, Vergas, Minnesota, Menagha, Minnesota, Hackensack, Minnesota, and Cass Lake, Minnesota. Waldsee departed from Vergas in the summer of 2006 to make room for Al-Wāḥa, the Arabic language village, which was founded that year.\n\nWaldsee travels abroad to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with smaller groups of high school students studying German in their summer for credit.\nIn 2006, Waldsee opened the \"BioHaus\", the first certified passive house in North America, on its permanent site near Bemidji, Minnesota. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.\n\nThe construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant in North America.\n\nIn 2007, the BioHaus won the Minnesota Environmental Initiative Award in the category of Air Quality and Climate Protection. It was a 2007 Nominee for the World Clean Energy Award in the construction category.\n\nThe fixtures are German, and the house helps to introduce students to the \"new Germany\" as well as preparing them for responsible and ecological citizenship in the global community, the mission of Concordia Language Villages. The modern house itself pays homage to the Bauhaus school of 1920s architecture, and floor-to-ceiling windows recall the symbolic transparency built into West German government buildings post-World War II.\n\nThe house was built using eight critical design strategies: Passive Solar Design, Superinsulation, Advanced Window Technology, Airtightness, Ventilation, Space Heating, Efficient Lighting and Electrical appliances.\n\nThe building replaces 100% outside air; no air is recirculated through the system. Two underground tubes exchange outside and inside air eight feet beneath the ground, passively warming or cooling the air to match the temperature of the ground (~55°F year round). The house transfers heat between the outgoing air and the incoming air before it reaches the rooms, resulting in a difference of less than 10°F between the incoming fresh air and the desired room temperature, even in the midst of Minnesotan winter.\n\nWater in the house is heated by solar thermal heat panels on the roof, rather than photovoltaic solar cells, which would convert solar energy directly to electricity.\n\nLow-growing plants make up the building's green roof, reducing rainwater runoff and adding another layer of insulation to the building. Additionally, the western half of the lower level of the structure is tucked into the slope, enabling natural insulation based on the soil.\n\n\n"}

As with most Edu-Ware games, \"Windfall\" has an educational aspect, demonstrating the delicate balance in complex systems.\n\nThe player has six primary choices in this simulation of oil company operations:\n\n\nStrategy is based upon several simple economic principles. If players pay their employees poorly, the service time will be longer; however, if players pay them too much, prices will need to be raised to maintain a profit, but competitors may steal business away with lower prices. If gasoline prices go too high, the government may step in and set price limits. Occasionally, stockholders will overrule players' decisions.\n\nA clock runs continuously through the game. When time expires, the player's performance is evaluated.\n\n\"Windfall\", like most games from Edu-Ware's zip-lock bag era, sold only a few hundred units.

It takes pupils from pre-school through to university entrance and has an enrolment of around 275 students.\n\nWynstones was founded on the initiative of Margaret Bennell and Cora Nokes, two teachers from Crouch End, London, who wished to change their educational direction. Before and soon after its opening in 1937, they were joined by several other teachers including some, like Bettina Mellinger, Rudi Lissau and Maria and Norbert Glas that had come to England after the closure of the German Waldorf schools by the Nazi government. The school grew rapidly over the War years, being in the countryside away from the bombing of the cities. Its hostel became a home to many children including those of the Camphill community co-workers in Scotland. The high school was established after the War and the land and new buildings surrounding the original manor house developed.\n\nSituated in rural surroundings in the Cotswolds between Gloucester and Stroud, the school is set on 11 acres of extensive grounds, allowing for outdoor building and gardening pursuits as well as accommodating the sports hall, sports field and tennis courts.\nThe main building provides a central core, and each of the classroom blocks has been placed around it to create a kind of village centre – helping to engender a sense of community for pupils, parents, teachers and staff within the school.\n\nThe Barn, the school’s theatre, has enabled performance and visual arts to be at the heart of Wynstones School education and many memorable plays have been put on by pupils throughout the years. These have included King Lear, Romeo & Juliet, An Inspector Calls, Amadeus, The House of Bernarda Alba and most recently, Les Misérables.\n\nBoarding places offered to international students are with school families.\n\nAdmission is not based on academic selection and children with a wide range of abilities are accepted.\n\nThe school offers a comprehensive curriculum based on Steiner-Waldorf education with numerous extra-curricular activities, arts and cultural events and a comprehensive GCSE & A Level programme. It is a full member of the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship in the United Kingdom\n\nThere is a parent and child group, for 0-3 year olds, where parents and carers bring babies and toddlers to morning sessions on several days of the week. They spend a morning a week in school where they can experience some kindergarten activities such as simple seasonal crafts, food preparation, stories, singing and games, get to know the school, meet other parents and learn about Steiner Waldorf Education.\n\nLike most Steiner Waldorf schools, Wynstones adopts a co-operative approach to management.\n\nRecently the school employed an Education Leader as part of the management structure. Broadly the roles of the various components are:\n\nThe Education Leader chairs the meetings of the College of Teachers, is responsible for Continuing Professional Development, INSET days, teacher appraisal, complaints & grievances, to lead and support the school's development and enhance the scope of education provided\nThe College of Teachers works as an advisory, reference group to the Education Leader\n\nThe Chair of Lower School (pupils 6 – 14): Management responsibility for the curriculum, teaching and learning, standards and attainment\nThe Chair of Upper School (pupils 14 – 18): Management responsibility for the curriculum, teaching and learning, standards and attainment\nA Mandate system enlists the individual members to undertake an area of responsibility in the school\n\nSchool Council - The Trustees\n\nWynstones is an educational charity and the independent trustees making up the School Council have final responsibility for the well-being of the school.\n\nThe School Council is ultimately responsible for all aspects of the school. The Council’s role is not day-to-day management of the school which is delegated to the Education Leader/Chair of College. Our overall commitment is that: 'The Council, supporting the work of staff, the well being of pupils and the interest of parents, holds itself accountable to the Association to see that Wynstones (a) achieves its desired aims, and (b) avoids unacceptable actions and situations.\n\n"}
