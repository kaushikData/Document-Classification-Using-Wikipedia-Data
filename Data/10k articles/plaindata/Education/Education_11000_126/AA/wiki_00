Authoring systems can be defined as software that allows its user to create multimedia applications for manipulating multimedia objects. \n\nIn the development of educational software, an authoring system is a program that allows a non-programmer, usually an instructional designer or technologist, to easily create software with programming features. The programming features are built in but hidden behind buttons and other tools, so the author does not need to know how to program. Generally authoring systems provide lots of graphics, interaction, and other tools educational software needs. The three main components of an authoring system are: content organization, control of content delivery, and type(s) of assessment. Content Organization allows the user to structure and sequence the instructional content and media. Control of content delivery refers to the ability for the user to set the pace in which the content is delivered, and how learners engage with the content. Assessment refers to the ability to test learning outcomes within the system, usually in the form of tests, discussions, assignments, and other activities which can be evaluated. \n\nAn authoring system usually includes an \"authoring language\", a programming language built (or extended) with functionality for representing the tutoring system. The functionality offered by the authoring language may be programming functionality for use by programmers or domain representation functionality for use by subject experts. There is overlap between authoring languages with domain representation functionality and domain-specific languages.\n\nAn \"authoring language\" is a programming language used to create tutorials, computer-based training courseware, websites, CD-ROMs and other interactive computer programs. Authoring systems (packages) generally provide high-level visual tools that enable a complete system to be designed without writing any programming code, although the authoring language is there for more in-depth usage.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The language was meant to introduce structured programming elements in an environment where BASIC would normally be used.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, COMAL looks like a Structured BASIC that has reasonably well-written, vendor neutral, free, standards. It is never necessary to use GOTO, and line numbers are purely for editing purposes rather than flow control. Note, however, that the standardised language only supports control structuring, not data structuring such as records or structs (commercial implementations such as UniCOMAL 3 supported this as an extension).\n\nIn the early 1980s, Apple Computer won a contract to supply Apple II computers running CP/M and COMAL to Irish secondary schools. It was popular for education and some textbooks were locally written.\n\nIn 1984 Acornsoft released a COMAL implementation, by David Christensen, Jim Warwick and David Evers, for their 8-bit BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers (with a manual by Paul Christensen and Roy Thornton)\n\nBetween 1984-1987 TeleNova, a subsidiary of the industrial arm of the Swedish Telecoms system, Teli industrier manufactured a desktop PC\ncalled \"Compis\" for the educational sector.

It’s the idea that teachers influence student growth and behavior. The student’s behavior affects peer interaction—the responsibility of influencing these behaviors is placed with the Instructor. The way the instructor organizes the classroom should lead to a positive environment rather than a destructive and/or an environment that is not conducive to learning. Dr. Karen L. Bierman, the Director of the PennState Child Study Center and Professor of Psychology, believed that a teacher needs to be \"invisible hand\" in the classroom.\n\nTeachers should learn to guide their students, not to alienate them. The safety of the student’s well-being is paramount in their development of social ties with peers and their instructor. As education becomes more inclusive, teachers need to become more aware of how to organize groups of students and how the students are arranged can lead to a favorable environment. Well-organized classrooms are an important component to classroom functions as it leads to more dialogue and formative assessment. Students with special education needs (SEN) tend to feel more excluded from the other students in the classroom. SEN students include those with behavioral problems and those with learning difficulties. Students who do not have disadvantages are more inclined to participate as they feel more like they belong and have a higher belief in their academic abilities. Education becomes less of a chore and more enjoyable when students grow as a group which can lead to the reduction of students acting out destructively. In order to affect students, a teacher needs to monitor and modify the influence students have on one another. Teachers are able to help students feel included by assigning groups and rearranging the seating chart so less cliques are formed in the classroom. Combating bad behavior is a teacher's duty. Teachers need not only to take into consideration how the classroom is arranged, but also observe students' background, family life, grade, and many other complex issues surrounding life.\n\nMara W. Allodi, Department of Special Education, Stockholm University's article \"The Meaning of Social Climate of Learning Environments: Some Reasons Why We Do Not Care Enough About It, discusses the idea that social competence is as important to learning as the curriculum. Teaching has become more bureaucratic in the distribution of curriculum, its organization, and the system has turned it into more of a competition for high grades and less about human emotion. People often forget the importance of self-esteem and stress; these affect student interaction and learning. It is two-fold: one separates knowledge from the social climate. Classroom climate is not associated with learning.\n\n"}

It was associated with the work of Sadie Plant and Nick Land.\n\nThe collective's research was closely tied to the work of philosophers Sadie Plant (around whom it was founded), Nick Land, and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging cyberfeminist thinking that would lead to the \"Virtual Futures\" conferences at Warwick in the middle of the decade. Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing post-structuralism, cybernetics, science-fiction, rave culture, and occult studies. In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled \"Ccru: Writings 1997-2003\" was published.\n\nAlthough it only existed in an official capacity for little over two years—following the departure of Plant, the University of Warwick would deny any relationship to the renegade collective—the Ccru's cultural impact has been significant. Those who were affiliated with the Ccru during and after its time as part of the University of Warwick Philosophy department include philosophers Iain Hamilton Grant, Ray Brassier and Reza Negarestani; cultural theorists Mark Fisher and Kodwo Eshun; publisher and philosopher Robin Mackay; digital media theorists Luciana Parisi and Matthew Fuller; electronic music artist and Hyperdub label head Steve Goodman, aka Kode9; writer and theorist Anna Greenspan; novelist Hari Kunzru; and artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, among others.

It is important to note that accelerationism as it was deployed by the Ccru should be distinguished from the term more frequently associated with Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams’ ‘Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’.

It achieves dominance by being perceived as pertaining to a majority of the population and having a significant presence in institutions relating to communication, education, artistic expression, law, government and business. The concept of \"dominant culture\" is generally used in academic discourse in fields such as sociology, anthropology and cultural studies.\n\nThe culture that is dominant within a particular geopolitical entity can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but one is usually very resilient and able to reproduce itself effectively from generation to generation. In a multicultural society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally. A dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of minority cultures or subcultures.\n\nIn the United States, a distinction is often made between the indigenous culture of Native Americans, and a dominant culture that may be described as \"Anglo\", \"white\", \"middle class\", and so on. Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own tribe, community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.\n\nEthnic groups are said to exist in the United States in relation to a dominant culture, generally seen as English-speaking, of European ancestry, and Protestant Christian faith.

It is divided into the three stages of \"enseignement primaire\" (primary education), \"enseignement secondaire\" (secondary education), and \"enseignement supérieur\" (higher education). In French higher education, the following degrees are recognized by the Bologna Process (EU recognition): \"Licence\" and \"Licence Professionnelle\" (bachelor's degrees), and the comparably named \"Master\" and \"Doctorat\" degrees.\n\nNapoleon launched the university and secondary educational systems to Napoleon. Guizot started the elementary system. Intense battles took place over whether the Catholic Church should play a dominant role. The modern era of French education begins at the end of the nineteenth century. Jules Ferry, a Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern school (\"l'école républicaine\") by requiring all children between the ages of 6 and 12, both boys and girls, to attend. He also made public instruction mandatory, free of charge, and secular (\"laïque\"). With these laws, known as French Lubbers, Jules Ferry laws, and several others, the Third Republic repealed most of the Falloux Laws of 1850–1851, which gave an important role to the clergy.\n\nAll educational programmes in France are regulated by the Ministry of National Education (officially called \"Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de la Jeunesse et de la Vie associative\"). The head of the ministry is the Minister of National Education.\n\nThe teachers in public primary and secondary schools are all state civil servants, making the \"ministère\" the largest employer in the country. Professors and researchers in France's universities are also employed by the state.\n\nAt the primary and secondary levels, the curriculum is the same for all French students in any given grade, which includes public, semi-public and subsidised institutions. However, there exist specialised sections and a variety of options that students can choose. The reference for all French educators is the \"Bulletin officiel de l'éducation nationale, de l'enseignement supérieur et de la recherche (B.O.)\" which lists all current programmes and teaching directives. It is amended many times every year.\n\nIn Metropolitan France, the school year runs from early September to early July. The school calendar is standardised throughout the country and is the sole domain of the ministry.\n\nIn May, schools need time to organise exams (for example, the baccalauréat). Outside Metropolitan France, the school calendar is set by the local \"recteur\".\n\nMajor holiday breaks are as follows:\n\nSchooling in France is not mandatory (but instruction is). Most parents start sending their children to preschool (\"maternelle\") when they turn 3. Some even start earlier at age 2 in \"toute petite section \"TPS\"\". The first two years of preschool (TPS and \"petite section\" \"PS\") are introductions to community living; children learn how to become students and are introduced to their first notions of arithmetic, begin to recognize scripture, develop oral language, etc. The last two years of preschool, \"moyenne section\" and \"grande section,\" are more school-like; pupils are introduced to reading, writing and more mathematics. \n\nA preschool can have its own school zone (mostly true in towns) or be affiliated to an elementary school (mostly in villages). As in other educational systems, French primary school students usually have a single teacher (or two) who teaches the complete curriculum.\n\nAfter kindergarten, the young students move on to the \"école élémentaire\" (elementary school). In the first 3 years of elementary school, they learn to write, develop their reading skills and get some basics in subjects such as French, mathematics, science and the arts, to name a few. Note that the French word for a teacher at the primary school level is \"professeur\" or \"professeure des écoles\" (previously called \"instituteur\", or its feminine form \"institutrice\").\n\nChildren stay in elementary school for 5 years until they are 10–11 years-old. The grades are named: CP (\"cours préparatoire\"), CE1 (\"cours élémentaire 1\"), CE2 (\"cours élémentaire 2\"), CM1 (\"cours moyen 1\") and CM2 (\"cours moyen 2\"). \n\nAfter primary school, two educational stages follow:\n\nAs of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed France as having 105 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms: \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist.\n\nFrance has its own international school regulator, the AEFE (Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger).\n\nHigher education in France is organized in three levels, which correspond to those of other European countries, facilitating international mobility: the \"Licence\" and \"Licence Professionnelle\" (bachelor's degrees), and the Master's and Doctorat degrees. The Licence and the Master are organized in semesters: 6 for the Licence and 4 for the Master. These levels of study include various \"parcours\" or paths based on UE (Unités d’Enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS); a student accumulates these credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Licence is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained; a Master is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained. \nLicence and master's degrees are offered within specific \"domaines\" and carry a specific \"mention\". \"Spécialités\" which are either research-oriented or professionally oriented during the second year of the Master. There are also Professional Licences whose objective is immediate job integration. It is possible to later return to school through continuing education or to validate professional experience (through VAE, Validation des Acquis de l’Expérience).\n\nHigher education in France is divided between grandes écoles and public universities. The grandes écoles admit the graduates of the level Baccalauréat + 2 years of validated study (or sometimes directly after the Baccalauréat) whereas universities admit all graduates of the Baccalauréat.\n\nA striking trait of French higher education, compared with other countries, is the small size and multiplicity of establishments, each specialised in a more-or-less broad spectrum of areas. A middle-sized French city, such as Grenoble or Nancy, may have 2 or 3 universities (focused on science or sociological studies) and also a number of engineering and other establishments specialised higher education. In Paris and its suburbs there are 13 universities, none of which is specialised in one area or another, and a large number of smaller institutions that are highly specialised. It is not uncommon for graduate teaching programmes (master's degrees, the course part of PhD programmes etc.) to be operated in common by several institutions, allowing the institutions to present a larger variety of courses.\n\nIn engineering schools and the professional degrees of universities, a large share of the teaching staff is often made up of non-permanent professors; instead, part-time professors are hired to teach one only specific subject. The part-time professors are generally hired from neighbouring universities, research institutes or industries.\n\nAnother original feature of the French higher education system is that a large share of the scientific research is carried out by research establishments such as CNRS or INSERM, which are not formally part of the universities. However, in most cases, the research units of those establishments are located inside universities (or other higher education establishments) and jointly operated by the research establishment and the university.\n\nSince higher education is funded by the state, the fees are very low; the tuition varies from €150 to €700 depending on the university and the different levels of education. (\"licence, master, doctorate\"). One can therefore get a master's degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. Additionally, students from low-income families can apply for scholarships, paying nominal sums for tuition or textbooks, and can receive a monthly stipend of up to €450 per month.\n\nThe tuition in public engineering schools is comparable to universities, albeit a little higher (around €700). However it can reach €7,000 a year for private engineering schools, and some business schools, which are all private or partially private, charge up to €15,000 a year.\n\nHealth insurance for students is free until the age of 20 so only the costs of living and books have to be added. After the age of 20, the health insurance for students costs €200 a year and cover most of the medical expenses.\n\nSome public schools have other ways of gaining money. Some do not receive sufficient funds from the government for class trips and other extra activities and so these schools may ask for a small (optional) entrance fee for new students.\n\nThe public universities in France are named after the major cities near which they are located, followed by a numeral if there are several. Paris, for example, has thirteen universities, labelled Paris I to XIII. Some of these are not in Paris itself, but in the suburbs. In addition, most of the universities have taken a more informal name which is usually that of a famous person or a particular place. Sometimes, it is also a way to honor a famous alumnus, for example the science university in Strasbourg is known as \"Université Louis Pasteur\" while its official name is \"Université Strasbourg I\" (however, since 2009, the three universities of Strasbourg have been merged).\n\nThe French system has undergone a reform, the Bologna process, which aims at creating European standards for university studies, most notably a similar time-frame everywhere, with three years devoted to the bachelor's degree (\"licence\" in French), two for the Master's, and three for the doctorate. French universities have also adopted the ECTS credit system (for example, a licence is worth 180 credits). However the traditional curriculum based on end of semester examinations still remains in place in most universities. This double standard has added complexity to a system which also remains quite rigid. It is difficult to change a major during undergraduate studies without losing a semester or even a whole year. Students usually also have few course selection options once they enroll in a particular diploma.\n\nFrance also hosts various branch colleges of foreign universities. These include Baruch College, the University of London Institute in Paris, Parsons Paris School of Art and Design and the American University of Paris.\n\nThe \"grandes écoles\" of France are elite higher-education establishments. They are generally focused on a single subject area (e.g., engineering or business), have a small size (typically between 100 and 300 graduates per year), and are highly selective. They are widely regarded as prestigious, and most of France's scientists and executives have graduated from a \"grande école\".\n\nNational rankings are published every year by various magazines. While these rankings slightly vary from year to year, the top \"grandes écoles\" have been very stable for decades:\n\n\nThe Preparatory classes (in French \"classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles\" or CPGE), widely known as \"prépas\", is a prep course with the main goal of training students for enrollment in a \"grande école\". Admission to CPGEs is based on performance during the last two years of high school, called \"Première\" and \"Terminale\". Only 5% of a generation is admitted to a \"prépa\". CPGEs are usually located within high schools but pertain to tertiary education, which means that each student must have successfully passed their \"Baccalauréat\" (or equivalent) to be admitted in a CPGE. Each CPGE receives applications from hundreds of applicants worldwide every year in April and May, and selects students based on its own criteria. A few CPGEs, mainly the private ones (which account for 10% of CPGEs), also have an interview process or look at a student's involvement in the community.\n\nThe ratio of CPGE students who fail to enter any \"grande école\" is lower in scientific and business CPGEs than in humanities CPGEs.\n\nThe oldest CPGEs are the scientific ones, which can only be accessed by scientific Bacheliers. Scientific CPGE are called TSI (\"Technology and Engineering Science\"), MPSI (\"Mathematics, Physics and Engineering Science\"), PCSI (\"Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering Science\") or PTSI (\"Physics, Technology, and Engineering Science\") in the first year, MP (\"Mathematics and Physics\"), PSI (\"Physics and Engineering Science\"), PC (\"Physics and Chemistry\") or PT (\"Physics and Technology\") in the second year and BCPST (\"Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Life and Earth Sciences\").\n\nFirst year CPGE students are called the \"Math Sup\"—or \"Hypotaupe\"—(Sup for \"Classe de Mathématiques Supérieures\", superior in French, meaning post-high school), and second years \"Math Spé\"—or \"Taupe\"—(Spés standing for \"Classe de Mathématiques Spéciales\", special in French). The students of these classes are called \"Taupins\". Both the first and second year programmes include as much as twelve hours of mathematics teaching per week, ten hours of physics, two hours of philosophy, two to four hours of (one or two) foreign languages teaching and four to six hours of options: either chemistry, \"SI\" (Engineering Industrial Science) or \"Theoretical Computer Science\" (including some programming using the Pascal or CaML programming languages, as a practical work). With this is added several hours of homework, which can rise as much as the official hours of class. A known joke among those students is that they are becoming moles for two years, sometimes three. This is actually the origin of the nicknames \"taupe\" and \"taupin\" (\"taupe\" being the French word for a mole).\n\nThere are also CPGE which are focused on economics (who prepare the admission in ). These are known as \"Prépa EC\" (short for \"Economiques et Commerciales\") and are divided into two parts : prépa ECS, which focuses more on mathematics, generally for those who graduated the scientific baccalaureat and prépa ECE, which focuses more on economics, for those who were in the economics section in high school.\n\nThe literary and humanities CPGEs have also their own nicknames, \"Hypokhâgne\" for the first year and \"Khâgne\" for the second year. The students are called the \"khâgneux\". These classes prepare for schools such as the three Écoles Normales Supérieures, the Ecole des Chartes, and sometimes Sciences Po.\n\nThere are two kinds of \"Khâgnes\". The \"Khâgne de Lettres\" is the most common, and focuses on philosophy, French literature, history and languages. The \"Khâgne de Lettres et Sciences Sociales\" (Literature and Social Sciences), otherwise called Khâgne B/L, also includes mathematics and socio-economic sciences in addition to those literary subjects.\n\nThe students of Hypokhâgne and Khâgne (the humanities CPGE) are simultaneously enrolled in universities, and can go back to university in case of failure or if they feel unable to pass the highly competitive entrance examinations for the \"Écoles Normales Supérieures\".\n\nThe amount of work required of the students is exceptionally high. In addition to class time and homework, students spend several hours each week completing oral exams called \"colles\" (sometimes written 'khôlles' to look like a Greek word, this way of writing being initially a \"khâgneuxs\" joke, since \"khâgneux\" study Ancient Greek). The \"colles\" are unique to French academic education in CPGEs.\n\nIn scientific and business CPGEs, \"colles\" consist of oral examinations twice a week, in French, foreign languages (usually English, German, or Spanish), maths, physics, philosophy, or geopolitics—depending on the type of CPGE. Students, usually in groups of three or four, spend an hour facing a professor alone in a room, answering questions and solving problems.\n\nIn humanities CPGEs, \"colles\" are usually taken every quarter in every subject. Students have one hour to prepare a short presentation that takes the form of a French-style \"dissertation\" (a methodologically codified essay, typically structured in 3 parts: thesis, counter-thesis, and synthesis) in history, philosophy, etc. on a given topic, or the form of a \"commentaire composé\" (a methodologically codified commentary) in literature and foreign languages. In Ancient Greek or Latin, they involve a translation and a commentary. The student then has 20 minutes to present his/her work to the teacher, who finally asks some questions on the presentation and on the corresponding topic.\n\n\"Colles\" are regarded as very stressful, particularly due to the high standards expected by the teachers, and the subsequent harshness that may be directed at students who do not perform adequately. But they are important insofar as they prepare the students, from the very first year, for the oral part of the highly competitive examinations, which are reserved for the happy few who successfully pass the written part.\n\nDecades ago, primary school teachers were educated in Ecoles Normales and secondary teachers recruited through the \"Agrégation\" examination. The situation has been diversified by the introduction in the 1950s of the CAPES examination for secondary teachers and in the 1990s by the institution of \"Instituts Universitaires de Formation des Maîtres\" (IUFM), which have recently been renamed Écoles Supérieures du Professorat et de l’Éducation (ESPE). University teachers are recruited by special commissions, and are divided between:\n\n\nReligious instruction is not given by public schools (except for 6- to 18-year-old students in Alsace-Moselle under the Concordat of 1801). \"Laïcité\" (secularism) is one of the main precepts of the French republic.\n\nIn a March 2004 ruling, the French government banned all \"conspicuous religious symbols\" from schools and other public institutions with the intent of preventing proselytisation and to foster a sense of tolerance among ethnic groups. Some religious groups showed their opposition, saying the law hindered the freedom of religion as protected by the French constitution.\n\nThe French Republic has 67 million inhabitants, living in the 13 regions of metropolitan France and four overseas departments (2.7 million). Despite the fact that the population is growing (up 0.4% a year), the proportion of young people under 25 is falling. There are now fewer than 19 million young people in metropolitan France, or 32% of the total population, compared with 40% in the 1970s and 35% at the time of the 1990 census. France is seeing a slow aging of the population—less marked however than in other neighbouring countries (such as Germany and Italy), especially as the annual number of births is currently increasing slightly.\n\nEighteen million pupils and students, i.e. a quarter of the population, are in the education system. Of these, over 2.4 million are in higher education. The French Education Minister reported in 2000 that 39 out of 75,000 state schools were \"seriously violent\" and 300 were \"somewhat violent\".\n\n\n\n"}

During his early manhood, he moved to Illinois and engaged in the mercantile business at Litchfield, until his early death. He married Amanda Slaughter (born December 28, 1901, Tennessee). The Slaughter family is traced back to 1608 in Scotland, and three brothers coming from that country founded the family in America.\n\nEstella Bagnelle's education, begun in Litchfield, her native town, was completed in the state normal school of San Jose, California (now San Jose State University), from which she was graduated in 1885.\n\nAfter teaching for a year in San Jose, in 1887 she began to teach in the district schools of Madera county, and afterward was for eight years connected with the Madera schools. During the first six years of this time, she held the position of vice-principal and then for two years served as principal. In 1898, she was nominated for county superintendent of schools on the Democratic ticket and received a majority of 140, taking the oath of office in January, 1899, for a term of four years. At the expiration of that time, in 1902, she was re-elected without opposition.\n\nThere are four improvements for which she has labored indefatigably, namely: uniformity of text books; higher standard of teachers; better salaries; and more interest among trustees. Aside from her duties as superintendent, she served as secretary of the San Joaquin Teachers’ Association, was interested in the National Educational Association, and had sympathy with all movements for the benefit of the profession. May, 1893, she was chosen a member of the county board of education, at the time of the organization of Madera county, and after 1899, she officiated as secretary of the board.\n\nAfter retiring in January, 1911, she married the miner, Oscar H.

His grandfathers were both civil engineers. He grew up in Tibirke (Tisvilde), a small village located to the north of Copenhagen, and studied architecture with Enric Miralles at in Barcelona and at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture in Copenhagen, from where he graduated in 1994. He then worked briefly for Rem Koolhaas’ Office for Metropolitan Architecture in Rotterdam.\n\nIn 1995 Henrik Valeur started out on his own making competition entries of which a few were awarded, including a proposal for a new entrance to Copenhagen Zoo and for a new university on Amager (U97), following which, in 1997, he founded UiD, a networking urban consultancy.\n\nIn 1999 he was invited to present his work at Arkitekturgalleriet, an exhibition venue for young architects at the Danish Architecture Centre. He included in the exhibition, entitled \"‘99\" but sometimes wrongly referred to as \"UiD/Henrik Valeur\", not only his own work but the works of other architects, as well as material that is not commonly seen in architecture exhibitions. Architectural projects were not presented as unique, solitary pieces, but were mixed with commercials, news pieces, slogans and snap shots. The Danish architecture critic commented:\n\n“These are radical attempts at a new architectural practice, but almost de-illuminated. At first sight the quotations out of context or the mischievous clippings on the walls critically turn their back on the subject of architecture, away from any architectural core. But it is there! Floating somewhere in between text fragments, photos [...]”.\n\nWith Swedish architect and comedian , he initiated CoMa in 2001 – a research project about the newly formed Øresund Region, centered on the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö, hence the name CoMa, and the urban regions of Los Angeles and Pearl River Delta/Hong Kong. The project was based on a “diagnosis of society as a multicultural society. [T]his diagnosis becomes the frame for conceiving a new regional strategy that crosses the national borders of Denmark and Sweden, using urbanism as an integrating force”.\n\nCoMa was exhibited, in the format of a multimedia installation, at Form/Design Center in Malmö in 2002 and at the Danish Architecture Centre in Copenhagen in 2004. In addition, the team organized a conference about the Øresund Region and contributed a sound installation to an international group exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Roskilde.\n\nFor the development of Trekroner East in Roskilde (2002–03), Henrik Valeur organized a workshop with groups of young architects, artists and representatives of various interest groups, the municipality, local citizens and experts, who worked together to design the landscape of this new part of the city - prior to the design of the buildings, thus making it a practical example of landscape urbanism and of a participatory and collaborative planning process.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Henrik Valeur and Fredrik Fritzon developed a series of planning tools intended to make planning processes flexible and inclusive. These tools, which include the 1:1 Sketch Model, the 4D+ Model and the Change Design Model, were demonstrated and discussed at a fair-like idea shop, which they organized for the \"6th European Biennal of Towns and Town Planning\" in Copenhagen in 2005. Several young Danish and Swedish architecture offices participated in the idea shop, which was entitled \"A New Future for Planning – Young Architects Show the Way!\"\n\nHenrik Valeur and Fredrik Fritzson's ideas of planning were implemented in the development of Musicon in Roskilde, for which they made the structure plan and the process manual, based on a scenario game and role play with local stakeholders. Roskilde Municipality was awarded the Danish Urban Planning Award in 2012 for the \"exceptionally creative planning\" of Musicon.\n\nHenrik Valeur was appointed curator of the Danish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2006. He traveled to China where he met with universities and city administrations in several of the biggest Chinese cities. Based on the conversations he had with people there he conceived the project \"CO-EVOLUTION - Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China\" in which young professional Danish architects and architecture students would work together with professors and students from leading Chinese universities in the cities of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai and Xi’an. The curator and his team wrapped the exterior of the Danish Pavilion in a green scaffolding, often seen on Chinese construction sites, and conducted a research project on problems and possibilities related to the processes of rapid urbanization in China, which constituted the background story of the exhibition, literally in the format of billboards mounted on the interior walls of the pavilion, with the project proposals developed by the four teams placed as free-standing installations in space. \"CO-EVOLUTION\" was awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Participation by the jury of the 10th International Architecture Exhibition, Richard Sennett (President), Amyn Aga Khan, Antony Gormley and Zaha Hadid, who said:\"We salute the creativity, intelligence, and generosity of the Danish pavilion\".\n\nHenrik Valeur was himself a member of the jury for the 7th International Architecture Biennale in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. That year he also founded UiD Shanghai Co., Ltd in China and was the co-curator, with Professor Pan Haixiao of Tongji University, of the exhibition \"Harmonious City\", which included examples of Danish experiences with sustainable urban development and projects by students from Tongji University and was exhibited at Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center.\n\nAmong the projects Henrik Valeur created while living in China was the \"Bicycle Tower\", a design for vertical bicycle parking developed jointly by UiD in Shanghai and Malmö, and exhibited by the City of Malmö as part of the Urban Best Practice Area at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai.\n\nIn 2010 Henrik Valeur gave the \"Le Corbusier Memorial Lecture\" in Chandigarh, in which he noted that:\n\n“The problem with modernist architecture is not only that it tries to erase the past; it also obstructs the future!”\n\nIn the following years he worked with Indian students and researchers, activists and bureaucrats, developers and entrepreneurs, and participated in public discussions about the urban transition of India. His book , which is based on his teaching, researching and practicing, primarily in Chandigargh in North India and Bangalore in South India, was published in 2014. \"The book contextualises city making as a complex highly political process and contends that it is the Indian city that can truly be the landscape on which the idea of India, with its diversity, flourishes\".\n\nThe Indian architect Rahul Mehrotra, Professor and then Chair of Urban Planning and Design at Harvard University, called the book “an important contribution” because of its “fine grain reading of issues in the Indian city” and its “attempt to connect so many dots to make sense of the moving targets we encounter in Urbanism in India\".\n\nOne of the projects featured in the book is a proposal to make one of the sectors of Chandigarh car-free. Though initially commissioned by the Chief Architect of Chandigarh for the new master plan of the city, the proposal was not realized despite the fact that the Punjab and Haryana High Court subsequently directed the City Administration to make one of its sectors car-free.\n\nA project for the businessman and environmentalist Kamal Meattle uses natural ventilation and “growing fresh air” with plants in a vertical greenhouse to improve indoor air quality in an office building.\n\nOther projects include a proposal for \"vertical kitchen gardens\" in a colony of rehabilitated slum dwellers in Chandigarh, developed in collaboration with a local NGO, and a proposal for self-built low-cost \"garden flats\" for current slum dwellers in Bangalore, developed with a local developer. In Chandigarh the lack of open space in the colony led to the idea of placing community kitchen gardens on top of each other. In Bangalore residents would be provided an open frame structure to be filled out by themselves according to individual preferences and possibilities. The reasoning for both projects, i.e. to provide poor people in urban settings with opportunities to produce their own food and to create their own dwellings respectively, owes a debt to the Indian economist Amartya Sen’s capability approach.\n\nWith experiences from both China and India, Henrik Valeur asks whether India can “use urbanization as a driver of economic, human and social development like China has done?”\n\nAccording to Henrik Valeur, city and nature should be mixed.\n\nIn a feature article in Politiken (2009) he argued that in response to climate change, i.e. extreme weather, sea level rise and stormwater etc., ecology and urbanity must be integrated. But rather than moving the city out into the countryside, as Ebenezer Howard had proposed with his garden city concept more than a hundred years earlier, Henrik Valeur suggested that nature be incorporated in the city both physically, for instance in the form of soil and vegetation that can absorb excess water, and conceptually, in the way we think about cities.\n\nThe book \"\" (2014) provides a number of examples, including the revitalization and integration of an existing system of water canals with a new network of pathways for pedestrians in the city of Bangalore, the replacement of asphalt with natural surfaces, so-called \"green streets\", in the city of Chandigarh and the use of plants and natural ventilation to create fresh air inside an office building, in which the plants are also used as movable space dividers with the interior planning being based on principles of self-organization.\n\nWhile in favor of urban development, as a means of creating development in the so-called \"developing\" world, Henrik Valeur has voiced concern about the concept of smart city floated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. According to Henrik Valeur the \"concerns related to the concept of smart city have to do with the issues of control and surveillance, the risk of corruption, misuse and mismanagement, and the prospect of smart cities becoming exclusive enclaves for the rich\".\n\nIn response to the tradition of central control and the associated principle of determinism in Scandinavian planning, Henrik Valeur, in collaboration with Fredrik Fritzson, developed the concept of \"parallel processing\" in urban planning, which was discussed at the \"6th European Biennal of Towns and Town Planning\" in 2005 and implemented in the development of Musicon in 2007.\n\n“The objective of parallel processing is not only to democratize the planning process, but also to let mutual understanding and inspiration generate results, which are more than the sum of the individual interests.” This should be achieved by “establishing planning processes that engage all of the parties involved throughout the entire sequence”.\n\nRather than involving the various actors and stakeholders one after the other at various stages of the process (a serial process) they should all be involved from the very beginning and be able to interact with each other and with the relevant authorities throughout the process (open-ended planning processes were proposed). To this end, and in order to promote flexibility and experimentation, new planning methods and instruments, such as the 1:1 sketch model, the 4D+ model, the Change Design Model, role plays and scenario games, were introduced along with the use of new information and communications technologies.\n\nIn biology, “the term co-evolution is used to describe cases where two (or more) species reciprocally affect each other's evolution”.\n\nHenrik Valeur introduced the concept of co-evolution in architecture in 2006 as curator of the project \"CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China\" for which he asked four young architecture offices from Denmark to work together with planners and researchers from four Chinese universities to answer the question: \"How can China proceed with its ambitious project to improve living conditions for its population without exhausting the very resources needed to sustain a better life?\"\n\nBy creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, it was hoped that the exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences would stimulate “creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development\".\n\nHenrik Valeur later argued that: \"As we become more and more interconnected and interdependent, human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people\".\n\nIn 2010, Henrik Valeur wrote an op-ed in the Danish newspaper Information. In the English translation of the article the term “development urbanism” appears for the first time.\n\nIn the book , which can be seen as a \"call for action to everyone who wants to make a positive and concrete difference to the urban environments of developing societies\", Henrik Valeur describes development urbanism as “a multidisciplinary field that is focused on sustainable urban development as a means of combating poverty and its related illnesses and of protecting the environment, the climate and the resources. It addresses basic human concerns in urban settings, seeing cities not as “dumb” machines but rather as sophisticated ecologies in which people are adapting to a constantly changing environment”.\n\nThe concept of development urbanism can be seen as an alternative to the concept of smart city. Said Henrik Valeur: “There are obviously too many unresolved problems in our cities today, but my point is that many of these problems can be solved by very simple and inexpensive means. Smart technologies are rarely necessary and may, in fact, create more problems than they solve”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni.

In the final they beat Darren Bailey and Lana Williams.\n\nRobertson grew up in Ludlow, Shropshire. Her background is gymnastics in which she participated from the age of six to thirteen until she slipped a disc. She achieved third place at the British Championships in the vaulting horse, later getting into hip hop dance. Robertson names Levell Smith Junior as her biggest influence.\n\nRobertson took dance classes at In-Steps in Ludlow, where she still teaches hip hop and commercial jazz. From 2005 she attended the Midlands Academy of Dance and Drama in Nottingham for a two-year course in musical theatre.\n\nIn 2004, Robertson won choreographer Wade Robson's MTV show, \"Shakedown\", taking the title of best dancer in Europe. In 2005, she was a backing dancer in the video of the single \"Only U\" by Ashanti. She has also danced for Rachel Stevens and McFly.\n\n\"Strictly Dance Fever\" is an amateur dance competition broadcast on the BBC, consisting of several rounds of auditions followed by weekly live shows in which one couple is voted off each week until three couples are left for the final live show. Voting is done by professional judges and the viewing public, each making up 50% of the total score. The four judges award scores out of ten, while the public phones in to vote for their favourite. During the weeks of the live shows, the couples live together in a \"Dance Mansion\" where they receive intensive training.\n\nThe show is open to non-professional dancers over the age of 18. Even though Robertson had previously won a similar competition on MTV called \"Shakedown\" and had been awarded the title of best dancer in Europe, she was not a professional dancer and therefore was allowed to enter.\n\nRobertson participated in series two, which was broadcast in the spring of 2006. In that series 80,000 participants applied for the auditions. Over a million telephone votes were cast over the course of the series.\n\nRobertson auditioned with her boyfriend Bruno. Eventually he was not selected for the live shows and she was partnered with Darrien Wright. Robertson and Wright won the final on 3 June 2006 beating Darren Bailey and Lana Williams.\n\nRobertson and Wright received the top score of ten out of ten of all the judges on both their dances in the final. They performed The Milonga and a freestyle dance. In an earlier round they had also achieved the highest possible score for one of their dances.\n\nThe prize consisted of ₤50,000 for the couple and a contract to dance for one week in the production of \"Footloose\" on the West End. Robertson said after winning the final: \"I want to put the prize money towards a dance studio so I can teach.\"\n\nAs part of their prize, Robertson and Wright won a professional dance contract. This culminated early in July 2006 when, for a week, the pair took to the West End stage as background dancers in \"Footloose\" in London's Novello Theatre.\nDavid Essex and Cheryl Baker also starred in the show.\n\nRobertson's career suffered a minor set-back when she was injured after an attack on holiday in Portugal. Regarding this incident she's quoted as saying: \"I've never had anything so painful happen to me in my life before. It was horrible, absolutely horrible. [...] Stuff happens to you in life and you just have to get on with it and as long as I don't stop dancing it's ok...I'll be ok.\"\n\nRobertson is currently appearing in the UK tour of \"Fame\"\nalongside dance partner Darrien Wright.\n\n"}

It convened because of an interest in moral education by many countries beginning a decade before the inaugural event. The movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the Ethical movement. The idea to hold the congress was at the behest of the International Union of Ethical Societies; its greatest proponents were Professor Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster and Gustav Spiller, the secretary of the Union. The first congress was held in 1908, and except for one 10-year beak (1912-1922), the congress met every four years in various cities. The official languages were German, English, and French.\n\nThe Moral Education League of London was founded in 1897. This organization exercised a considerable influence, not only in the United Kingdom but in various parts of the British Empire and throughout the world. Its president was John Stuart Mackenzie. Among its members were Catholics, Anglicans, Jews, Unitarians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Nonconformists, Ethicists, Rationalists, Positivists, and others. Its secretary was Harrold Johnson, who was later appointed Hon. Secretary of the International Moral Education Congress Executive Council. The league also employed a demonstrator, Frederick James Gould, who acquired an international reputation for his numerous \nbooks on moral lessons. This League succeeded in 1906 in inducing the Board of Education to make provision for moral instruction in the education code for England and Wales.\n\nIn 1905, a new Italian Education Code was published, laying the utmost stress on moral education and making detailed regulations with regard to moral instruction. In the following year, a new Hungarian Education Code was issued. In 1905, a new Austrian Education Code came to light. In Portugal, a manual of Moral Instruction for Primary Schools, as distinct from Religious Instruction, was officially published in 1906. In the United States, schemes of moral instruction were elaborated in many places. In Germany, the Reading Books for Elementary Schools contained abundance of ethical matter. In Switzerland, several Cantons took distinct steps in the direction of drawing up Moral Instruction Programmes. In Belgium, Moral Instruction Syllabuses for Primary Schools and for Training Colleges existed. In France and Japan, where moral instruction was introduced, the subject was being studied with redoubled interest. In Russia, the authorities were turning their attention to this subject. And, finally, in England, the Code of the Board of Education for 1906 stated that \"Moral instruction should form an important part of every school curriculum\". Educationists generally laid increasing emphasis on the moral factor in education, while men in every walk of life came more and more to feel that the training of the intellect must be accompanied by the development of character if the school is to serve effectively the nation and humanity. This movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the Ethical movement.\n\nThe First Congress was held at the University of London, London, England, on September 25–29, 1908. Michael Sadler served as president. The Congress counted altogether some 1,800 members and 2,000 volumes of the Papers on Moral Education were disposed of within less than four weeks after the first Congress met. Both the educational magazines and the leading daily papers rendered valuable assistance to the Congress. There were sessions on the following topics: The Principles of Moral Education; Aims, Means and Limitations in the various types of schools; Character Building by Discipline, Influence and Opportunity; the Problems of Moral Instruction; Relation of Religious Education to Moral Education; Systematic Moral Instruction; The Relation of Moral Education to Education under Other Aspects; the Problem of Moral Education under varying conditions of Age and Opportunity; Biology and Moral Education.\n\nThe Second Congress was held at the Hague, August 22–27, 1912. Dr. J. Th. Mouton was the President of the Executive Committee. The following twenty-three countries sent official government delegates: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, India (British), Ireland, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Romania, South Australia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and Tunis. Over 1,000 members (apart from honorary members) were officially enrolled for the congress. Over 200 papers of some 2,000 words each were contributed and appeared in the five published volumes of more than 1,200 pages. The subjects dealt with and under discussion at the various sessions were: Moral Education and Character Building considered from the Denominationalist, the Undenominationalist and the Independent-Moralist points of view; Moral Education considered from social and national points of view Formation of the Will; Physical Training as a means of Character-Building; Moral Education considered from a Practical Point of View; the Moral Education of Adolescents; Character-Building in family life and in society at large; Character-Building of young people at educational institutions not dedicated to the ordinary primary education; Character-Building of Abnormal Children. This Congress stated it would not advocate the views of any society or party, but it would afford to all who are interested in moral education, whatever their religious or ethical convictions, nationality and point of view, an equal opportunity of expressing their opinions and comparing them with those of others. This proved so good a basis that the congress with unanimity adopted it as the basis of future congresses, with the addition of the following object: The object of the Congress is to enlist the active co-operation of all, irrespective of race, nations, and creed, in promoting the work of moral education. The first aim of the Second Congress, as of the first, was to cultivate the co-operation of men and women representing different schools of thought in matters of education, giving every one an opportunity in the spirit of toleration, of defining and explaining his opinion and point of view.\n\nThe Third Congress met in the Aula, or Assembly Hall, of the University of Geneva, July 28 to August 1, 1922. About 500 members attended, representing 30 nationalities and 29 national committees. Thirty-three papers were contributed, all being published in French, in two volumes, by Delachaux, at Neuchatel. The topics were confined to (1) the international motive, with special reference to the teaching of history; and (2) the motive of service. Frederick Pollock gave the inaugural address on behalf of the International Executive Council (London), and was followed by the newly elected president of the Congress, Dr. Adolphe Ferrière, who was an advocate of progressive education. Among the speakers during the eight sessions, perhaps the most popular were three—Professor Foerster; M. Albert Thomas, Director of the Labor Office of the League of Nations; and Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. A special session was held in the hall of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, chaired by Gustav Spiller, which included Nitobe Inazō, Director of the Section of International Bureaus. The Congress approved of the establishment of an International Moral Education Bureau at the Hague, and decided to form a permanent association of educationists of the world, based on the 29 national committees already existing.\n\nThe Fourth Congress took place in Rome, Italy, from September 28 to October 2, 1926. Francesco Orestano served as president.\n\nThe Fifth Congress took place at the University of Sorbonne in Paris, France, September 23–27, 1930. Sébastien Charléty served as president.\n\nThe Sixth Congress took place in Krakow, Poland, September 11–14, 1934.\n\nIn 2004, Marco Cicchini of the University of Geneva published his study based on a review of the proceedings and publications of the six congresses. He synthesized the congresses' aims and ideals, the theoretical and institutional outlines, the socio-professional profiles of the participants, the status of their contributions, and the disciplines invited to discuss the issues. He also noted on the changes which led to the disappearance of the congress.\n"}

{"id": "167071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167071", "title": "Lawrence Kohlberg", "text": "Lawrence Kohlberg\n\nLawrence Kohlberg (; October 25, 1927 – January 19, 1987) was an American psychologist best known for his theory of stages of moral development. He served as a professor in the Psychology Department at the University of Chicago and at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. Even though it was considered unusual in his era, he decided to study the topic of moral judgment, extending Jean Piaget's account of children's moral development from twenty-five years earlier. In fact, it took Kohlberg five years before he was able to publish an article based on his views. Kohlberg's work reflected and extended not only Piaget's findings but also the theories of philosophers George Herbert Mead and James Mark Baldwin. At the same time he was creating a new field within psychology: \"moral development\". In an empirical study using six criteria, such as citations and recognition, Kohlberg was found to be the 30th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.\n\nLawrence Kohlberg was born in Bronxville, New York. He was the youngest of four children of Alfred Kohlberg, a Jewish German entrepreneur, and of his second wife, Charlotte Albrecht, a Christian German chemist. His parents separated when he was four years old and divorced finally when he was fourteen. From 1933 to 1938, Lawrence and his three other siblings rotated between their mother and father for six months at a time. In 1938 this rotating custody of the Kohlberg children was ended, allowing the children to choose the parent with whom they wanted to live. Kohlberg attended high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, which was an elite preparatory school. Kohlberg served in the Merchant Marine at the end of World War II. He worked for a time with the Haganah on a ship smuggling Jewish refugees from Romania through the British Blockade, into Palestine. Captured by the British and held at an internment camp on Cyprus, Kohlberg escaped with fellow crew members. Kohlberg was in Palestine during the fighting in 1948 to establish the state of Israel, but refused to participate and focused on nonviolent forms of activism. He also lived in an Israeli kibbutz during this time, until he was able to return to America in 1948. In the same year he enrolled at the University of Chicago. At this time at Chicago it was possible to gain credit for courses by examination, and Kohlberg earned his bachelor's degree in one year, 1948. He then began study for his doctoral degree in psychology, which he completed at Chicago in 1958. In those early years he read Piaget's work. Kohlberg found a scholarly approach that gave a central place to the individual's reasoning in moral decision making. At the time this contrasted with the current psychological approaches of behaviorism and psychoanalysis that explained morality as simple internalization of external cultural or parental rules, through teaching using reinforcement and punishment or identification with a parental authority.\n\nKohlberg's first academic appointment was at Yale University, as an assistant professor of psychology, 1958–1961. In 1955 while beginning his dissertation, he had married Lucille Stigberg, and the couple had two sons, David and Steven. Kohlberg spent a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Palo Alto, California, 1961–1962, and then joined the Psychology Department of the University of Chicago as assistant, then associate professor of psychology and human development, 1962–1967. He held a visiting appointment at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 1967–68, and then was appointed Professor of Education and Social Psychology there, beginning 1968, where he remained until his death.\n\nIn his unpublished 1958 dissertation, Kohlberg wrote what are now known as Kohlberg's stages of moral development. These stages are planes of moral adequacy conceived to explain the development of moral reasoning. Created while studying psychology at the University of Chicago, the theory was inspired by the work of Jean Piaget and a fascination with children's reactions to moral dilemmas. Kohlberg proposed a form of \"Socratic\" moral education and reaffirmed John Dewey's idea that development should be the aim of education. He also outlined how educators can influence moral development without indoctrination and how public school can be engaged in moral education consistent with the United States Constitution.\n\nKohlberg's approach begins with the assumption that humans are intrinsically motivated to explore, and become competent at functioning in, their environments. In social development, this leads us to imitate role models we perceive as competent and to look to them for validation. Thus our earliest childhood references on the rightness of our and others' actions are adult role models with whom we are in regular contact. Kohlberg also held that there are common patterns of social life, observed in universally occurring social institutions, such as families, peer groups, structures and procedures for clan or society decision-making, and cooperative work for mutual defense and sustenance. Endeavoring to become competent participants in such institutions, humans in all cultures exhibit similar patterns of action and thought concerning the relations of self, others, and social world. Furthermore, the more one is prompted to imagine how others experience things and imaginatively to take their roles, the more quickly one learns to function well in cooperative human interactions.\n\nThe sequence of stages of moral development thus corresponds to a sequence of progressively more inclusive social circles (family, peers, community, etc.), within which humans seek to operate competently. When those groups function well, oriented by reciprocity and mutual care and respect, growing humans adapt to larger and larger circles of justice, care, and respect. Each stage of moral cognitive development is the realization in conscious thought of the relations of justice, care, and respect exhibited in a wider circle of social relations, including narrower circles within the wider.\n\nKohlberg's theory holds that moral reasoning, which is the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental constructive stages – each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than the last. Kohlberg suggested that the higher stages of moral development provide the person with greater capacities/abilities in terms of decision making and so these stages allow people to handle more complex dilemmas. In studying these, Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment beyond the ages originally studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding considerably upon this groundwork, it was determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that its development continued throughout the life span, even spawning dialogue of philosophical implications of such research. His model \"is based on the assumption of co-operative social organization on the basis of justice and fairness.\"\n\nKohlberg studied moral reasoning by presenting subjects with moral dilemmas. He would then categorize and classify the reasoning used in the responses, into one of six distinct stages, grouped into three levels: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Each level contains two stages. These stages heavily influenced others and have been utilized by others like James Rest in making the \"Defining Issues Test\" in 1979.\n\nKohlberg is most well-known among psychologists for his research in moral psychology, but among educators he is known for his applied work of moral education in schools. The three major contributions Kohlberg made to moral education were the use of Moral Exemplars, Dilemma Discussions, and Just Community Schools.\n\nKohlberg's first method of moral education was to examine the lives of moral exemplars who practiced principled morals such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Socrates, and Abraham Lincoln. He believed that moral exemplars' words and deeds increased the moral reasoning of those who watched and listened to them. Kohlberg never tested to see if examining the lives of moral exemplars did in fact increase moral reasoning. Recent research in moral psychology has brought back the value of witnessing moral exemplars in action or learning about their stories. Witnessing the virtuous acts of moral exemplars may not increase moral reasoning, but it has been shown to elicit an emotion known as moral elevation that can increase an individual's desire to be a better person and even has the potential to increase prosocial and moral behavior. Although Kohlberg's hypothesis that moral exemplars could increase moral reasoning might be unfounded, his understanding that moral exemplars have an important place in moral education has growing support.\n\nDilemma discussions in schools was another method proposed by Kohlberg to increase moral reasoning. Unlike moral exemplars, Kohlberg tested this method by integrating moral dilemma discussion into the curricula of school classes in humanities and social studies. Results of this and other studies using similar methods found that moral discussion does increase moral reasoning and works best if the individual in question is in discussion with a person who is using reasoning that is just one stage above their own.\n\nThe final method Kohlberg used for moral education was known as \"just communities\". In 1974, Kohlberg worked with schools to set up democracy-based programs, where both students and teachers were given one vote to decide on school policies. The purpose of these programs were to build a sense of community in schools in order to promote democratic values and increase moral reasoning. Kohlberg's idea and development of \"just communities\" were greatly influenced by his time living in an Israeli kibbutz when he was a young adult in 1948 and when he was doing longitudinal cross-cultural research of moral development in another Israeli kibbutz.\n\nSome of Kohlberg's most important publications were collected in his \"Essays on Moral Development\", Vols. I and II, \"The Philosophy of Moral Development\" (1981) and \"The Psychology of Moral Development\" (1984), published by Harper & Row. Other works published by Kohlgainz or about Kohlberg's theories and research include \"Consensus and Controversy\", \"The Meaning and Measurement of Moral Development\", \"Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education\" and \"Child Psychology and Childhood Education: A Cognitive Developmental View\".\n\nCarol Gilligan, a fellow researcher of Kohlberg's in the studies of moral reasoning that led to Kohlberg's developmental stage theory, suggested that to make moral judgments based on optimizing concrete human relations is not necessarily a lower stage of moral judgment than to consider objective principles. Postulating that women may develop an empathy-based ethic with a different, but not lower structure than that Kohlberg had described, Gilligan wrote \"In a Different Voice\", a book that founded a new movement of care-based ethics that initially found strong resonance among feminists and later achieved wider recognition.\n\nKohlberg's response to Carol Gilligan's criticism was that he agreed with her that there is a care moral orientation that is distinct from a justice moral orientation, but he disagreed with her claim that women scored lower than men on measures of moral developmental stages because they are more inclined to use care orientation rather than a justice orientation. Kohlberg disagreed with Gilligan's position on two grounds. First, many studies measuring moral development of males and females found no difference between men and women and when differences were found it was attributable to differences in education, work experiences, and role-taking opportunities, but not gender. Second, longitudinal studies of females found the same invariant sequence of moral development as previous studies that were of just males. In other words, Gilligan's criticism of Kohlberg's moral development theory was centered on differences between males and females that did not exist. Kohlberg's detailed responses to numerous critics can be read in his book \"Essays on Moral Development: Vol.II. The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages.\"\n\nAnother criticism against Kohlberg's theory was that it focused too much on reason at the expense of other factors. One problem with Kohlberg's focus on reason was that little empirical evidence found a relationship between moral reasoning and moral behavior. Kohlberg recognized this lack of a relationship between his moral stages and moral behavior. In an attempt to understand this, he proposed two sub-stages within each stage, to explain individual differences within each stage. He then proposed a model of the relationship between moral judgments and moral action. According to Kohlberg, an individual first interprets the situation using their moral reasoning, which is influenced by their moral stage and sub-stage. After interpretation individual's make a deontic choice and a judgment of responsibility, which are both influenced by the stage and sub-stage of the individual. If the individual does decide on a moral action and their obligation to do it, they still need the non-moral skills to carry out a moral behavior. If this model is true then it would explain why research was having a hard time finding a direct relationship between moral reason and moral behavior.\n\nAnother problem with Kohlberg's emphasis on moral reasoning is growing empirical support that individuals are more likely to use intuitive \"gut reactions\" to make moral decisions than use reason-based thought. The high use of intuition directly challenges the place of reason in moral experience. This expanding of the moral domain from reason has raised questions that perhaps morality research is entering areas of inquiry that are not considered real morality, which was a concern of Kohlberg when he first started his research.\n\nScholars such as Elliot Turiel and James Rest have responded to Kohlberg's work with their own significant contributions.\n\nWhile doing cross-cultural research in Belize in 1971, Kohlberg contracted a parasitic infection. Due to this, he suffered from extreme abdominal pain. The long-term effects of the infection and the medications took their toll, and Kohlberg's health declined as he also engaged in increasingly demanding professional work, including \"Just Community\" prison and school moral education programs. Kohlberg sometimes experienced depression as well.\n\nOn January 19, 1987, Kohlberg parked at the end of a dead end street in Winthrop, Massachusetts, across from Boston's Logan Airport. He left his wallet with identification on the front seat of his unlocked car and walked into the icy Boston Harbor. His car and wallet were found within a couple of weeks, and his body was recovered some time later, with the late winter thaw, in a tidal marsh across the harbor near the end of a Logan Airport runway.\n\nAfter Kohlberg's body was recovered and his death confirmed, former students and colleagues published special issues of scholarly journals to commemorate his contribution to developmental psychology.\n\n"}

Following her decades-long career, she moved to the U.S., where she founded the Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse. Krassovska taught, choreographed and performed until her death.\n\nKrassovska was born Nathalie Leslie in St. Petersburg, the daughter of a Russian mother and Scottish father. Depending on the source her birthdate is recorded as June 1 or June 3, with the year ranging from 1917 to 1919, most frequently 1918. Her grandmother was a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet; her mother Lydia Krassovska was a dancer with Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes.\n\nYoung Nathalie began her ballet studies with her grandmother, but her formal training took place in Europe. In Paris, she trained with Olga Preobrajenska, St Petersburg's pre-Revolutionary prima ballerina. In London, she studied with Russian ballet master Nikolai Legat. Under the name of Nathalie Leslie she danced with Ida Rubinstein's company at the Paris Opera. At age 14, she was selected by Bronislava Nijinska for her company, the Théâtre de la Danse. In 1933, she joined George Balanchine's short-lived Les Ballets. After Les Ballets, Krassovska partnered with Serge Lifar for a tour of South America.\n\nKrassovska joined the Ballet Russe de Paris in 1935 and René Blum’s Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1936. In 1938, she became a member of the Massine-Denham Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. During her time with the troupe, Krassovska worked closely with Mikhail Fokine, the well-known choreographer and reformer of conventional ballet traditions. Fokine personally coached her for roles in Les Sylphides, Le Spectre de la Rose and other ballets. She advanced to the position of principal dancer and performed with the group until 1950.\n\nDuring World War II, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo moved its home base to New York and toured primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Krassovska was acclaimed for her lyrical style, especially in performances of the Romantic ballets. In 1948, she premiered Pas de Quatre at the New York Met, alongside Alicia Markova, Alexandra Danilova and Mia Slavenska. Anton Dolin’s restaging of the 1845 Jules Perrot ballet is an evocation of four legendary ballerinas from the Romantic era.\n\nIn 1949, Krassovska first danced the title role in Giselle, one of the most famous Romantic ballets. It was to become one of her signature roles. Writing of the performance, Montreal Daily Star dance critic S. Morgan-Powell reportedly wrote, \"Her dancing was characterized by a purity of style not often seen nowadays in ballet.\" She was also noted for her performances in Les Sylphides, Scheherazade, The Snow Maiden, Swan Lake and The Nutcracker. In an \"American Dancer\" article, reviewer Albertina Vitak said, \"Krassovska stands out over all and is one of the most valuable assets of the company.\"\n\nKrassovska's repertoire was not limited to ballet blanc. She learned tap dancing for her character in The New Yorker, Leonide Massine's 1940 ballet based on cartoons from the popular magazine. For Capriccio Espagnol, another Massine work, Krassovska and the cast were required to execute Flamenco steps such as the bulerías and seguidilla.\n\nKrassovska briefly joined Ballet Rambert in 1949. When Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin decided to found the London Festival Ballet in 1950, they asked her to be the second ballerina, partnering with English dancer John Gilpin. On opening night at the Stoll Theatre, Krassovska and Gilpin triumphed in Massine's Le Beau Danube. Their partnership became a major company attraction.\n\nKrassovska stayed with Festival Ballet through 1960 and continued to perform the standard 19th century repertory. She danced in Great Britain under her birth name Nathalie Leslie. As a guest artist with the Ballet Russe in the late 1950s, she used the surname Krassovska.\n\nKrassovska moved to U.S. in the 1960s. Having toured the country a number of times, she decided that Dallas, Texas, with its flowers, trees and pleasant climate was one of the nicest cities. She opened a dance school at her home and founded a student company, Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse. She became an American citizen in 1964.\n\nKrassovska was invited frequently as a guest teacher and coach throughout the Southeastern U.S. She danced in local productions of The Nutcracker into her 80s and produced her last concert, Tribute to Ballet Russe, at Southern Methodist University in 1997.\n\nIn 1941 and 1942, while a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Krassovska appeared in two movies choreographed by Massine, Spanish Fiesta (an adaptation of Capriccio Espagnol) and The Gay Parisian (also known as Gaité Parisienne). Her remarkable beauty caught the eye of David O. Selznick and he offered her a movie contract. Although it was a very difficult decision, she chose to remain with the ballet company.\nFor the 1953 film Never Let Me Go, Krassovska doubled in long shots for Gene Tierney in her role as a Russian ballet dancer.\n\nKrassovska was interviewed and shown in archival footage for the 2005 documentary movie Ballets Russes.\n\nHer romantic life was reputedly eventful and she was briefly married to an Austrian count. Another interest, outside of ballet, was the Eastern Orthodox Church. Krassovska helped raise $850,000 toward a construction project for the St. Seraphim Orthodox Church in Dallas.\n\nNathalie Krassovska died on February 8, 2005 due to complications from surgery. She is buried in Restland Memorial Park in Dallas.\n\n"}

The Commissioners' work paved the way for the establishment of the Public Record Office in 1838. The Commissioners were also responsible for publishing various historical records, including the \"Statutes of the Realm\" (i.e. of England and Great Britain) to 1714 and the \"Acts of Parliament of Scotland\" to 1707, as well as a number of important medieval records.\n\nAlthough the six Commissions were technically distinct from one another, there was a considerable degree of continuity between them, and it is common practice to regard them as a single entity and to refer to them in singular form as the Record Commission.\n\nThe first Commission was established on 19 July 1800, on the recommendation of a Select Committee appointed earlier in the year, on the initiative and under the chairmanship of Charles Abbot, MP for Helston, \"to inquire into the State of the Public Records of this kingdom\". The public records were at this time housed in a variety of repositories, including the Tower of London, the chapter house of Westminster Abbey, the Pell Office adjacent to Westminster Hall, Somerset House, and elsewhere, often in a disorganised state and in highly unsuitable physical conditions. The idea of a single central repository was mooted as early as 1800, and became the subject of an abortive parliamentary bill in 1833, but it was to be some years before this was achieved: in the meantime, the Commissioners arranged for various moves of individual classes of records into new accommodation. These moves were well-intentioned and sometimes led to improvements in storage and arrangement, but more often resulted in the loss and further disorganisation of records. \n\nThe Commission (in particular the sixth Commission, which sat from 1831 to 1837) gained a reputation for inactivity, corruption, jobbery, and for including among its members too many persons in high office with other demands on their time. Some of these criticisms came from external observers, such as Sir Harris Nicolas; others were made by the Commission's own salaried employees, notably Henry Cole, and to a lesser extent Thomas Duffus Hardy. A Parliamentary committee, appointed to inquire into its work, reported in 1836 that the national archives remained scattered in a number of unsuitable locations, and in the custody of \"a multitude of imperfectly responsible keepers\". Out of these controversies emerged the Public Record Office Act 1838, which established the Public Record Office in that same year.\n\nThe Commissioners' second objective was to make the records more accessible through the compilation of finding aids (indexes and calendars), and where possible the publication of these, as well as the publication of full texts of selected records of particular importance. The sixth Commission employed four sub-Commissioners (Joseph Hunter, Francis Palgrave, Joseph Stevenson, and for a time John Caley), as well as other \"ad hoc\" editors and a number of clerks, specifically on the task of editing records for publication. Most of the Commission's publications used a \"record type\" typeface, designed to present the text in a near-facsimile of the manuscript originals. The publications programme was generally considered a success, and many of the Commission's editions remain in current scholarly use. In other cases, however, the absence of a permanent arrangement to the records rapidly rendered the compilation of finding aids efforts redundant.\n\nThe Commissions' publications included:\n\n\n"}

He is best known for the autobiographical monologues that he wrote and performed for the theater in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as for his film adaptations of these works, beginning in 1987. He wrote and starred in several, working with different directors.\n\nTheater critics John Willis and Ben Hodges described his monologue work as \"trenchant, personal narratives delivered on sparse, unadorned sets with a dry, WASP, quiet mania.\" Gray achieved renown for his monologue \"Swimming to Cambodia\", which he adapted as a 1987 film in which he starred; it was directed by Jonathan Demme. Other of his monologues which Gray adapted for film were \"Monster in a Box\" (1991), directed by Nick Broomfield, and \"Gray's Anatomy\" (1996), directed by Steven Soderbergh.\n\nGray is believed to have committed suicide in New York City in January 2004, after struggling with depression and severe injuries following a car accident. Steven Soderbergh made a documentary film about Gray's life entitled \"And Everything Is Going Fine\" (2010). An unfinished monologue and a selection from his journals were published in 2005 and 2011, respectively.\n\nSpalding Rockwell Gray was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Rockwell Gray, Sr., the treasurer of Brown & Sharpe and Margaret Elizabeth \"Betty\" (née Horton). He was the middle-born of three sons; his brothers were Rockwell, Jr. and Channing. They were raised in the Christian Science faith of their mother. Gray and his brothers grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island, spending summers at their grandmother's house in Newport, Rhode Island. Rockwell became a literature professor at Washington University in Saint Louis, and Channing a journalist in Rhode Island.\n\nAfter graduating from Fryeburg Academy in Fryeburg, Maine, Gray enrolled at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, as a poetry major. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1963.\n\nIn 1965, Gray moved to San Francisco, California, where he became a speaker and teacher of poetry at the Esalen Institute. In 1967, while Gray was vacationing in Mexico City, his mother committed suicide at age 52. She had suffered from depression. After his mother's death, Gray returned to the East Coast and settled permanently in New York City. Gray's books \"Impossible Vacation\" and \"Sex and Death to the Age 14\" are largely based on his childhood and early adulthood.\n\nGray began his theater career in New York in the late 1960s. In 1970, he joined Richard Schechner's experimental troupe, The Performance Group. With actors from The Performance Group, including Willem Dafoe and Elizabeth LeCompte, Gray helped to co-found the theater company The Wooster Group. He worked with them from 1975 to 1980, before leaving the company to focus on his monologue work. During this time, he also appeared in adult films, having a featured role in \"Farmer's Daughters\" (1976) and appearing in Radley Metzer's \"Maraschino Cherry\" (1978),\n\nGray first achieved prominence in the United States with the film version of his monologue \"Swimming to Cambodia.\" He had performed this monologue in New York City, and published it as a book in 1985. He adapted it as a film in 1987, directed by Jonathan Demme. This work was based on his experience in Thailand during filming a small role in \"The Killing Fields\" (1984), about the war in Cambodia.\n\nIn 1987 Gray traveled to Nicaragua with Office of the Americas. He wrote an unproduced screenplay based on the experience. Some of his experiences there were documented in \"Monster in a Box\".\n\nGray received a Guggenheim Fellowship and the National Book Award in 1985 for this work. He continued to write and perform monologues until his death. Through 1993, these works often incorporated his relationship to his girlfriend Renée Shafransky. They married and she became his collaborator. He later married Kathleen Russo.\n\nGray's success with his monologues brought him various supporting movie roles. He also played the lead role of the Stage Manager in a high-profile 1988 revival of Thornton Wilder's play \"Our Town\" by the Lincoln Center Theater.\n\nIn 1992, Gray published his only novel, \"Impossible Vacation.\" The novel reflects elements of Gray's life, including his upbringing as a Christian Scientist, his WASP background, and his mother's suicide. Gray wrote a subsequent monologue related to his experiences in writing and promoting this book, entitled \"Monster in a Box\".\n\nDuring an interview in 1997 with film critic Edward Vilga, Gray was asked whether the movie industry was \"confused\" by his writings and roles. He responded:\n\nGray's performance style relied upon an impressionistic use of memories rather than a recounting of chronological facts. Gray referred to his style of monologue as resulting from a sort of \"poetic journalism.\"\n\nIn June 2001, Gray suffered severe injuries in a car crash while on vacation in Ireland. In the crash, Gray suffered a broken hip, which left his right leg almost immobilized, and a fracture in his skull. During surgery on his skull, a titanium plate was placed over the break after surgeons removed dozens of bone fragments from his frontal cortex. A jagged scar on his forehead was a reminder of the injury. He struggled to recover from his injuries and a severe depression that set in some time after the accident. He had already struggled intermittently with depression in his life. Suffering both from physical impairment and ongoing depression, Gray struggled for months and was treated with a variety of different therapies.\n\nGray sought treatment from neurologist Oliver Sacks, who began treating Gray in August 2003 and continued to do so until almost the time of Gray's death. Sacks later said Gray perceived the taking of his own life as part of what he had to say, with the monologuist having \"talked about what he called 'a creative suicide.' On one occasion, when he was being interviewed, he thought that the interview might be culminated with a 'dramatic and creative suicide. ... I was at pains to say that he would be much more creative alive than dead.\"\n\nOn January 9, 2004, Gray had an interview with Theresa Smalec, the subject of which was Ron Vawter, a deceased friend and colleague whom he had met in the winter of 1972–73. Gray and Vawter had worked closely together throughout the 1970s, first with The Performance Group, then as core members of The Wooster Group (founded by Gray and Elizabeth LeCompte). The edited transcript of \"Spalding Gray's Last Interview\" was published in 2008 by the \"New England Theatre Journal\".\n\nOn January 11, 2004, Gray was declared missing. The night before his disappearance, he had taken his children to see Tim Burton's film \"Big Fish.\" It ends with the line, \"A man tells a story over and over so many times he becomes the story. In that way, he is immortal.\" Gray's widow, Kathie Russo, said after he disappeared, \"You know, Spalding cried after he saw that movie. I just think it gave him permission. I think it gave him permission to die.\"\n\nWhen Gray was first reported missing, his profile was featured on the Fox Network television show \"America's Most Wanted.\"\n\nOn March 7, 2004, the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York reported that Gray's body was discovered by two men and pulled from the East River. One of the men gave an interview about the incident. It is believed that Gray jumped off the side of the Staten Island Ferry. Gray had previously attempted suicide in 2002; in addition, he had a history of depression, and his mother had killed herself in 1967. Gray was reported to have been working on a new monologue at the time of his death. There was speculation that his revisiting the material of the car crash in Ireland and his subsequent attempts to recover from his injuries might have triggered a final bout of depression.\n\nGray was buried at Oakland Cemetery in Sag Harbor, New York. He was survived by his wife Kathie Russo, stepdaughter Marissa, sons Forrest Dylan Gray and Theo Spalding Gray, and brothers Rockwell and Channing Gray.\n\nTheater historian Don Wilmeth noted Gray's contribution to a unique style of writing and acting: \nDescribing the play-film monologue, theatre director Mark Russell wrote: \nJournalist and author Roger Rosenblatt, described Gray as \nDirector Jonathan Demme said of Gray, \"Spalding's unfailing ability to ignite universal emotions and laughter in all of us while gloriously wallowing in his own exquisite uniqueness will remain forever one of the great joys of American performance and literature\".\n\n\"He took the anarchy and illogic of life and molded it into something we could grab a hold of,\" said actor and novelist Eric Bogosian. \"It took courage to do what Spalding did, courage to make theatre so naked and unadorned, to expose himself in this way and to fight his demons in public.\"\n\nTheater critic Mel Gussow wrote of Gray's \"Swimming to Cambodia\" and \"Terrors of Pleasure\" that \"Through a look or a comment, he offers intelligent analysis. Though the narrative is entirely centered around Mr. Gray himself, it never suffers from self-pity or self-indulgence. He remains the antihero in his own fascinating life story, the never ending tale of EverySpalding.\"\n\nIn 2005, Gray's unfinished final monologue was published in a hardcover edition entitled \"Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue.\" The monologue, which Gray had performed in one of his last public appearances, is augmented by two additional pieces he performed at the time, a short remembrance called \"The Anniversary\" and an open letter to New York City written in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Also included in the book is an extensive collection of remembrances and tributes from fellow performers and friends.\n\nThe 2007 play \"Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell,\" produced at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, is based on his monologues and journals. Kathleen Russo, his widow, developed the concept for the play. The show has a cast of four actors as well as a rotating guest artist; all five read from selected portions of his work.\n\nIn January 2010, Steven Soderbergh's documentary about Gray, \"And Everything Is Going Fine,\" was released at Utah's Slamdance Film Festival. The film was compiled from film and video clips of Gray's early life and career. His widow said that Soderbergh \"wanted Spalding to tell the story, as if it was his last monologue, and I think he accomplished that\".\n\nIn 2011 a selection from his journals was published as \"The Journals of Spalding Gray,\" edited by Nell Casey, who had worked with his widow Kathie Russo on the project. Dwight Garner thought this material was less interesting than Spalding's monologues. He said they have value as a \"portrait of a theatrical coming of age\" as Gray determined how to make his art. Garner notes, \"His art, these journals make clear, is what kept him alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.\n\nDuring her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet Léopold Sédar Senghor, who introduced her to Aimé Césaire, a fellow student at the École normale supérieure. The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris. During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, \"L'Étudiant noir\". In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher. They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.\n\nSuzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal \"Tropiques\", of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and René Ménil, both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.\n\nWhile her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology \"The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean\" (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.\n\nCésaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”. In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:\n\n“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”\n\nSuzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with André Breton following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941). This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism \n\nHer writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of \"Tropiques\" can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. \"Tropiques\" was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature. Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success. She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of \"Tropiques\" towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing. The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue. Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of \"Tropiques\", published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.\n\n\"Tropiques\" published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two. With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire. Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.\n\nHaving stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti. She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.\n\nSuzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of \"Tropiques\", she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed \"Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire\" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]\nHer encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - \"La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas\" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

TTÜ, in the capital city of Tallinn, is a university for engineering, business, and public administration. TTÜ has colleges in Tallinn, Tartu, Kuressaare and Kohtla-Järve. Despite the similar names, Tallinn University and Tallinn University of Technology are separate institutions.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Estonia recognised an urgent need for locally trained engineering specialists. Until then, young people from Estonia had received their specialist education in St. Petersburg, Germany or Riga. Opportunities had to be sought for engineering-minded people to acquire an Estonian-based education which was adapted to local conditions and needs; Estonia was in the process of establishing itself as an independent country.\n\nOn 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses. That date has been recognised as the founding date of the Tallinn University of Technology. Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture. In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution. Teachers' efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published. In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia. In the same year, a state laboratory of materials testing opened for research work.\n\nBy the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named the Tallinn Technical Institute. The institute had two faculties: civil and mechanical engineering and chemistry and mining. In 1938, the name Tallinn Technical University (TTU) was effective. In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded. After 2003 the university was known in English as the Tallinn University of Technology (TTÜ).\n\nOn 1 July 2008, TTÜ took over International University Audentes (IUA), which became part of the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, except the Law School which joined the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 2014 an agreement for merger of the Estonian Maritime Academy with TTÜ was signed.\n\nOn 16 November 2016, TTÜ and the Estonian Information Technology College signed a merger agreement. Since 1 August 2017, the IT College is a part of TTÜ.\n\nThere are over 30 fully accredited international degree programmes (4 Bachelor programmes, 18 Master programmes and 10 PhD programmes) that are available fully in English.\n\nTTÜ conducts research and develops high-tech applications in many fields: \n\nTallinn University of Technology is the third highest ranking university in the Baltic states, placing in the 601-800 bracket in Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016-17 and in the 601-650 bracket in QS World University rankings (behind Tartu University and Vilnius University). In QS University Rankings for Eastern Europe and Central Asia 2016, TTÜ ranked 30th, placing it among the top ten technical universities in the region and confirming its status as the best technical university in the Baltics.\n\n\n\nThe internationalization of higher education is one of the key strategic goals of Tallinn University of Technology. The university offers over 30 degree programmes in English: 5 Bachelor programmes, 18 Master programmes and 10 PhD programmes.\n\nBachelor's level programmes:\n\nMaster's level programmes:\nPhD programmes:\n\nBesides the entire technological elite of Estonia, alumni include numerous industrialists and businessmen, including Hardi Meybaum, the CEO and a co-founder of GrabCAD; the Chairman of the Estonian Chamber of Commerce, Toomas Luman, the former Prime Minister and eminent industrialist Tiit Vähi, as well as Chief information officer of Estonian Government and leader of e-residency programme Taavi Kotka. The Vice President and former President of the Estonian Academy of Science, Jüri Engelbrecht, is also a TTÜ graduate.\n\nThe cooperation, especially with European universities is more focused for curricula development, project cooperation and networking.

{"id": "449826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449826", "title": "U.S. News &amp; World Report", "text": "U.S. News &amp; World Report\n\nU.S. News & World Report is an American media company that publishes news, opinion, consumer advice, rankings, and analysis. Founded as a newsweekly magazine in 1933, U.S. News transitioned to primarily web-based publishing in 2010. \"U.S. News\" is best known today for its influential Best Colleges and Best Hospitals rankings, but it has expanded its content and product offerings in education, health, money, careers, travel, and cars. The rankings are popular in North America but have drawn widespread criticism from colleges, administrations, and students for their dubious, disparate, and arbitrary nature. The ranking system by \"U.S. News\" is usually contrasted with the \"Washington Monthly\" and \"Forbes\" rankings.\n\nUnited States News was founded in 1933 by David Lawrence (1888–1973), who also started World Report in 1946. The two magazines covered national and international news separately, but Lawrence merged them into \"U.S. News & World Report\" in 1948. He subsequently sold the magazine to his employees. Historically, the magazine tended to be slightly more conservative than its two primary competitors, \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\", and focused more on economic, health, and education stories. It also eschewed sports, entertainment, and celebrity news. Important milestones in the early history of the magazine include the introduction of the \"Washington Whispers\" column in 1934 and the \"News You Can Use\" column in 1952. In 1958, the weekly magazine's circulation passed one million and reached two million by 1973.\n\nSince 1983, it has become known primarily for its influential ranking and annual reports of colleges and graduate schools, spanning across most fields and subjects. \"U.S. News & World Report\" is America's oldest and best-known ranker of academic institutions, and covers the fields of business, law, medicine, engineering, education, social sciences and public affairs, in addition to many other areas. Its print edition was consistently included in national bestseller lists, augmented by online subscriptions. Additional rankings published by \"U.S. News & World Report\" include hospitals, medical specialties and automobiles.\n\nIn October 1984, publisher and real estate developer Mortimer Zuckerman purchased U.S. News & World Report. Zuckerman is also formerly the owner of the \"New York Daily News\". In 1993, \"U.S. News & World Report\" entered the digital world by providing content to CompuServe and in 1995, the website usnews.com was launched. In 2001, the website won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence Online. In 2007, \"U.S. News & World Report\" published its first list of the nation's best high schools. Its ranking methodology includes state test scores and the success of poor and minority students on these exams, and schools' performance in Advanced Placement exams.\n\nStarting in June 2008, the magazine reduced its publication frequency in three steps. In June 2008, citing the decline overall magazine circulation and advertising, \"U.S. News & World Report\" announced that it would become a biweekly publication, starting January 2009. It hoped advertisers would be attracted to the schedule, which allowed ads to stay on newsstands a week longer. However, five months later the magazine changed its frequency again, becoming monthly. In August 2008, \"U.S. News\" expanded and revamped its online opinion section. The new version of the opinion page included daily new op-ed content as well as the new Thomas Jefferson Street blog. An internal memo was sent on November 5, 2010, to the staff of the magazine informing them that the \"December issue will be our last print monthly sent to subscribers, whose remaining print and digital replica subscriptions will be filled by other publishers.\" The memo went on to say that the publication would be moving to a primarily digital format but that it would continue to print special issues such as \"the college and grad guides, as well as hospital and personal finance guides.\" Prior to going defunct, \"U.S. News\" was the lowest-ranking news magazine in the U.S., after \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\". A weekly digital magazine, \"U.S. News Weekly\", introduced in January 2009, continued to offer subscription content until it ceased at the end of April 2015.\n\nThe company is owned by U.S. News & World Report, L.P., a privately held company based in the \"Daily News\" building in New York City. The editorial staff is headquartered in Washington, D.C. The company's move to the Web made it possible for \"U.S. News & World Report\" to expand its service journalism with the introduction of several consumer-facing rankings products. The company returned to profitability in 2013. The editorial staff of U.S. News & World Report is based in Washington, D.C. and Brian Kelly has been the chief content officer since April 2007. The company is owned by media proprietor Mortimer Zuckerman.\n\nThe first of the U.S. News & World Report's famous rankings was its \"Who Runs America?\" surveys. These ran in the spring of each year from 1974 to 1986. The magazine would have a cover typically featuring persons selected by the USN & WR as being the ten most powerful persons in the United States. Every single edition of the series listed the President of the United States as the most powerful person, but the #2 position included such persons as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (1974), Federal Reserve Chairmen Paul Volcker and Arthur Burns (each listed multiple years) and US Senator Edward Kennedy (1979). While most of the top ten each year were officials in government, occasionally others were included, including TV anchormen Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather, Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman David Rockefeller, AFL-CIO leader George Meany, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. The only woman to make the top ten list was First Lady Rosalynn Carter in 1980.\n\nIn addition to these overall top ten persons, the publication also included top persons in each of several fields, including Education, Business, Finance, Journalism, and many other areas. The survey was discontinued after 1986.\n\nIn 1983, \"U.S. News & World Report\" published its first \"America's Best Colleges\" report. The rankings have been compiled and published annually since 1987. These rankings are based upon data that \"U.S. News & World Report\" collects from each educational institution from an annual survey sent to each school. The rankings are also based upon opinion surveys of university faculties and administrators who do not belong to the schools. In addition to colleges, \"U.S. News & World Report\" also ranks graduate schools and academic programs in a number of specific disciplines, including business, law, engineering, nursing, and medicine.\n\nThe popularity of U.S. News & World Report's Best Colleges rankings is reflected in its 2014 release, which brought 2.6 million unique visitors and 18.9 million page views to usnews.com in one day. Traffic came from over 3,000 sites, including Facebook and Google. U.S. News & World Report continues to publish comprehensive college guides in book form. Robert Morse created the U.S. News Best Colleges rankings methodology, and continues to oversee its application as chief data strategist at U.S. News. In 2014, \"The Washington Post\" featured a profile of Morse, exploring his 30-year career with the publication.\n\nDuring the 1990s, several educational institutions in the United States were involved in a movement to boycott the \"U.S. News & World Report\" college rankings survey. The first was Reed College, which stopped submitting the survey in 1995. The survey was also criticized by Alma College, Stanford University, and St. John's College during the late 1990s. SAT scores play a role in The \"U.S. News & World Report\" college rankings even though \"U.S. News\" is not empowered with the ability to formally verify or recalculate the scores that are represented to them by schools. Since the mid-1990s there have been many instances documented by the popular press wherein schools lied about their SAT scores in order to obtain a higher ranking. An exposé in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" stated that the elements in the methodology of \"U.S News & World Report's\" rankings are redundant and can be reduced to one thing: money. On June 19, 2007, during the annual meeting of the Annapolis Group, members discussed the letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the \"reputation survey\" section of the \"U.S. News & World Report\" survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking).\n\nAs a result, \"a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the \"U.S. News\" reputational rankings in the future.\" The statement also said that its members \"have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process.\" This database will be web-based and developed in conjunction with higher-education organizations including the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU) and the Council of Independent Colleges.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, \"U.S. News & World Report\" editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, \"in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at \"U.S. News\" firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the 'intangibles' of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges.\" In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, \"It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] \"U.S. News\" has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. \"U.S. News\" first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of \"U.S. News\".\"\n\nSome higher education experts, such as Kevin Carey of Education Sector, have asserted that \"U.S. News & World Report\"'s college rankings system is merely a list of criteria that mirrors the superficial characteristics of elite colleges and universities. According to Carey, the \"U.S. News\" ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity. He suggests that there are more important characteristics parents and students should research to select colleges, such as how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.\n\nThe question of college rankings and their impact on admissions gained greater attention in March 2007, when Dr. Michele Tolela Myers (the former President of Sarah Lawrence College) shared in an op-ed that the \"U.S. News & World Report\", when not given SAT scores for a university, chooses to simply rank the college with an invented SAT score of approximately one standard deviation (roughly 200 SAT points) behind those of peer colleges, with the reasoning being that SAT-optional universities will, because of their test-optional nature, accept higher numbers of less academically capable students.\n\nIn a 2011 article regarding the Sarah Lawrence controversy, Peter Sacks of \"The Huffington Post\" criticized the \"U.S. News\" rankings' centering on test scores and denounced the magazine's \"best colleges\" list as a scam:\n\nIn the \"U.S. News\" worldview of college quality, it matters not a bit what students actually learn on campus, or how a college actually contributes to the intellectual, ethical and personal growth of students while on campus, or how that institution contributes to the public good [...] and then, when you consider that student SAT scores are profoundly correlated [to] parental income and education levels – the social class that a child is born into and grows up with – you begin to understand what a corrupt emperor 'America's Best Colleges' really is. The ranking amounts to little more than a pseudo-scientific and yet popularly legitimate tool for perpetuating inequality between educational haves and have nots – the rich families from the poor ones, and the well-endowed schools from the poorly endowed ones.\n\nIn October 2014, the \"U.S. News & World Report\" published its inaugural \"Best Global Universities\" rankings. \"Inside Higher Ed\" noted that the \"U.S. News\" is entering into the international college and university rankings area that is already \"dominated by three major global university rankings,\" namely the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\", the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\", and the \"QS World University Rankings\". Robert Morse stated that \"it's natural for \"U.S. News\" to get into this space.\" Morse also noted that the \"U.S. News\" \"will also be the first American publisher to enter the global rankings space.\"\n\nSince 1990, \"U.S. News & World Report\" has compiled the Best Hospitals rankings. The Best Hospitals rankings are specifically based on a different methodology that looks at difficult (high acuity) cases within 16 specialties, including cancer; diabetes and endocrinology; ear, nose and throat; gastroenterology; geriatrics; gynecology; heart and heart surgery; kidney disorders; neurology and neurosurgery; ophthalmology; orthopedics; psychiatry; pulmonology; rehabilitation; rheumatology; and urology. In addition to rankings for each of these specialties, hospitals that excel in many \"U.S. News\" areas are ranked in the Honor Roll.\n\nSince 2007, U.S. News has developed an innovative rankings system for new and used automobiles. The rankings span over 30 classes of cars, trucks, SUVs, minivans, wagons, and sports cars. Each automobile receives an overall score, as well as a performance, interior, and recommendation score to the nearest tenth on a 1-10 scale. Scores are based on the consensus opinion of America's trusted automotive experts, as well as reliability and safety data. U.S. News also produces annual \"Best Cars for the Money\" and \"Best Cars for Families\" awards across approximately 20 classes of cars, trucks, SUVs, and minivans. Money award winners are derived by combining vehicle price and five-year cost of ownership with the opinion of the automotive press, while family awards are tabulated by combining critics' opinions with the vehicle's availability of family-friendly features and interior space, as well as safety and reliability data. Money and family award winners are announced in February and March of each year, respectively.\n\nIn 2017, U.S. News published its first ranking of all 50 U.S. states, incorporating metrics in seven categories: health care, education, crime and corrections, infrastructure, opportunity, economy, and government. The weighting of the individual categories in determining overall rank was informed by surveys on what matters most to residents. Massachusetts occupies the top rank of the 2017 list, with an overall #2 ranking in health care and #1 ranking in education.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7712696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712696", "title": "Yale-China Association", "text": "Yale-China Association\n\nThe Yale-China Association (), formerly Yale-in-China, is an independent, nonprofit organization which seeks to develop educational programs in and about China and further understanding between Chinese and American people. Founded in 1901 and originally a Protestant missionary society, Yale-China's work is characterized by long-term relationships to build Chinese institutional capacity. Current programs include the fields of public health and nursing, legal education, English language instruction, American Studies, and cultural exchange for Chinese and American students. Publications include a regular newsletter, biennial report, and the annual Yale-China Health Journal.\n\nThe Yale-China Association was first incorporated as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society, and was known informally as Yale-in-China as early as 1913. It was nondenominational from its beginnings and by the 1920s had ceased to be an overtly missionary enterprise. It was re-incorporated in 1934 as a secular organization, the Yale-in-China Association, and in 1975 as the Yale–China Association.\n\nA reflection of the religious fervor sweeping American college campuses at the end of the 19th century, which took form in the Student Volunteer Movement, Yale-China was founded in 1901 as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society by a group of Yale graduates and faculty members committed to establishing a Christian missionary presence overseas. The founders chose China as the focus of their work, in part to honor the memory of a Yale graduate from the class of 1892, Horace Tracy Pitkin, who had worked in China as a missionary and was killed in 1900 during the Boxer Uprising. The city of Changsha in Hunan Province was chosen as the base of operations in China after consultation with other foreign missionaries.\n\nAt the urging of the home office in New Haven as well as other missionaries in China, the Yale Mission early on assumed more of an educational than evangelical function. With the arrival of Dr. Edward H. Hume in 1905, medical education and care became a major focus of the endeavor. The educational compound that began with Dr. Hume's medical clinic eventually grew to comprise a preparatory school, the Yali School; the College of Yale-in-China (later moved to Wuhan, where it joined two other missionary colleges to form Huachung University); and the Hsiang-Ya Medical College, Nursing School and Hospital. Over the years, Hsiang-Ya (a compound of hsiang, denoting Hunan, and ya, denoting Yale-China; transliterated today as Xiangya) developed a reputation for providing the most advanced training in Western medicine in all of central and southern China. More than at other foreign-affiliated institutions, an effort was made early on to bring as many Chinese faculty and administrators on board as possible. By the late 1920s, all major leadership positions were held by Chinese, and Yale-in-China was very much a joint Sino-American enterprise.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1920, future Chairman Mao Zedong had several encounters with the school: he edited its student magazine, re-focusing it on \"thought reorientation,\" and operated a bookshop out of its medical college.\n\nThe war years (1937–45) placed enormous strains on the Yale-in-China institutions, especially the Hsiang-Ya Hospital, which cared for war casualties and refugees. For example, the life of paralyzed Frank Wattendorf was spared at the hospital before he was evacuated.\n\nMany of the Changsha facilities were damaged by invading Japanese troops. Nevertheless, these challenges served to inspire renewed commitment on the part of both American and Chinese faculty and administrators. The Yale-in-China staff who returned to Changsha in September 1945 were determined to rebuild the campus and resume their pre-war operations. Within four years, however, a Communist insurgency toppled the Nationalist government and Yale-in-China's future seemed uncertain in the face of growing hostility between the United States and China.\n\nBy 1951, the new Communist government had taken possession of Yale-in-China's Changsha properties and renamed the Yali School as \"Liberation Middle School.\" Dr. Dwight Rugh, Yale-in-China's last representative in Changsha, spent most of 1950 under house arrest as the only American on campus, and was eventually expelled from China in May 1951. With his departure, the ties between Yale-in-China in New Haven and the institutions in Changsha and Wuhan were broken for nearly 30 years.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1954, hostility against the United States on the mainland and turmoil on Nationalist-held Taiwan led to a suspension of Yale-in-China's work within China. Preston Schoyer, who had been a Bachelor in Changsha before the war, worked both formally and informally to develop new programs and maintain ties with old friends. During those years, Yale-in-China devoted its resources to financing the education of Chinese students in the U.S. while looking in Asia for new projects to support. Attention soon focused on a refugee college in the British colony of Hong Kong which had been founded by Ch'ien Mu (1895–1990) and other Chinese intellectuals determined to preserve traditional Chinese learning and values in the face of the Communist victory on the mainland. In early 1954, after a visit to the colony and months of negotiations, Yale-in-China's trustees formally affiliated the organization with New Asia College.\n\nUnlike in Changsha, Yale-in-China's relationship with New Asia College was, by intention, one of support and assistance rather than direct administration. Yale-in-China secured funding from the Ford Foundation and other U.S. foundations to support the development of the college, and also provided fellowships for New Asia faculty to pursue further study in the United States. In 1956, Yale-in-China resumed the practice of sending Bachelors, two recent Yale graduates, to teach English, though now to New Asia College instead of the Yali School.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the possibility of founding a university in Hong Kong that would use Chinese as the language of instruction was explored. In 1959, the Council of British Universities selected New Asia, United and Chung Chi colleges to federate and form the new Chinese University of Hong Kong, which was formally inaugurated in 1963 on its Shatin campus. Preston Schoyer played a key role in negotiating New Asia's entrance. Yale-in-China contributed to the new campus by securing funds to construct buildings, including the university health clinic, the Yali Guest House, Friendship Lodge and a student dormitory at New Asia College. Yale-in-China also contributed to the early internationalization of the campus by helping to establish the New Asia - Yale-in-China Chinese Language Centre and the International Asian Studies Programme, which now enroll hundreds of international students every year. Meanwhile, the relationship with New Asia College, where the Yale–China Association (as the organization was renamed in 1975) has maintained a representative office for fifty years, remains a strong one.\n\nBy the 1970s, both New Asia College and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had achieved a level of institutional maturity and financial stability that decreased the need for Yale-China's contributions. At the same time, the normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China presented the possibility of resumed activity on the mainland. In the fall of 1979, Yale-China staff traveled to Changsha to explore opportunities for academic exchange with administrators and faculty at Hunan Medical College, the successor to Hsiang-Ya, and several exchange agreements were concluded that led to the arrival of Yale-China English teachers in September 1980 and exchanges of medical personnel between Yale University and Hunan Medical College. Two English instructors were also sent to Wuhan University the same year and later to Huazhong Normal University.\n\nDespite the geographical continuities, however, the intervening years had brought substantial changes to Chinese higher education and within Yale-China itself. Political sensitivities in China and Yale-China's own evolution determined that any new activity in China would be of a nature substantially different from that of the pre-1949 years. Rather than seeking to resume the joint administration of the former Yale-in-China institutions, the emphasis was placed on shorter-term academic exchanges in the fields of medicine and American Studies and a resumption of the English language instruction program. Throughout the 1980s, Yale-China's medical program brought almost 50 Chinese medical personnel to the U.S. and sent over 40 Americans to China for exchanges of medical knowledge. During the same years, nearly 100 Yale graduates participated in Yale-China's English teaching program in China. Yale-China also continued to send English teachers to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and maintained its involvement with the university's International Asian Studies Program.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s brought an expansion of Yale-China's activities into new program areas and affiliations with institutions outside of Yale-China's historical bases in Hong Kong, Changsha and Wuhan. While maintaining its English teaching program, Yale-China initiated projects in environmental protection and pediatric cardiology and facilitated a drama collaboration between New Haven's Long Wharf Theater and the Shanghai People's Art Theater which resulted in a Chinese-language stage production of Amy Tan's \"Joy Luck Club\" in 1994. Other areas of expansion have included the fields of American Studies, legal education, public health, nursing, and service in the non-profit sector for China and American students.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5502920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5502920", "title": "Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies", "text": "Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies\n\nThe Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies (F&ES) is a professional school of Yale University. It was founded to train foresters, and now trains environmental leaders through four 2-year degree programs (Master of Environmental Management, Master of Environmental Science, Master of Forestry, and Master of Forest Science) and two 10-month mid-career programs. Yale F&ES strives to create new knowledge that will sustain and restore the health of the biosphere and emphasizes the possibility of creating a regenerative coexistence between humans and non-human life and the rest of the natural world. Still offering forestry instruction, the school has the oldest graduate forestry program in the United States.\n\nThe school was founded in 1900 as the Yale Forest School, to provide high-level forestry training suited to American conditions. At the urging of Yale alumnus Gifford Pinchot, his parents endowed the two-year postgraduate program. At the time Pinchot was serving as Bernhard Fernow's successor as Chief of the Division of Forestry (predecessor of the U.S. Forest Service, USFS). Pinchot released two foresters from the division to start the school: fellow Yale graduate Henry Solon Graves and James Toumey. Graves became the School's first dean and Toumey its second.\n\nWhen the school opened, other places in the United States offered forestry training, but none had a post-graduate program. (Both Pinchot and Graves had gone to Europe to study forestry after graduating from Yale.) In the fall of 1900, the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell had 24 students, Biltmore Forest School 9, and Yale 7. Despite its small size, from its beginnings the school influenced American forestry. The first two chiefs of the USFS were Pinchot and Graves; the next three were graduates from the school's first decade. Wilderness and land conservation advocate Aldo Leopold graduated in the class of 1908.\n\nIn 1915, Yale School of Forestry's second dean, James Toumey, became one of the \"charter members\", along with William L. Bray of the New York State College of Forestry, by then reestablished at Syracuse University, and Raphael Zon, of the Ecological Society of America. In 1950, the \"activist wing\" of that society formed The Nature Conservancy.\n\nBesides the school's own forests, Yale has used a number of other sites in the eastern United States for field education over the years. From 1904 to 1926, the summer session leading to a master's degree in forestry was held at Grey Towers and Forester's Hall in Milford, Pennsylvania. Beginning in 1912, Yale classes took occasional field trips to the land of the Crossett Lumber Company in Arkansas. For two decades from 1946 until 1966, the company provided the school a \"camp,\" including cabins and a mess hall, used during spring coursework on forest management and wood products production. Yale students have also used a field camp at the Great Mountain Forest in northwestern Connecticut since 1941.\n\nReflective of the expanding variety of environmental interests, the school changed its name to the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1972. Today, F&ES is a leader in global sustainability, hosting the bi-annual Yale Environmental Sustainability Summit to assemble thought leaders from around the globe. The school's 16th and present dean is Ingrid \"Indy\" Burke, who replaced Sir Peter Crane in October, 2016.\n\nThe school offers classes at Kroon Hall, Sage Hall, Greeley Labs, Marsh Hall, the Environmental Science Center, the houses at 301 Prospect St. and 380 Edwards St., and teaches the Yale College undergraduate courses needed for the Environmental Studies major. Kroon Hall, the school's main building, is named for the philanthropist Richard Kroon (Yale Class of 1964). The building has of space. It is \"a showcase of the latest developments in green building technology, a healthy and supportive environment for work and study, and a beautiful building that actively connects students, faculty, staff, and visitors with the natural world.\" The building obtained Platinum Rating under the LEED certification system. It is designed by Hopkins Architects of London with Architect of Record Centerbrook Architects. Goodfellow Inc from Delson, Quebec, supplied the glulam roof structure for this project.\n\n\nThe school owns and manages of forestland in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The Yale-Myers Forest, in Union, Connecticut, donated to Yale in 1930 by alumnus George Hewitt Myers, is managed by the school as a multiple-use working forest. Yale-Toumey Forest, near Keene, New Hampshire, was set up by James W. Toumey (a former dean of the school) in 1913. Other Yale forestlands include Goss Woods, Crowell Forest, Cross Woods, Bowen Forest, and Crowell Ravine. A three-alarm fire burned several buildings within the Yale Myers Forest Camp on May 28th, 2016. Rebuilding efforts are ongoing.\n\nThe school has an active tradition of student involvement in academic and extracurricular life. Many students take part in student interest groups, which organize events around environmental issues of interest to them. These groups range in interest from Conservation Finance and International Development, to the Built Environment and \"Fresh & Salty: The Society for Marine and Coastal systems\". There are also social and recreational groups, such as the Forestry Club, which every Friday organizes themed \"TGIF\" (\"Thank-God-I'm-a-Forester\") happy hours and school parties; the Polar Bear club, which swims monthly in Long Island Sound under the full moon (year-round); Veggie Dinner, which is a weekly vegetarian dinner club; the Loggerrhythms, an a cappella singing group; and the student-run BYO Café in Kroon Hall opened in 2010. A notable F&ES tradition is the extravagant environmentally inspired decoration of graduation caps in preparation for commencement.\n\n"}
