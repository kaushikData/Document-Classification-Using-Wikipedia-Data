The other 7 members, or sponsors, of ICETE cover the other continents. ATA is a nongovernmental association formed by evangelical Christians in Asia to confer accreditation to theological institutions in Asia.\n\nATA was formally established in 1970 as a direct outcome of the Asia-South Pacific Congress of Evangelism held in Singapore in 1968. It grew out of a concern that \"evangelicals had neglected theological scholarship in the past and that the Asian church leadership was increasingly being influenced by Western liberal theology.\" Its primary goal was to develop \"evangelical scholars, thinkers and teachers\" for the leadership of the Asian church.\n\nAccreditation services were rendered to institutions in 1978. Since then, it has developed in serving its member theological institutions in teaching evangelical biblical theology and in the training of Christian pastors and church workers. Its operating principles include strengthening partnership, enhancing scholarship, furthering academic excellence, fostering spiritual and ministerial formation, and mobilizing resources to fulfill global Christian mission within diverse Asian cultures. The main reason for the establishment of ATA was to be an aid to theological institutions in contextualising theology in the Asian context. Through this Christian pastors and Christian churches can be aided to be more effective in supporting Christian ministry more effectively with other Asians in their own context. Today the majority of Evangelical Bible colleges in Asia are members of ATA.\n\nThe ATA's Statement of Faith indicates that theologically it \"follows mainstream evangelicalism in the west.\"\n\nAsia Theological Association accredits theological seminaries in the Asian region.\nATA is the Asian sponsor of the International Council for Evangelical Theological Education (ICETE), the theological education network covering all the continents that operates under the auspices of the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA).

It began in 2000, and since then the Bristol Dinosaur Project team has visited hundreds of schools and spoken to tens of thousands of children, as well as appearing at science fairs in Bristol and elsewhere.\n\nThe Bristol dinosaur, \"Thecodontosaurus antiquus\", was found in 1834, and named in 1836, and did not achieve much recognition locally, either at the time of discovery, in the 1830s, nor later, when it was restudied, in the 1870s, 1900s, or 1990s. Then, after the re-examination of specimens collected in the 1830s, still located in Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, and the collection of additional specimens from Tytherington quarry, in the 1970s, local palaeontologists and geologists realised there was potential to use the newly reinvigorated research programme as a means to include the public, especially local children, in the excitement of scientific discovery.\n\nInitially, the Bristol Dinosaur Project was funded by the University of Bristol using widening participation funds. These were funds intended to reach out to local schools that did not have a reputation for sending many children to university. By sending students to visit those schools, it was hoped that children might be inspired, work hard, and then later apply to study at university.\n\nThen, the Bristol Dinosaur Project received substantial funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and it was able to operate at a much more ambitious level, from 2010-2013. After that funding cycle, the University of Bristol continued funding of the project for widening participation purposes.\n\nFrom the start, the Bristol Dinosaur Project sought to engage children in two age groups, 7-9-year olds, and 14-15-year olds. With younger children, it has always been very easy to engage their enthusiasm - it is enough to pass round a dinosaur bone or tooth, and they are thrilled to be handling the real thing. With the teenagers, it is more important to let them see how much fun a career in science, or a related field, can be. At that age, young people are making important choices that may affect the rest of their lives - whether to engage with their academic studies or not, whether to focus on science or other disciplines.\n\nA recent evaluation report about the Bristol Dinosaur Project by David Owen, summarised the learning and engagement side of the project as follows:\n\nSince May 2010 the project engaged with over 136 schools and more than 13,200 pupils. The majority of these pupils were Key Stage 1-2 (11,000) with the remainder being Key Stage 3-4 (2,000). In total the project delivered 216 day visits to schools, reaching schools across Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset. The project also visited some schools in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, South Wales, Gloucestershire and one in the West Midlands. Interviews confirmed that the project had developed an excellent reputation across the city with teachers, schools and organisations that support schools. This was largely attributed to the high quality resources and the professionalism of the volunteers and staff delivering the workshop. A major part of the schools’ outreach was the development of fossil walks; these were particularly targeted at Key Stage 3-4. Young people had the chance to visit Aust Cliffs, South Gloucestershire or Charmouth, Dorset, to find fossils and discover more about how they formed and what life was like in the past. \n\nIn addition to its work with schools, the project team developed a wide range of partnerships with organisations across the city, in order to better engage new audiences and hard-to-reach adults and young people with the project. Evidence collected for this report suggested that the partnerships would have lasting impacts beyond the HLF funding, and in particular had connected the discovery of the Bristol Dinosaur with the cultural heritage of the city.\n\nIn three years the project visited a wide range of annual or one-off public events and festivals including the Bristol Festival of Nature, At-Bristol, the Cheltenham Science Festival, Arnos Vale Cemetery, libraries across South Gloucestershire, and Bristol’s City Museum & Art Gallery. The project visited over 30 one-off or annual events in total, with the project team estimating a reach of 18, 000 people (children and adults). These figures do not include the 650,000 people who visit the Bristol Zoo each year. \nThe reach of the Bristol Dinosaur Project was recognised as a key success, and is a major part of how the project reached new audiences. However, in building the partnerships that delivered this reach, the project was able to piggyback on the efforts of other organisations to engage hard-to-reach groups of young people and adult. The project also sought to involve adults and young people from hard-to-reach groups in a more sustained and transformational manner.\n\nIn 2018, the Bristol Dinosaur Project was featured in the \"Jurassic Make Off\" series, a sponsored YouTube collaboration between the Let's Play channels Game Grumps and The Yogscast, where Education Officer Rhys Charles was cast as a competition judge alongside Ben Ebbrell of Sorted Food.\n\nLaboratory work has always been the key component of the Bristol Dinosaur Project. The 1975 find from Tytherington Quarry consisted of some 4 tonnes of fossiliferous rock, and numerous technical staff and student volunteers have laboured over the years to remove the fossilized bones from the rock.\n\nThe HLF funding allowed one side of a new palaeontology laboratory to be built at the University of Bristol. This was used for the preparation and curatorial work done with over 4 tonnes of rock containing the remains of \"Thecodontosaurus\" and associated micro-fauna. For the first 2 years, the creation and development of a new research collection was one of the main activities in the laboratory. A new volunteering program was developed at the University, and hundreds of volunteers (University students and external volunteers) worked under the preparator´s guidance and supervision in order to process several hundred kilograms of rock by means of acid digestion, mostly using acetic acid. This process, even though very slow and painstaking, provided great results for the project´s laboratory and research team: several thousand microfossils were recovered, studied and classified. The implementation of a new summer research program enabled undergraduate and master students to take part in top research projects, with the aim for scientific publications, while developing their laboratory and scientific skills.\nThe second year of the project marked the beginning of curatorial and preparation work. Tons of rock were prepared using mechanical or chemical techniques. Thousands of dinosaur bones were extracted and fully curated into a new research collection. Both micro- and macrofossil collections are now housed at the University´s museum, and are available for further research studies.\n\n"}

CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice chaplains and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. CPE is both a multicultural and interfaith experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers. \n\nAn underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the \"Action-Reflection\" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose \"verbatims\" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.\n\nAlthough the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, Richard Cabot, a physician and adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Divinity School, published an article in \"Survey Graphic\" suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students. In the 1930s, the Rev. Anton Boisen placed theological students at the Chicago Theological Seminary in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.\n\nCPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE). The six constituent associations are: New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.\n\nIn the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an accrediting organization for CPE programs by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nIn Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through CASC, the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.\n"}

The company is located in Cape Town, South Africa and San Jose, California and was founded by brothers Barry Kayton and Patrick Kayton in 2010.\n\nCognician is an online software platform that allows users to explore a particular topic by guiding them through an interactive question-and-answer process inspired by the Socratic method and the theory of cognitive apprenticeship. Content is packaged in applets called coaching guides, or cogs for short. Each cog consists of two complementary parts: a series of questions designed to provoke higher-order thinking and a sidebar that contains supporting material in the form of text, images or video. Users respond to the questions in the chat space, which is designed to resemble an IRC. However the chat is not a live, synchronous chat. It is a pre-scripted, structured conversation which gives users a thinking agenda and enables them to develop their thoughts on the topic. Cogs are similar to workbooks in that they bring structure to a complex activity, but the experience of using a cog has the semblance of a live conversation with a person.\n\nThe Cognician management team consists of Barry Kayton and Patrick Kayton who are CEO in USA and South Africa respectively, Robert Stuttaford (CTO) and Victoria Skye Grulke (COO). Cognician's employees include software developers (responsible for the platform), researchers, writers and editors (responsible for content development), and graphic designers (responsible for what users see when interacting with the platform). In this respect, Cognician is a typical Digital Content Creation (DCC) business.\n\nCognician's core business logic, website, web application and backend systems are implemented using Clojure. Cognician uses Datomic, a distributed database also built with Clojure, as well as Memcached for transitory cache and RabbitMQ for message queuing. Cognician hosts on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.\n\nThe idea for Cognician came from a seminar in creative thinking that Barry Kayton was running at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Cape Town in 2006. The Kayton brothers worked part-time developing a prototype of the Cognician platform, initially investing their own money in the project and later raising seed capital from angel investors.\n\nIn January 2010, at the Geek Retreat in Stanford, the Kayton brothers decided that Cognician would no longer be a stealth startup. In February 2010, Robert Stuttaford joined as CTO and began building Cognician as an Adobe AIR Application. In its earliest alpha version Cognician took the form of a mind map and the company founders described the app as a kind of extended mind. In April 2010, Cognician was officially registered as a company in Cape Town, South Africa. The company has set up subsidiaries in the United States (San Carlos, CA) and the United Kingdom (London).\n\nIn 2010, Cognician received local and international recognition at the Cape Town Activa Awards, Seedcamp Johannesburg, the Seedcamp London finals and by being named one of Europe's top 11 startups at the TechCrunch Europas Awards.\nIn August 2013, the Kayton brothers were among 17 high impact entrepreneurs selected by Endeavor to join its global network of entrepreneurs.\nIn October 2014, Cognician's Leadership Accelerator program received the Best Soft Skills Solution award at DevLearn's DemoFest in Las Vegas.\nIn February 2017, Recruiting Daily selected Cognician as one of the top 100 HR technologies and recruiting tools worth watching in Q1 2017.\n\nCognician's initial aim was to work with publishers to adapt non-fiction books into cogs for the consumer market (B2C). In March 2011, Cognician launched their first book-to-cog adaption which was based on \"The Decision book\" by Mikael Krogerus and Roman Tschäppeler. But the company soon found traction selling to enterprises (B2B) and decided to pivot.

{"id": "662803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=662803", "title": "Crazy English", "text": "Crazy English\n\nCrazy English () is a brand name related to a non-traditional method learning English in mainland China conceived by Li Yang. Li believes that the traditional way of learning English in China is ineffective. Li Yang's method places heavy emphasis on practicing English orally. His method can be described with the slogan \"By shouting out loud, you learn.\" In many ways it remains similar to the traditional pedagogic practices of Chinese education in that it still relies on repetition and recitation. Members of the school administration in China often disapprove of the method because they believe it goes against the traditional Chinese values of modesty and restraint.\n\nFor over a decade China has been gripped by the “English Fever” phenomenon as the country increasingly associates English language skills with success in the business world. Though China states that it has the largest number, 300 million, of English speakers in the world, the number of people who translate their reading and writing skills to spoken word decreases substantially. This issue with students not being comfortable or confident in speaking English opened the door for Li Yang’s Crazy English method of teaching.\n\nYang, like many others, struggled with speaking in English. In preparation for his TEM 4 English exam, Yang found that while practicing English he would often time find himself shouting English passages and class exercises aloud; this made him more confident. After only four months of using his new method of studying Yang placed second in his class on the exam.\n\nAfter graduating Yang started to work as an electrical engineer but also taught English in his spare time using his method of teaching English as a “shouted language”. He later quit his job in 1994 to start his own English teaching company “Li Yang English Promotion Studio\" to promote his technique\" which he named “Crazy English”. In the following years, Yang’s method would gain popularity beginning after Ouyang Weijian, the leader of an elementary school asked Yang to teach for a crowd of about five thousand people, Weijian would later go on to join Yang’s company as his business manager.\n\nOne major contribution to Crazy English’s rise to fame was director Zhang Yuan’s 1999 documentary Fengkuang Yingyu (“Crazy English”) which gained Crazy English attention, especially in the Western world. Crazy English popularity continued to grow causing more than 20 million people to sign up for a course. Eventually the Chinese government recognized Crazy English as a legitimate teaching method by allowing Yang to teach in Beijing, to teach soldiers on top of the Great Wall of China, as well as conduct Intensive Training Camps to prepare for the 2008 Olympics. Today “Li Yang English Promotion Studio\" is a multi-million dollar business that employs over 150 people with Yang still at the helm as director and principal speaker.\n\nThe name “Crazy English” comes from the fact that Yang’s methods are so different from traditional Chinese classroom norms of being restrained. Crazy English goes against these traditions as the method utilizes physical and mental engagement. The word “Crazy” is not to be synonymous with insanity but instead, stand for Yang’s belief that everything in life should be done wholeheartedly with passion and abandon. \"Crazy stands for the single-minded pursuit of dreams. Crazy stands for the total devotion to your work. Crazy stands for the passion of commitment to reach the goal,\" says the course's guidebook.\n\nLi Yang’s unconventional method of teaching English includes screaming popular and random English phrases at a rapid pace and occasionally, involves hand movements in patterns that reflect the word’s pronunciation. In a survey on Crazy English students identified Li Yang’s technique as one which does not include grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing, or listening comprehension. In 2003, Li in an interview with Kripal Singh said, “[Chinese students] have no problem writing, they have no problem reading. That’s why I trigger their power of speaking.” \n\nSince Crazy English highlights various aspects of learning a language without using any traditional ways like learning grammar or reading textbooks, pronunciation is the backbone of this methodology. Crazy English follows the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as its standard for giving pronunciation notation. Li Yang employed several native English speakers to incorporate exaggerated American pronunciation in his lecture to develop conversation practicality.\n\nCrazy English also makes significant use of gesticulation. Amber R. Woodward offers the example of Crazy English students learning ‘i as in like’ by making the right hand’s index finger, drawing a complete clockwise circle; similarly, for ‘th as in three’ holding the right hand above the head, bending his hand at the wrist with a flat palm, and moving arm from right to left over one’s head, also for ‘a as in made’ holding the right hand above the head, bending hand at the wrist with a flat palm, moving arm from front to back over his head. These gesticulations were ridiculed for not being consistent with the hand movements in his various lectures.\n\nLi Yang chooses not to provide vocabulary lists or grammar notes for the words and phrases he uses. In his lectures, Yang sometimes translates English words or phrases into Chinese to focus on the emotion behind the word by reminding the audience of the Chinese translation to make the learning of the word faster. Crazy English uses simple forms of vocabulary and grammar this is why the translation in order to invoke feeling is not necessary every time. Crazy English lectures mostly contain English phrases and not full sentences.\n\nThe psychological aspect of the Crazy English method is related to its emphasis on improving speech. Students practice his technique by going behind buildings or on rooftops and shouting English. They also go to his rallies and shout together; this helps them overcome their shyness (everybody is doing it, so nobody is embarrassed). Li’s frequently used slogan, “Crazy English! Crazy life! Crazy world! I love this crazy game, so let’s go!” signifies the method Li wants his students to adapt to this mindset in order to learn English in his way. The “Crazy” in Crazy English signifies Li Yang’s want for students to have rage and passion in their studies and to fulfill their dreams by giving up their fear of failing.\n\nCrazy English encourages students to shout out English words whether behind buildings, on rooftops, or at organized rallies. Shouting together with others helps people overcome their shyness, because if everyone is doing it nobody is embarrassed. In traditional Chinese hierarchies, youths are not encouraged to show a mastery of skills that surpass the skills of their adult counterparts. Li Yang’s proponents argue that his method of teaching may help Chinese students get over their inhibitions to learning and practicing English. Li believes that most Chinese are brought up with modesty and a lack of confidence—that they are afraid of losing face in front of family, friends, educators, and even strangers. Common English teaching methods in China reflect this fear of failure and accommodate students by allowing them to learn English without practicing speaking, preparing dialogues, or giving individual oral presentations.\n\nHowever, an opposer of Crazy English notes that Li Yang only says English words without giving any further details about the context in how, when, where, and what condition does one word should and could be applied Another opposer comments that Li does not spend effort on structuring any cohesion between vocabulary or sentences; he assumes that students get enough of that in the classroom. Instead, he uses “crazy” sentences shouted at high decibels and funny hand movements to engage his audience in participation. In additional challenger also notes that students rarely – if not never – are presented with a situation in which they need just to parrot a native speaker. Another argues that because of crazy english many students have come to believe that english has no standards which results in their english not sounding American or British.\n\nIn 1996 Yang’s method became popular in Guangdong province against the will of the local English teachers. To counter, the local government prohibited Yang from giving seminars in the area for six months. Chengdu, Sichuan also banned Li from teaching for an extended span of time. Critics of Crazy English say that the promotion of Crazy English over the past 15 years has resulted in most students believing English has no standard, and that some even mistake American English for the standard one, which has made most students in China after 16 years of studying English sound neither British nor American. As a result, many are so confused with the two different kinds of English accents that they choose to keep their mouths shut. Critics also describe crazy english as a technique only appropriate for certain situations.

The main focus is to promote adult learning and access to and participation in non-formal adult education for all, particularly for groups currently under-represented. EAEA aims at influencing EU policies on non-formal adult education and lifelong learning and cooperates with the institutions of the European Union and with international organisations as the Council of Europe, the International Council for Adult Education (ICAE) and UNESCO.\n\nPreviously known as the European Bureau for Adult Education, EAEA has its roots in the Folk high schools in Europe, and in particular in those of the Netherlands. In the first years after the Second World War, the Netherlands Folk high school movement saw it as its mission to strive for a Europe wide cooperation of Folk high schools.\n\nThe \"Centre Européen de la Culture\" established in 1949 in Geneva developed, under the directorship of Denis de Rougemont, the idea of having a number of \"Foyers de Culture\" throughout Europe in and through which European culture in its diversity and unity could be experienced and spread. Oscar Guermonprez, director of the Bergen Folk high school in the Netherlands, imagined in this context an office for documentation and information, with an advisory council representing the whole field of adult education.\n\nThe European Bureau for Adult Education was founded in 1953 by representatives from a number of European countries. The Bureau was formally established in Bergen, hosted by the Agency for European Folk high school work. Oscar Guermonprez was the first President.\n\nEAEA’s main roles:\n\nEAEA’s duties include:\n\nEAEA advocates for non-formal adult learning.

The EAEA Grundtvig Award was launched in 2003 by EAEA in order to celebrate excellence in adult education. Each year the Award has a different theme.\n\nThe Award is named after Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig (1783–1872), a Danish educator mainly influential in the development of non-formal adult education in Europe and worldwide. He provided the adult education sector a foundational philosophy that underpins much of the work in lifelong learning and laid the ground work for the development of learning centres, in all kinds of contexts, from residential educational institutions to agricultural co-operatives.\n\nEAEA organises an annual training \"European Adult Education and Lifelong Learning – Introduction for younger staff\". The objectives are to learn about European developments in adult education and lifelong learning, to exchange information and knowledge about each other's organisations, to understand advocacy work at European level and adult education backgrounds, to learn about EAEA and other key civil society organisations.\n\nBrochures and leaflets\nEAEA Policy Reports within the field of adult education and lifelong learning.\nEAEA Monograph Series 1993–1999: A discontinued series publishing the results and final reports of EAEA projects.\n\n\n"}

There are three awards: bronze, silver and gold.\n\nThe term \"gaisce\" is from the Irish language and can be translated as \"achievement\". The award was established by a trust deed under the patronage of the President of Ireland on 28 March 1985. In 1988 the award became part of the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Association. The profile of the award was raised substantially following the first award ceremonies performed by President Hillery in 1989.\n\nEvery participant has the support of a \"PAL\" (President's Award Leader). It is not a competition, the only person you compete with is yourself. The PAL guides you through the challenges and sets appropriate activities.\n\nGaisce's mission is to contribute to the development of all young people through the achievement of personal challenges.

Through the Chief Scout Award you can in turn earn your Gaisce, but this does not work the other way around; if you have completed your Gaisce you do not receive your Chief Scout Award as well. All leaders who have been invested into Scouting Ireland and who have the appropriate training can take the role of being a PAL, if they so desire.\n\nAll Participants must undertake a further 3 months in either the Service, Skills or Physical Recreation.\n\nPeople who do not have the Bronze Award must undertake a further 6 months in either the Service or the longer of the Skills or Physical Recreation Sections.\n\nPeople who do not have the Silver Award must undertake a further 6 months in either the Service or the longer of the Skills or Physical Recreation Sections.\n\nIn Northern Ireland participants completing the Duke of Edinburgh's Award can choose to accept a certificate from the Gaisce or an International Award Certificate instead of a Duke of Edinburgh certificate.\n\n\n"}

He is based in New York City.\n\nA native of The Bronx, New York, of Italian American descent, he was inspired to become an architect at the age of about 13 when he saw the then-unfinished Guggenheim Museum, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Ranalli attended Mount Saint Michael Academy high school in New York City and graduated in 1964. From 1967 to 1968, he attended New York Institute of Technology, and Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York, where he received a Bachelor of Architecture in 1972.

Upon graduation, he traveled on a research grant throughout Europe before returning to New York.\n\nRanalli founded his firm, \"George Ranalli, Architect\", in New York in 1977.\nEarly on, architecture critic Paul Goldberger described Ranalli in a \"New York Times\" article as one of the \"better younger architects\" working in the Modernist idiom. Goldberger stated that Ranalli's designs were tied \"as closely to the ancient craft of building as to the modern business of churning out huge commercial projects, yet they bespeak a consistent awareness of the realities of our age as well.\" In 1991, Michael Sorkin described Ranalli as \"a creator and preserver of worlds, a precisionist.\" Ranalli is credited with carrying forward the lessons of Italian architect Carlo Scarpa into new settings. Architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote that Ranalli's \"purpose is to move modernism into an enriched and more deeply referenced style.\" In 1996, Yale University granted Ranalli a Master of Arts degree, honoris causa.

He was a professor at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, broken by World War II. He was in the U.S. from 1942 to 1945, having been interned as a Jew at the Drancy internment camp (north-east of Paris) and then escaped.\n\nHe began his career as a follower of Henri Bergson and the American pluralist philosophers William James and George Santayana. He is known as one of those introducing Hegelian thought in France in the 1930s (his book on Hegel was published in 1929), ahead of Alexandre Kojève's more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the Danish proto-existentialist Søren Kierkegaard. These enthusiasms, which became the significant books \"Le malheur de la conscience dans la philosophie de Hegel\" (1929) and \"Études kierkegaardiennes\" (1938) were controversial, in the prevailing climate of thought. However, he influenced a number of key thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the second issue of \"Acéphale\", Georges Bataille's review, Jean Wahl wrote an article titled \"Nietzsche and the Death of God\", concerning Karl Jaspers' interpretation of this work. He became known as an anti-systematic philosopher, in favour of philosophical innovation and the concrete.\n\nWhile in the USA, Wahl with Gustave Cohen and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation founded a 'university in exile', the \"École Libre des Hautes Études\", in New York City. Later, at Mount Holyoke where he had a position, he set up the \"Décades de Mount Holyoke\", also known as \"Pontigny-en-Amérique\", modelled on meetings run from 1910-1939 by French philosopher Paul Desjardins (November 22, 1859 - March 13, 1940) at the site of the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny in Burgundy. These successfully gathered together French intellectuals in wartime exile, ostensibly studying the English language, with Americans including Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and Roger Sessions. Wahl, already a published poet, made translations of poems of Stevens into French. He was also an avid reader of the Four Quartets and toyed with the idea of publishing a poetical refutation of the poem. (See, e.g., his \"On Reading the Four Quartets.\" )\n\nIn post-war France Wahl was an important figure, as a teacher and editor of learned journals. In 1946 he founded the Collège philosophique, influential center for non-conformist intellectuals, alternative to the Sorbonne. Starting in 1950, he headed the \"Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale\".\n\nWahl translated the second hypothesis of the \"Parmenides\" of Plato as \"\"Il y a de l'Un\", and Jacques Lacan adopted his translation as a central point in psychoanalysis, as a sort of antecedent in the Parmenides of the analytic discourse. This is the existential sentence of psychoanalytic discourse according to Lacan, and the negative one is \"Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel\" \" — there is no such a thing as a sexual relationship.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Foundation seeks most of its funding from donors and corporate partnerships from around the globe, including Daimler AG, the Maybach brand, and Silverstein Properties.\n\nThe Foundation is currently working with both their San Francisco and Stuttgart branches to focus on enhancing, celebrating, and sharing their heritage and tradition of innovation through their projects, additional mobile educational outreach, and design excellence for the next generation of technical innovators.\n\nThe Foundation marked each mentorship with a specific project that falls within a sector of interest. The general sectors of interest for the Foundation are science and research; art, design and architecture; community and ethics; and business and technology.\n\nThe pilot project for the mentoring program was led by Dr. David Bangsberg, M.D., a leader in HIV treatment strategies and founding dean at Portland State University School of Public Health, who mentored Dr. Conrad Muzoora, M.D., a Ugandan medical researcher, head of internal medicine at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology. The two focused on working together from 2008-2013 in order to successfully research treatment options for patients with HIV/AIDS in addition to at least one other infectious disease like tuberculosis and bring positive change by empowering the next generation of doctors and researchers who will remain in Uganda to fight life-threatening infectious diseases.\nIn a partnership between the Maybach Foundation and Silverstein Properties, four photographers were given the opportunity to document the rebuilding of the World Trade Center in New York City and mentored by Joe Woolhead, the official photographer of the World Trade Center. The four photographers were Marika Asatiani (Tbilisi, Georgia), Benjamin Jarosch (New York, United States), Nicole Tung (New York, USA), and Vicky Roy (New Delhi, India). The goal of the project was for the proteges to become skilled documentary photographers and produce a collection of images that capture the rebuilding of one of the US's most prominent landmarks, developing a generation of photographers who will raise awareness about political, cultural, and social issues.\n\nIn October 2008, the Foundation launched the Post-Apartheid Role Model Project (PARM) with the extraordinarily talented South African polo player, Sbu Duma, who was trained and mentored by top international professionals in his field, the lead mentor being Argentinian polo player, Federico Bachman. Project locations included Argentina, Spain, France, Germany, and Great Britain. Tragically, Sbu Duma died in May 2012 before completing his mentorship but remains an inspiration to all who aspire to achieve individual greatness and wish to share their gifts with the world.\n\nCoinciding with the Venice Biennale 2011, the Maybach Foundation founded their art mentoring program, forming a collaborative mentorship between Julian Schnabel and Vahakn Arslanian, both New York-based artists. The goal of the mentorship project was to develop the creative potential of promising young artists who have overcome adversity and to use art to challenge the way we see the world and look to the future, these two were chosen because they were kindred spirits aiming to break down the prevailing aesthetic and establish a new way of seeing, much in the way of the revolutionary work of Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler. \nWith the assistance of Maybach, the two were able to work together using automobile parts in art pieces to create several exhibitions for the 2011 Venice Biennale, 2011 St. Moritz Art Masters Event, and a 2012 exhibition entitled Holy, Heavenly in the West Village, sponsored by the foundation, Maybach Manufaktur, and Vito Schnabel.\n\nThe arts mentorship project paired promising young artistic talent with established leaders in the art world to highlight their creativity. Up-and-coming photographer Garret Suhrie was mentored by star photographer David LaChapelle as a means to motivate society to appreciate and preserve nature as a way to survive urban chaos, using art to challenge the way the natural world is viewed. Suhrie documented the decaying industrial facilities in his home city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, displaying the original sights hidden amongst the natural world. Suhrie's resulting works from the period were showen at the Maybach Center of Excellence Event in Stuttgart, Germany, where he donated two of his photographs to the Daimler Art Collection. In 2011, Suhrie was featured at the St. Moritz Art Walk.\n\nThrough this project the Maybach Foundation paired Tessa Tricks, a post-graduate student in the anthropology of food from the UK, with Sarah Weiner and other leaders from the Seedling Projects organization. Tessa Tricks was nominated by Aine Morris of the Sustainable Food Trust organization in the UK for her exceptional resume and experience in the Slow Food movement. The project allowed Tricks to forge relationships for future collaboration, investigate examples of best practices from the USA sustainable food movement, and help organize the 2014 Good Food Awards with her mentor.\n\nAfter earning her Masters in Public Administration from Cornell University and becoming active in the Maine Seafood Marketing Network, Amanda LaBelle was mentored by Monique Coombs, the Director of Marine Programs for the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association. The program explored opportunities for integrating seafood into Maine's local food systems and bridged the gap between agriculture and fisheries in Maine.\n"}

Today Michael Park is an integrated Area School, providing seamless education for students from Playgroup (children aged 2–3 years), Nursery (2½ - 4 years), Kindergarten (4–6 years), lower school (6–14 years) to high school (students aged 14–18 years). The Steiner School refers to the years 2 to 13 as \"Class 1\" to \"Class 12\".\n\nUnlike 'conventional' state schools, the Steiner philosophy encourages a slightly later development, and a more creative environment.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Michael Park is their keen eye for aesthetics. The belief is that more graceful architecture will be beneficial to student's learning, meaning that there are less right angles in the school buildings and more curves.\n\nOne of the key things making Rudolf Steiner schools unique is the year-long project of each and every 7th Form/Year 13 student. The student is encouraged to learn or develop a skill, complete an exercise and assist the community. Some recent projects have included: learning to play a musical instrument, making a short film, learning authorship or painting, restoration/building of cars, boats, etc.\n\nThe student study is assessed on many levels including the presentation of an oral speech, and development of records (i.e., keeping a diary or their efforts) and compiling a visual display to represent their work and what they've learned over the course of the year.\n\nThe final result of the Independent Study contributes substantially to their Steiner certificate results for the year.\n\nThis is a state integrated school (i.e., they are largely funded by Government subsidy). This way, Michael Park School students can participate in both government standard assessment, NCEA as well as Steiner School Certificate.

It is an independent organisation whose statutory objectives are to enhance the understanding and knowledge of people about financial matters (including the UK financial system) and to enhance their ability to manage their own financial affairs. The service provides free money advice and guidance online and by telephone.\n\nThe service was launched in April 2011, superseding the Moneymadeclear-branded service provided by the Consumer Financial Education Body. Prior to 2010, the service had been a division of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). It was set up by the UK Government and is paid for by a statutory levy on the financial services industry.\n\nThe strategic goals and direction of the Money Advice Service are set by a 12-member board. The board is appointed by, but acts independently of, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The service has an independent Chairman and board appointed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA’s appointments of the Chair and Chief Executive are subject to the approval of HM Treasury.\n\nIn April 2012 the Money Advice Service took on additional responsibility for funding and improving the quality, consistency and availability of UK debt advice, a statutory function as set out in the Financial Services Act 2012.\n\nIn March 2017 the Money Advice Service launched the new Standard Financial Statement (SFS), an initiative designed to bring greater consistency to the way organisations assess people’s finances when they are in debt.\n\nThe Money Advice Service also lead the work of a wide range of organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop the UK Financial Capability Strategy\na ten-year plan to address people’s skills and knowledge around money management, their attitudes and motivations that hold them back and their access to products and services.\n\nIn March 2016 HM Treasury announced that the service would become part of a new guidance body that would see the Money Advice Service, The Pensions Advisory Service and Pension Wise combine to form a new single guidance body.\n\nThe Financial Guidance and Claims Bill seeks to establish the new statutory body by Royal Assent from Autumn/Winter 2018. The new guidance body will be accountable to Parliament, with responsibility for coordinating the provision of debt advice, money guidance, and pension guidance, ensuring that people across the UK are able to seek the help and advice they need to manage their finances.\n\nThe Bill entered the House of Lords for its first reading on 22 June 2017 and moved to the House of Commons for its first reading on 22 November 2017.\n\nThe Queen's Speech of June 2017 announced that the new single body would be funded through existing levies on pension schemes and the financial services industry.\n"}

It is a self-appointed body and does not hold any statutory powers from central government, meaning students and those seeking to enter the media industry do not have to legally hold one of its qualifications to obtain work as a journalist.\n\nThe NCTJ delivers the premier training scheme for journalists in the United Kingdom The NCTJ offers a range of qualifications for those beginning a career in journalism and for those who want to continue their professional development. The Level 3 Diploma in Journalism introduced in 2007 and the Level 5 National Qualification in Journalism (NQJ) introduced in 2013 have been joined by apprenticeship and foundation certificate qualifications. Qualifications cover news, magazine, production, sports, business and finance, online, video, radio and television journalism. Courses are vocational, focusing on skills convergence and multimedia journalism.\n\nThe NCTJ is a charity for all media with a professional awarding body recognised by Ofqual, Qualification Wales and CCEA Northern Ireland, an accreditation board, Student Council, focus groups and forums, and the annual Journalism Skills Conference.\n\nNCTJ alumni include Mark Austin, Piers Morgan, Kay Burley, John Inverdale, Reshmin Chowdhury, Geordie Greig and Helen Skelton.\n\nAs well as being the examining body, the NCTJ offers short training courses to refresh candidates' knowledge prior to them sitting exams, and also for professionals looking for related training.\n\nThe NCTJ is also a professional awarding body recognised by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulator Ofqual.\n\nThe Diploma in Journalism is a Level 3 qualification that is made up of four mandatory subjects – essential journalism, essential journalism e-portfolio, essential journalism ethics and regulation and essential media law and regulation – and a selection of elective skills modules \n\nTo meet the gold standard, candidates have to achieve grades A-C in all subjects plus 100wpm shorthand.\n\nThe National Qualification in Journalism (NQJ) is a Level 5 qualification that examines all-round competence in a range of essential journalism skills.\n\nTo be eligible to sit the NQJ, candidates must have achieved the gold standard in the Diploma in Journalism and have undertaken a period of 18 months' full-time employment on a newspaper or news agency. \n\nThe \"Oxdown Gazette\" was a fictional newspaper used by the NCTJ as a setting for its journalism exam papers. Since the 1970s, trainee journalists would have to write reports on fires, floods, rail crashes and fatal accidents in the imaginary town of Oxdown. The idea was to replicate, as far as possible, the sense of local knowledge trainees would have if working for a real paper.\n\nIn 2006, the NCTJ decided that it would no longer use Oxdown – instead, a variety of locations and publications would feature on its exam papers. This did not go down well with some journalists and journalism lecturers, who had a sentimental attachment to the fictional town and launched a campaign to save it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33381607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33381607", "title": "Occupy movement", "text": "Occupy movement\n\nThe Occupy movement was an international progressive, socio-political movement against social and economic inequality and the lack of \"real democracy\" around the world. It aimed primarily to advance social and economic justice and new forms of democracy. The movement had many different scopes; local groups often had different focuses, but among the movement's prime concerns were how large corporations (and the global financial system) control the world in a way that disproportionately benefited a minority, undermined democracy, and was unstable. \"Occupy\" formed part of what Manfred Steger called the \"global justice movement\".\n\nThe first Occupy protest to receive widespread attention, Occupy Wall Street in New York City's Zuccotti Park, began on 17 September 2011. By 9 October, Occupy protests had taken place or were ongoing in over 951 cities across 82 countries, and in over 600 communities in the United States. Although most active in the United States, by October 2012 there had been Occupy protests and occupations in dozens of other countries across every inhabited continent. For the first month, overt police repression remained minimal, but this began to change by 25 October 2011 when police first attempted to forcibly remove Occupy Oakland. By the end of 2011, authorities had cleared most of the major camps, with the last remaining high-profile sites – in Washington, D.C. and in London – evicted by February 2012.\n\nThe Occupy movement took inspiration in part from the Arab Spring, from the 2009 Iranian Green Movement, and from the Spanish Indignados Movement, as well as from the overall global wave of anti-austerity protests. The movement commonly uses the slogan \"We are the 99%\" and the #Occupy hashtag format; it organizes through websites such as Occupy Together. According to \"The Washington Post\", the movement, which Cornel West described as a \"democratic awakening\", is difficult to distill to a few demands. On 12 October 2011, Los Angeles City Council became one of the first governmental bodies in the United States to adopt a resolution stating its informal support of the Occupy movement. In October 2012, the Executive Director of Financial Stability at the Bank of England stated that the protesters were right to criticise and had persuaded bankers and politicians \"to behave in a more moral way\".\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, students across the University of California occupied campus buildings in protest against budget cuts, tuition hikes, and staff cutbacks that had resulted from the Great Recession of 2008. According to Dissent Magazine, \"It was in the context of the California student movement that the slogan 'Occupy Everything, Demand Nothing' first emerged.\" \"The Huffington Post\" noted that \"During one incident in March of 2010, 150 protesters were arrested for trying to occupy part of Interstate 80 in protest of the budget cuts and tuition hikes, displaying a banner that read 'Occupy everything,' while shutting down the roadway for an hour, and were crushed by the same kind of overwhelming police force that was later mobilized against Occupy encampments across the country.\" \"Adbusters\" editor Micah White, who designed the original Occupy Wall Street concept, traveled to California for the protests and took part in the occupation of Wheeler Hall. He wrote enthusiastically for \"Adbusters\" about the \"revolutionary potential of [the students] struggle.\"\n\nThe Spanish Indignados movement began in mid-May 2011, with camps at Madrid and elsewhere. According to sociologist Manuel Castells, by the end of the month there were already hundreds of camps around Spain and across the world. For some journalists and commentators the camping in Spain marked the start of the global occupy movement, though it is much more commonly said to have begun in New York during September.\nOn 30 May 2011, a leader of the \"Indignados\", inspired by the Arab Spring, 5.18 Movement of 1980, and June Democracy Movement of 1987 called for a worldwide protest on 15 October. In mid-2011, the Canadian-based group Adbusters Media Foundation, best known for its advertisement-free anti-consumerist magazine \"Adbusters\", proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, address a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis. Adbusters co-founder Kalle Lasn registered the \"OccupyWallStreet.org\" web address on 9 June. According to Micah White, the senior editor of the magazine, \"[we] basically floated the idea in mid-July into our [email list] and it was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world, it just kind of snowballed from there.\"\n\nOne of the inspirations for the movement was the Democracy Village set up in 2010, outside the British Parliament in London. The protest received additional attention when the internet hacker group Anonymous encouraged its followers to take part in the protests, calling protesters to \"flood lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and Occupy Wall Street\". They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic Charging Bull. The first protest was held at Zuccotti Park in New York City on 17 September 2011, the tenth anniversary of the re-opening of Wall Street trading after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The protests were preceded by a similar Occupy Dataran movement in Kuala Lumpur in July, seven weeks before Occupy Wall Street.\n\nThe phrase \"The 99%\" is a political slogan used by participants in the Occupy movement. It was originally launched as a Tumblr blog page in late August 2011. It refers to the concentration of wealth among the top 1% of income earners compared to the other 99 percent; the top 1 percent of income earners nearly tripled after-tax income over the last thirty years according to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report.\n\nThe report was released just as concerns of the Occupy Wall Street movement were beginning to enter the national political debate. According to the CBO, between 1979 and 2007 the incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. Since 1979 the average pre-tax income for the bottom 90% of households has decreased by $900, while that of the top 1% increased by over $700,000, as federal taxation became less progressive. From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%. In 2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum income of $343,927.\nIn 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15% —an example of the Pareto principle. Financial inequality (total net worth minus the value of one's home) was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.\n\nHowever, after the Great Recession which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between the 1% and the 99%. During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928. This is in stark contrast with surveys of U.S. populations that indicate an \"ideal\" distribution that is much more equal, and a widespread ignorance of the true income inequality and wealth inequality.\n\nDuring the early weeks, the movement was frequently criticized by the news media for having no clearly defined goals. Speaking on 7 October 2011, Kalle Lasn of Adbusters said that, in the early stages, the lack of demands was the \"mysterious part\" that allowed the movement to grow. By late October, Adbusters had been trying to \"rally it around a single, clear demand\" for a Robin Hood tax, with a global march in support of the Robin Hood tax planned for 29 October. Naomi Wolf argued that the impression created by much of the media that the protestors did not have clear demands was false. Wolf argued that they did have clear demands including a desire to end what they saw as the corrupting effect of money on politics. \"The New Yorker\" magazine stated that the claims of Kalle Lasn and Micah M. White were specific: tighten banking-industry regulations, ban high-frequency trading, arrest all 'financial fraudsters' responsible for the 2008 crash, and form a Presidential commission to investigate and prosecute corruption in politics. According to \"Bloomberg Businessweek\", protesters wanted more and better jobs, more equal distribution of income, bank reform, and a reduction of the influence of corporations on politics. The movement has also been described as broadly anticapitalist.\n\nSome commentators such as David Graeber and Judith Butler criticized the idea that the movement must have clearly defined demands; they argued that issuing demands is counterproductive for the Occupy movement, because doing so would legitimize the very power structures the movement seeks to challenge. In late November, the London contingent of the Occupy movement released their first statement on corporations, in which they called for measures to end tax evasion by wealthy firms. The reason for the delay in articulating a clear demand was given as the time it takes to reach a consensus with the sometimes slow processes of \"participatory democracy\". In November \"Occupy London Stock Exchange\", an offshoot of Occupy London, said that they were working on a global collaboration of various occupations that reflected the voices of diverse movements worldwide. The global movement has been called the reinvention of politics, revolution, and utopia in the twenty-first century.\n\nActivists have used web technologies and social media like IRC, Facebook, Twitter, and Meetup to coordinate events. Indymedia helped the movement with communications, saying there had been conference calls on Skype with participants from up to 80 locations. Interactive live streams of events by independent journalists such as Tim Pool were used to augment Mainstream media coverage. The progressive provider May First/People Link offered cost-free memberships for dozens of groups, including groups in Iran and Germany, to host websites, emails, and email lists securely. The movement went further to attempt to promote its causes through multi-media and art, which has been gathered and archived by institutions such as the National Museum of American History and New York Historical Society. The aim of much of the art produced was to visually impact the mainstream through imagery to attempt to create solidarity and unity among the \"99%\".\n\nThe Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund released a model community bill of rights, promoting laws that strip corporations of their personhood rights and elevating the rights of citizens, for occupy organizers to adopt locally. In December 2011, Occupy Homes embarked on a movement to assist home owners who had lost or were scheduled to lose their homes due to foreclosure as a result of what they called the illegal practices used by banks that took advantage of consumers. The group planned to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions.\n\nThe movement has been described as having an \"overriding commitment\" to participatory democracy. Much of the movement's democratic process occurs in \"working groups,\" where any protester is able to have their say. Important decisions are often made at General assemblies, which can themselves be informed by the findings of multiple working groups. Decisions are made using the consensus model of participatory democracy. This often features the use of hand signals to increase participation and operating with discussion facilitators rather than leaders – a system that can be traced in part to the Quaker movement several centuries ago, to participatory democracy in ancient Athens, and to the spokescouncils of the 1999 anti-globalization movement.\n\nAt the assemblies, working group proposals are made to meeting participants, who comment upon them using a process called a \"stack\"; a queue of speakers that anyone can join. In New York City, Occupy Wall Street uses what is called a progressive stack, in which people from marginalized groups are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, with facilitators, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to \"step forward, or step back\" based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities get to go to the front of the line, while white males must often wait for a turn to speak. The progressive stack concept has been criticized by some outside the movement as \"forced equality\" and \"unfair.\"\n\nThe occupy movement began with a commitment to nonviolence. Frequent references were made to the writings of nonviolent theorist Dr. Gene Sharp whose work was reported to have influenced nonviolent struggle movements in Serbia and the Arab Spring. Study groups were organised across the US Occupy camps discussing Sharp's 198 methods of nonviolent action and his book From Dictatorship to Democracy. A subsequent film about his work How to Start a Revolution by Ruaridh Arrow which premiered in Boston on 18 September was screened in Occupy camps across the US and Europe.\nSharp himself warned that many of the tactics the movement were employing were not effective. In an Al Jazeera interview, he said, \"The [Occupy] protesters don't have a clear objective, something they can actually achieve. If they think they will change the economic system by simply staying in a particular location, then they are likely to be very disappointed. Protest alone accomplishes very little.\"\n\nIn late May 2011, sociologist Manuel Castells congratulated Spanish occupiers for the fact that not a single violent incident had been reported after 11 days of camping all over Spain. Castells said that nonviolence was of fundamental importance, and was echoed by various other sociologists and social historians including Lester Kurtz, Prof. Maurice Isserman and Prof. Tom Juravich. Juravich and others have, however, said that conflict can be important in attracting attention, with much to be gained if occupiers are seen as victims of the violence, providing occupiers keep their own aggression strictly within limits. In the words of one occupier, it can help them gain media coverage if they \"make things a little sexy and badass\" . The Direct Action Working Group of Occupy Wall Street endorsed diversity of tactics from the earliest days of the encampment. Not all occupiers have upheld the commitment to nonviolence, with aggressive tactics being used in Spain from as early as 15 June, and with some journalists saying the New York branch of the movement did initially accept protestors who had not signed up to nonviolence.\n\nIn September, sympathetic coverage given to the movement by the media was substantially increased after the circulation of a video of pepper spray being used by a police commander against peaceful female protestors. In early October, Naomi Klein congratulated New York occupiers for their commitment to nonviolence. By November 2011, media sources began to report an increase in violence, with allegations of sexual assault and incidents of violence from occupiers against the police, including one officer allegedly stabbed with scissors. Some occupy camps responded by requiring that all occupiers sign a resolution to be nonviolent if they wished to stay. Rick Hampton for USA Today said the vast majority of occupy members have been nonviolent. Reviewing the global movement in December 2011, Anthony Barnett said its nonviolence remained an immense strength.\nIn late January 2012, the movement's commitment to nonviolence was questioned after clashes with the police that saw about 400 arrests in the U.S. city of Oakland. Some protestors and witnesses said the police initiated the violence; others said there was violence against the police; however, they blamed black bloc anarchists and agents provocateurs. One protester who did not take part stated, \"It was organized by a very militant anarchist segment of the movement; I support the idea of taking a building, especially for housing those who don't have housing. But I don't support it with the kind of triumphal attitude I saw expressed.\"\n\nThe beginning of the Occupy Movement was reliant on the usage of social media accounts for the dispersal of information. These accounts were very useful and helped tremendously. The social media accounts eventually became hierarchical and failed their purpose. Some believe, in order to have been more successful, the social media accounts should have been more heavily regulated and kept to a standard. In addition, a study was published that followed how Occupy user interests changed in time from 1 June 2011 to 31 August 2012. It showed 40% of users produced Occupy related content during peak activity of the movement. But, it was not sustained over the following year, with the user ratio dropping to less than 5% in the last three months of the study period.\n\nResponses to the movement from celebrities were both in-person and online. Some find it controversial that rich celebrities made appearances at the Occupy Wall Street Movement, but Kanye West justified his appearance as helping give power back to the people. Other celebrities such as Yoko Ono, Mark Ruffalo, and Michael Moore tweeted and showed their support.\n\nMany hold that the success of OWS has led to the success of Bernie Sanders and his political platform, disrupting the political conversation about environmental impact and economic equality. Some believe that there was social media blockage of Sanders' presidential campaign, in favor of more airtime for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. During the 2016 Presidential Election, people used the #BernieBlackout hashtag to boost awareness around the unfair usage of popular media to favor some presidential candidates over others.\n\nThe WikiLeaks endorsed news site WikiLeaks Central began promoting the idea of a \"US Day of Rage,\" on 10 March 2011. The Canadian editor in chief Heather Marsh, and the American WikiLeaks Central writer Alexa O'Brien modeled the concept after the Day of Rages being held at that time in the Middle East and North Africa. Early promotion by the WikiLeaks Twitter and blog was reported as being instrumental in the group's success. It was renamed Occupy Wall Street after the idea publicized on an email list and online blog. 13 July 2011, by Vancouver-based non-profit Canadian group Adbusters. The Occupy Wall Street protests began on 17 September 2011 in downtown Manhattan. On 9 October 2011, activists in cities in over 25 countries repeated calls for a global protest on 15 October. A list of events for 15 October included 951 cities in 82 countries. On 15 October events were held in many cities worldwide.\n\nOn 17 September 2011, 1,000 protesters gathered in downtown Manhattan walking up and down Wall Street. About 100 to 200 people stayed overnight in Zucotti Park, two blocks north of Wall Street. By 19 September, seven people had been arrested.\n\nAt least 80 arrests were made on 24 September after protesters started marching uptown and forcing the closure of several streets. Most of the 80 arrests were for blocking traffic, though some were also charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Police officers also used a technique called kettling which involves using orange nets to isolate protesters into smaller groups. Videos which showed several penned-in female demonstrators being hit with pepper spray by a police official were widely disseminated, sparking controversy. That police official, later identified as Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna, was shown in other videos hitting a photographer with a burst of spray.\nPublic attention to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern that was to be repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. Clyde Haberman, writing in \"The New York Times\", said that \"If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, they may want to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna,\" calling the event \"vital\" for the still nascent movement. On 1 October 2011, protesters set out to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. \"The New York Times\" reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, \"The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway.\" A spokesman for the New York Police Department, Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.\n\nOn 4 October, a group of protesters who were arrested on the bridge filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging that officers had violated their constitutional rights by luring them into a trap and then arresting them. In June 2012, a federal judge ruled that the protesters had not received sufficient warning of arrest pending entrance onto the Brooklyn Bridge. Although video evidence showed the police warning protesters by bullhorn, after reviewing it, Judge Jed S. Rakoff sided with plaintiffs, saying, \"a reasonable officer in the noisy environment defendants occupied would have known that a single bull horn could not reasonably communicate a message to 700 demonstrators\".\n\nOn 5 October 2011, joined by union members, students, and the unemployed, the demonstration swelled to the largest yet with an estimated 15,000 marchers joining the protest. Smaller protests continued in cities and on college campuses across the country. Thousands of union workers joined protesters marching through the Financial District. The march was mostly peaceful—until after nightfall, when scuffles erupted. About 200 protesters tried to storm barricades blocking them from Wall Street and the Stock Exchange. Police responded with pepper spray and penned the protesters in with orange netting. Inspired by Occupy Wall Street, British protesters organized an occupation of the London Stock Exchange to bring attention to what they saw as unethical behavior on the part of banks. One of the organizers of the protest said the protests were to be focused against \"increasing social and economic injustice in this country.\" In his opinion, \"the Government has made sure to maintain the status quo and let the people who caused this crisis get off scot-free, whilst conversely ensuring that the people of this country pay the price, in particular those most vulnerable.\"\n\nOn 15 October 2011 global protests were staged around the world, with thousands of protesters staging demonstrations in 900 cities including Auckland, Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, São Paulo, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and many other cities. In Frankfurt, 5,000 people protested at the European Central Bank and in Zurich, Switzerland's financial hub, protesters carried banners reading \"We won't bail you out yet again\" and \"We are the 99 percent.\" Protests were largely peaceful; however, a protest in Rome that drew thousands turned violent. Thousands of Occupy Wall Street protesters gathered in Times Square in New York City and rallied for several hours. Several hundred protesters were arrested across the U.S., mostly for refusing to obey police orders to leave public areas. In Chicago there were 175 arrests, about 100 arrests in Arizona (53 in Tucson, 46 in Phoenix), and more than 70 in New York City, including at least 40 in Times Square. Multiple arrests were reported in Chicago, and about 150 people camped out by city hall in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 25 October, police cleared and closed an Occupy Oakland encampment in Frank Ogawa Plaza in Oakland, California. The raid was chaotic and violent, but Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan expressed his pleasure concerning the operation because neither the police nor the public suffered any injuries. A street march that afternoon protesting the closure culminated in a confrontation between police and protesters, who sought to re-establish the Ogawa Plaza encampment. During this confrontation, protester Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a tear-gas projectile or smoke canister fired by police. By 29 October 2011, there were around 2,300 Occupy protest camps across around 2,000 cities worldwide. On 2 November, protesters in Oakland, California, shut down the Port of Oakland, the fifth busiest port in the nation. Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city; however, a member of the Occupy movement was quoted by the BBC as estimating as many as 30,000 may have taken part.\n\nOn 4 November 2011, \"Occupy the Roads\" (OTR) started traveling throughout the U.S. to bring the message of Occupy, in order to educate the people on various issues facing the general public and shine a light on the inequities and political injustice. OTR has been to every major Occupy Event in support of all occupied cities, traveling over 31,000 miles and visiting 42 States and 160 cities since inception. One side of the RV (named the \"V\"- from the chant \"Whose V? RV\") has been decorated with stickers, posters, and event notices from around the Country representing a billboard for the Occupy movement. On the other side is 31 ft of graphics in support for Bradley/Chelsey Manning and WikiLeaks.\n\nOn 5 November, protesters held \"Bank Transfer Day\", marching on banks and other financial institutions to urge Americans to move their money from big corporate banks to smaller community credit unions. It was reported that an estimated 600,000 people took their money out of major banks. On 11 November, Remembrance Day in Canada, police forcibly removed tents from Victoria Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrested 15 protestors. On the night of 14 November, a coordinated crackdown was undertaken by authorities around the world, with several camps being forcibly cleared including Zuccotti Park in New York, Oakland, Oregon, Denver and Zurich. For some of the other camps such as the one at St Pauls in London, no physical action was taken, but on 15 November authorities stepped up legal action to gain authorization for a forcible eviction. \"Financial Times\" editor Richard Lambert suggested that the shift to confrontational tactics by authorities would be more likely to spur on the movement rather than cause it to disband. However, John Gapper, chief business commentator at the \"FT\", offered a different view. Gapper said that it may be advantageous that the camps were being closed down, as they were beginning to alienate even members of the public who were initially fully sympathetic with the movement. During a demonstration at UC Davis on 18 November 2011, campus police Lieutenant John Pike used pepper spray on seated students. The incident drew national attention and led to further demonstrations, petitions, and calls for Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi to resign. (See: UC Davis pepper-spray incident) On 22 November, occupiers mic checked President Obama to draw his attention to the treatment they had received from the police, including thousands of arrests.\n\nBy December, occupiers had begun to divert their energies beyond protest camps and a narrow focus on the banks, instead seeking to engage further with mainstream politics and joining forces with established activist groups to support causes broadly compatible with the interests of \"the 99%\". Interviewing one of the informal leaders of the movement, \"Financial Times\" journalist Shannon Bond found that issues of concern included: \"the unemployment rate, household debt, student debt, the lack of prospects for people graduating from college and foreclosures.\" In the U.S., Occupy Homes joined with other existing human rights activists groups and began to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions. On 1 December, two evicted activists in Portland, Oregon, planted a table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall and lit a candle, igniting a Prayer Vigil/Occupation of City Hall that lasted 18 months. On 22 December \"The Washington Post\" reported that some of the cities which had forcefully disbanded occupy camps were now facing legal challenges.\n\nOn 2 January 2012, Occupy Nigeria began, sparked by Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan announcing the ending of fuel subsidies in the country. There was support from the global movement, but most of the activity took place in Nigeria itself, with a report from CSM saying strikes were effectively shutting down whole cities. On 16 January Jonathan responded by announcing he would bring prices back down by partially restoring the fuel subsidy.\n\nWhile students have been involved with Occupy since its inception, early 2012 has seen increasing formal interaction between the Occupy movement and academia. In the US, universities including Columbia and Roosevelt have begun offering courses about the movement, in the case of Columbia the course includes field work where students join in with Occupy activities. In Great Britain, Occupy's outwork teams are planning school visits to give talks about the movement and related issues.\n\nOn 23 January, EGT LLC (Export Grain Terminal) and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) reached a tentative agreement, mediated by Washington state governor Christine Gregoire. The agreement resolved a year-long dispute, paving the way for ILWU Local 21 workers to work inside the $200 million grain terminal at the Port of Longview in south-west Washington state. This came after \"Occupy the Ports\" protests which shut down multiple ports on the west coast of the United States on 12 December. The goals of those protests included support of longshoremen and truckers in disputes with EGT and terminal operator SSA Marine (partially owned by Goldman Sachs).\n\nA worldwide poll conducted in January 2012 found that only one third (37%) of respondents were familiar with the movement. Of the respondents who were aware of the movement, supporters of the movement outweighed those in opposition two to one. In late January, Occupy protested at the World Economic Forum. On 17 March, Occupy Wall Street attempted to mark six months of the movement, by reoccupying Zuccotti Park, the location of the first Occupy camp. Protestors were soon cleared away by police, who made over 70 arrests. On 1 May, the Occupy movement marked a resurgence with a May Day general strike that took place in cities across the U.S., including New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles. This included a revival of the Free University of New York.\n\nOn the weekend of 15 and 16 September, members of the Occupy movement gathered in Union Square, with direct action training on the 15th and a celebration of the movement on the 16th. On 17 September, the Occupy movement celebrated its first anniversary with several marches and general assemblies which were attended by thousands of protesters.\n\nThe longest US \"re-occupation\" started on 1 December 2011, when evicted activists from the Occupy Portland camp set up a table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall and lit a candle, igniting the 24/7 Prayer Vigil to Lift the Camping Ban, referring to the city's anti-\"camping\" ordinances that were cited during the eviction. The activists claimed the laws, which prohibit the use of \"bedding, sleeping bags, or other sleeping matter,\" are immoral and that they're obligated to challenge them. The occupiers claim that sleep is human right and is essential for mental, physical and emotional health, citing that human beings need to spend nearly a third of their lives sleeping. Prohibiting sleep by making it illegal for people to protect themselves and their belongings from the elements causes sleep deprivation; it is inhumane, unconstitutional, and amounts to torture. The activists said the prayer vigil would continue until \"bedding matter\" was again legal. The vigil was staffed around the clock until 23 July 2013, when Mayor Charlie Hales ordered the removal of the vigil and associated encampments on the abutting sidewalks.\n\nThe Occupy movement has \"already transformed beyond recognition from its original state\" and \"campaigns have emerged outside the constraint of the trademark Occupy tactics.\" These campaigns include Occupy Sandy which has provided needed relief to the New York area since Hurricane Sandy hit, Occupy London's Occupy Economics group that hosted, and was praised by the Bank of England's Executive Director for Financial Stability, Occupy the SEC, which monitors US financial regulatory matters, The Rolling Jubilees program of Strike Debt, which is raising money to retire \"zombie debt,\" debt, such as medical bills, that the individual cannot re-pay, Occupy University, which has developed and made accessible free educational materials, and the Debt Collective, a successor of Strike Debt, worked to get students of a fraudulent for-profit college absolved of their debt with some success.\n\nOn 3 April 2016, hundreds of supporters of Bernie Sanders protested outside of CNN's Headquarters in Los Angeles. Sanders supporters were protesting CNN's coverage of the 2016 United States presidential elections, specifically in regards to the amount of airtime Sanders has received. Known as Occupy CNN, protestors are claiming that major media networks have intentionally blacked out Sanders' presidential campaign in favor of giving much more airtime to candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Occupy spirit lives on by annual online and offline celebrations each year on 17 September in the village of St. Imier where modern anarchism began with the International Congress of 1872. The Occupy Cafe along with the Decentrale Co operative continues to assist those wishing to participate in the continuing \"decentralisation of the power \"of banks and corporate entities; and, to encourage global activism through developing trust and value networks.\n\nAfter an approximate 2 year hiatus in activism on location, the Occupy Movement organized the Occupy ICE phase in order to protest the actions of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office regarding the detention of undocumented immigrants presenting themselves at the southern US border points to seek asylum. While small groups of protestors emerged across the country in protest of the separation of families who were detained during immigration processing, a group swarmed the ICE facility in SOHO, NYC, causing it to shutdown temporarily. In Washington state, hundreds of Occupy ICE activists took over a portion of the grounds of the Portland ICE building. The blockade caused the building to shutdown for several days, with ICE staff citing 'safety concerns'. On 25 June, Feds ordered the protestors to vacate government environs or face arrest. On 28 June 2018, Federal officers moved in the early morning hours to remove and/or arrest protestors blockading the building. 8 protestors were arrested.\n\n19 August 2018 - Occupy Kalamazoo begins encampment to address homelessness ( as of sept 9th 2018) Encampment has stood and is still growing to with a list of demands to address homelessness.\n\nOn 20 February 2012 near Margaryan Maternity Clinic, where kiosks were being built by the city authorities. The place of protests was promptly dubbed \"Mashtots park\" – a name under which it is now widely known by the Armenian society now.\n\nThe protesters faced police violence as with many other \"Occupy\" movements, a report was filed to the ombudsman of RA on account of the destruction of a tent with a sleeping protester inside. \"Occupy\" demonstrations are still continuing in Mashtots Park, and the leader of the Greens party Armenak Dovlatyan has named it the most successful civic action in the history of the Republic of Armenia.\n\n\"Occupy\" demonstrations took place in Canberra, Wollongong, Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne, as well as smaller towns around the country. At the Occupy Melbourne protest on 21 October 2011, approximately 150 protesters defied police orders to clear the area, and were subsequently removed with force. 95 arrests were made and 43 reports of police violence were filed. Occupiers returned the following day in a walk against police violence, re-occupying multiple sites since.\nOccupy Sydney had an ongoing occupation in Martin Place since their initial police eviction, marking almost 21 months in July 2013. The Occupy Sydney camp was removed on 3 July 2013 but it returned on 4 July. It was again removed on 5 July.\n\nIn Brussels, a large Occupy demonstration took place on 15 October involving between 6,500 and 8,000 participants. The protest was largely peaceful, although seven people were arrested following vandalisation of the Dexia bank headquarters and financial tower. The Occupy Antwerp (Antwerpen) movement had its first gathering on Saturday 22 October at the Groenplaats, next to the cathedral. About 150–200 people attended a speakers corner. The left-wing socialist party (PVDA) was present and served free soup as well as information about its proposed \"millionaires' tax\".\nTo date, there have been four Occupy protests in Leuven. Three took place on the Grand Market in the centre of the city and one took place at a building of the city's Catholic university. The number of protesters in these rallies varied from 100 to 250. These protests have not included prolonged camping, but the protesters say that it is a possibility in the future. Occupy Ghent (Gent) began on 29 October with 400 people in the South Park (Zuidpark). They received a visit by supporters attending the \"second day of Socialism\" (de Tweede Dag van het Socialisme), also held in Ghent on the same day.\n\nThe 2013 protests in Brazil (also known as the V for Vinegar Movement,[5] Salad Revolt, Vinegar Revolt, Come to the street and Brazilian Spring) are ongoing public demonstrations in several Brazilian cities, initiated mainly by the Movimento Passe Livre (Free Fare Movement), a local entity that advocates for free public transportation. The most recent movement being \"Ocupe Estelita\" in Recife, Pernambuco which is focused on the demolition of an historical part of the city to make way for high-priced housing and leisure facilities.\n\nOccupy protests have taken place in at least 20 Canadian cities since 15 October 2011. On that day, 5,000 people gathered in Vancouver to protest perceived social injustice, while 150 stayed the night in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery. 2,000 people marched in Toronto on 15 October and around 100 continued to occupy St James Park, and 1,000 gathered in Montreal to march down Ste-Catherine Street; 85 tents were set up in Victoria square. Beginning on 23 October 2011 approximately 40 people occupied Memorial Park on Minto Street in downtown Sudbury and still continue to do so. On 20 October 2011, over 100 people occupied the front of City Hall in Prince George British Columbia. Events have been concentrated in provincial urban areas, and there have yet to be any demonstrations in the territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, or Nunavut. A relatively small group of occupiers successfully occupied Harbourside Park in St John's Newfoundland for the entire 2012 Winter season. This site, known also as \"King's Beach\" is symbolically significant as the birthplace of the British Empire, and the encampment is seen by some protesters to represent an occupation of colonialism vis-a-vis its birth site. There are currently a number of court proceedings across Canada on whether or not the eviction of protestors and violence from police is an infringement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nAround 800 student protestors began occupying universities across Colombia on 12 November 2011.\n\nOn 28 April 2012, a week after demonstrations of unions and civic associations (more than one hundred thousand protesters) the camp \"Occupy Klárov\" in Prague was started. Pirate Party participated in the occupation. Police dissolved the camp a month later.\n\nOn 19 November 2011, protesters started the \"No Borders Camp\" Or \"Occupy Buffer Zone\", a permanent occupation of the United Nations controlled buffer zone in the centre of the capital, Nicosia, demanding an end to the decades-long division of the Island. The movement used the Twitter hashtag \"OccupyBufferZ\". By June 2012 the occupation of the buffer zone was essentially over.\n\nOn 15 October 2011, 2,000 protesters showed up on the square in front of the city hall of Copenhagen, protesting in sympathy with OWS. Immediately after the demonstration an \"Occupy Copenhagen\" camp was established. The camp, internally nicknamed \"Plaza One Love\", lived through harsh climate conditions and a couple of eviction attempts for two months, until it was torn down by the Municipality of Copenhagen and Danish police, on 21 December. The movement has shifted to a mobile camp tactic, and still holds GA every Wednesday and other activities throughout the week.\n\nSome 300 protesters started occupying Paris's financial district, La Défense, on 4 November 2011. Since then, their camp has been torn down by several police forces. According to French protestors, relations with the police have varied considerably. Some police joined them for coffee and friendly discussion, but otherwise were hostile and confiscated blankets and food, leaving protesters sleeping in the cold outdoors without protection. On 11 November, following a call made on social networks, some 400 additional people joined the occupation. Occupy protests have also begun at Nantes, Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille, Perpignan and more than 50 cities.\n\nOn 31 March 2016, students and young workers began occupying public spaces in France in opposition to the 2016 neoliberal labor reforms in a protest movement known as Nuit debout. As of 8 April, it has spread to dozens of cities in France as well as to Belgium, Germany, and Spain.\n\nThe Occupy movement began in Germany on 15 October 2011 with protests in Berlin, focused outside the Reichstag, as well as Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf. Occupy Frankfurt subsequently took residence in front of the European Central Bank, and Occupy Berlin established a protest camp at St. Mary's Church. On 12 November major Occupy protests took place in Berlin and Frankfurt. Police reported that around 9,000 people peacefully protested near the headquarters of the European Central Bank, and that \"several thousand\" people took to the streets of Berlin; organisers of the protests claimed that turnout was around 8,000 in Berlin and 10,000 in Frankfurt.\n\nAn Occupy movement in Hong Kong, named 'Occupy Central', began on 15 October 2011 with protesters occupying the plaza beneath the HSBC Main Building in Central, an iconic landmark of the territory's central business district. Despite the fact that the protesters were peaceful, HSBC filed a lawsuit for their eviction. On 13 August 2012, the High Court ruled that the protesters must leave the occupied area. On 11 September 2012, the protesters were evicted from the plaza by court bailiffs, ending one of the world's longest continuously occupied Occupy protest camps.\n\nSocial protests have been ongoing in Israel since 14 July 2011.\n\nOn 15 October 2011, about 200,000 people gathered in Rome to protest against economic inequality and the influence of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on government. Many other protests occurred in other Italian cities the same day. In Rome masked and hooded militants wearing makeshift body armor, in black bloc fashion, participated in the protests centered in St John Lateran square and committed numerous violent acts, throwing Molotov cocktails and other homemade explosives, burning and blowing up cars, burning buildings, and smashing up property such as ATMs and shop windows. The Roman Catholic church Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano received extensive damage, including a statue of the Virgin Mary being thrown into the street and destroyed. \n\nSeveral unexploded petrol bombs were reportedly found on several streets by Italian police. Over 1,000,000 euros of damage (equivalent to over 1.3 million dollars) was recorded. At least 135 people were injured in the resulting clashes, including 105 police officers, several of whom were left in critical condition, and two news crews from Sky Italia. Two protesters had their fingers amputated by exploding smoke bombs. Almost 20 people have been arrested in connection with the violence. After the 15 October demonstration, people occupied the Santa Croce in Gerusalemme square and started camping as in other cities worldwide. The name of this Rome's group, related to international Occupy movement, is Accampata Roma.\n\nThe Occupy Dataran movement first held their assembly at Dataran Merdeka (Independence Square) seven weeks before Occupy Wall Street on 30 July 2011 to create an alternative to the current representative democracy using the popular assembly model based on principles of participatory democracy. As part of the 15 October 2011 global protests, over 200 people took part in 15 October's Occupy Dataran, the largest assembly to date. In late October, the movement spread to Penang with Occupy Penang and Kelantan with Occupy Kota Bharu.\n\nOccupy began in Mexico City on 11 October 2011, with a hunger strike in front of the Mexican Stock Exchange highrise. Edur Velasco, a 56-year-old labor economist and university professor, was on a 42-day-long hunger strike sitting in a tent outside Mexico City's stock market, demanding that the government guarantee greater access to higher education among the youth. Days after his initiative, it came as a surprise to see the multiplication of tents setting up outside the stock exchange building. Police remained discreetly around the corner sitting in their trucks.\n\nOccupy Mexico did not achieve the level of popularity it gained in other areas. This is attributed to the fact that Mexico's Occupy protesters, which were focused on poverty and workers' rights, failed to resonate with a public enthralled by the violence of the Mexican Drug War. In contrast, an anti-violence movement led by Javier Sicilia during the time that the Occupy protests occurred, drew thousands onto the streets of Mexico City. The Occupy Movement was almost entirely ignored by Mexico's mainstream politicians. By late January 2012, most of the tents were empty and only a few protesters remained outside the Stock Exchange.\n\nS. Ganbaatar, the head of Mongolia's Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU), has announced that the association joins the worldwide occupy protests of Wall Street and other high streets on 20 October 2011. He claimed that bankers are charging higher interest rates from customers and corporates. In the most recent data in September 2011, the weighted average annual MNT lending rate is 16% in Mongolia.\n\nAlso known as Baluwatar Satyagraha, Occupy Baluwatar is a peaceful protest movement calling on the Nepali state to better address the widespread problem of impunity and gender-based violence. Since 28 December 2012, protesters have gathered outside the prime minister's official residence in Baluwatar from 9:00 to 11:00 am daily. The protesters created a coherent set of demands, divided into short- and long-term goals, which they presented to then prime minister Baburam Bhattarai. The short-term demands called on the state, including the police and the judiciary, to properly investigate and prosecute the guilty in five specific cases which took place immediately prior to the movement's start. The long-term demands focused on policy reform in the arenas of migration and rape laws, among others.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Occupy protests took place in many cities, most notably Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht\n\nIn October 2011, Occupy protests began in six New Zealand cities (Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill) with protests in Auckland drawing up to 3,000 supporters. A seventh Occupy protest started on 19 November in the Lower Hutt suburb of Pomare by a group called \"Pomare Community Voice\" to highlight what they call the \"loss of community\" caused by the demolition of state homes in the area. On 23 January, police moved in on four sites in Auckland. Two arrests were made and police said campers were in breach of council bylaws regarding camping. The sites were at Aotea Square, 360 Queen St, Victoria Park and Albert Park.\n\nOccupy Nigeria is an anti-fuel subsidy removal protest that started in Nigeria on 2 January 2012 in response to fuel subsidy removal by the Federal government of Nigeria on 1 January 2012. It is a movement against corruption in Government & public service, insensitive & inhuman treatment of Nigerians by Government & Security agents. The movement ended on 16 January 2012 following agreement between the government and the organized labour leaders which saw a partial restoration of the subsidy regime. Fuel pump price in Nigeria has since then been fixed at the official rate of 97 naira per litre while it practically sells for as high as 130 naira in some major cities including Port Harcourt, one of the cities in the oil-producing states in Nigeria.\n\nThe Occupy movement in Norway began on 15 October with protests in Oslo and Bergen as part of the Global Day of Action. In Oslo, the movement has since then met every Saturday in the city centre, usually at Eidsvolls plass in front of the Parliament, but sometimes at other sites, like Spikersuppa and Youngstorget. In Bergen, the movement meets on Saturdays at Vågsallmenningen 4 (Holbergsstatuen).\n\nTo date six towns and cities in Ireland have witnessed experienced Occupy camps; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Letterkenny, and Athlone. Protests were held in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. \"The Irish Times\" described the movement in the following terms: \"The group has no hierarchical structure, has set up a Facebook page and Twitter account – with the social media links attracting a very mixed, and sometimes critical, reaction.\" The protest in Dublin was organized by \"Pots & Pans – Ireland\", and #OccupyDameStreet protest group, who then invited Real Democracy Now! Shell to Sea, Tir na Saor and many other non political groups to participate and all set up camp outside the Central Bank of Ireland in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York. On 22 October it was reported that over 2,000 people took part in a demonstration organized by Occupy Dame Street. This camp survived through the winter, but was removed by an Garda Síochána (Irish police) on 13 March 2012, days before the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. On the morning of 16 May 2012 at approximately 4:30 am, the Occupy camp in Eyre Square in Galway, the longest-lasting of the Occupy groups in Ireland, was removed by An Garda Síochána and Galway City Council. The camp was removed because the group was illegally occupying a public amenity. At the time the camp was dismantled, there were only 6 protesters at the camp. The camp had lasted for 215 days.\n\nIn South Africa, a movement called \"Taking Back South Africa!\" sprung up as an initiative primarily aimed at protesting and inciting mass action against the economic and social inequality in the country. It consists of a loose informal affiliation of on-the-ground groups and individuals across South Africa as well as internet based groups. During the 2016 Fees Must Fall movement, protest groups also adopted the slogan #Occupy4FreeEducation in response to the government's perceived lack of interest in dealing with the issue.\n\nHundreds of protesters held rallies in the South Korean capital of Seoul on 15 and 22 October in 2011 under the slogan of \"Occupy Seoul\". Protesters focused on issues such as a recent free trade agreement with the United States as well as costs of tuition and rent.\n\n\"Occupy Seoul\" began as a part of 15 October 2011 global protests. Protesters gathered in several places in Seoul, including Yeouido (financial hub of Seoul) where protesters rallied under the slogan of \"Occupy Yeouido: 99% against Financial Exploitation of 1%.\" Three primary requirements demanded by these protesters were: (1) clarifying the responsibility of the bureaucracy, (2) financial regulations, and (3) compensations for the victims of failed financial policies of Korean government. Other protesters, led by leftist organizations such as People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, gathered in front of Seoul train station and Daehanmoon. However, they failed to enter the Seoul City Hall Plaza as they had planned, as their protest permit was rejected by the police due to an exhibition that was already taking place in the Plaza.\n\nAlthough there were considerable support from public, there were also criticisms regarding the nature of the protest. Unlike the original Occupy movement which started out as the anti-capitalist protest, many of the catchphrases of Occupy Seoul contained anti-government or anti-American messages. One of the observers has argued that \"South Korea overcame the 2008 financial crisis relatively well and there was no serious crisis in financial sector. It is hard to find the legitimate basis of the protest.\"\n\nA series of protests demands a radical change in Spanish politics, as protesters do not consider themselves to be represented by any traditional party nor favoured by the measures approved by politicians. Spanish media have related the protests to the economic crisis, Stéphane Hessel's \"Time for Outrage!\", the NEET troubled generation and current protests in the Middle East and North Africa, Greece, Portugal as well as the Icelandic protest and riots in 2009. The 15-M Movement drew inspiration from 2011 revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and uprisings in 1968 France, South Korea in 1980 and 1987 and Greece in 2008.\n\nOn 15 October 2011, between 500 to 1,000 Occupy protesters demonstrated in front of the offices of UBS and Credit Suisse on the Paradeplatz in Zurich. 100 protesters later established an occupation on the nearby Lindenhof, which was evicted by the police on 15 November.\n\nThe Sunflower Student Movement (太陽花學運) is a protest movement driven by a coalition of students and civic groups that began on 18 March 2014, in the Legislative Yuan and, later, also the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). The activists protested the passing of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) by the ruling party Kuomintang at the legislature without clause-by-clause review. The protesters occupied the legislature for 24 days before vacating peacefully.\n\nThe initial protests in Istanbul on 28 May 2013 were led by about 50 environmentalists against replacing Taksim Gezi Park with a reconstruction of the Ottoman Era Taksim Military Barracks (the scene of pro Sultan riots in 1909). The current protests developed into riots after the heavy handed police intervention which featured significant use of tear gas and water cannons. The oppressive reaction to the protests caused the protests to widen with many more people to become involved, people from many different walks of life including a wide range of political interest groups, secular and religious people, students, gays, feminists, football fans, women in head scarves, whole families, all finding reason to join the protests.\n\nWhat started as an environmentalist protest against plans to replace Taksim Gezi Park developed into wider anti-government demonstrations. Demands issued on 4 June included\n\nAs part of the 15 October 2011 global protests, protesters gathered in London, Bristol, and Birmingham in England, together with Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland (See \"Scotland\" heading below). The London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters of Occupy London on 15 October 2011. Attempts to occupy the square were thwarted by police. Police sealed off the entrance to the square as it is private property, and a High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square. 2,500–3,000 people gathered nearby outside St Paul's Cathedral, with 250 camping overnight. A canon of St. Paul's, Reverend Giles Fraser, said he was happy for people to \"exercise their right to protest peacefully\" outside the cathedral and an indefinite encampment was established. Additional smaller protests occurred in Birmingham and Nottingham. As of 17 October an indefinite encampment had also been established on College Green in Bristol.\n\nOn 29 October a camp was also established in Victoria Gardens, Brighton, and grew from six tents to around twenty within one week. Further Occupy camps took place in Liverpool Bath, Bournemouth University, Bradford, Leeds, Sheffield, Thanet, Newcastle upon Tyne, Plymouth, Exeter, Norwich, The Occupy Thanet protests also focused on local issues, including the closure of shops in the town and the Dreamland Margate amusement park, a lack of employment opportunities and perceived disparities in the allocation of education resources. Lancaster in England and Cardiff in Wales. On 8 January 2012, Lancaster Police arrested four members of Occupy Lancaster who were occupying a disused hotel in the city centre.\n\nOn 11 November, police arrested 179 people believed to be EDL supporters on Armistice Day after apparent threats to the St Paul's camp were posted on Facebook. 176 were released without charge and 3 were bailed \"pending further inquiries\".\n\nOn 15 November, an Occupy camp was established in the centre of Leicester near the Highcross shopping centre. On 25 November an Occupy camp was established in Liverpool near the Walker Art Gallery. Starting on 30 November 2011 following a national strike action, a body of students occupied the University of Sheffield Arts Tower in solidarity with, but not limited to, the Occupy movement.\n\nOn 17 October 2014 a new camp was established in Parliament Square, Westminster by a group called Occupy Democracy. The camp was part of a campaign for greater transparency in democracy as well as an end to lobbying. The camp lasted two days until police swept in, giving protestors 30 minutes to leave or face arrest. Any items that could be used for sleeping have been deemed illegal under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, created after the original occupation. The eviction was live streamed, showing police dragging protesters away. Police said there was one arrest. Fifty to a hundred protesters remained in the park overnight. On their website, the group says their goal is \"to direct the energy from current single issue struggles into a critical mass that can radically challenge the corrupt and unrepresentative system.\"\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Occupy Belfast initiated its protest outside the offices of Invest NI on 21 October 2011. Occupy Belfast took residence at Writer's Square, in the Cathedral Quarter. It also took control of a disused building owned by the Bank of Ireland, renaming it the People's Bank, with plans to open a library and homeless accommodation to be a community hub. It was expected that an Occupy Derry would take place in the near future.\n\nOccupy Coleraine took over the University of Ulster Common Room for three weeks in December 2013. The group protested the demolition of the historic student-teacher shared space, due for refurbishment as a senior management corporate dining room.\n\nOccupy camps were established in the financial district of St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh on 15 October 2011. St. Andrews Square is the home of the Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters in the Dundas House mansion. Edinburgh City Council subsequently officially backed Occupy Edinburgh and the Occupy movement worldwide. Protesters from Occupy Glasgow set up in the civic George Square on 15 October but after the council obtained a court order moved to Kelvingrove Park, where the council agreed to provide running water, toilets and safety fences.\n\nIn Wales, Occupy Cardiff originally set its camp-site outside Cardiff Castle but it was disbanded by police, and some protesters were arrested. Charges were later dropped following calls from trade unionists, lawyers and politicians including Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, Labour Party politician Tony Benn and demonstrations outside Cardiff magistrates court. Occupy Cardiff set up a new camp in the city, outside the offices of Welsh Labour and a number of trade unions at the Transport House, Cathedral Road.\n\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests began in New York City on 17 September 2011. By 9 October, similar demonstrations were either ongoing or had been held in 70 major cities and over 600 communities across the U.S. The movement rejects existing political institutions and attempts to create alternative ones through direct action and direct democracy. Occupy protesters' slogan, \"We are the 99%\", asserts that the \"99%\" pay for the mistakes of the \"1%\".\nThe original location of choice by the protesters was 1 Chase Plaza, the site of the \"Charging Bull\" statue, but when police discovered the planned site, it was fenced off and nearby Zuccotti Park was chosen. There was scant media coverage till 24 September when a large march forcing the closure of several streets resulted in 80 arrests. Police used a technique called \"netting\", the use of orange plastic nets to corral protesters, and the march received extensive media coverage when a video of several \"netted\" young women being pepper sprayed was widely circulated.\n\nMedia coverage was again sparked on 1 October, when New York City protesters attempted to march across the Brooklyn Bridge and more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge and even escorting them partway across before they began to make mass arrests. On 25 October, police officers cleared two Occupy Oakland protest camp sites. Police fired tear gas canisters at the protestors, allegedly in response to objects being thrown at them. Protest organizers said that many of the troublemakers were not part of the Occupy movement. The raid was described as \"violent and chaotic at times\" and resulted in over 102 arrests. Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a projectile that witnesses believed was a tear gas or smoke canister fired by the police. On 2 November, protesters in Oakland, California, shut down the Port of Oakland, the fifth busiest port in the nation. Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city.\n\nAt about 1:00 am on 15 November, police cleared the Zuccotti Park encampment. Many journalists complained that the police had made a deliberate decision to keep journalists away from the park during the raid. New York City journalists responded to what they perceived as \"alarming suppression, abuse and arrests of reporters\" by forming \"The Coalition for the First Amendment\" to \"monitor police-press relations as a way of spotlighting police activities that threaten constitutional protections\". Executive Director Alison Bethel McKenzie of the International Press Institute commented: \"It is completely unacceptable to hinder reporting on a subject that is undoubtedly of public interest. Such reporting is vital to democracy, and authorities at every level of government – federal, state and local – must honour their constitutional obligation not to infringe upon the freedom of the press.\"\n\nOn 6 December, Occupy Homes, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, embarked on a \"national day of action\" to protest the mistreatment of homeowners by big banks, who they say made billions of dollars off the housing bubble by offering predatory loans and indulging in practices that allegedly took advantage of consumers. In more than two dozen cities across the nation the movement took on the housing crisis by re-occupying foreclosed homes, disrupting bank auctions and blocking evictions. On 17 September 2012, protesters returned to Zuccotti Park to mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the occupation.\n\n\n\"Foreign Affairs\" has had various articles covering the movement. In the January/February 2012 issue, Francis Fukuyama argued that the Occupy movement was not as influential as the right-wing Tea Party movement. \"One of the most puzzling features of the world in the aftermath of the financial crisis,\" he wrote, \"is that so far, populism has taken primarily a right-wing form, not a left-wing one.\" In contrast, a survey for the think tank Center for American Progress suggested that the Occupy movement has succeeded in substantially boosting the coverage of the job crisis in the American media.\n\nEgyptian protesters from Tahrir Square have lent their support of the movement. A message of solidarity issued by a collective of Cairo-based protesters declared: \"As the interests of government increasingly cater to the interests and comforts of private, transnational capital, our cities and homes have become progressively more abstract and violent places, subject to the casual ravages of the next economic development or urban renewal scheme. An entire generation across the globe has grown up realizing, rationally and emotionally, that we have no future in the current order of things.\"\nIn early December 2011, business magnate Richard Branson said the movement is a \"good start\", that they have been protesting for valid reasons, and that if the business community takes some of their concerns on board they will have made a difference.\n\nOn 15 December 2011, Jesse Jackson said that Jesus Christ, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King were all occupiers, and that: \"Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children\". A global survey of 23 countries published by Ipsos on 20 January 2012 found that around 40% of the world's citizens are familiar with the movement. Over twice as many reported a favourable response to the movement compared to those who dislike it. Support for the movement varied markedly among countries, with South Korea (67%), Indonesia (65%), and India (64%) reporting the highest sympathy – while Australia (41%), Japan (41%), and Poland (37%) reporting the lowest.\n\nSome known impacts to date include the following:\n\nIn the United States, the protests have helped shift the focus of national dialogue from the federal budget deficit to economic problems many ordinary Americans face, such as unemployment, the large amount of student and other personal debt that burdens middle class and working class Americans, and other major issues of social inequality, such as homelessness. The movement appears to have generated a national conversation about income inequality, as evidenced by the fact that print and broadcast news mentioned the term \"income inequality\" more than five times more often during the last week of October 2011 than during the week before the occupation began. Longer term effects are much less clear, as according to Google search trends, in the years since 2012 interest has waned. Occupy movement raised awareness regarding what organizers consider undeserved wealth and lack of fairness in American society. Labor unions have become bolder in the tactics they employ and have been using digital social media more effectively thanks to the Occupy movement. In New York City, the Occupy Wall Street protest has also provided hundreds of protesters to help in picket actions conducted by labor unions.\n\nOffshoots of the Occupy movement, such as Rolling Jubilee, a project of Strike Debt, have bought millions in \"zombie debt,\" money that individuals owe that they have no financial means to pay, including medical debt, to free the debtors from the obligation to pay it off. As of September 2014, Rolling Jubilee claims to have cancelled more than $15 million in medical debt and $4 million in private student loan debt. Noam Chomsky argues that the movement \"spontaneously created something that doesn't really exist in the country: communities of mutual support, cooperation, open spaces for discussion . . . just people doing things and helping each other.\" As of April 2015, Rolling Jubilee reports it has cleared nearly $32 million in debt.\n\nOn 10 November 2011, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the word \"occupy\" had been the \"most commonly used English word on the internet and in print\" over the past 12 months according to a top ten list published by media analysis company Global Language Monitor. In January 2012, members of the American Dialect Society voted with an overwhelming majority for \"Occupy\" as the word of the year for 2011. Numerous news shows and radio shows have been using the term \"1%\" and \"99%\" TV shows such as \"The Middle\", \"Revenge\" and, \"The Office\" have made references to Occupy, and, in July 2012, the City of Vancouver added the word to its list of reserve names for civic assets such as streets and buildings. In December 2012, the Television show Conan launched a contest called \"Occupy Conan.\"\n\nOn 27 December 2011, the \"Financial Times\" argued that the movement had had a global impact, altering \"the terms of the political debate.\" However, some sympathetic commentators such as Anthony Barnett have suggested that in Spain, where the movement once had the support of well over 70% of the population with millions taking part, the popularity of \"Occupy\" is now past its peak and has achieved no consequences of any significance. However, there were numerous successes at local levels, and \"The Economist\" has reported that Spanish protesters caused their government to pass various laws including new limits on the amounts banks can \"claw\" back from defaulting borrowers.\nIn November 2011, U.S. Congressman Ted Deutch, member of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced the \"Outlawing Corporate Cash Undermining the Public Interest in our Elections and Democracy (OCCUPIED) Constitutional Amendment,\" which would overturn the United States Supreme Court decision in \"Citizens United v. FEC\" recognizing corporate constitutionally protected free speech rights and would ban corporate money from the electoral process.\n\nIn March 2012, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore called on activists to \"occupy democracy\", explaining that \"Our democracy has been hacked. It no longer works to serve the best interests of the people of this country.\" Also in November 2011, Paul Mason said that the Occupy movement had started to dynamically shape the global policy response to the Late-2000s financial crisis, being mentioned so often at the 2011 G20 summit that if Occupy had been a brand \"it would have a profile to die for among the super-elite\". Various journalists along with Jared Bernstein former chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, have suggested that Occupy influenced the President's January 2012 State of the Union address, with the movement creating the political space for Obama to shift to the economic left and speak about the desirability of the rich paying a greater share of the tax burden. Inequality has remained a central theme of President Obama's reelection campaign, yet he no longer mentions the Occupy movement by name, which analysts say reflects the fact that by early 2012 Occupy had become a divisive issue, unpopular with some of the public.\n\nThree years later, income inequality had become a major part of the political discourse and \"The Atlantic\" Magazine declared \"The Triumph of Occupy Wall Street\"\n\nGovernment documents released in December 2012 pursuant to Freedom of Information Act requests by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund reveal FBI monitoring of what became known as the Occupy movement since at least August 2011, a month before the protests began. The FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, local police, regional law enforcement \"counterterrorism\" fusion centers, and private security forces of major banks formed the Domestic Security Alliance Council (DSAC) to collect and share information about, and to share plans to target and to arrest Occupy protesters. Banks met with the FBI to pool information about participants of the Occupy movement collected by corporate security, and the FBI offered to bank officials its plans to prevent Occupy events that were scheduled for a month later.\n\nFBI officials met with New York Stock Exchange representatives on 19 August 2011, notifying them of planned peaceful protests. FBI officials later met with representatives of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and Zions Bank about planned protests. The FBI used informants to infiltrate and monitor protests; information from informants and military intelligence units was passed to DSAC, which then gave updates to financial companies. Surveillance of protestors was also carried out by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. DSAC also coordinated with security firms hired by banks to target OWS leaders.\n\nFollowing actions by police and municipal officials to use force in closing various Occupy tent camps in public spaces, lawsuits have been filed, while others are being planned. Civil liberties organizations filed separate law suits against the FBI for refusing to turn over documents requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regarding the FBI's role in surveillance of the Occupy movement and the FBI's sharing of intelligence about Occupy events with private corporate security officials. The FBI withheld documents requested under the FOIA citing the reason that the withholding was \"in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.\"\n\nIn 2013, MIT doctoral student Ryan Shapiro, collecting research on the role of the FBI in the Occupy movement, sent the FBI three FOIA requests regarding \"a potential plan to gather intelligence against the leaders of [Occupy Wall Street-related protests in Houston] and obtain photographs, then formulate a plan to kill the leadership [of the protests] via suppressed sniper rifles.\" When the FBI refused the request, Shapiro filed a federal complaint in Washington, D.C., and subsequently obtained 17 pages (most of the requested documentation was ruled withheld due to the possibility to \"disclose the identity of a confidential source.\") The redacted FBI document confirmed the Houston plot and contradicted an earlier claim by the FBI that it had never opened an investigation on the Occupy movement.\n\nBy 2015, there were no more Occupy events chasing the same original goals. Instead, there were multiple reported protests that had similar methods to the Occupy movement, with different goals.\n\n\"Occupy\" has since become a style of protest, as Occupy Silicon Valley is aimed at tech wealth as well as general inequality caused by technology and its advances.\n\nApart from the dismissals made by political conservatives, there have also been appreciative criticisms from more left-wing scholars. One such critique concerns itself with the way in which the Occupy movement has focused its demands around a narrowly modern understanding of freedom that differs little from the claims of mainstream liberal pluralism:\n\nInternational activists involved in the Occupy Movement have seen it stall due a lack of synergy to work with other alternative movements calling for change. The biggest criticism is that the movement is without depth, without a lasting vision of an alternative future.\n\nIn her critique of the Occupy movement, American political philosopher Jodi Dean argues that the focus on autonomy, leaderlessness and horizontality paved the way for conflicts and disillusionment within the movement:\n\nRemarks from Occupy Wall Street participant Justine Tunney, a Google software engineer, who called on President Obama to appoint Eric Schmidt \"CEO of America\", have also sparked criticism, including from the vast majority of other Occupy participants, many of whom have observed that her politics are inconsistent with horizontalism.\n\nMany Occupy Wall Street protests have included anti-zionist and anti semitic slogans and signage such as \"Jews control Wall Street\" or \"Zionist Jews who are running the big banks and the Federal Reserve\". As a result, the Occupy Wall Street Movement has been consistently confronted with accusations of anti-Semitism. However, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League stated that \"it's not surprising that in a movement that deals with economic issues you're going to get bigots that believe in this stereotype...[however] they are not expressing or representing a larger view.\"\n\n\nOther U.S. protests\nOther international protests\nRelated articles\n\n\n\n\n"}

Built in the 1920s, it retains its splendour and elegant styling and is Bournemouth's regular home for West End stage shows, Opera, Ballet, Pantomime and Comedy as well as for corporate presentations and dinner dances, product launches and small conferences.\n\nOwned by Bournemouth Borough Council and managed by BH Live, the Pavilion operates alongside its sister venue, The Bournemouth International Centre.\n\nAdvocated as early as 1859, proposals for a Pavilion building incorporating a concert room, reading rooms and cafes were first authorised by the municipal authorities in 1892. The architectural competition was won by a young and unknown firm of architects called Home and Knight. On 19 March 1929, the building was opened by HRH The Duke of Gloucester. It had cost £250,000.\n\nInitially the Pavilion's main auditorium was not called a theatre, but a Concert Hall, and within a few years it became apparent that it had shortcomings in presenting staged productions. As a result, in 1933 the stage was enlarged, both in depth and height, and it was reopened as a theatre in July 1934. Numerous further alterations have been undertaken since, including the addition of two storeys to either side of the main entrance in the early 1950s, and the replacement of the large fountain in the forecourt by a smaller one in 1968.

{"id": "22954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22954", "title": "Plato", "text": "Plato\n\nPlato (; \"Plátōn\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the development of Western philosophy. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.\n\nAlong with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\" In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science, philosophy, and mathematics, Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality.\n\nPlato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato appears to have been the founder of Western political philosophy, with his \"Republic\", and \"Laws\" among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective. Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates, Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself.\n\nThe \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" describes Plato as \"...one of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the history of philosophy. ... He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word “philosopher” should be applied. But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him), Aquinas and Kant would be generally agreed to be of the same rank.\"\n\nDue to a lack of surviving accounts, little is known about Plato's early life and education. The philosopher came from one of the wealthiest and most politically active families in Athens. Ancient sources describe him as a bright though modest boy who excelled in his studies. His father contributed all which was necessary to give to his son a good education, and, therefore, Plato must have been instructed in grammar, music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of the most distinguished teachers of his era.\n\nThe exact time and place of Plato's birth are unknown, but it is certain that he belonged to an aristocratic and influential family. Based on ancient sources, most modern scholars believe that he was born in Athens or Aegina between 429 and 423 BC. His father was Ariston. According to a disputed tradition, reported by Diogenes Laertius, Ariston traced his descent from the king of Athens, Codrus, and the king of Messenia, Melanthus. Plato's mother was Perictione, whose family boasted of a relationship with the famous Athenian lawmaker and lyric poet Solon. Perictione was sister of Charmides and niece of Critias, both prominent figures of the Thirty Tyrants, the brief oligarchic regime, which followed on the collapse of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian War (404–403 BC). Besides Plato himself, Ariston and Perictione had three other children; these were two sons, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a daughter Potone, the mother of Speusippus (the nephew and successor of Plato as head of his philosophical Academy). The brothers Adeimantus and Glaucon are mentioned in the \"Republic\" as sons of Ariston, and presumably brothers of Plato, but some have argued they were uncles. But in a scenario in the \"Memorabilia\", Xenophon confused the issue by presenting a Glaucon much younger than Plato.\n\nThe traditional date of Plato's birth (428/427), the year after the death of prominent Athenian statesman Pericles, is based on a dubious interpretation of Diogenes Laertius, who says, \"When [Socrates] was gone, [Plato] joined Cratylus the Heracleitean and Hermogenes, who philosophized in the manner of Parmenides. Then, at twenty-eight, Hermodorus says, [Plato] went to Euclides in Megara.\" As Debra Nails argues, \"The text itself gives no reason to infer that Plato left immediately for Megara and implies the very opposite.\" In his \"Seventh Letter\", Plato notes that his coming of age coincided with the taking of power by the Thirty, remarking, \"But a youth under the age of twenty made himself a laughingstock if he attempted to enter the political arena.\" Thus, Nails dates Plato's birth to 424/423.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Ariston tried to force his attentions on Perictione, but failed in his purpose; then the god Apollo appeared to him in a vision, and as a result, Ariston left Perictione unmolested. Another legend related that, when Plato was an infant, bees settled on his lips while he was sleeping: an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse about philosophy.\n\nAriston appears to have died in Plato's childhood, although the precise dating of his death is difficult. Perictione then married Pyrilampes, her mother's brother, who had served many times as an ambassador to the Persian court and was a friend of Pericles, the leader of the democratic faction in Athens. Pyrilampes had a son from a previous marriage, Demus, who was famous for his beauty. Perictione gave birth to Pyrilampes' second son, Antiphon, the half-brother of Plato, who appears in \"Parmenides\".\n\nIn contrast to reticence about himself, Plato often introduced his distinguished relatives into his dialogues, or referred to them with some precision: Charmides has a dialogue named after him; Critias speaks in both \"Charmides\" and \"Protagoras\"; and Adeimantus and Glaucon take prominent parts in the \"Republic\". These and other references suggest a considerable amount of family pride and enable us to reconstruct Plato's family tree. According to Burnet, \"the opening scene of the \"Charmides\" is a glorification of the whole [family] connection ... Plato's dialogues are not only a memorial to Socrates, but also the happier days of his own family.\"\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laërtius, the philosopher was named \"Aristocles\" () after his grandfather. It was common in Athenian society for boys to be named after grandfathers (or fathers). But there is only one inscriptional record of an Aristocles, an early Archon of Athens in 605/4 BC. There is no record of a line from Aristocles to Plato's father, Ariston. However, if Plato was not named after an ancestor named Plato (there is no record of one), then the origin of his renaming as \"Plato\" becomes a conundrum.\n\nThe sources of Diogenes account for this fact by claiming that his wrestling coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him \"Platon\", meaning \"broad,\" on account of his robust figure or that Plato derived his name from the breadth (, \"platytēs\") of his eloquence, or else because he was very wide (, \"platýs\") across the forehead. Recently a scholar has argued that even the name Aristocles for Plato was a much later invention. Although \"Platon\" was a fairly common name (31 instances are known from Athens alone), the name does not occur in Plato's known family line. Another scholar, however, claims that \"there is good reason for not dismissing [the idea that Aristocles was Plato's given name] as a mere invention of his biographers\", noting how prevalent that account is in our sources. The fact that the philosopher in his maturity called himself \"Platon\" is indisputable, but the origin of this naming must remain moot unless the record is made to yield more information.\n\nApuleius informs us that Speusippus praised Plato's quickness of mind and modesty as a boy, and the \"first fruits of his youth infused with hard work and love of study\". Plato must have been instructed in grammar, music, and gymnastics by the most distinguished teachers of his time. Dicaearchus went so far as to say that Plato wrestled at the Isthmian games. Plato had also attended courses of philosophy; before meeting Socrates, he first became acquainted with Cratylus (a disciple of Heraclitus, a prominent pre-Socratic Greek philosopher) and the Heraclitean doctrines.\n\nAmbrose believed that Plato met Jeremiah in Egypt and was influenced by his ideas. Augustine initially accepted this claim, but later rejected it, arguing in \"The City of God\", that \"Plato was born a hundred years after Jeremiah prophesied.\" Hebrew-language chronology works argue that, based on seder hadoroth chronology, Jeremiah's final year of prophecy was 411 BCE (3350 HC), at which time Plato was a teenager and that he initially perceived Jeremiah to be absurd. \n\nPlato may have traveled in Italy, Sicily, Egypt and Cyrene. Said to have returned to Athens at the age of forty, Plato founded one of the earliest known organized schools in Western Civilization on a plot of land in the Grove of Hecademus or Academus. The Academy was a large enclosure of ground about six stadia outside of Athens proper. One story is that the name of the Academy comes from the ancient hero, Academus; still another story is that the name came from a supposed former owner of the plot of land, an Athenian citizen whose name was (also) Academus; while yet another account is that it was named after a member of the army of Castor and Pollux, an Arcadian named Echedemus. The Academy operated until it was destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 84 BC. Many intellectuals were schooled in the Academy, the most prominent one being Aristotle.\n\nThroughout his later life, Plato became entangled with the politics of the city of Syracuse. According to Diogenes Laertius, Plato initially visited Syracuse while it was under the rule of Dionysius. During this first trip Dionysius's brother-in-law, Dion of Syracuse, became one of Plato's disciples, but the tyrant himself turned against Plato. Plato almost faced death, but he was sold into slavery. Then Anniceris bought Plato's freedom for twenty minas, and sent him home. After Dionysius's death, according to Plato's \"Seventh Letter\", Dion requested Plato return to Syracuse to tutor Dionysius II and guide him to become a philosopher king. Dionysius II seemed to accept Plato's teachings, but he became suspicious of Dion, his uncle. Dionysius expelled Dion and kept Plato against his will. Eventually Plato left Syracuse. Dion would return to overthrow Dionysius and ruled Syracuse for a short time before being usurped by Calippus, a fellow disciple of Plato.\n\nA variety of sources have given accounts of Plato's death. One story, based on a mutilated manuscript, suggests Plato died in his bed, whilst a young Thracian girl played the flute to him. Another tradition suggests Plato died at a wedding feast. The account is based on Diogenes Laertius's reference to an account by Hermippus, a third-century Alexandrian. According to Tertullian, Plato simply died in his sleep.\n\nAlthough Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \"for substantial theses in science and morals\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism.\n\nPythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. These ideas were very influential on Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato. Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\" (\"Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia\").\n\nGeorge Karamanolis notes thatNumenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy—including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally.\n\nThese two philosophers, following the way initiated by pre-Socratic Greek philosophers like Pythagoras, depart from mythology and begin the metaphysical tradition that strongly influenced Plato and continues today.\n\nThe surviving fragments written by Heraclitus suggest the view that all things are continuously changing, or becoming. His image of the river, with ever-changing waters, is well known. According to some ancient traditions like that of Diogenes Laërtius, Plato received these ideas through Heraclitus' disciple Cratylus, who held the more radical view that continuous change warrants skepticism because we cannot define a thing that does not have a permanent nature.\n\nParmenides adopted an altogether contrary vision, arguing for the idea of changeless Being and the view that change is an illusion. John Palmer notes \"Parmenides’ distinction among the principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that must belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as the founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct from theology.\"\n\nThese ideas about change and permanence, or becoming and Being, influenced Plato in formulating his \"theory of forms\". According to this theory, there is a world of perfect, eternal, and changeless \"forms\", the realm of Being, and an imperfect sensible world of becoming that partakes of the qualities of the forms, and is its instantiation in the sensible world.\n\nThe precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his \"Apology of Socrates\" that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d–34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the \"Phaedo\", the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \"Plato was ill\". (\"Phaedo\" 59b)\n\nPlato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the \"Second Letter\", it says, \"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form.\n\nAristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (\"Metaphysics\" 987b1–11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding.\n\n\"Mythos\" and \"logos\" are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of \"tale or history\". Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a \"nonverifiable account\", and logos a \"rational account\". Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use.\n\nPlato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently, then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths.\n\nPlato often discusses the father-son relationship and the question of whether a father's interest in his sons has much to do with how well his sons turn out. In ancient Athens, a boy was socially located by his family identity, and Plato often refers to his characters in terms of their paternal and fraternal relationships. Socrates was not a family man, and saw himself as the son of his mother, who was apparently a midwife. A divine fatalist, Socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees on tutors and trainers for their sons, and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character is a gift from the gods. Plato's dialogue Crito reminds Socrates that orphans are at the mercy of chance, but Socrates is unconcerned. In the \"Theaetetus\", he is found recruiting as a disciple a young man whose inheritance has been squandered. Socrates twice compares the relationship of the older man and his boy lover to the father-son relationship (\"Lysis\" 213a, \"Republic\" 3.403b), and in the \"Phaedo\", Socrates' disciples, towards whom he displays more concern than his biological sons, say they will feel \"fatherless\" when he is gone.\n\nIn several of Plato's dialogues, Socrates promulgates the idea that knowledge is a matter of recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study. He maintains this view somewhat at his own expense, because in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness. Socrates is often found arguing that knowledge is not empirical, and that it comes from divine insight. In many middle period dialogues, such as the \"Phaedo\", \"Republic\" and \"Phaedrus\" Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the afterlife. More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, perception and reality, nature and custom, and body and soul.\n\nSeveral dialogues tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the \"Phaedrus \"(265a–c), and yet in the \"\"Republic\"\" wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well. In \"Ion\", Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the \"Republic\". The dialogue \"Ion\" suggests that Homer's \"Iliad\" functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.\n\nSocrates and his company of disputants had something to say on many subjects, including politics and art, religion and science, justice and medicine, virtue and vice, crime and punishment, pleasure and pain, rhetoric and rhapsody, human nature and sexuality, as well as love and wisdom.\n\n\"Platonism\" is a term coined by scholars to refer to the intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the \"Republic\", Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the \"Theaetetus\", he says such people are \"eu amousoi\" (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, \"happily without the muses\" (\"Theaetetus\" 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to higher insights about reality.\n\nSocrates' idea that reality is unavailable to those who use their senses is what puts him at odds with the common man, and with common sense. Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his Allegory of the Cave, and more explicitly in his description of the divided line. The Allegory of the Cave (begins \"Republic\" 7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible (\"noeton\") and that the visible world (\"(h)oraton\") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.\n\nSocrates says in the \"Republic\" that people who take the sun-lit world of the senses to be good and real are living pitifully in a den of evil and ignorance. Socrates admits that few climb out of the den, or cave of ignorance, and those who do, not only have a terrible struggle to attain the heights, but when they go back down for a visit or to help other people up, they find themselves objects of scorn and ridicule.\n\nAccording to Socrates, physical objects and physical events are \"shadows\" of their ideal or perfect forms, and exist only to the extent that they instantiate the perfect versions of themselves. Just as shadows are temporary, inconsequential epiphenomena produced by physical objects, physical objects are themselves fleeting phenomena caused by more substantial causes, the ideals of which they are mere instances. For example, Socrates thinks that perfect justice exists (although it is not clear where) and his own trial would be a cheap copy of it.\n\nThe Allegory of the Cave (often said by scholars to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that only people who have climbed out of the cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the \"philosopher-king\", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the \"Republic\", that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.\n\nThe theory of Forms (or theory of Ideas) typically refers to the belief that the material world as it seems to us is not the real world, but only an \"image\" or \"copy\" of the real world. In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating a solution to the problem of universals. The forms, according to Socrates, are archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason (). (That is, they are universals.) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent.\n\nMany have interpreted Plato as stating—even having been the first to write—that knowledge is justified true belief, an influential view that informed future developments in epistemology. This interpretation is partly based on a reading of the \"Theaetetus\" wherein Plato argues that knowledge is distinguished from mere true belief by the knower having an \"account\" of the object of her or his true belief (). And this theory may again be seen in the \"Meno\", where it is suggested that true belief can be raised to the level of knowledge if it is bound with an account as to the question of \"why\" the object of the true belief is so (). Many years later, Edmund Gettier famously demonstrated the problems of the justified true belief account of knowledge. That the modern theory of justified true belief as knowledge which Gettier addresses is equivalent to Plato's is accepted by some scholars but rejected by others. Plato himself also identified problems with the \"justified true belief\" definition in the \"Theaetetus\", concluding that justification (or an \"account\") would require knowledge of \"differentness\", meaning that the definition of knowledge is circular ().\n\nLater in the \"Meno\", Socrates uses a geometrical example to expound Plato's view that knowledge in this latter sense is acquired by recollection. Socrates elicits a fact concerning a geometrical construction from a slave boy, who could not have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy's lack of education). The knowledge must be present, Socrates concludes, in an eternal, non-experiential form.\n\nIn other dialogues, the \"Sophist\", \"Statesman\", \"Republic\", and the \"Parmenides\", Plato himself associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships to one another (which he calls \"expertise\" in Dialectic), including through the processes of \"collection\" and \"division\". More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the \"Timaeus\" that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. And opinions are characterized by a lack of necessity and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the \"Theaetetus\" and \"Meno\". Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be at the base of the \"account\" required for justification, in that it offers foundational knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an infinite regression.\n\nSome of Plato's most famous doctrines are contained in the \"Republic\" as well as in the \"Laws\" and the \"Statesman\". Because these doctrines are not spoken directly by Plato and vary between dialogues, they cannot be straightforwardly assumed as representing Plato's own views.\n\nSocrates asserts that societies have a tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason structure of the individual soul. The appetite/spirit/reason are analogous to the castes of society.\n\n\nIn the Timaeus, Socrates locates the parts of the soul within the human body: Reason is located in the head, spirit in the top third of the torso, and the appetite in the middle third of the torso, down to the navel.\n\nAccording to this model, the principles of Athenian democracy (as it existed in his day) are rejected as only a few are fit to rule. Instead of rhetoric and persuasion, Socrates says reason and wisdom should govern. As Socrates puts it:\n\nSocrates describes these \"philosopher kings\" as \"those who love the sight of truth\" (\"Republic\" 475c) and supports the idea with the analogy of a captain and his ship or a doctor and his medicine. According to him, sailing and health are not things that everyone is qualified to practice by nature. A large part of the \"Republic\" then addresses how the educational system should be set up to produce these philosopher kings.\n\nIn addition, the ideal city is used as an image to illuminate the state of one's soul, or the will, reason, and desires combined in the human body. Socrates is attempting to make an image of a rightly ordered human, and then later goes on to describe the different kinds of humans that can be observed, from tyrants to lovers of money in various kinds of cities. The ideal city is not promoted, but only used to magnify the different kinds of individual humans and the state of their soul. However, the philosopher king image was used by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs. The philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united in virtuous harmony. A philosopher has the moderate love for wisdom and the courage to act according to wisdom. Wisdom is knowledge about the Good or the right relations between all that exists.\n\nWherein it concerns states and rulers, Socrates asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He argues that it is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the \"Republic\" as Socrates describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Socrates suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Socrates' description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.\n\nAccording to Socrates, a state made up of different kinds of souls will, overall, decline from an aristocracy (rule by the best) to a timocracy (rule by the honorable), then to an oligarchy (rule by the few), then to a democracy (rule by the people), and finally to tyranny (rule by one person, rule by a tyrant). Aristocracy in the sense of government (politeia) is advocated in Plato's Republic. This regime is ruled by a philosopher king, and thus is grounded on wisdom and reason.\n\nThe aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of the \"Republic\", as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Socrates states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character. Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control. In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes. Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.\n\nFor a long time, Plato's unwritten doctrine had been controversial. Many modern books on Plato seem to diminish its importance; nevertheless, the first important witness who mentions its existence is Aristotle, who in his \"Physics\" (209 b) writes: \"It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there [i.e. in \"Timaeus\"] of the participant is different from what he says in his so-called \"unwritten teachings\" ().\" The term \"\" literally means \"unwritten doctrines\" and it stands for the most fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept secret from the public. The importance of the unwritten doctrines does not seem to have been seriously questioned before the 19th century.\n\nA reason for not revealing it to everyone is partially discussed in \"Phaedrus\" (276 c) where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favoring instead the spoken logos: \"he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually.\" The same argument is repeated in Plato's \"Seventh Letter\" (344 c): \"every serious man in dealing with really serious subjects carefully avoids writing.\" In the same letter he writes (341 c): \"I can certainly declare concerning all these writers who claim to know the subjects that I seriously study ... there does not exist, nor will there ever exist, any treatise of mine dealing therewith.\" Such secrecy is necessary in order not \"to expose them to unseemly and degrading treatment\" (344 d).\n\nIt is, however, said that Plato once disclosed this knowledge to the public in his lecture \"On the Good\" (), in which the Good () is identified with the One (the Unity, ), the fundamental ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses. Aristoxenus describes the event in the following words: \"Each came expecting to learn something about the things that are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is One seemed to them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it.\" Simplicius quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias, who states that \"according to Plato, the first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and Indefinite Duality (), which he called Large and Small ()\", and Simplicius reports as well that \"one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good\".\n\nTheir account is in full agreement with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine. In \"Metaphysics\" he writes: \"Now since the Forms are the causes of everything else, he [i.e. Plato] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly the material principle is the Great and Small [i.e. the Dyad], and the essence is the One (), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One\" (987 b). \"From this account it is clear that he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms—that it is this the duality (the Dyad, ), the Great and Small (). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil\" (988 a).\n\nThe most important aspect of this interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is the continuity between his teaching and the neoplatonic interpretation of Plotinus or Ficino which has been considered erroneous by many but may in fact have been directly influenced by oral transmission of Plato's doctrine. A modern scholar who recognized the importance of the unwritten doctrine of Plato was Heinrich Gomperz who described it in his speech during the 7th International Congress of Philosophy in 1930. All the sources related to the have been collected by Konrad Gaiser and published as \"Testimonia Platonica\". These sources have subsequently been interpreted by scholars from the German \"Tübingen School of interpretation\" such as Hans Joachim Krämer or Thomas A. Szlezák.\n\nThe role of dialectic in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition. Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is \"the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position.\" A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are borrowed from Hegel. According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach \"the end of history.\" Karl Popper, on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for \"visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\"\n\nThirty-five dialogues and thirteen letters (the \"Epistles\") have traditionally been ascribed to Plato, though modern scholarship doubts the authenticity of at least some of these. Plato's writings have been published in several fashions; this has led to several conventions regarding the naming and referencing of Plato's texts.\n\nThe usual system for making unique references to sections of the text by Plato derives from a 16th-century edition of Plato's works by Henricus Stephanus. An overview of Plato's writings according to this system can be found in the Stephanus pagination article.\nOne tradition regarding the arrangement of Plato's texts is according to tetralogies. This scheme is ascribed by Diogenes Laertius to an ancient scholar and court astrologer to Tiberius named Thrasyllus.\n\nThe works are usually grouped into \"Early\" (sometimes by some into \"Transitional\"), \"Middle\", and \"Late\" period. This choice to group chronologically is thought worthy of criticism by some (Cooper \"et al\"), given that it is recognised that there is no absolute agreement as to the true chronologicity, since the facts of the temporal order of writing are not confidently ascertained.\n\nEarly: \"Apology (of Socrates)\", \"Charmides\", \"Crito\", \"Euthyphro\", \"Gorgias\", \"(Lesser) Hippias (minor)\", \"(Greater) Hippias (major)\", \"Ion\", \"Laches\", \"Lysis\", \"Protagoras\"\n\nMiddle/Transitional: \"Cratylus\", \"Euthydemus\", \"Meno\", \"Parmenides\", \"Phaedo\", \"Phaedrus\", \"Republic\", \"Symposium\",\n\nMiddle/Late: \"Theaetetus\"\n\nLate: \"Critias\", \"Sophist\", \"Statesman / Politicus\", \"Timaeus\", \"Philebus\", \"Laws\"\n\nChronologicity was not a consideration in ancient times, in that grouping of this nature are \"virtually absent\" (Tarrant) in the extant writings of ancient Platonists.\n\nJowett mentions in his Appendix to Menexenus, that works which bore the character of a writer were attributed to that writer even when the actual author was unknown.\n\nFor below:\n\n(*) if there is no consensus among scholars as to whether Plato is the author, and (‡) if most scholars agree that Plato is \"not\" the author of the work.\n\n\"First Alcibiades\" (*), \"Second Alcibiades\" (‡), \"Clitophon\" (*), \"Epinomis\" (‡), \"Epistles\" (*), \"Hipparchus\" (‡), \"Menexenus\" (*), \"Minos\" (‡), \"(Rival) Lovers\" (‡), \"Theages\" (‡)\n\nThe following works were transmitted under Plato's name, most of them already considered spurious in antiquity, and so were not included by Thrasyllus in his tetralogical arrangement. These works are labelled as \"Notheuomenoi\" (\"spurious\") or \"Apocrypha\".\n\nNo one knows the exact order Plato's dialogues were written in, nor the extent to which some might have been later revised and rewritten. A significant distinction of the early Plato and the later Plato has been offered by scholars such as E.R. Dodds and has been summarized by Harold Bloom in his book titled \"Agon\": \"E.R. Dodds is the classical scholar whose writings most illuminated the Hellenic descent (in) \"The Greeks and the Irrational\" ... In his chapter on Plato and the Irrational Soul ... Dodds traces Plato's spiritual evolution from the pure rationalist of the \"Protagoras\" to the transcendental psychologist, influenced by the Pythagoreans and Orphics, of the later works culminating in the \"Laws\".\"\n\nLewis Campbell was the first to make exhaustive use of stylometry to prove objectively that the \"Critias\", \"Timaeus\", \"Laws\", \"Philebus\", \"Sophist\", and \"Statesman\" were all clustered together as a group, while the \"Parmenides\", \"Phaedrus\", \"Republic\", and \"Theaetetus\" belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given Aristotle's statement in his \"Politics\" that the \"Laws\" was written after the \"Republic\"; cf. Diogenes Laertius \"Lives\" 3.37). What is remarkable about Campbell's conclusions is that, in spite of all the stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be \"proven\" by stylometry is the fact that \"Critias\", \"Timaeus\", \"Laws\", \"Philebus\", \"Sophist\", and \"Statesman\" are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier.\n\nIncreasingly in the most recent Plato scholarship, writers are skeptical of the notion that the order of Plato's writings can be established with any precision, though Plato's works are still often characterized as falling at least roughly into three groups. The following represents one relatively common such division. It should, however, be kept in mind that many of the positions in the ordering are still highly disputed, and also that the very notion that Plato's dialogues can or should be \"ordered\" is by no means universally accepted.\n\nAmong those who classify the dialogues into periods of composition, Socrates figures in all of the \"early dialogues\" and they are considered the most faithful representations of the historical Socrates. They include \"The Apology of Socrates\", \"Charmides\", \"Crito\", \"Euthyphro\", \"Ion\", \"Laches\", \"Lesser Hippias\", \"Lysis\", \"Menexenus\", and \"Protagoras\" (often considered one of the last of the \"early dialogues\"). Three dialogues are often considered \"transitional\" or \"pre-middle\": \"Euthydemus\", \"Gorgias\", and \"Meno\".\n\nWhereas those classified as \"early dialogues\" often conclude in aporia, the so-called \"middle dialogues\" provide more clearly stated positive teachings that are often ascribed to Plato such as the theory of Forms. These dialogues include \"Cratylus\", \"Phaedo\", \"Phaedrus\", \"Republic\", \"Symposium\", \"Parmenides\", and \"Theaetetus\". Proponents of dividing the dialogues into periods often consider the \"Parmenides\" and \"Theaetetus\" to come late in this period and be transitional to the next, as they seem to treat the theory of Forms critically (\"Parmenides\") or only indirectly (\"Theaetetus\"). Ritter's stylometric analysis places \"Phaedrus\" as probably after \"Theaetetus\" and \"Parmenides\", although it does not relate to the theory of Forms in the same way. The first book of the \"Republic\" is often thought to have been written significantly earlier than the rest of the work, although possibly having undergone revisions when the later books were attached to it.\n\nThe remaining dialogues are classified as \"late\" and are generally agreed to be difficult and challenging pieces of philosophy. This grouping is the only one proven by stylometric analysis. While looked to for Plato's \"mature\" answers to the questions posed by his earlier works, those answers are difficult to discern. Some scholars indicate that the theory of Forms is absent from the late dialogues, its having been refuted in the \"Parmenides\", but there isn't total consensus that the \"Parmenides\" actually refutes the theory of Forms. The so-called \"late dialogues\" include \"Critias\", \"Laws\", \"Philebus\", \"Sophist\", \"Statesman\", and \"Timaeus\".\n\nPlato never presents himself as a participant in any of the dialogues, and with the exception of the \"Apology\", there is no suggestion that he heard any of the dialogues firsthand. Some dialogues have no narrator but have a pure \"dramatic\" form (examples: \"Meno\", \"Gorgias\", \"Phaedrus\", \"Crito\", \"Euthyphro\"), some dialogues are narrated by Socrates, wherein he speaks in first person (examples: \"Lysis\", \"Charmides\", \"Republic\"). One dialogue, \"Protagoras\", begins in dramatic form but quickly proceeds to Socrates' narration of a conversation he had previously with the sophist for whom the dialogue is named; this narration continues uninterrupted till the dialogue's end.\n\nTwo dialogues \"Phaedo\" and \"Symposium\" also begin in dramatic form but then proceed to virtually uninterrupted narration by followers of Socrates. \"Phaedo\", an account of Socrates' final conversation and hemlock drinking, is narrated by Phaedo to Echecrates in a foreign city not long after the execution took place. The \"Symposium\" is narrated by Apollodorus, a Socratic disciple, apparently to Glaucon. Apollodorus assures his listener that he is recounting the story, which took place when he himself was an infant, not from his own memory, but as remembered by Aristodemus, who told him the story years ago.\n\nThe \"Theaetetus\" is a peculiar case: a dialogue in dramatic form embedded within another dialogue in dramatic form. In the beginning of the \"Theaetetus\" (142c–143b), Euclides says that he compiled the conversation from notes he took based on what Socrates told him of his conversation with the title character. The rest of the \"Theaetetus\" is presented as a \"book\" written in dramatic form and read by one of Euclides' slaves (143c). Some scholars take this as an indication that Plato had by this date wearied of the narrated form. With the exception of the \"Theaetetus\", Plato gives no explicit indication as to how these orally transmitted conversations came to be written down.\n\nThe trial of Socrates is the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, \"Apology\" is among the most frequently read of his works. In the \"Apology\", Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a sophist and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the Oracle at Delphi. He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow man, and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens.\n\nIf Plato's important dialogues do not refer to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that play a part in it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the \"Theaetetus\" (210d) and the \"Euthyphro\" (2a–b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. In the \"Meno\" (94e–95a), one of the men who brings legal charges against Socrates, Anytus, warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the \"Gorgias\", Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a). In the \"Republic\" (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The \"Apology\" is Socrates' defense speech, and the \"Crito\" and \"Phaedo\" take place in prison after the conviction. In the \"Protagoras\", Socrates is a guest at the home of Callias, son of Hipponicus, a man whom Socrates disparages in the \"Apology\" as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.\n\nTwo other important dialogues, the \"Symposium\" and the \"Phaedrus\", are linked to the main storyline by characters. In the \"Apology\" (19b, c), Socrates says Aristophanes slandered him in a comic play, and blames him for causing his bad reputation, and ultimately, his death. In the \"Symposium\", the two of them are drinking together with other friends. The character Phaedrus is linked to the main story line by character (Phaedrus is also a participant in the \"Symposium\" and the \"Protagoras\") and by theme (the philosopher as divine emissary, etc.) The \"Protagoras\" is also strongly linked to the \"Symposium\" by characters: all of the formal speakers at the \"Symposium\" (with the exception of Aristophanes) are present at the home of Callias in that dialogue. Charmides and his guardian Critias are present for the discussion in the \"Protagoras\". Examples of characters crossing between dialogues can be further multiplied. The \"Protagoras\" contains the largest gathering of Socratic associates.\n\nIn the dialogues Plato is most celebrated and admired for, Socrates is concerned with human and political virtue, has a distinctive personality, and friends and enemies who \"travel\" with him from dialogue to dialogue. This is not to say that Socrates is consistent: a man who is his friend in one dialogue may be an adversary or subject of his mockery in another. For example, Socrates praises the wisdom of Euthyphro many times in the \"Cratylus\", but makes him look like a fool in the \"Euthyphro\". He disparages sophists generally, and Prodicus specifically in the \"Apology\", whom he also slyly jabs in the \"Cratylus\" for charging the hefty fee of fifty drachmas for a course on language and grammar. However, Socrates tells Theaetetus in his namesake dialogue that he admires Prodicus and has directed many pupils to him. Socrates' ideas are also not consistent within or between or among dialogues.\n\nAlthough their popularity has fluctuated over the years, the works of Plato have never been without readers since the time they were written. Plato's thought is often compared with that of his most famous student, Aristotle, whose reputation during the Western Middle Ages so completely eclipsed that of Plato that the Scholastic philosophers referred to Aristotle as \"the Philosopher\". However, in the Byzantine Empire, the study of Plato continued.\n\nThe only Platonic work known to western scholarship was Timaeus, until translations were made at a time post the fall of Constantinople, which occurred during 1453, George Gemistos Plethon brought Plato's original writings from Constantinople in the century of its fall. It is believed that Plethon passed a copy of the Dialogues to Cosimo de' Medici when in 1438 the Council of Ferrara, called to unify the Greek and Latin Churches, was adjourned to Florence, where Plethon then lectured on the relation and differences of Plato and Aristotle, and fired Cosimo with his enthusiasm; Cosimo would supply Marsilio Ficino with Plato's text for translation to Latin. During the early Islamic era, Persian and Arab scholars translated much of Plato into Arabic and wrote commentaries and interpretations on Plato's, Aristotle's and other Platonist philosophers' works (see Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Hunayn ibn Ishaq). Many of these comments on Plato were translated from Arabic into Latin and as such influenced Medieval scholastic philosophers.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, with the general resurgence of interest in classical civilization, knowledge of Plato's philosophy would become widespread again in the West. Many of the greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with Scholasticism and fostered the flowering of the Renaissance, with the support of the Plato-inspired Lorenzo (grandson of Cosimo), saw Plato's philosophy as the basis for progress in the arts and sciences. His political views, too, were well-received: the vision of wise philosopher-kings of the \"Republic\" matched the views set out in works such as Machiavelli's \"The Prince\". More problematic was Plato's belief in metempsychosis, transmigration of the soul, as well as his ethical views (on polyamory and euthanasia in particular), which did not match those of Christianity. It was Plethon's student Bessarion who reconciled Plato with Christian theology, arguing that Plato's views were only ideals, unattainable due to the fall of man.\n\nBy the 19th century, Plato's reputation was restored, and at least on par with Aristotle's. Notable Western philosophers have continued to draw upon Plato's work since that time. Plato's influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to distinguish between pure and applied mathematics by widening the gap between \"arithmetic\", now called number theory and \"logistic\", now called arithmetic. He regarded \"logistic\" as appropriate for business men and men of war who \"must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops,\" while \"arithmetic\" was appropriate for philosophers \"because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being.\" Plato's resurgence further inspired some of the greatest advances in logic since Aristotle, primarily through Gottlob Frege and his followers Kurt Gödel, Alonzo Church, and Alfred Tarski. Albert Einstein suggested that the scientist who takes philosophy seriously would have to avoid systematization and take on many different roles, and possibly appear as a Platonist or Pythagorean, in that such a one would have \"the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.\"\n\nMany recent philosophers have diverged from what some would describe as the ontological models and moral ideals characteristic of traditional Platonism. A number of these postmodern philosophers have thus appeared to disparage Platonism from more or less informed perspectives. Friedrich Nietzsche notoriously attacked Plato's \"idea of the good itself\" along with many fundamentals of Christian morality, which he interpreted as \"Platonism for the masses\" in one of his most important works, \"Beyond Good and Evil \"(1886). Martin Heidegger argued against Plato's alleged obfuscation of \"Being \"in his incomplete tome, \"Being and Time\" (1927), and the philosopher of science Karl Popper argued in \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" (1945) that Plato's alleged proposal for a utopian political regime in the \"Republic\" was prototypically totalitarian. The political philosopher and professor Leo Strauss is considered by some as the prime thinker involved in the recovery of Platonic thought in its more political, and less metaphysical, form. Strauss' political approach was in part inspired by the appropriation of Plato and Aristotle by medieval Jewish and Islamic political philosophers, especially Maimonides and Al-Farabi, as opposed to the Christian metaphysical tradition that developed from Neoplatonism. Deeply influenced by Nietzsche and Heidegger, Strauss nonetheless rejects their condemnation of Plato and looks to the dialogues for a solution to what all three latter day thinkers acknowledge as 'the crisis of the West.'\n\nSome 250 known manuscripts of Plato survive. The texts of Plato as received today apparently represent the complete written philosophical work of Plato and are generally good by the standards of textual criticism. No modern edition of Plato in the original Greek represents a single source, but rather it is reconstructed from multiple sources which are compared with each other. These sources are medieval manuscripts written on vellum (mainly from 9th to 13th century AD Byzantium), papyri (mainly from late antiquity in Egypt), and from the independent \"testimonia\" of other authors who quote various segments of the works (which come from a variety of sources). The text as presented is usually not much different from what appears in the Byzantine manuscripts, and papyri and testimonia just confirm the manuscript tradition. In some editions however the readings in the papyri or testimonia are favoured in some places by the editing critic of the text. Reviewing editions of papyri for the \"Republic\" in 1987, Slings suggests that the use of papyri is hampered due to some poor editing practices.\n\nIn the first century AD, Thrasyllus of Mendes had compiled and published the works of Plato in the original Greek, both genuine and spurious. While it has not survived to the present day, all the extant medieval Greek manuscripts are based on his edition.\n\nThe oldest surviving complete manuscript for many of the dialogues is the Clarke Plato (Codex Oxoniensis Clarkianus 39, or Codex Boleianus MS E.D. Clarke 39), which was written in Constantinople in 895 and acquired by Oxford University in 1809. The Clarke is given the siglum \"B\" in modern editions. \"B\" contains the first six tetralogies and is described internally as being written by \"John the Calligrapher\" on behalf of Arethas of Caesarea. It appears to have undergone corrections by Arethas himself. For the last two tetralogies and the apocrypha, the oldest surviving complete manuscript is Codex Parisinus graecus 1807, designated \"A\", which was written nearly contemporaneously to \"B\", circa 900 AD. \"A\" must be a copy of the edition edited by the patriarch, Photios, teacher of Arethas.\"A\" probably had an initial volume containing the first 7 tetralogies which is now lost, but of which a copy was made, Codex Venetus append. class. 4, 1, which has the siglum \"T\". The oldest manuscript for the seventh tetralogy is Codex Vindobonensis 54. suppl. phil. Gr. 7, with siglum \"W\", with a supposed date in the twelfth century. In total there are fifty-one such Byzantine manuscripts known, while others may yet be found.\n\nTo help establish the text, the older evidence of papyri and the independent evidence of the testimony of commentators and other authors (i.e., those who quote and refer to an old text of Plato which is no longer extant) are also used. Many papyri which contain fragments of Plato's texts are among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The 2003 Oxford Classical Texts edition by Slings even cites the Coptic translation of a fragment of the \"Republic\" in the Nag Hammadi library as evidence. Important authors for testimony include Olympiodorus the Younger, Plutarch, Proclus, Iamblichus, Eusebius, and Stobaeus.\n\nDuring the early Renaissance, the Greek language and, along with it, Plato's texts were reintroduced to Western Europe by Byzantine scholars. In September or October 1484 Filippo Valori and Francesco Berlinghieri printed 1025 copies of Ficino's translation, using the printing press at the Dominican convent S.Jacopo di Ripoli. Cosimo had been influenced toward studying Plato by the many Byzantine Platonists in Florence during his day, including George Gemistus Plethon.\n\nThe 1578 edition of Plato's complete works published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva also included parallel Latin translation and running commentary by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres). It was this edition which established standard Stephanus pagination, still in use today.\n\nThe Oxford Classical Texts offers the current standard complete Greek text of Plato's complete works. In five volumes edited by John Burnet, its first edition was published 1900-1907, and it is still available from the publisher, having last been printed in 1993. The second edition is still in progress with only the first volume, printed in 1995, and the \"Republic\", printed in 2003, available. The \"Cambridge Greek and Latin Texts\" and \"Cambridge Classical Texts and Commentaries\" series includes Greek editions of the \"Protagoras\", \"Symposium\", \"Phaedrus\", \"Alcibiades\", and \"Clitophon\", with English philological, literary, and, to an extent, philosophical commentary. One distinguished edition of the Greek text is E. R. Dodds' of the \"Gorgias\", which includes extensive English commentary.\n\nThe modern standard complete English edition is the 1997 Hackett \"Plato, Complete Works\", edited by John M. Cooper. For many of these translations Hackett offers separate volumes which include more by way of commentary, notes, and introductory material. There is also the \"Clarendon Plato Series\" by Oxford University Press which offers English translations and thorough philosophical commentary by leading scholars on a few of Plato's works, including John McDowell's version of the \"Theaetetus\". Cornell University Press has also begun the \"Agora\" series of English translations of classical and medieval philosophical texts, including a few of Plato's.\n\nPlato's Academy mosaic was created in the villa of T. Siminius Stephanus in Pompeii, around 100 BC to 100 CE. \"The School of Athens\" fresco by Raphael features Plato also as a central figure.\n\nFootnotes\n\na. Plato is a nickname from the adjective \"platýs\" \"broad\". Diogenes Laertius mentions three possible meanings of the nickname:\nSeneca mentions the meaning of Plato's name in connection to a moral lesson:\n\nb. The grammarian Apollodorus of Athens argues in his \"Chronicles\" that Plato was born in the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month Thargelion; according to this tradition the god Apollo was born this day. According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death. If we accept Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than Isocrates by six years, and therefore he was born in the second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC). According to the \"Suda,\" Plato was born in Aegina in the 88th Olympiad amid the preliminaries of the Peloponnesian war, and he lived 82 years. Sir Thomas Browne also believes that Plato was born in the 88th Olympiad. Renaissance Platonists celebrated Plato's birth on November 7. Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff estimates that Plato was born when Diotimos was archon eponymous, namely between July 29, 428 BC and July 24, 427 BC. Greek philologist Ioannis Kalitsounakis believes that the philosopher was born on May 26 or 27, 427 BC, while Jonathan Barnes regards 428 BC as year of Plato's birth. For her part, Debra Nails asserts that the philosopher was born in 424/423 BC. According to Seneca Plato died at the age of 81 on the same day he was born.\n\nc. Diogenes Laertius mentions that Plato \"was born, according to some writers, in Aegina in the house of Phidiades the son of Thales\". Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the \"Universal History\" of Favorinus. According to Favorinus, Ariston, Plato's family, and his family were sent by Athens to settle as cleruchs (colonists retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there. Nails points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of Athenians from Aegina between 431–411 BC. On the other hand, at the Peace of Nicias, Aegina was silently left under Athens' control, and it was not until the summer of 411 that the Spartans overran the island. Therefore, Nails concludes that \"perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, but none of this enables a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's birth). Aegina is regarded as Plato's place of birth by Suda as well.\n\nd. Some Wikipedia editors use the term \"allegory\" instead of myth. This is in accordance with the practice in the specialized literature, in which it is common to find that the terms allegory and myth are used as synonyms. Nevertheless, there is a trend among modern scholars to use the term \"myth\" and avoid the term allegory, as it is considered more appropriate to modern interpretation of Plato's writings. One of the first to initiate this trend was the Oxford University professor John Alexander Stewart, in his work \"The Myths of Plato\".\nCitations\nPrimary sources (Greek and Roman)\n\nSecondary sources\n\n"}

It is set in the Caribbean during the 16th and 17th centuries. Created by Kalypso Media which founded Gaming Minds Studios in 2009 after Ascaron Entertainment went bankrupt, it combines a business simulator with real-time battles and towns that can be owned, built, developed or razed. This is the 1st installment of the Port Royale Series done by Gaming Minds Studios.\n\nThe first preview of \"Port Royale 3\" took place during the Gamescom trade fair which was held from 17 to 21 August 2011 in Cologne, Germany.\n\nThe protagonist is a young Spanish commoner who left Spain to explore the New World. An accident at sea casts him overboard, and he finds himself in the Caribbean city of Port Royale. His life changes forever when he meets Elena, the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy. He has two options to win her heart: The merchant \"Path of the Trader\" or the pirate \"Path of the Adventurer.\"\n\nPath of The Trader details the economic part of the game. Elena and her father grew up from the humble town of Cayman. Cayman had been overlooked by the major European powers and traders and struggled economically. The Trader decides to win her heart through developing the small colony into a bustling city, all while dealing with a superficial rival suitor who woos Elena with gaudy gifts instead of helping the town.\n\nPath of the Adventurer details the combat aspect of the game. Elena is captured by pirates hired by a young Frenchman who plans to marry her. The Adventurer ends up at war with the French in order to save Elena.\n\nPort Royale 3 is an open-ended game, so players can choose to pursue several careers. This could range from a business tycoon to a pirate. Initially, you must trade goods between Caribbean colonies to make money, but over the long term you can have substantial business interests in many Caribbean ports, and support large fighting fleets.\nAs a business tycoon, you trade with towns to gain their friendship, and can then buy building permits to establish businesses there. Ultimately, you can even come to have your own town, but this can take a very long time. As a buccaneer (with a Letter of Marque), you can attack any of the four colonial nations in the Caribbean circa 1600; from largest to smallest: Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands. If you have not acquired a Letter of Marque, each nation will see you as a pirate.\nShips range from a small Pinnace to a massive Ship of the Line. There are also missions you can complete for money, supplies, or improved relations. At higher levels you can also automate the game to some degree, by setting up trade routes that your trading fleets will follow from town to town.\nFickle politics impact the game. One year you might choose to be loyal to Spain and fight England - but a year later, might join the Dutch in their fight against the French.\nFamous pirates of the age also make appearances. These sea wolves are likely to attack any ship or town that they please, including those that belong to the player. They usually operate from heavily fortified bases, but if you defeat them, you'll gain favor with any nation you choose.\nInitially, you have operating constraints (how many fleets you may have and how many towns you can buy building permits in), but as you gain levels (based on net worth), you can have unlimited fleets and permits.\n\nMidlife Gamer gave the game 6/10, stating \"Action is not the order of the day here. Port Royale 3 is incredibly slow paced especially during the first few hours.\" and that \"The visuals in Port Royale are a mixed bag. The in game cut scenes look really nice; sadly the same cannot be said for the trading over world map. It’s nowhere near as pleasing to the eye as other parts of the game so much so to the point that it looks like you are playing a much older game.\"\n\nGamespot rated the title 5/10, noting that although it looked good and played smoothly, despite there being plenty to do in the game none of it was much fun.\n"}

{"id": "48993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48993", "title": "Quiz bowl", "text": "Quiz bowl\n\nQuiz Bowl (quizbowl, scholar bowl, scholastic bowl, academic bowl, academic team, etc.) is a quiz-based competition that tests players on a wide variety of academic subjects. Standardized quiz bowl formats are played by lower school, middle school, high school, and university students throughout the United States, Germany, Canada, Asia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe game is typically played with a lockout buzzer system between at least two teams, usually consisting of four or five players each. Players are read questions and try to score points for their team by buzzing first and responding with the correct answer.\n\nQuiz Bowl is most commonly played in a toss-up/bonus format, which consists of a series of two different types of questions. Other formats, particularly in local competitions, may deviate from the above rules.\n\nMost forms of modern quiz bowls are modeled after game shows. \"College Bowl\", which was created by Don Reid as a USO activity for US service men during World War II, was an influential early quiz bowl program. Also known as \"The College Quiz Bowl,\" it started on radio in 1953 and then aired on national television from 1959 to 1970.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, many other quiz bowl-like competitions were also created. Delco Hi-Q began in 1948 as a radio quiz competition sponsored by the Scott Paper Company for high school students in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It claims to be the oldest continuously running student quiz contest in the United States. The \"It's Academic\" televised student quiz show program has been run for high school teams in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area since 1961 and is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-running quiz program in television history. \"It's Academic\" has been spun off in many other US media markets and has inspired many other televised high school competitions.\n\nIn 1977, College Bowl was revived as an activity on college campuses by College Bowl Company Inc. (CBCI). In September 1990, the Academic Competition Federation (ACF) was founded as the first major alternative to The College Bowl Company. National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT) was founded in 1996 and currently organizes national competitions at all levels in the United States and supplies tournament questions for grade school and college teams across North America and other parts of the world. In 2008, the College Bowl program abruptly ended, although the company itself continues to operate the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge (HCASC) for historically black colleges and universities.\n\nDuring a quiz bowl game, two or more teams of usually up to four or five players are read questions by a moderator. In most forms of quiz bowl, there are two basic types of questions: toss-ups and bonuses. Toss-ups are questions that any individual player can attempt to answer, and players are generally not allowed to confer with each other. Each player usually has a signaling device, also called a buzzer, to signal in at any time during the question to give an answer. If the answer given is incorrect, then no other member of that team may give an answer. If a toss-up is successfully answered, the correctly answering team is given an opportunity to answer a bonus. Bonuses are usually worth a total of 30 points, and consist of three individual questions worth ten points each. Team members are generally permitted to confer with each other on these questions.\n\nRegional or local tournaments may dispose of any number of standard rules entirely. Some may only have toss-ups and not use bonuses at all. Some formats include a lightning round during which a team attempts to answer multiple questions as fast as possible under a given time limit, usually sixty seconds.\n\nMatch length is determined by either a game clock or the number of questions in a packet. In most formats, a game ends once the moderator has finished reading every question in a packet. Tie-breaking procedures may include reading extra toss-ups until the tie is broken or sudden-death toss-ups.\n\nQuiz bowl tests players in a variety of academic subjects including literature, science, history, and fine arts. Additionally, some quiz bowl events may feature small amounts of popular culture content like sports, popular music, and other non-academic general knowledge subjects, although their inclusion is generally kept to a minimum.\n\nIn most quiz bowl competitions, players and coaches may protest the moderator's decision if they believe their answer was incorrectly rejected, or an opponent's answer was incorrectly accepted.\n\nTwo common types of toss-ups include buzzer-beaters and pyramidal tossups. Buzzer-beaters (also known as speed check or quick-recall questions) are relatively short, rarely more than two sentences long, and contain few clues. This type of question is written specifically to test quick recall skills of players, and does not discriminate the different levels of knowledge that the players possess.\n\nPyramidal or pyramid-style tossups include multiple clues and are written so that each question starts with more difficult clues and moves toward easier clues. This way the player with the most knowledge of the subject being asked about has the most opportunity to answer first. Pyramidal toss-ups are considered standard for college quiz bowl.\n\nIn most formats, correctly answering a toss-up earns a team 10 points. Extra points, usually for a total of 15 or 20 points, may be awarded if a question is answered prior to a certain clue-providing keyword in the question, an action known as \"powering\". Answering a tossup incorrectly is called \"negging\", and may incur a 5-point penalty for a team. After a neg occurs, the moderator continues reading the rest of the question for the other team. There are usually no further penalties after one team has already negged.\n\nBonuses usually have multiple parts that are related by some common thread and may or may not be related to corresponding tossup. A team is usually rewarded with 10 points upon correctly answering each bonus part. Usually, only the team that answered the tossup correctly can answer the bonus questions, though some formats allow the opposing team to answer certain parts of the bonus not correctly answered by the team in control of the bonus, a gameplay element known as a \"bounceback\" or \"rebound\". Less-used types of bonus questions include list bonuses, which require players to give their answers from a requested list, and \"30-20-10\" bonuses, which give a number of discrete clues for a single answer in order of decreasing difficulty, with more points being awarded for giving the correct answer on an earlier clue. The 30-20-10 bonus was officially banned from ACF in 2008 and NAQT in 2009.\n\nSeveral variations on the game of quiz bowl exist that affect question structure and content, rules of play, and round format. One standardized format is the pyramidal tossup/bonus format, which is used in ACF (or mACF) and NAQT competitions. ACF/mACF tossups are written in pyramidal style and are generally much longer than College Bowl and NAQT questions. It has a rigorous emphasis on academics, with very little popular culture. Games are usually untimed and last until a total of 20 tossups are read. NAQT is another common variation on the tossup/bonus format that balances academic rigor with a wider variety of subjects, including popular culture and an increased amount of current events and geography content. Unlike many mACF events, most questions used in this format are written and sold by NAQT themselves. NAQT also uses powers in their tossups, which reward players with 15 points instead of 10 for a tossup answered before a predetermined point. Games played on NAQT rules consist of two nine-minute halves and a total of 24 tossups. NAQT tossups are typically shorter than most other pyramidal tossups because of a character limit enforced on the questions. The format used for the now-defunct College Bowl tournament uses comparatively shorter questions. Gameplay is relatively quick as it is played in eight-minute halves, to a usual total of 22–24 tossups read. The Honda Campus All Star Challenge and \"University Challenge\" use similar formats.\n\nMatches played at the National Academic Championship and its affiliated tournaments are split into four quarters, with differing styles of gameplay in each phase. Individual tournaments may use worksheet quizzes, lightning rounds, or tossups without accompanying bonuses.\n\nSince questions are generally derived from an unofficial canon of topics, players commonly review question content from older competitions to prepare for upcoming tournaments. Several websites exist in this vein, the most commonly used being Quinterest, a navigable database of past quiz bowl tournaments, and Protobowl, a multiplayer real-time quiz bowl simulator. NAQT also sells lists of topics that are frequently asked about in their questions. Players also research and write questions to prepare for quiz bowl. Active participation in academic coursework can also serve as means of preparing for quiz bowl. Blind memorization of high-frequency out-of-context facts, often referred to as \"stock\" clues, is a common method of quiz bowl preparation, but is generally discouraged for the lack of academic utility in doing so. Team members often specialize in a few subjects. Players benefit from exposure to a broad range of school and cultural subjects, memorization, and study skills, and an improved ability to cooperate and work in teams.\n\nQuiz bowl is primarily played at single-day tournaments. Some events have eligibility rules that dictate who may participate, such as allowing only freshman and sophomore players or excluding graduate students from playing. Additionally, most tournaments allow multiple teams from a single school to compete.\n\nSome schools hold intramural tournaments where any team formed from students can play. High school-level quiz bowl is occasionally played over an extended period of time schools within a league or preexisting athletic conference or even in single matches against other schools.\nSome regional variants organized for grade school students include Knowledge Bowl, Ohio Academic Competition (OAC), Florida's Commissioner's Academic Challenge (CAC), and various television quiz competitions such as \"It's Academic\". Athletic and activities associations in some US states also organize quiz bowl competitions, including Missouri's MSHSAA, Illinois's IHSA, and Virginia's VHSL.\nAdditionally, various formats have been developed to test knowledge in specific areas like the Bible, classics, science, and agricultural science. DECA runs quiz bowl events at their competitions that tests knowledge on business and market topics. Gallaudet University sponsors a National Academic Bowl for deaf university students. Tournaments designated as \"trash\" focus on pop culture and sports trivia questions.\n\nThere are several collegiate-level national championship tournaments for which teams usually qualify through regional competitions. These tournaments include:\n\nSeveral national competitions are conducted in the United States every year for high school students. Compared to at the college level, there are usually many more tournaments at which teams can qualify. These include:\n\nThe following high school tournaments are for single all-star teams from each US state or other political subdivision:\n\nSome proponents of reform seek to increase the educational value and fairness of quiz bowl, primarily by using pyramidal questions. Many competitions at grade school levels are criticized for their use of speed-check questions, which encourage participants to rely more on their ability to buzz in quickly than on knowledge of the subjects tested. Some tournaments such as College Bowl are criticized for being insufficiently academic, including superfluous clues in their questions, and for recycling questions from previous years. The use of \"hoses\", misleading clues that discourage players from buzzing in too early, is also considered a mark of \"bad\" quiz bowl. The use of mathematical computation problems in tossups is criticized by some for rewarding fast problem solving skills over conceptual knowledge and being non-pyramidal. Pyramidal questions are sometimes criticized for containing obscure information and being unsuitable for television.\n\nQuiz bowl shows have been on television for many years in some areas and usually feature competitors from local high schools. Many of these competitions may have rules and formats that differ slightly from standardized quiz bowl.\n\n\"College Bowl\" was broadcast on NBC radio from 1953 to 1955. The program moved to television as \"General Electric College Bowl\" and was broadcast from 1959 to 1970, first on CBS and later on NBC. \"College Bowl\" would return to CBS radio from 1979 to 1982, and HCASC was broadcast on BET from 1990 to 1995. The \"Texaco Star National Academic Championship\" ran from 1989 to 1991 on Discovery Channel and was hosted by Chip Beall and Mark L. Walberg. In 1994, it was syndicated as the \"Star Challenge\" and hosted by Mark L. Walberg. \"University Challenge\" is licensed from CBCI by Granada TV Ltd. and broadcast in the United Kingdom. Reach for the Top, a Canadian competition with a quiz bowl-like format, has been broadcast on the CBC in the past.\n\nQuiz bowl has received media coverage due to the number of highly successful game show contestants with backgrounds in the activity. Despite this, most game shows have little resemblance to quiz bowl in both question content and gameplay. NAQT maintains a list of current and former quiz bowl players at any level who have appeared on TV game shows. Several of the top dollar winners in the history of \"Jeopardy!\" include former players such as Ken Jennings,Matt Jackson, David Madden, and Brad Rutter.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, scientific discoveries are often presented in a mythological way with a theory being presented as a dramatic flash of insight by a heroic individual rather than as the result of sustained experiment and reasoning. For example, Newton's law of universal gravitation is commonly presented as the result of an apple falling upon his head. Newton's observation of an apple falling did indeed play a part in starting him thinking about the problem but it took him about twenty years to fully develop the theory and so the story of the apple has been described as a myth.\n\nThe extent to which this occurs and is problematic is debatable. Scientific historian Douglas Allchin suggests that mythical accounts are misleading because they present the results as handed down by authority figures and understate the importance of error and its resolution by the scientific method. In responding to this, Westerlund and Fairbanks agreed that romantic accounts of science tend to distort its nature but, in the case of Mendel's discovery of the rules of inheritance, they argue that Allchin's criticism of Mendel's role and reasoning is over-stated.\n\n\n"}

Junior high school education is compulsory in Taiwan. Children and youths aged 6 to 15 are required to receive nine years of compulsory education. By law, every pupil who completed his or her primary education must attend a junior high school for at least three years, with exemptions to homeschooling and severe disorder or disabilities. Legal guardians of offenders may be subjected to fines up to NT$300, where penalties may be repeatedly imposed until offenders return to school.\n\nThe history of secondary education in Taiwan dates back to the Japanese rule. In 1896, Taiwan's colonial government implemented the policy of Direct Schools System, which was the first modern schooling system with reference to the Western system in the history of education in Taiwan. Japan later made three revisions to the educational policy in Taiwan and made use of education to promote militarism and loyalty to the Empire of Japan.\n\nIn August 1945, the Pacific War ended and Taiwan was handed over to the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China. The current secondary education system in Taiwan was formed in 1968, in which the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China implemented nine years of compulsory education to enhance the level of knowledge of Taiwanese.\n\nUpon completion of studies in a junior high school, students may opt to pursue further studies or enter workforce. For those pursuing further studies, 2014 graduates could take the Comprehensive Assessment Program (國中教育會考) or the Special Entrance Examination (特色招生考試).\n\nSeveral educational reforms were vastly promoted, which included the extension and normalization of education and independent learning. The calls for extension of years of education started in 1983, and came to a consensus in 2003. It was announced in 2011 that the Twelve Years of Basic Education (十二年國民基本教育) will be implemented three years later, where education in Taiwan will be extended from nine years to twelve years, while the current promotion system to a senior high school will be abolished. This causes a fundamental impact on Secondary education in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan uses the Minguo calendar system. A school year consists of two semesters, with the fall semester begins in early September every year and runs through late January or early February. The spring semester begins in mid February and ends in early June. Semester breaks typically last for around two or three weeks surrounding the Spring Festival and Lunar New Year. Statistics on education are according to each academic year, while expenditures according to each fiscal year.\n\nIn junior high schools, subjects covered including literature, mathematics, English, science, technology, social studies, home economics and craft, arts and physical education. The language used in both junior and senior high schools is Mandarin at all levels. However, English classes are mandatory throughout the whole secondary education period.\n\nAccording to the \"Educational Statistics of the Republic of China\" (中華民國教育統計), Taiwan has 932 junior high schools in total, 844,884 students and 880 full-time teachers in those schools, as of the 101st academic year (August 2012 to July 2013). There has been a steep increase in those numbers since the implementation of nine years of compulsory education, which reflects the growth and changes in the junior high school education in Taiwan.\n\nFor students, the proportion of the number of students dropped from 93.96% in the 39th academic year (August 1950 to July 1951) to 50.18% in the 98th academic year (August 2009 to July 2010), showing the change in the educational structure of Taiwan. Another fact worth mentioning is the change in proportion of genders. In the 39th academic year (August 1950 to July 1951), there were 40,670 boys, which nearly doubled that of the 20,412 girls. However, as of the 101st academic year (August 2012 to July 2013), the difference in the proportion of boys and girls significantly reduced, where there was 440,711 boys and 404,173 girls. This indicates that under the compulsory education policy and the rise in feminism, the education conditions for girls have improved. In addition to this, the promotion rates of students in junior high schools increased from 51.15% to 99.15% from the 39th to the 101st academic year. In other words, currently in Taiwan, almost every student can be promoted and pursue further studies.\n\nFor schools, in the 39th academic year, there were only 66 junior high schools. After the implementation of compulsory education, junior high schools were set up to meet the goal of One Junior High School in Each Township (一鄉鎮一國中). In the fiscal year of 2009, the total expenditure on education was NT$802.3 billion, which was 5.83% of the Gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nAs for the aboriginal education, there were 72,652 aboriginal students studying in junior high schools in the 101st academic year. The first five groups in terms of student population are: Amis (26,113), Atayal (13,410), Paiwan (12,946), Bunun (8,113) and Truku (4,600). In that academic year, there were a total of 41,525 students who were new immigrants; sorted by the nationality (non-ROC national) of a parent, the first three countries are: People's Republic of China (16,221), Vietnam (10,690) and Indonesia (8,099), where they sum up to comprise 84.30% of the total number of new-immigrant student population. As for overseas Taiwanese, there were 206 students who returned to Taiwan to attend a junior high school in the 98th academic year (August 2009 to July 2010), mainly those residing in Indonesia (60), followed by the United States (29).\n\n\n"}

Semantic publication provides a way for computers to understand the structure and even the meaning of the published information, making information search and data integration more efficient.\n\nAlthough semantic publishing is not specific to the Web, it has been driven by the rising of the semantic web. In the semantic web, published information is accompanied by metadata describing the information, providing a \"semantic\" context.\n\nAlthough semantic publishing has the potential to change the face of web publishing, acceptance depends on the emergence of compelling applications. Web sites can already be built with all contents in both HTML format and semantic format. RSS1.0, uses RDF (a semantic web standard) format, although it has become less popular than RSS2.0 and Atom.\n\nSemantic publishing has the potential to revolutionize scientific publishing. Tim Berners-Lee predicted in 2001 that the semantic web \"will likely profoundly change the very nature of how scientific knowledge is produced and shared, in ways that we can now barely imagine\". Revisiting the semantic web in 2006, he and his colleagues believed the semantic web \"could bring about a revolution in how, for example, scientific content is managed throughout its life cycle\". Researchers could directly self-publish their experiment data in \"semantic\" format on the web. Semantic search engines could then make these data widely available. The W3C interest group in healthcare and life sciences is exploring this idea.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is usually taken by students in their last year of junior high school.\n\nBefore the Senior High School Entrance Examination, every province will hold two simulation examination twice, few places even three times. The Senior High School Entrance Examination usually make out problems by province, but few provinces transmit the power of making out problems to cities.

If the students failed the Senior High School Entrance Examination, then they cannot graduate from the junior high school, even if there are senior high school who want to admit them. These students will be refused by the senior high school for the reason \"failure in graduation from junior high school\" (初中肄业), that is what is commonly called “sending back the document” (退档).

{"id": "45314428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45314428", "title": "Teacher leadership", "text": "Teacher leadership\n\nTeacher leadership is a term used in K-12 schools for classroom educators who simultaneously take on administrative roles outside of their classrooms to assist in functions of the larger school system. Teacher leadership tasks may include but are not limited to: managing teaching, learning, and resource allocation. Teachers who engage in leadership roles are generally experienced and respected in their field which can both empower them and increase collaboration among peers.\n\nIn these types of school environments, teachers are able to make decisions based on the work they do directly with students. When a school system places the decision-making on the teachers, the action is happening one level closer to the people who are most closely impacted by the decisions (generally the students and the teachers), rather than two or more levels above at the principal, superintendent, or school board level.\n\nThe extent to which teacher leaders adopt additional roles varies in degree and description:\n\nAdministration leadership (traditional school leadership/educational leadership): \nAdministrative staff carries out the majority of the leadership duties.\n\nTeacher networks (professional learning community/professional community/networked improvement communities/community of practice/distributed leadership): \n\nAll teachers collectively take on decision-making roles about curriculum and school climate. This practice is facilitated by and supported by an administrative leader.\n\nTeacher leaders (instructional leadership/instructional coaches): \nSome teachers take on individual leadership roles that directly impact educational practices under the leadership of a school administrator.\n\nTeacher co-ops (teacher-powered schools/teacher-led schools/worker cooperative/professional partnerships/teacherpreneurs): \nAll teachers collectively take on leadership and administrative tasks that would traditionally be done by a principal or administrative team\n\nThe National Education Association (NEA) (2011) describes teacher leaders as, \"experienced professionals who have earned the respect of their students and colleagues and have gained a set of skills that enable them to work effectively and collaboratively with colleagues. They work closely with principals who have been trained to develop and implement effective mechanisms of support for teachers and teacher leaders.\"\n\nTeacher leaders are teachers who, \"want to remain closely connected to the classroom and students, but are willing to assume new responsibilities that afford them leadership opportunities in or outside the classroom while still teaching full or part-time.\"\n\nIn his book, Kolderie (2014) cites Hubbs in describing the benefits of decentralizing the authority in schools: \"You just can’t beat a decentralized system. It gets closest to the level where the action really is. Education should have an advantage in moving into it, because your locations and your people are already physically dispersed.\"\n\nAnother potential benefit of decentralizing authority is as Spillane et al. describe: \"The interactions among two or more leaders in carrying out a particular task may amount to more than the sum of those leaders’ practice.\"\n\nThe NEA (2011) reported that, \"Research indicates that in order to increase the likelihood that Gen \"Y\" teachers remain in the profession, they need opportunities to participate in decision making at the school and district level; a positive and supportive school culture which fosters teamwork and effective lines of communication; professional opportunities that include collaboration and technology; in-depth feedback and support from administrators and colleagues; time set aside for regular collaboration; and fair pay and a differentiated pay structure which includes rewarding outstanding performance, acquiring new knowledge and skills, and assuming new roles and responsibilities (Behrstock & Clifford, 2009).\"\n\nKolderie (2014) emphasizes, \"If teachers can control what matters for student success teachers will accept accountability for student success.\"\n\nTeacherpowered.org is a resource for this kind of work, and they note that teachers, \"feel increased passion for the job and have greater ability to make the dramatic changes in schools that they determine are needed to truly improve student learning and the teaching profession.\"\n\nLieberman (2000) cited Newmann and Wehlage (1995) in their search for, \"an understanding of how schools developed the capacity to inspire student learning of high intellectual quality. They found that a self-conscious professional community was a salient characteristic of those schools most successful with students.\"\n\nTo frame the types of work in which Teacher leaders participate, it is important to look at the roles taken on by Educational leadership more broadly. Halverson, Kelley, and Shaw (2013) identify the following domains of school leadership:\n\n\nStyles of school leadership can be placed on a spectrum in which on one end the leadership is completely owned by the administration to the opposite end in which leadership in completely owned by the teachers.\n\nThe structure of teacher networks, or as Kruse defines them, professional communities, includes \"collective responsibility, professional control, and flexible boundaries\". Kruse continues to describe the day-to-day norms of a professional community, including: \"reflective dialogue..., de-privatized, collective focus on student learning, collaboration, [and] shared norms and values.\"\n\nLieberman (2000) explains that, \"having a professional community differentiated those teachers who worked together to change the culture of their classrooms and their departments from those teachers who either tried new ideas in fragmented ways on their own or who blamed students for their inabilities to learn.\"\n\nBryk/Gomez describe a type of teacher network, \"a networked improvement community\" as, \"an intentionally formed social organization\" whose \"improvement goals impose specific demands on the rules and norms of participation.\"\n\nDanielson (2006) explains, \"Many schools have instituted structures in which teachers assume formal leadership roles in the school, such as master teacher, department chair, team leader, helping teacher, or mentor.\"\n\n\"Teachers in leadership roles work in collaboration with principals and other school administrators by facilitating improvements in instruction and promoting practices among their peers that can lead to improved student learning outcomes. By doing so, they support school leaders in encouraging innovation and creating cultures of success in school. Teacher leadership can neither be effective nor successful without principal support, but neither can the principal maximize his or her effectiveness without harnessing the talents and expertise of teachers in leadership roles.\"\n\n\"Teachers who serve in leadership roles may do so formally or informally. Rather than having positional authority, teachers become leaders in their schools by being respected by their peers, being continuous learners, being approachable, and using group skills and influence to improve the educational practice of their peers. They model effective practices, exercise their influence in formal and informal contexts, and support collaborative team structures within their schools.\"\n\n\"The Teacher Leader Model Standards consist of seven domains describing the many dimensions of teacher leadership:\n\n\nOne way in which teachers serve in these leadership or instructional coaching roles is to do instructional rounds in their school. Rounds consist of teachers spending time observing in one another’s classrooms and then meeting to discuss the findings. City et al. describe the goals of rounds to: \"1. Build skills of network members by coming to a common understanding of effective practice and how to support it. 2. Support instructional improvement at the host site (school or district) by sharing what the network learns and by building skills at the local level.\"\n\nSome additional forms of teacher or instructional leadership may include: problem-solving teams, peer mentoring, and coaching, which support of the work of the administration without replacing it.\n\nThe Teacher Powered Schools organization explains this teacher co-op or teacher-powered model as: \"1. collaboratively designed and implemented by teachers. 2. teachers having collective autonomy to make the decisions influencing the success of a school, project, or professional endeavor.\"\n\nIn these teacher co-ops or professional partnerships, Kolderie explains, \"The authority pyramid inverts, and school moves to the dual-leader model typical of partnerships in most areas. (Think of the managing partner and the administrator of a law firm, or the chief of the medical staff and the executive of a hospital.).\"\n\nThe structure of a teacher co-op could vary from, \"...handling the whole school [which] involves the teachers in the administration and management of the school as well as in the learning. Alternatively, teachers in a large secondary school—while continuing to be district employees—could form a partnership to handle the math department, the science department or the English department. They could then focus on learning; the principal would handle the school administration. A partnership of teachers might also organize to take responsibility for a program serving several schools across a district; Montessori, for example.\"\n\nLieberman (2000) found that, \"Networks that last, that hold their members, and continue to attract new teachers understand that they must account for the daily pressures of teaching, even as they seek to advance larger ideals.\"\n\nIn order to be successful, teacher leadership should be implemented strategically. \"Among the issues that will need to be considered are:\n\n\nTeacher leadership can be initiated from within the staff itself, however, it is important that the teachers have administrative support as well as peer-to-peer support to carry out their tasks. Halverson, Kelley, and Shaw (2013) reference: \"Louis, Kruse and Bryk (1995) conclude that the most important task for school leaders is to create meaningful opportunities for teachers across the school to work together on pressing issues of common interest.\"\n\nKruse (1993) outlines the conditions that support teacher leadership in the specific case of a professional community:\n\n\"Structural conditions\nSocial and human resources\n\nSchools may implement a teacher leadership model as a strategy to down-size and cut costs for the school. In most cases, distributing administrative among the teachers could reduce overall personnel costs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11610734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11610734", "title": "Thoughts on the Education of Daughters", "text": "Thoughts on the Education of Daughters\n\nThoughts on the education of daughters: with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life is the first published work of the British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. Published in 1787 by her friend Joseph Johnson, \"Thoughts\" is a conduct book that offers advice on female education to the emerging British middle class. Although dominated by considerations of morality and etiquette, the text also contains basic child-rearing instructions, such as how to care for an infant.\n\nAn early version of the modern self-help book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was an explosion in the number of conduct books published during the second half of the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published \"Thoughts\". However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.\n\nLike other conduct books of the time, \"Thoughts\" adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book encourages mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for women—a role that she viewed as meaningful—was interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.\n\nAlthough much of \"Thoughts\" is devoted to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few passages anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.\n\nLike many impoverished women during the last quarter of the 18th century in Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted to support herself by establishing a school. She, her sister, and a close friend founded a boarding school in Newington Green, a village already known for its Dissenting academies, including that of political theorist and educational reformer James Burgh, whose widow acted as \"fairy godmother\" in helping Wollstonecraft to find a house and pupils. However, in the late 1780s the school closed because of financial difficulties, and, desperate to escape from debt, Wollstonecraft wrote her first book, \"Thoughts on the Education of Daughters\". The title alludes to Burgh's \"Thoughts on Education\" (1747), which in turn alludes to John Locke's 1693 work, \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\". She sold the copyright for only ten guineas to Joseph Johnson, a publisher recommended to her by a friend; they became friends and he encouraged her writing throughout her life.\nWollstonecraft next tried her hand at being a governess, but she chafed at her lowly position and refused to accommodate herself to her employers. The modest success of \"Thoughts\" and Johnson's encouragement emboldened Wollstonecraft to embark on a career as a professional writer, a precarious and somewhat disreputable profession for women during the 18th century. She wrote to her sister that she was going to become the \"first of a new genius\" and published \"\", an autobiographical novel, in 1788.\n\nAddressed to mothers, young women, and teachers, \"Thoughts on the Education of Daughters\" explains how to educate a woman from infancy through marriage. Its twenty-one chapters are not arranged in any particular order and cover a wide variety of topics. The first two chapters, \"The Nursery\" and \"Moral Discipline\", offer advice on shaping the child's \"constitution\" and \"temperament\", arguing that the formation of the rational mind must begin early. These chapters also offer specific recommendations regarding the care of infants and endorse breastfeeding (a hotly debated topic in the 18th century). Much of the book criticizes what Wollstonecraft considers the damaging education usually offered to women: \"artificial manners\", card-playing, theatre-going, and an emphasis on fashion. She complains, for example, that women \"squander\" their money on clothing, \"which if saved for charitable purposes, might alleviate the distress of many poor families, and soften the heart of the girl who entered into such scenes of woe\". She contrasts this common but ineffectual education with one based on early childhood reading, benevolence, and love. Wollstonecraft also delved into a description of social issues, addressing the \"Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune\" in addition to the \"Treatment of Servants\". Religious faith plays a prominent role in Wollstonecraft's educational plan; she advocates Sabbath observance and describes the \"Benefits which arise from Disappointments\", that is, the benefits which arise from suffering sent by God.\n\nIn her later works, such as \"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\" (1790) and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792), Wollstonecraft repeatedly returns to the topics addressed in \"Thoughts\", particularly the virtue of hard work and the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.\n\nBetween 1760 and 1820, conduct books reached the height of their popularity in Britain; one scholar refers to the period as \"the age of courtesy books for women\". As Nancy Armstrong writes in her seminal work on this genre, \"Desire and Domestic Fiction\" (1987): \"so popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed\".\n\nConduct books integrated the styles and rhetorics of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers a description of (most often) the ideal woman while at the same time handing out practical advice. Thus, not only did they dictate morality, but they also guided readers' choice of dress and outlined \"proper\" etiquette. Typical examples include Bluestocking Hester Chapone's \"Letters on the Improvement of the Mind\" (1773), which went through at least sixteen editions in the last quarter of the 18th century, and the classically educated historian Catharine Macaulay's \"Letters on Education\" (1790). Chapone's work, in particular, appealed to Wollstonecraft at this time and influenced her composition of \"Thoughts\" because it argued \"for a sustained programme of study for women\" and was based on the idea that Christianity should be \"the chief instructor of our rational faculties\". Moreover, it emphasized that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in sensualism. When Wollstonecraft wrote \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" in 1792, she drew on both Chapone and Macaulay's works.\n\nConduct books have traditionally been viewed by scholars as an integral factor in the creation of a bourgeois sense of self. The conduct book \"helped to generate the belief that there was such a thing as a 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'\". By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners. However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called \"the angel in the house\" image (alluding to Coventry Patmore's poem of that name). Women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.\n\nMore recently, a few scholars have argued that conduct books should be differentiated more carefully and that some of them—such as Wollstonecraft's \"Thoughts\"—transformed traditional female advice manuals into \"proto-feminist tracts\". These scholars view \"Thoughts\" as part of a tradition that adapted older genres to a new message of female empowerment, genres such as advice manuals for women's education, moral satires, and moral and spiritual works by religious Dissenters (those not associated with the Church of England). Wollstonecraft's text resembles conventional conduct books in promoting self-control and submission, traits that were supposed to attract a husband. Yet at the same time, the text challenges this portrait of the \"proper lady\" by introducing strains of religious Dissent that promote equality of the soul. Thus, \"Thoughts\" appears to be torn between several sets of binaries, such as compliance and rebellion; spiritual meekness and rational independence; and domestic duty and political participation. This view of the conduct book, and of \"Thoughts\" in particular, questions the earlier interpretation of the genre as a mere tool of ideological indoctrination, an interpretation that grew out of criticism influenced by theorists such as Michel Foucault.\n\nBy the end of her life, Wollstonecraft had been involved in almost every arena of education: she had been a governess, a teacher, a children's writer, and a pedagogical theorist. Most of her works deal with education in some way. For example, her two novels are \"bildungsromane\" (novels of education); she translated educational works such as Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's \"Elements of Morality\"; she wrote a children's book, \"Original Stories from Real Life\" (1788); and her \"Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" is largely an argument for the value of female education. As is evidenced by this broad range of genres, \"education\" for Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries included much more than scholastic training; it encompassed everything that went into forming a person's character, from infant swaddling to childhood curricular choices to adolescent leisure activities.\n\nWollstonecraft and other political radicals during the last quarter of the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious Dissenters, especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in \"Thoughts\" and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist Joseph Priestley and the minister Richard Price. Dissenters \"were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits\". However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to Lockean and Hartleian associationist psychology: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care. Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.\n\nWollstonecraft was significantly influenced by Locke's \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" (1693) (her title alludes to it) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Emile\" (1762), the two most important pedagogical treatises of the 18th century. \"Thoughts\" follows in the Lockean tradition with its emphasis on a parent-directed domestic education, a distrust of servants, a banning of superstitious and irrational stories (e.g. fairy tales), and an advocacy of clear rules. Wollstonecraft breaks from Locke, however, in her emphasis on piety and her insistence that the child has \"innate\" feelings that guide her towards virtue, ideas likely drawn from Rousseau.\n\n\"Thoughts\" advocates several educational goals for women: independent thought, rationality, self-discipline, truthfulness, acceptance of one's social position, marketable skills, and faith in God.\n\nWollstonecraft assumes that the \"daughters\" in her book will one day become mothers and teachers. She does not propose that women abandon these traditional roles, because she believes that women can most effectively improve society as pedagogues. Wollstonecraft and other writers as diverse as the evangelical moralist Hannah More, the historian Catharine Macaulay, and the feminist novelist Mary Hays, argue that since women are the primary caregivers of the family and educators of children, they should be given a sound education. \"Thoughts\" is insistent, following Locke and associationist psychology, that a poor education and an early marriage will ruin a woman. Wollstonecraft argues that if no attention is paid to girls as they are growing, they will turn out poorly and marry while still intellectual and emotional children. Such wives, she contends, perform no useful role in society and, indeed, contribute to its immorality. She expanded upon this argument five years later in \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\".\nWollstonecraft and others criticized the traditional \"accomplishment\"-based education traditionally offered women; they argued that this kind of education, which emphasized the acquisition of skills such as drawing and dancing, was useless and decadent. The ideal woman in \"Thoughts\" is, as Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, \"rational, provident, realistic, self-disciplined, self-conscious and critical\", an image that resembles that of the professional man. Wollstonecraft argues that women should have all of the intellectual and moral training given to men, though she does not provide women with a place to use these new skills beyond the home.\n\nWollstonecraft's feminist critics charged that the masculine role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more in the way of education without a real way to use it.\n\nWollstonecraft's most passionate writing in \"Thoughts\" focuses on the lack of career opportunities for women, a theme that would dominate her later novel \"\" (1798). In the chapter entitled \"Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune\" she writes, perhaps describing her own experiences:\n\n[T]o be an humble companion to some rich old cousin... It is impossible to enumerate the many hours of anguish such a person must spend. Above the servants, yet considered by them as a spy, and ever reminded of her inferiority when in conversation with the superiors. … A teacher at a school is only a kind of upper servant, who has more work than the menial ones. A governess to young ladies is equally disagreeable. … life glides away, and the spirits with it; 'and when youth and genial years are flown,' they have nothing to subsist on; or, perhaps, on some extraordinary occasion, some small allowance may be made for them, which is thought a great charity. … It is hard for a person who has a relish for polished society, to herd with the vulgar, or to condescend to mix with her formal equals when she is considered in a different light... How cutting is the contempt she meets with!—A young mind looks round for love and friendship; but love and friendship fly from poverty: expect them not if you are poor!\n\nAlthough Wollstonecraft's comments on female education hint at some of her more radical arguments in \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\", the religious tone of the text—also found in her first novel, \"\"—is generally viewed by scholars as conservative. The religion presented in \"Thoughts\" is one that celebrates the \"pleasures of resignation\", the belief that the afterlife is awaiting and that the world is ordered by God for the best. Wollstonecraft writes:\n\nHe who is training us up for immortal bliss, knows best what trials will contribute to make us [virtuous]; and our resignation and improvement will render us respectable to ourselves, and to that Being, whose approbation is of more value than life itself.\n\nAlthough she drifted away from these beliefs and later adopted a more permissive theology, \"Thoughts\" is \"steeped in orthodox attitudes, advocating 'fixed principles of religion' and warning of the dangers of rationalist speculation and deism\". Wollstonecraft even agrees with Rousseau that women should be taught religious dogma rather than theology; clear rules, she maintains, will restrain their passions.\n\n\"Thoughts\" was only moderately successful: it was reprinted in Dublin a year after its initial publication in London, extracts were published in \"The Lady's Magazine\", and Wollstonecraft included excerpts from it in her own \"Female Reader\" (1789), an anthology of writings designed \"for the Improvement of Young Women\". \"The English Review\" noticed \"Thoughts\" favourably:\n\nThese thoughts are employed on various important situations and incidents in the ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject; … while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention of those who are more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.\n\nHowever, no other journal reviewed the book and \"Thoughts\" was not reprinted until the late 20th century, when there was a resurgence of interest in Wollstonecraft among feminist literary critics.\n\nAlan Richardson, a scholar of 18th-century education, points out that if Wollstonecraft had not written \"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\" (1790) and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\", it is unlikely that \"Thoughts\" would have been considered progressive or even worthy of notice. One critic has even said that the text reads as if it were simply trying to please the public. Although some scholars have argued that there are glimmers of Wollstonecraft's radicalism in this text, they admit that the \"potential for critique remains largely latent\". \"Thoughts\" is therefore usually interpreted either teleologically, as a first step towards the more radical \"Rights of Woman\", or dismissed as a \"politically naïve potboiler\" written prior to Wollstonecraft's conversion to radicalism while she was writing the \"Rights of Men\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "668610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=668610", "title": "University of the Third Age", "text": "University of the Third Age\n\nThe University of the Third Age is an international movement whose aims are the education and stimulation of mainly retired members of the community—those in their third 'age' of life. It is commonly referred to as U3A.\n\nThere is no universally accepted model for the U3A. Its original conception in France as an extramural university activity was significantly modified in the United Kingdom where it was recognized that most people of retirement age have something to contribute and the emphasis has been on sharing, without formal links to traditional universities. \n\nMany English-speaking countries have followed this geragogic model, whereas continental European countries have mostly followed the French model.\n\nA British U3A website reports this about \"The Third Age\" membership eligibility: \"U3A membership is not related to a specific age but to a period in one’s life (the third age) after the second age of full-time employment and parental responsibility. Anybody in their third age can join U3A and this includes people who are working part-time. There is no lower age for membership.\"\n\nU3A started in France at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Toulouse back in 1973. It was started by Prof. Pierre Vellas. In France, each Third Age University group is mostly associated with a local university. This academic model is used in many other countries, in particular in continental Europe. The university affiliation generates various opportunities such as highly qualified teaching personnel, a variety of subject choices, opportunity for students and faculty to conduct research based on the professional, cultural or historical experiences of the elderly, etc. U3As do not issue diplomas but rather certificates and teach in many fields according to the interests of the groups of elderly students (usually 55+) such as computer skills, languages, entrepreneurship, hereditary law, religion, politics, etc. Sometimes U3As provide groups with vocational training and formal continuous education opportunities.\n\nIn the 1990s the concept was broadened in France to the notion of the University of All Ages (UTA - université tous âges) or University of Free Time (UTL - université du temps libre). The UFUTA changed its name to \"Union Française des Universités de Tous Ages\" (retaining the acronym). Some French university departments have adopted the title of \"Université du Temps Libre\". \n\nAIUTA (\"Association Internationale des Universités du Troisième Âge\") (https://aiu3a.org/) is the global international organization and network of universities of the third age, including such institutions from most continental European countries, Central and East Europe, China, Russia, Latin America, etc., including Mauritius and other destinations. The President of AIUTA is prof. François Vellas from the University of Toulouse, son of the founder of the first U3A Pierre.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the concept reached the United Kingdom, where its nature was radically changed to be more a self-help organization under the influence of its founders, Peter Laslett, Michael Young and Eric Midwinter. This model is also used in Australia, Cyprus, Dominica, New Zealand and South Africa.\nIn the British model of peer learning, it is acknowledged that retired people have a lifetime of experience and, collectively, a vast amount of knowledge. This is used to arrange a syllabus for each subject where each meeting is normally led by a member of the group with a strong interest or specialist knowledge.Each U3A group pays a membership fee to the national coordinating body, The Third Age Trust, and has access to a vast range of resources including a multi-media lending library, special-interest newsletters and contacts with other groups with similar interests. Summer schools are held by special interest groups. Most importantly, each group ha an absolutely autonomous entity, self-financing and self-managing. In 2016 the British U3A reported its 1000th member, at Churchdown, Gloucestershire which has 26 groups, after reporting 950 in 2015, running 36,000 courses for 350,000 people.Most groups are regional in nature which has led to the creation, in some countries, of variations on the U3A. For example, in Cyprus there is a U3A, an organization called C3A (Cyprus Third Age), which is affiliated to the UK U3A, and P3A (Paphos Third Age).\n\nSome Central (and Eastern) European countries were introduced to the U3A quite early: Poland, Czech Republic (formerly part of Czechoslovakia) and Slovenia. The Slovenian Third Age University was started by two university professors in 1984 and has developed into a network of 40 universities over the entire country.\n\nThere is an online Third Age University in Russia at http://u3a.niuitmo.ru/.\n\nAustralia's first U3A began in Melbourne in 1984 and as of 2013, has grown to 250 U3As with approximately 85,000 members. These are based in metropolitan, regional and rural areas, and follow the British self-help model of teaching and learning over a wide range of subject areas, dependent upon the membership's own expertise, knowledge and skills.\n\nU3As in New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital territory, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia have formed state networks to support the U3As in their state or territory with a range of resources. Each Network has its own website from which local U3As can be located. For example, see http://www.nsw.u3anet.org.au which also has links to other state networks.\n\nIn 1998, U3A Online was started to provide cognitively challenging virtual courses for isolated older people from any country. Since then the initiative has been widened to include any person who regards themselves as being in their third age. More than 35 courses, all written and taught by volunteer experts from various countries, are available. In 2009, U3A Online published a paper entitled \"Educational initiatives for the elderly\". The paper contains contributions from a number of U3A leaders from around the world outlining the status of U3A and U3A-like organizations in different countries. That paper, and other peer-reviewed research studies based on the Successful Aging model, are freely available from http://www.u3aonline.org.au.\n\nThe Third Age Network (TAN) is very active in Canada, however currently only within the province of Ontario. With head office at the G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education at Ryerson University in Toronto, the network started in 2007 and has grown to 21 groups in 2018. \n\nThe Third Age Mission: “To foster Third Age Learning and share issues and solutions to common organizational challenges. We do this by promoting the establishment of organizations that provide opportunities for older adults to learn in a friendly, social setting and by supporting adult learning organizations in this process by sharing strategies and techniques to accomplish this goal.”\n\nTAN runs a newsletter and hosts organization-wide symposiums and forums. It also provides support to local groups with things like information on speakers, networking with colleagues, data on member operations, including honoraria paid to speakers, board make up, rental costs, affordable group insurance, a regular newsletter, conferences and workshop, guidance for creating a website, internal and external communication.\n\nSimon Fraser University (SFU) Seniors Program\n\nSFU was the first university in North America to create a series of specially designed courses for seniors at the post-secondary level. Its mandate was to provide educational programs for older adults that were responsive to their unique psychological and physiological characteristics. \n\nTo read more see this page on the UBC website.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, after four years of experiments and testing, the Virtual University of the Third Age (vU3A) was launched with the intention of offering the same friendship, support and learning enjoyed by off-line groups. vU3A is open to anyone, in particular those who, by circumstances of isolation, health problems or other restrictions, cannot get to a U3A group. There is a small fee.\n\nVolunteers run the entire operation, including teaching, in cyberspace. There is general agreement that not only physical but intellectual activity enrich and prolong life in the later years. Although primarily for the retired, many U3As open their membership to any people not in full-time employment, thus becoming more inclusive and widening the age range of the membership.\n\nTypical courses include Art, Classical Studies, Conversation, Computers, Crafts, Debate, Drama, History, Languages, Literature, Music, Sciences, Social Sciences, and Philosophy. Some study groups do not have a prepared syllabus, but draw on reports of current affairs in their topic subject to prompt conversation and research. Some groups are designed to cross disciplinary boundaries, for example, combining Society, Technology and Science in a fashion not practical in more formal academic environments.\n\nU3A groups are well positioned to conduct serious research into local history and genealogy. For example, a group in Eyemouth collected and exhibited many photographs of life and work in the district over the years. Some groups aim to bridge the generation gap in the field of information technology, opening up an exciting new world to many who might have been oblivious of it otherwise. Internet marketing is especially important for members in more remote locations.\n\nThere are also many less educationally focused activities, including Games, including bridge tuition and duplicate bridge playing groups; Health, Fitness & Leisure, including countryside walks, Theatre/Concert Clubs, Travel Clubs, and Dance in all its forms.\n\nMany U3As publish local newsletters as do some of their special interest networks. In the UK the Third Age Trust, the coordinating body in the UK, publishes a national magazine. Third Age Matters publishes five times per year plus an educational bulletin called Sources, for subscribing U3A members three times annually.\n\nThe U3A can also provide a valuable resource in considering many local and national issues. Membership includes many with experience and expertise in almost all walks of life and letters. Although strictly non-political, U3A members have time to reflect in a mature fashion on such topics as the operation of public services, crime and punishment, the future of energy supplies, public funding of the arts and so on, and can reply to invitations to engage in public consultations with carefully considered and argued responses.\n\n\n"}

Its members meet once a week to critique stories and discuss the art, craft, and business of writing. It is a long-running speculative fiction critique group, and has a high concentration of published authors. However, having prior publishing credits is not a prerequisite to joining. The group has produced winners of the Galaxy Press international Writers of the Future contest six years in a row. \n\nThe group promotes itself as a means to help writers produce fiction of salable quality, and to continually improve their writing abilities. The workshop's primary focus is on short speculative fiction, but members have had fiction of other lengths and genres critiqued.\n\nFounded in 1987, \"The Wordos\" was originally called \"The Eugene Professional Writers Workshops, Inc.\" The name was changed in 1995, to make it \"shorter and friendlier.\" They kept the original name for business purposes, however. The group meets weekly in a local bookstore.\n\nThe membership over time has included, young adult and fantasy novelist Nina Kiriki Hoffman, surrealist short story writer and novelist Ray Vukcevich, science fiction writers Kathy Oltion and Jerry Oltion, Bruce Holland Rogers, Patricia Briggs, fiction and non-fiction writer Leslie What, Jay Lake, Eric M. Witchey, Devon Monk and many others. Deborah Layne, a long-time member, is also the founder of Wheatland Press, the award-winning publisher of the \"Polyphony\" anthology.\n\nThe Wordos follow the Clarion Workshop model of critiquing. A member reads a submitted story, writes comments on it, and then, on the evening of the workshop, speaks for one to three minutes offering those and other comments aloud. At the end of the evening the critiqued story is given back to the author.\n\nMembers also report on news over the previous week, including accepted stories, rejections, and re-write requests from publishers.\n\nA member of the Wordos has won or placed in the L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future contest consistently since 2001. There have also been several Nebula Award-winning workshop members and members who have been nominated for or won the Endeavour Award, World Fantasy Award, and Philip K. Dick Award. One member, Marshall Moseley, was a finalist in the Bravo television series \"Project Greenlight\".\n\nThe following is a partial list of award-winning stories written by members of the Wordos:\n"}
{"id": "581421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=581421", "title": "Work college", "text": "Work college\n\nWork Colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. Work Colleges are federally designated institutions that have \"comprehensive work-learning-service\" programs as an essential and core component of their educational programs. All resident students are required to work including one-half of all students who are enrolled on a full-time basis regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution with a commitment to community service. The purpose of the Work Colleges program is to recognize, encourage and promote work-learning-service programs as a valuable education approach when it is an integral part of the institution's education program and a part of the financial plan that decreases reliance on (grants and) loans. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Students are paid for their work which helps offset the cost of tuition. At some work colleges students receive a full tuition credit for their work, while other receive reduced tuition. Student work can help contribute to lower operational costs and more affordable tuition.\n\nStudents typically work 6 to 15 hours per week, jobs run the gamut of campus need from teaching assistant-ships, to accounts payable, to IT, to food services, to grounds keeping, to plumbing, public relations, campus safety etc. Work colleges share the belief that the integration of work-learning-service provides a strong, successful, and relevant model for educating students.\n\nCurrently, there are nine federally recognized work colleges in the nation that meet the federal requirements for operation as overseen by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n\n"}
