{"id": "57465515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57465515", "title": "Atel (slang)", "text": "Atel (slang)\n\nAtel is a French-derivative and nonsensical Bengali term, used as noun and pronoun in Bengali language, which is the inferior term for intellectual. In the lexical sense, Atel is a scholar (derogatorily), wise person, person of the type of intellectual, which is coming from the French dialect of intellectual, or the French intellectual pronunciation of English intellectual. A person who is proficient in academic practice, but lacks the sensuality and practical knowledge is called Atel. The person who pretends as being intelligent also identified as Atel. According to the linguist Pabitra Sarkar, \"In the forty-five decades, a class of Bengali intellectuals emerged, who used to regularly sit in the coffee house, wore Panjabi and considered themselves best; seeing these intellectuals, the word context was applied according to the ridicule and reaction of others.\"\n\nAccording to Indian author Nrisingh Prasad Vauduri, winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award, \"The word intellectual is found since in the Bachelorette meeting (Swayambara Sava) of Draupadi. Immediately after Arjuna and Raja-Maharaja (kings-emperors) came to the meeting, \"Nipuna Buddhijibina (perfect intellectuals)\" appeared at the meeting. In this context, the question is whether this will be done or not. He described the character of Karna of Mahabharata as \"Atel\". According to him, \"I can all understand the \"I can do everything\" mentality of the Karna, we manifest the ego in his behavior. On the battlefield, Dushasana died, but Karna could not do anything, yet he advised Duryodhana not to be anxious. Yet today, where there is the trend of being middlemen doing nothing, so the meaning of the word \"Atel\" has gradually changed to us.\"\n\nIn the May 2017, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina said in the session of parliament pointing towards the rescued social activist and author Farhad Mazhar after the disappearance, \"One of our renowned \"Atel\" disappeared as kidnapped. Later we saw that he was not kidnapped. He himself went to Khulna. Later he was found. This fault is ours. There are many more such cases happening. I do not want to say his name.\"\n\nFormer chairman of the Department of Language Studies of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Shafiuddin Ahmed said in response to the question of \"how much our generation is progressive\", \"Our boys and girls are more meritorious than boys and girls of other countries. You see, when they goes out, there in the case of studying, innovation, entrepreneur, they keep the sign of good credit. But they are not able to do it here, because we can not teach them that ourselves. When a nation's teachers, artists, writers, poets, intellectuals become \"Atel\", party-oriented, and dependeant, then, the nation becomes damaged. We are now passing that time, so our generation is being damaged.\"\n\nIndian film director Raj Chakraborty, in his interview, mentioned the word in the answer of \"what types of films will you use to choose to make as a producer\", he said, \"Since I am now making historical and children's movie instead commercial films, I will choose to produce commercial films as a producer. The director of this type of film is few in number. Over that, I don't enjoy much the Urban \"Atel\" films. Whatever people think negatively, but over all I am the son of a small-town. I grew up watching the commercial pictures. I like to see yet. The typical Bollywood masala movies. Hence, I would much like to invest in commercial movies.\"\n"}
{"id": "5857487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5857487", "title": "Baron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels", "text": "Baron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels\n\nBaron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels (born 28 April 1901 in Prague - died 7 February 1980 in Neckargemünd, Heidelberg, Germany) was a prominent Muslim of Austrian origin.\n\nOmar, or as he later chose, Umar Rolf Ehrenfels was born 28 April 1901 in Prague, Austria. He was baptised Rolf Werner Leopold von Ehrenfels. His father was Roman Catholic Baron Christian von Ehrenfels (1859–1932) professor of philosophy at the German part of Prague University. He is known as the founder of the Gestalt theory. His mother was Emma von Ehrenfels (1862–1946) born André, in Bratislava (Pressburg). In her parental home both German and Hungarian was spoken. During World War I she worked for the Red Cross caring for Hungarian wounded soldiers. Widowed of her first marriage she brought her daughter Elfriede (Elfi) Hartmann into their home. The second daughter, known as the author Imma von Bodmershof (1895–1983), was born in Graz. Rolf as the only son of Christian Freiherr von Ehrenfels inherited the title but he had to discard it according to new Austrian laws in 1920. As a convert to Islam he took on the name Omar or Umar, kept Rolf and omitted the others. 1932–37 he was a student of social anthropology (Völkerkunde) at Vienna University and got a doctorate there. At the Nazi occupation of Austria, Anschluss, 13 March 1938, he emigrated to India. There he lived until 1961, since 1949 as lecturer, later professor of social anthropology at the University of Madras. Umar Rolf Ehrenfels died 7 February 1980 in Neckargemuend, Germany having been guest professor at Heidelberg University and co- founder of its South Asia Institute 1961-71. Elfriede von Bodmershof (1894–1982) was his wife 1925–1948. The couple was separated due to the Nazi occupation of 1938. Later Ehrenfels married the French social scientist Mireille Abeille (1924–2007).\n\nRolf Ehrenfels was an Austrian citizen all his life. Lichtenau near Krems and Gföhl in Lower Austria was his home parish. Since 1813 the Ehrenfels family were settled in Schloss Lichtenau. Also the castles Brunn im Walde and Rastbach were family properties. Rolf's eldest sister \"Elfi\" Elfriede Hartmann married a widower with three children and had her own home from the early 1920s. His sister Imma Ehrenfels married Wilhelm \"Willy\" (von) Bodmershof (Schuster)and they settled at Rastbach castle for life. In 1925 there was a double wedding as Rolf Ehrenfels married Willy's sister Fridl who became Elfriede Ehrenfels. She was born in Trieste, Austria.\n\nFor a period Rolf lived in Berlin. His first wife Ellen Feld can be seen as she has a part in a film, Das grosse Sehnen , for which Rolf wrote the manuscript. Rolf and his friend Willy Bodmershof worked on it together and shot it partly in a studio in Berlin, partly on location in Istanbul in 1923. On this trip, partly by bicycle, Rolf's interest in Islam was kindled. Also Christian von Ehrenfels appears in it, as a wise man. There are still photos in Ehrenfels archive, Lichtenau. The film is now in the Austrian Film Museum in Vienna. The film was reviewed by Kurt Bauchwitz as press clippings in the Ehrenfels archive show. Kurt was one of the intellectual Jews in the Berlin Wilmersdorf area. With him Rolf Ehrenfels developed a friendship for life. Kurt called himself Roy C Bates when he had escaped to the USA after 1933. Their relationship is documented in the Roy C Bates papers in the Grenander Collections at Albany University, USA.\n\nAround 1926 Rolf made up his mind to convert to Islam. He took on the name Omar, used in his Muslim circles, Rolf in the family. (Later he turned a Sufist using different invented Sufi names.) In Berlin Omar got attached to the Wilmersdorfer Moschee of Ahmadyya Anjuman located in Brienner Strasse near Fehrbelliner Platz. Philosophy and religion were common interests to Rolf and his wife from 1925, Elfriede Ehrenfels. She contributed to academic journals of philosophy. She was never a Muslim but attracted by Baha'ism. Christian Ehrenfels major work \"Kosmogonie\" (Jena 1916, English translation by M. Focht New York: Comet Press, 1948) fascinated them. Together Omar and Fridl made car tours in Muslim Europe, Bosnia and Albania, in 1929 and 1935. In 1931- 38 Omar wrote several important articles for the Berlin mosque journal started in 1924, Moslemische Revue, after he got a copy of it from the Imam Abdullah Effendi Kurbegovic (1873–1933) at the Great Mosque in Sarajevo. Living at Lichtenau Omar was one of the editorial board. He also wrote for Muslim Journals in English, connected to the Lahori Ahmadiyya e.g. at Woking. At his death in 1980 Umar Rolf was said to be the oldest Muslim by choice, \"Wahlmuslim\", in Europe. He wrote Muslim (Sufist) articles until the end (\"Sifat\", Zuerich,1978).\n\nLike brother and sister Willy and Fridl Bodmershof did, Rolf tried his luck both as freelance journalist and fiction writer. Kurt Bauchwitz and the circles in Berlin (Wilmersdorf?) encouraged him. He got many articles published, mostly under different pseudonyms. His best known one was Othmar Steinmetz. Soon Rolf and Fridl became a writing couple. \"My wife and literary co- worker since 1925, has assisted considerably in the planning and laying- out of the book, and Count and Countess Coudenhove- Kalergis in the completion of the manuscript as well as productive criticism\". This Rolf Ehrenfels writes in his doctoral dissertation, written 1937 in German, as it was printed in English in 1941. The Preface is dated \"Hyderabad, Deccan June 24th 1940\". \nFrom 1927 (?) the two married couples, Imma- Willy Bodmershof and Fridl- Rolf Ehrenfels, lived mostly at Lichtenau and Rastbach, doubly occupied with farming work on the estate and writing. The Ehrenfels parents' home was in Prague, the Bodmershof's in Trieste. Both Willy and Rolf managed to finish doctorates: Rolf Ehrenfels in Vienna in 1937, Wilhelm Bodmershof at Graz University in 1933. Thanks to connections with his father's students in Prague and his mother's friends in cultural, feminist circles in Prague and Vienna Rolf got the opportunity to publish articles and also a serialized novel in Prager Tagblatt in 88 parts called \"Ein Kriegskind sucht das Glück\" by Othmar Steinmetz. The date of the complete manuscript in the Lichtenau archive is 13 March 1930. In the archive there are other manuscripts and letters, among others to Tal Verlag, which confirm that Rolf and Elfriede Ehrenfels wrote novels together. They agreed to put one of their names on the text in turns. Evidently with the Kurban Said's novels it was Elfriede's turn . After Rolf had escaped to India February 1939 after eight months in Greece together there was no more Kurban Said.\n\nThe copyright sign is, or rather should be, the ultimate proof Elfriede Ehrenfels born Bodmershof has the right to be called the originator of the two novels by the pseudonym Kurban Said. \"Ali und Nino\" published in 1937 by Tal Verlag in Vienna is the best known. In Europe the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work of 1886 gives the person whose name is behind the copyright sign the right to be identified as the author of a book. Both publishers and authors had an interest not to have their work stolen. The publisher's right is/was something else, drawn up in a contract. National bibliographies were printed yearly. For years the massive American National Union Catalog NUC, listing books in the Congress library, was printed. Both NUC and the German bibliography \"Gesamtverzeichnis\" GV give the information that Kurban Said is Elfriede Ehrenfels. The convention is different in the USA. Americans are not always aware of this. It is a misunderstanding that \"authorities\" gave away copyright after Austria was occupied by Nazi-Germany. The occupation power printed its sign, the swastika, wherever they wanted. And they wanted it everywhere.\nProfessor Gerhard Hoepp's (1942–2003) research is a major source to Tom Reiss as he elaborated an article of 1999 into a book 2005. However, in his article of 2001 \"Who wrote \"Ali and Nino\": to the archaeology of a legend\" Hoepp sums up competing theories in a review of new editions (Overlook, New York, 1999; Ullstein, Berlin 2000) of \"Ali and Nino\" combined with Tom Reiss' article. Hoepp states \"dass Elfriede von Ehrenfels- Bodmershof, die auch den Vertrag fuer \"Ali und Nino\" unterzeichnete, Kurban Said war, steht inzwischen ausser Zeifel.\" (That EEB, who also signed the contract for A&N, was Kurban Said, is since then beyond doubt.) The contract for Ali und Nino was made with Mr Tal, who only signed Tal, which appears from the contract shown to Tom Reiss.\nHis widow Lucy in 1973 tried to take over the copyright owned by Elfriede Ehrenfels. The issue in the 2000s has become, as if a woman could not have achieved a novel on her own: Who was her co-writer? Essad Bey was a guess from the 1930s according to Hoepp. This guess was adopted and developed by Reiss (1999, 2005). The second wave of publication from 1970 introduced the Azerbaijan author Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli as the sole Kurban Said. \"Obwohl diese Annamhe nicht halten lässt\" (although this belief does not stand to tests). Hoepp says, it was spread by the Turkish publisher and later in the Soviet Union of the Glasnost. There was no more talk of Elfriede Ehrenfels.\n\nThe Chamanzaminli theory was researched by the magazine Azerbaijan International. AI exhibits the covers of about a hundred editions of Ali and Nino and has published an extensive analysis of their research.\n\nOn a few, a portrait of Elfriede appears, on one (German 2001), she is shown together with Omar Rolf, from a portrait in the film \"Das grosse Sehnen\". Fridl Ehrenfels' obvious co-writer, if any, was her husband Omar Rolf. His inside knowledge of Islam was significant.\n\nGerhard Hoepp does not go into this. He is a scientist and has done no research on Ehrenfels, but he has published research on Lev Noussimbaum. Hoepp in 1997 considers Essad Bey as the co-author of \"Ali and Nino\". One of the informants he mentions is Professor Dr. Heinz Barazon. Reiss 2005 shows that he is the legal adviser of Rolf Ehrenfels' widow Mireille Ehrenfels and their daughter Leela Ehrenfels. Some of the data on \"Ali and Nino\" from 1970 into the 2000s build on gossip running in Vienna after Anschluss 13 March 1938, as told by Dr Barazon to Tom Reiss, and also distorted memories of aged informants. Mireille Ehrenfels gave the wrong year (1937) and causes for the separation between Rolf and Fridl (conflicts) to the family lawyer Dr Barazon.\nRolf Ehrenfels in \"Mother- right in India\" (1941) says they wrote together since 1925. In \"Kadar of Cochin\" he states that Fridl was with him during the first eight months of his exile spent in Greece. She did her own research in Greece and her interest continues. They correspond on topics even 1952.\n\nReiss' argumentation builds on his theory that there was a need for \"the family´s de- Nazification\". This can be compared to documented facts visible also on the dust jacket of Umar Rolf Ehrenfels' \"The Light Continent\" (1960). \"Escaping the Hitler terror when the Nazis occupied Austria, Dr. U.R. Ehrenfels, born at Prague in 1901, took refuge in India in 1939.\" After respect to his father Christian we are informed of travels to the East and studies. \"/In Vienna/ Ehrenfels became founder- president of Der Orientbund, an Afro-Asian students' federation.\" After a trip to India 1932- 33 \"he went back to become the co- editor of \"Gerechtigkeit\" (justice) in Vienna, a journal which stood for the integrity of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and for Human Rights when Italy invaded that country.\" The book has a printed dedication: \"In memoriam the victims of Sharpeville and Lunda\" and to his wife Mireille called Mie. \nTom Reiss did not go deep enough into the documents shown to him when he visited Lichtenau in 1998. \"De- Nazification\" was a British invention that all prisoners of internment camps had to go through after 1945. Also Jews who had escaped to India to save themselves from Holocaust were exposed to the process. Not all succeeded. Facts about this are not on the Internet. It seems to be a taboo subject to historians. Reiss solves a \"mystery\" by turning victims of Nazism into Nazists.\n\nThe Berne Convention copyright law is the reason why Elfriede Ehrenfels in her will could let her right go on to Rolf's and Mireille's daughter Leela Ehrenfels at Fridl's death in 1982.\n\nFor those wishing to examine the question of the actual authorship of the novel \"Ali and Nino\", see Azerbaijan International. The staff of Azerbaijan International magazine spent six years of extensive research in 10 languages (Azeri, Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Georgian, Turkish, Persian and Swedish) before publishing their results, which are meticulously documented from research carried out in the National Archives of various countries including Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and Germany.\n\nThere is no doubt that Elfriede Ehrenfels registered the pseudonym Kurban Said in her own name for and \"Girl from the Golden Horn.\" See photos of registration.\n\nYes, there are first edition copies of Kurban Said's books in Elfriede's metal chest at the Lichtenau Castle but that is not proof of authorship. It would be quite natural for someone who had registered the novels to have copies.\n\nCorrespondence exists in the personal archives of the publisher of the book - Lucy Tal - indicating she had never met Elfriede Ehrenfels and was totally surprised to find that the Elfriede Ehrenfels had registered the pseudonym \"Kurban Said\" in her name. Lucy Tal's husband Peter had died of a heart attack on November 30, 1936, several months before the book was printed.\n\nIn an attempt to overcome the grief at his beloved father's death Umar Rolf made a journey to India in 1932-33. Together with the Imam of the Wilmersdorfer Mosque in Berlin, former professor in Lahore Dr S.M. Abdullah, Baron Omar made a lecture tour from Lahore in the north to Hyderabad in the south as an advocate of the Ahmadiya movement. He sent reports from the tour printed in newspapers. At home again he lectured. The tour affected him so much that Umar Rolf decided to give his life a new turn. He made India his main life project. His interest was deep. His father's colleague the Indologist professor Moriz Winternitz (1863–1937) had taught Rolf as a boy. He had met high-ranking Indians in his home among them the Nobel Prize Laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941). Mahatma Gandhi's close man Vallabhai Patel (1875–1950) was the patron of Der Orientbund in Vienna, which Umar Rolf founded 1932 and presided until his escape to India 1938. What Ehrenfels saw of women's position on the tour 1932-33 made him choose to study social anthropology at Vienna University. In 1937 he got his doctorate with the dissertation \"Mutterrecht in Vorderindien\". It was translated by himself and published in Hyderbad/Dn in 1941 as \"Mother-right in India\".\n\nIn 1938 Umar Rolf Ehrenfels lived in Vienna. He was known as a convert to Islam and founding president of the multiracial students' society in Vienna called Der Orientbund or Islamischer Kulturbund. His doctoral dissertation of 1937 built on a strongly anti- Aryan theory. As an active anti- fascist Umar Rolf had to flee to save his life after the Nazi occupation of Austria 13 March 1938. His wife Elfriede did not want to leave Austria. Rolf tried to protect her from harassment by a divorce in 1938, which was denied. Franz Kafka's friend and biographer Max Brod (1884–1968) was editor of Prager Tageblatt that had published many texts by Rolf. Brod managed to warn Rolf, who was lecturing in Prague, not to go back to Vienna, where he was on the Nazi death list. In 1939 Brod fled to Tel Aviv. He stayed in contact with Umar Rolf for life. They were engaged in JCM, an organisation to near the three religions. This was a recurrent theme of the Moslemische revue from 1924 on.\nEhrenfels left his home by way of Greece trying to find solutions. His wife went with him and friends came to support him. Thanks to Sir Akbar Hydari (1869–1941) Baron von Ehrenfels in 1939 could escape to be the guest of The Nizam of Hyderabad Deccan in South India. \"Motherright in India\" has a printed dedication saying: \"To Sir Akbar Hydari, the Chancellor of the Osmania University, the distinguished promoter of science and learning in India.\" According to plans Ehrenfels was to become professor of a new department of anthropology but a Nazi party member from Vienna came in his way. One trace of this plan is \"Ilm-ul Aqam\". It is anthropological textbook for students in two volumes translated from Ehrenfels' manuscript in English into Urdu by Dr. Syed Abid Hussain. A letter to Max Brod 1941 says: \"General and Indian Ethnology for the layman\". \nThe situation in India changed at the outbreak of World War II September 1939. Austrian passports were considered \"German\" from March 1938. The war meant that antifascist refugee Umar Rolf Ehrenfels was now an \"enemy alien\". Ehrenfels was deprived of his liberty until 1946 in two British India internment camps most of the time at Yercaud, a hill station. He managed to do some anthropological fieldwork - under police escort. He learnt languages and created art as he was a painter, having his first exhibitions in Prague and Vienna.\n\nIn 1949 Ehrenfels lectured before the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964) and got an honorary Indian citizenship. He was awarded the Sarat Chandra Roy Golden Medal for original contributions to Anthropology by the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. Ehrenfels had suffered hardships as a British Empire political prisoner like other freedom fighters. A forced exile had brought him back as the Nizam's guest but he became an active builder of the new republic. He used anthropology with a historical and interdisciplinary outlook to strengthen the self-esteem of Indians particularly women. He wrote many anthropological articles and gave radio talks. He took part in social work. Always infused with his passion for women's rights, not only in theory but in implementation in real life. \nIn 1949–1961 Ehrenfels was head and professor of the Department of Anthropology, founded in 1945, at Madras University. He held several grants from the Viking Fund, New York and did field work reinforcing the theories he had presentad in his dissertation 1937. In 1957–58 he held a Swedish grant to make his longed for field work in East Africa, described in the bok \"The Light Continent\" (1960), translated into German and Telugu: \"Kaanti Seema\".\n\nFrom Madras Ehrenfels and his newly wed wife Mireielle Ehrenfels moved to Heidelberg in 1961. Together they went to do a last fieldwork in India in the mid 60s. Apart from a book in 1969 there is a great amount of unpublished material in the Lichtenau archive. After her husband's death Mireille Ehrenfels made Lichtenau her home. She made great efforts in restoring the Lichtenau and Rastbach castles after the damages during the war as well as organising the Ehrenfels Archive.\n\nA recurrent theme in Ehrenfels' writings from the early 1920s was dress codes and women's rights.\nEhrenfels insisted that both men and women should stick to the pre- colonial traditions of the tropics which was to leave the upper part of the body uncovered. Ehrenfels lived as he taught and adjusted his dress to the climate but he could only do so in private. In British India there was legislation punishing non- indigenous men for \"disgracing European dignity\" by wearing the dhoti.\nIn 1973 the International Anthropological and Ethnological Congress IUAES was held in Chicago presided by Professor Sol Tax (1907–1995). Sol Tax Dr. Ehrenfels' paper Clothing and Power Abuse was printed in two of the congress volumes. 1975 in \"War: Its Causes and Correlates\". Part 2: Psychological and psychiatric considerations of the etiology of war p. 157-61. 1979 in The Fabrics of Culture: The Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment p. 399-404. Professor Sol Tax presented the 1973 congress in Chicago as the first of the decolonization era and demanded peace research to be a worldwide commitment ever after. The next IUAES congress in 1978 was for the first time held in the third world, in New Delhi, India, presided by Lalita Prasad Vidyarthi (1931–1985) L. P. Vidyarthi\n\nHe appears both in the aspect as a Muslim and Islamologist and as a Vienna University trained professional social scientist working at Madras University (1949–61) and Heidelberg University (1961 – c. 1975) doing scientific, published fieldwork in South Asia 1932–1964. The World Catalog http://worldcat.org database, although only primary, leads to several titles.\nMost of Ehrenfels' articles written for the Moslemische Revue in Berlin can now be read http://berlin.ahmadiyya.org/m-rev/index.htm This is the only genuine journal published in by the Berlin Mosque. The name was taken by others later.\nUmar Rolf Ehrenfels is included in the book Islam Our Choice first edition May 1961 is online. http://aaiil.org/text/books/kk/islamourchoicemuslimconvertstories/islamourchoicemuslimconvertstories.pdf Dr. Ehrenfels expressed his Muslim faith as it had crystallized over the years in the article The How and Why of Conversion to Islam published in June, 1961 in the Islamic Review, Woking. http://www.wokingmuslim.org/work/islamic_review/index.htm A fact box contains his life story. In 1967 the article was translated into German published in the Al Muslim, Frankfurt/M. \nBy that time Dr. Ehrenfels' work at the Heidelberg University South Asia Institute as a guest professor employed as a senior research fellow Ehrenfels had made him move even further. From his conversion on he saw Islam as a world-encompassing unifying link of mankind. Over the years he deepened his understanding and experiencing other religious forms into sharing the mystical oneness.\n\nAfter his escape from the Nazi terror in Austria after March 1938, Ehrenfels was received as the Guest of the Nizam's Government thanks to Sir Akbar Haydari. In 1939 Ehrenfels wrote \"Indian and general anthropology for the layman\", a two volume textbook for the students of anthropology he was planned to have at the Osmania University in Hyderabad. It was translated into Urdu, the educational language of the university, as Ilmul Aqvam 280 + 197 printed pages. It was published in Delhi by a'njuman e taraq y e a'rdv dhly in December 1941. Digitisation was made October 22, 2010.

Dr. Patel’s practice has focused on transforming urban design and planning practice to make them more effective in improving Indian cities. His research interests are in Land Use Planning, Real Estate Markets, Building Regulations, Land Management and Urban Planning History.\n\nBimal Patel lives and practices architecture and city planning in Ahmedabad, India. Ahmedabad is also the city that he grew up in and its architectural history and planning culture have influenced and informed his work. He studied at the School of Architecture, Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, CEPT, from 1978 to 1984. In 1981, he apprenticed with Frei Otto at the Institute for Lightweight Structures, Stuttgart, Germany. Living and working in Stuttgart also gave him the opportunity to travel through much of Western Europe at a young age.\n\nAfter receiving his first professional degree in architecture from CEPT in 1984 and a year of work in Ahmedabad, Bimal Patel moved to Berkeley to study at the College of Environmental Design, CED. He graduated with M.Arch. and M.C.P. degrees in 1988 and a Ph.D. from the Department of City and Regional Planning in 1995. He worked closely with Prof. Allan Jacobs, Prof. Donlyn Lyndon, Prof. Manuel Castells and Prof. Mike Teitz at the CED and Prof. Richard Walker of the Geography Department. UC Berkeley and the openness of CED provided him with the opportunity and freedom for intellectual exploration beyond the confines of Architecture and City Planning.\n\nWhile still working on his Ph.D. dissertation, Bimal Patel returned to India in 1990 and joined his father’s architectural practice. One of his first building design projects, a campus for The Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Ahmedabad, won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1992. In 2000 he was selected to build the New Campus for the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. Over the years he has built up a significant body of architectural and urban design work ranging from single family homes, to institutions, industrial buildings and urban redevelopment projects.

Hazzard is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Wakehurst for the Liberal Party since 1991.\n\nHazzard has previously served as the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure and the Minister Assisting the Premier on Infrastructure NSW in the O'Farrell government between 2011 and 2014; as the Attorney General of New South Wales and the Minister for Justice between 2014 and 2015 in the first Baird ministry; and as the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Social Housing between April 2015 and January 2017 in the second Baird government.\n\nHazzard was educated at Manly Boys' High School (now Manly Selective Campus), Macquarie University where he gained a Bachelor of Arts (Science) and a Diploma of Education, the University of New South Wales where he graduated Bachelor of Laws, and the University of Sydney where he graduated Master of Laws. Hazzard was then employed as a science teacher (1974-1977) before being admitted as a solicitor in 1977. He was a partner in a Manly law firm from 1981 to 1996.\n\nIn 1983, Hazzard joined the Liberal Party and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming regional president and a member of the state executive from 1985 to 1986. Hazzard was pre-selected as Liberal Party candidate for Wakehurst in April 1991, ahead of the sitting Liberal Party member John Booth. He was elected to NSW Legislative Assembly in 1991 and sat in the backbench during the Greiner and Fahey governments.\n\nHazzard played a role in the 'Metherell affair', involving the neighbouring Member for Davidson, Terry Metherell, who upon his resignation from the Liberal Party had expressed to Hazzard his interest in one of the Directorships at the new Environmental Protection Authority. Hazzard discussed this with Premier Greiner and the Minister for the Environment, Tim Moore, at Greiner's residence in February 1992. Greiner and Hazzard then discussed the matter with Metherell while in Parliament ten days later. The government subsequently created the job for Metherell, which he accepted, effectively engineering a vacancy in a seat that the Liberal Party would recover at a by-election. At the May 1992 by-election the Labor Party did not nominate a candidate, and a field of Independents and minor parties reduced the Liberal vote by 16 points (14 points after preferences), nevertheless won by Liberal candidate Andrew Humpherson.\n\nAfter the Labor party won the 1995 election, Hazzard was appointed to the Opposition frontbench and held various shadow portfolios. Under Opposition Leader Peter Collins, Hazzard was Shadow Minister for Corrective and Emergency Services (1995–96), Environment (1996-1997), Aboriginal Affairs (1996-2007), and Sport and Recreation (1997–99) Under Kerry Chikarovski he was Shadow Minister for Housing (1999-2000), Corrective Services (1999-2000), Disability Services and Ageing (2000–03), and Community Services (2000–03). Under John Brogden he was Shadow Minister for Energy and Utilities (2003–05), Science and Medical Research (2003–05), Youth (2005), and Community Services (2005).\n\nUnder Peter Debnam and Barry O'Farrell he was Shadow Minister for Education (2005–07) and was made Shadow Minister for Redfern Waterloo (2007–08). He was also appointed Shadow Minister for Planning (2008–11) and Shadow Minister for Infrastructure (2008–11). Between 2007 and 2011 Hazzard criticised the State Labor Government's move to take planning powers away from Local government and handing them to government-appointed planning panels and their attitudes towards development of heritage areas.\n\nIn April 2011 Hazzard was appointed Minister for Planning and Infrastructure and Minister Assisting the Premier on Infrastructure NSW. He also served as Leader of the Legislative Assembly from April 2011 to April 2014.\n\nDue to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, in April 2014 Hazzard was sworn in as the Attorney General and as the Minister for Justice; and lost the portfolio of Planning and Infrastructure. In April 2015, following the 2015 state election, Hazzard was sworn in as the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Social Housing in the second Baird ministry.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed with Hazzard sworn in as the Minister for Health and the Minister for Medical Research with effect from 30 January 2017.\n\nHazzard has two adult sons.\n\n"}

{"id": "2012209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012209", "title": "Cognitive apprenticeship", "text": "Cognitive apprenticeship\n\nCognitive apprenticeship is a theory that emphasizes the importance of the process in which a master of a skill teaches that skill to an apprentice.\n\nConstructivist approaches to human learning have led to the development of the theory of cognitive apprenticeship. This theory accounts for the problem that masters of a skill often fail to take into account the implicit processes involved in carrying out complex skills when they are teaching novices. To combat these tendencies, cognitive apprenticeships \"…are designed, among other things, to bring these tacit processes into the open, where students can observe, enact, and practice them with help from the teacher…\". This model is supported by Albert Bandura's (1997) theory of modeling, which posits that in order for modeling to be successful, the learner must be attentive, access and retain the information presented, be motivated to learn, and be able to accurately reproduce the desired skill.\n\nPart of the effectiveness of the cognitive apprenticeship model comes from learning in context and is based on theories of situated cognition. Cognitive scientists maintain that the context in which learning takes place is critical (e.g., Godden & Baddeley, 1975). Based on findings such as these, Collins, Duguid, and Brown (1989) argue that cognitive apprenticeships are less effective when skills and concepts are taught independently of their real-world context and situation. As they state, \"Situations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity. Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated\". In cognitive apprenticeships, teachers model their skills in real-world situations.\n\nBy modelling and coaching, masters in cognitive apprenticeships also support the three stages of skill acquisition described in the expertise literature: the cognitive stage, the associative stage, and the stage. In the cognitive stage, learners develop a declarative understanding of the skill. In the associative stage, mistakes and misinterpretations learned in the cognitive stage are detected and eliminated, while associations between the critical elements involved in the skill are strengthened. Finally, in the autonomous stage, the learner's skill becomes honed and perfected until it is executed at an expert level.\n\nLike traditional apprenticeships, in which the apprentice learns a trade such as tailoring or woodworking by working under a master teacher, cognitive apprenticeships allow masters to model behaviors in a real-world context with cognitive modeling. After listening to the master explain exactly what they are doing and thinking as they model the skill, the apprentice identifies relevant behaviors and develops a conceptual model of the processes involved. The apprentice then attempts to imitate those behaviors as the master observes and coaches. Coaching provides assistance at the most critical level– the skill level just beyond what the learner/apprentice could accomplish by themself. Vygotsky (1978) referred to this as the Zone of Proximal Development and believed that fostering development within this zone would lead to the most rapid development. The coaching process includes providing additional modeling as necessary, giving corrective feedback, and giving reminders, which all intend to bring the apprentice's performance closer to that of the master's. As the apprentice becomes more skilled through the repetition of this process, the feedback and instruction provided by the master \"fades\" until the apprentice is, ideally, performing the skill at a close approximation of the master level.\n\n[This entry is an excerpt from R. Shawn Edmondson's doctoral dissertation, entitled Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Telepresence-Enabled Cognitive Apprenticeship Model of Teacher Professional Development (2006).]\n\nCollins, Brown, and Newman developed six teaching methods rooted in cognitive apprenticeship theory and claim these methods help students attain cognitive and metacognitive strategies for \"using, managing, and discovering knowledge\". The first three, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, are at the core of cognitive apprenticeship and help with cognitive and metacognitive development. The next two, articulation and reflection, are designed to help novices with awareness of problem-solving strategies and execution similar to that of an expert. The final step, exploration, intends to guide the novice towards independence and the ability to solve and identify problems within the domain on their own. The authors note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list of methods and that the successful execution of these methods is highly dependent on the domain.\n\nModeling is when an expert, usually a teacher, within the cognitive domain or subject area demonstrates a task explicitly so that novices, usually a student, can experience and build a conceptual model of the task at hand. For example, a math teacher might write out explicit steps and work through a problem aloud, demonstrating their heuristics and procedural knowledge. Modeling includes demonstrating expert performances or processes in the world.\n\nCoaching involves observing a novice's task performance and offering feedback and hints to sculpt the novice's performance to that of an expert's. The expert oversees the novice's tasks and may structure the task accordingly to assist the novice's development.\n\nInstructional scaffolding is the act of applying strategies and methods to support the student's learning. These supports could be teaching manipulatives, activities, or group work. The teacher may have to execute parts of the task that the student is not yet able to do. This requires the teacher to have the skill to analyze and assess students' abilities in the moment.\n\nArticulation includes \"any method of getting students to articulate their knowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving process in a domain\" (p. 482). Three types of articulation are inquiry teaching, thinking aloud, and critical student role. Through inquiry teaching (Collins & Stevens, 1982), teachers ask students a series of questions that allow them to refine and restate their learned knowledge and form explicit conceptual models. Thinking aloud requires students to articulate their thoughts while solving problems. Students assuming a critical role monitor others in cooperative activities and draw conclusions based on the problem-solving activities. Articulation is described by McLellan as consisting of two aspects: separating component knowledge from skills to learn more effectively, and more commonly verbalizing or demonstrating knowledge and thinking processes in order to expose and clarify ideas.\n\nReflection allows students to \"compare their own problem-solving processes with those of an expert, another student, and ultimately, an internal cognitive model of expertise\" (p. 483). A technique for reflection would be examining the past performances of both an expert and a novice, and highlighting similarities and differences. The goal of reflection is for students to look back and analyze their performances with desire to understand and improve the behavior of an expert.\n\nExploration involves giving students room to problem solve on their own and teaching students exploration strategies. The former requires the teacher to slowly withdraw the use of supports and scaffolds not only in problem solving methods, but problem setting methods as well. The latter requires the teacher to show students how to explore, research, and develop hypotheses. Exploration allows the student to frame interesting problems within the domain for themselves and then take the initiative to solve these problems.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Colegio Tarbut finished building a new secondary school in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Núñez, which opened in 2016.\n\nColegio Tarbut is named after the Tarbut movement of humanistic Jewish education and has much in common with that movement's curricular philosophy. The school offers a trilingual education in which Hebrew, English, and Spanish are taught.\n\nThe focus on academics has ensured that the majority of the graduated students pursue university studies. The school offers their pupils the opportunity to obtain the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP) of the International Baccalaureate foundation, the PET (Preliminary English Test) examination and the IGCSE examination, both from Cambridge University.\n\nIn tenth grade, in secondary school, you can choose an orientation in order to give an IGCSE examination on that subject. The orientations include Visual Arts, Business Studies, Social Studies and since 2015, Science.\n\nDuring the last months of the school year, usually October or November, an annual Yom Sport (Hebrew for \"Sports Day\") is held in which students compete in individual (sprinting, shot put, and long and high jump) and group sports (association football and handball). Students are divided into four teams, namely red, green, yellow and blue, and stay in the same team every year. Competitions in the group disciplines are done according to the teams. Athletics records are kept between years.\n\nSome weeks after the Yom Sport another event is held in which winners in the individual events are announced and team rankings are published. Team rankings are computed according to the performance of the team members in the individual and group disciplines.\n\nDuring the Jewish High Holy Days the school holds religious services usually attended by current students, their families, and former alumni. \n\n"}

He was born in Valeggio sul Mincio into a family of landowners. On 7 November 1818 he married Teresa Zovetto with whom he had five children, two of whom became famous: the operatic soprano Antonietta Foroni-Conti (1822-187?) and the composer and conductor Jacopo Foroni (1825–1858). In 1818 he was appointed to the dual position of director and principal conductor of the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona, a position he held for over 25 years. He was also highly active as a teacher of singing and music composition in that city. Among his notable pupils were Gottardo Aldighieri, Paolo Bombardi, Domenico Conti, Carlo Pedrotti, Alessandro Sala, Maria Spezia-Aldighieri, and his children. Most of his compositional output was sacred music, the majority of which was written for services at the Verona Cathedral. Most of his music is now lost, but copies of his \"Miserere\" and \"Messe\" still exist\n\nIn 1848 Foroni participated actively in the First Italian War of Independence as a member of the secret committee of Veronese patriots. On three occasions he provided the Piedmontese minister of war a detailed plan for the taking the city of Verona, but the negligence and incompetence of Charles Albert of Sardinia's generals and other staff members led to their failure on acting upon the intelligence he provided. Ultimately the first war of independence ended in a stalemate. He died in Verona in 1853.\n\n"}

An EDUindex Gap Analysis provides missing, relevant curriculum relative to employment opportunity within a representative area. Representative areas may include geographic regions, states, cities, school districts or specific schools. Analysis is regularly conducted using zip code sets.\n\nIn 1918, John Franklin Bobbitt said that curriculum, as an idea, has its roots in the Latin word for horse race-course, explaining the curriculum as the course of deeds and experiences through which children become the adults they should be, for success in adult society. \nEDUindex, Inc. developed the EDUindex to identify and promote relevance in education.\n\nThe EDUindex is a correlation of curricular subjects taught in a particular school to skills as suggested by a pre-defined or custom selected target marketplace. Published class offerings represent the skills taught. The Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) provides a general inventory of courses taught nationwide in the secondary school level (grades 9 through 12). Further detail is provided by High School Transcript Studies provided by the National Center for Education Statistics. Public, Charter, and Private School listings are accessed per geographical area to create a comprehensive data set of all schools and businesses within the analytical focus. Curriculum per School, District, etc. is published individually and is publicly available.\n\nStandard databases like the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) provide defined business focus. Business focus can be further refined into specific occupations and skill sets using Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC). Together these datasets provide information representing the skills offered and the occupational opportunities available within the designated target area.\n\nThe EDUindex, as a value, is expressed as a number from 0 to 1.0 with 1.0 representing a perfect match of curricular offering to target need. The value is determined using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (sometimes referred to as the PMCC, and typically denoted by r) as a measure of the correlation (linear dependence) between two variables X and Y, giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive. It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the strength of linear dependence between two variables. It was developed by Karl Pearson from a similar but slightly different idea introduced by Francis Galton in the 1880s. The general correlation coefficient is sometimes called \"Pearson's r.\" The EDUindex calculates Pearson’s r for educational relevance by comparing the content of course offerings with the need for related skill sets within the same banded geographic area. Correlative results are weighted based on data volume for Scalar, comparative and presentation purposes.\n\n"}

On 10 April 2009 Moody's downgraded Houghton Mifflin Harcourt down to Caa3 from Caa1. In August 2009, EMPG announced that it had substantially reduced its debt, relaxed covenants and received incremental working capital facilities. Prior to March 2010, EMPG owned the legacy Riverdeep and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt businesses, which it acquired in 2006 and 2007, respectively.\n\nOn 22 December 2006, it was announced that Riverdeep PLC had completed its acquisition of Houghton Mifflin. The new joint enterprise would be called the Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group plc, a company based in Ireland. Riverdeep paid $1.75 billion in cash for the equity owned the private investment firms Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital and The Blackstone Group and assumed $1.61 billion in debt.

The expanded company would become Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The holding company structure of Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep plc was re-organised with a new holding company based in the Cayman Islands. This company was called Education Media and Publishing Group, EMPG for short.\n\nAt the time of the formation of HMH Lucki said \"Together, we will be better positioned to meet the changing needs of educators and students in a wider range of subjects, states and school districts\".\n\nOn 27 November 2008, President Jeremy Dickens told the New York Times that the company had $7bn of debt, which cost the company $500m per annum to service. The money to fund the 2006 Houghton Mifflin and 2007 Reed Elsevier acquisitions was borrowed, and in retrospect Education Media and Publishing Group (Riverdeep) probably overpaid for both companies.\n\nIn May 2008, Cengage Learning (formerly Thomson Learning) acquired the assets of the Houghton Mifflin College Division for $750 million.\n\nThe combined business was led by Tony Lucki, who had more than thirty years of publishing experience, until his replacement in April 2009 by Barry O'Callaghan.\n\nIn January 2009 the two big credit rating services, Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's, reduced the rating of EMPG and warned that default on its debt was increasingly likely. On 10 April 2009 Moody's downgraded Houghton Mifflin Harcourt down to Caa3 from Caa1.\n\nIn January 2009, Reed Elsevier dropped its valuation of their 11.8% stake in EMPG to just €15m. This values the group at around 5% of its original claimed worth, leaving Chairman Barry O'Callaghan with few options now that S&P rates the group CCC.\n\nOn 27 July 2009, the Irish Independent newspaper reported that was in the process of a re-structuring negotiations with its unsecured-debt holders that would lead to the conversion of the debt into equity. The news story reported that the unsecured debt holders would receive a 45% equity stake. Dubai's royal family to buy up stake in EMPG. The article estimates that post deal, EMPG would cut its debt from $7.3bn to $6.1bn. On 15 August 2009, the Financial Times newspaper reported in an interview with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's CEO, Barry O'Callaghan, that the refinancing had received approval of more than 90% of lenders. The terms included the holding company debt converting into 45% of the fully diluted common equity, an effective 25 per cent relaxation of financial covenants, second lien lenders agreeing to convert their holdings into a PIK instrument, reducing annual interest costs by $100m, and a further $50m increase its working capital facility. Following the announcement of the debt restructuring, the President of EMPG, Jeremy Dickens, previously a lawyer at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, stepped down as President of EMPG.\n\nOn 12 September 2009, the Irish Independent newspaper reported that a circular was posted to shareholders of EMPG with details of the restructuring, including an update on financial performance and a new management incentive plan. In the article it stated that EMPG's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 18pc in 2008 to $750m. Although the article indicated that the outlook for 2009 is uncertain, it highlights that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has won a 52% market share in all new adoptions in the first half of 2009.\n\nOn 13 January 2010, Irish politician, George Lee, the opposition party, Fine Gael's TD for Dublin South, told journalists that EMPG has failed with equity investors likely to be wipe-out and the Irish taxpayer was exposed since the nationalised bank, Anglo Irish Bank has lent money to the shareholders of EMPG.\n\nCommented Lee\nEMPG confirmed that it was in advanced negotiations with its lenders about a comprehensive restructuring, that could see a 70% reduction in the current debt levels that would lead to Paulson & Co., a hedge fund, becoming the largest shareholder. According to the Financial Times, second lien investors had not yet approved the plan which would see half of the $5bn of first-lien debt convert into circa 90% of the equity of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, with the remaining equity for the $2bn second lien investors and the old EMPG shareholders. The Financial Times story indicated that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt was considering a pre-packaged bankruptcy if the negotiations with lenders were not approved.\n\nAccording to the Irish Times, investors of Davy Stockbrokers had $475m of equity in EMPG. In contrast to the statement of George Lee that Irish taxpayers were exposed, an Anglo Irish Bank spokesperson was reported by the Irish Times to state that it did not have a “big exposure” to EMPG. However, the spokesperson did not comment on whether it has exposure to individuals that have exposure to EMPG.\n\nInterviewed on Irish State broadcaster, RTÉ, Barry O'Callaghan, Chairman on EMPG and CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, confirmed that Irish investors as well as he himself were facing huge losses. He stated that \"no-one has lost more than me\". According to the Irish Independent, Barry O'Callaghan is a large personal customer of Anglo Irish Bank. The article stated that Barry O'Callaghan may be forced to step down once the restructuring package was agreed. This contrasted with his interview with the Financial Times where he insisted that he would continue to run the business.\n\nOn 22 February 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that EMPG and HMH had reached an agreement to restructure the finances of the company and recapitalise its balance sheet with a substantial fresh cash investment by institutional investors.\n\nThe agreement, supported by 100% of HMH's creditors, closed on 9 March 2010. Highlights of the agreement included a reduction in the senior debt to $3 billion from the current $5 billion, with new equity issued to the senior debt holders (including Paulson & Co., Guggenheim Partners), conversion of the $2 billion mezzanine debt into equity and warrant, receipt of $650m of new cash from the sale of new equity. In addition to the key highlights, HMH formed a new $100m Innovation Fund to invest in the next generation of technology for the education industry.\n\nAccording to the Irish Times the investments by the current equity holders of EMPG, including HMH's CEO, Barry O'Callaghan, private clients of Davy Stockbrokers, Reed Elsevier, Istithmar and others, would see their investment of over $3.5 billion written down to zero. Following the restructuring, the investors of EMPG retained a nominal investment in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt via warrants over 5% of the company if it exceeded the $10 billion valuation placed on the company at the time of the merger between Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep and Harcourt. In addition to the warrants in HMH, the EMPG shareholders continue to own a stake in the international investment vehicle, EMPGI which has stakes in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nAfter the recapitalization, both the CEO, Barry O'Callaghan and the CFO, Michael Muldowney, remained in their roles. A new nine-member board was created with the CEO the only executive representative, one independent, two representative of Paulson & Co., and one director from each of Apollo Management, BlackRock, Guggenheim Partners, Fidelity Investments, and Avenue Capital.\n\nOn 10 March 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it had completed its re-capitalization. In addition to a new investment of $650 million of equity, the debt levels of the company were reduced by approximately 60% and the annual interest payments by over 75%. According to the Irish State Broadcaster, RTÉ, the old equity investors based in Ireland has lost all their investment. The Irish Independent reported that the old shareholders were denied a shareholders meeting to vote on discuss the restructuring. The former shareholders have been left with warrants over 5% of the company, in the case its value recovers to previous levels.\n\nThe now named Houghton Mifflin Harcourt alongside Pearson Education and McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. are the leading publishers in the global education market.\n"}

Kuwait was ranked 63rd on the Human Development Index (HDI) report for 2011 by UNDP, placing Kuwait above the regional average. The education system in Kuwait has celebrated several achievements; in the year ending 2006, thirteen percent of all public expenditure was given to education, comparable to many OECD countries, although lower than other Arab nations. As a percentage of GDP, at 3.9 percent, it remains well below the OECD average.\n\nIn 2005, the literacy rate of Kuwait was 94 percent.\nKuwait is striving to improve the quality of its education at all levels and for all ages. The Ministry of Education is also making efforts to incorporate women into the educated workforce through various programs; for instance, the 1989 initiative to establish daytime literacy clinics for women.\nThe Kuwaiti government offers scholarships to students who are accepted in universities in the United States, the United Kingdom and other foreign academic institutions.\n\nKuwait is a small country situated in the Persian Gulf. It is one of the high-income countries with a GDP per capita of above $24,000. Oil exports account for nearly half of Kuwait’s national income and about 80% of government revenues. Between 1975 and 1985, the proportion of all working nationals employed in the public sector, including oil, rose from 76 percent to 92 percent. The government of Kuwait is now looking for alternative ways to stimulate employment and the generation of income. With this in mind, it is keen to diversify and improve the skills of its labor force; hence the high priority given to the reform of education at all levels.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there was no formal educational system in place in Kuwait at all. There were a few Quranic schools, known as Al-Katatib, funded by the wealthy private citizens of Kuwait, that taught reading, writing and basic arithmetric. In 1911, the Al Mubarakiyya School was established as one of Kuwait’s modern educational institutions. It was founded by merchants to train their clerks in commerce, arithmetic and letter-writing skills. In 1921, the Al-Ahmedia school was established, which offered English courses, and soon thereafter, an all-girls school was founded that provided education in Arabic, home economics and Islamic Studies. The government became involved in providing formal education in 1936, and by 1945 there were 17 schools in Kuwait. With the increase in oil production and hence state revenues after World War II, the government began investing huge sums of money into social services, including education. By 1960, there were 45,000 students enrolled in Kuwait's educational system, including 18,000 girls.\n\nIn 1965, following the constitution that made education a fundamental right of a citizen, education was made compulsory for children aged between 6 and 14. Since the early 21st century, the Ministry of Education has sought to prepare a general, long-term education strategy, focusing on educational teaching for the years up to 2025. This effort aims to align teaching methodologies with the current needs of an increasingly globalised world. The World Bank is conducting an analytical study to explore the various policy options needed to implement this new strategy.\n\nA National Conference for the Development of Education was held in Kuwait in February 2008, in order to discuss this national strategy further. Other multilateral organizations, such as the OECD, are working towards improving the business environment in Kuwait and providing training for women to promote female entrepreneurship within the country.\n\nThe population of Kuwait has grown rapidly in recent times, more than doubling between 1985 and 2005. Kuwaitis now make up about a third of the country’s population, expatriates the rest. The school-aged population of both Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis represented 24 percent of the total population in 2005. There were 716,000 people aged between 4 and 21 years old in Kuwait that year, of which 426,000 were Kuwaitis (representing 60 percent) and about 290,000, non–Kuwaitis. There are more males than females in every age group of the school-age population. The proportion of non-Kuwaitis is slightly higher among the 18- to 21-year-olds.\n\nIn 2007, the female enrollment at primary and secondary level was 97 and 91 percent respectively, and for males, the corresponding figures were 99 and 90 percent. At the same time, a burgeoning young population is posing a burden on the job market, with rising numbers of young people unemployed. \"The Government is looking at wider economic reform, including moving some of the 95 per cent of Kuwaitis who work in the state sector to the private sector\", in order to increase job opportunities for the new entrants.\n\nThe general education system consists of four levels: kindergarten, or nursery (lasting for 2 years), primary (lasting for 5 years), intermediate (lasting for 4 years) and secondary (lasting for 3 years). Schooling at primary and intermediate level is compulsory for all students aged 6 – 14. All the levels of state education, including higher education, are free. There are two main ministries involved in the development of the education sector: the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher of Education.\nThere are about 1,145 schools in Kuwait, at all levels from kindergarten to secondary (2006 figures). Out of this total, 664 are public and 481 are private schools. There are 6 districts in Kuwait.\n\nTwo-thirds of all students (from kindergarten to secondary) were in public schools during the year ending 2006. Most Kuwaitis study in public schools, typically with Arabic curriculum. The private schools are split about equally between Arabic medium schools, which follow Kuwait’s national curriculum, and foreign language schools, which follow other curricula (e.g., American, British, French and Indian). There are currently 591,359 students enrolled in Kuwait's schools which makes up approximately 20 percent of the entire population.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006 there was a substantial increase in the growth of teachers, compared to the growth in students, especially at the primary level. In the year ending 2006 there was an increase of 21 percent in primary school teachers despite a decrease in student enrollments. A large proportion of public school teachers are Kuwaiti females, particularly at the primary level. Only 4 percent of women teachers are older than 45 years, compared to 35 percent of non-Kuwaiti males.\n\nschool aims at rehabilitating students scientifically and educationally, during the scholastic year, through remedying all learning difficulties using individual and group learning and then they can go back to their schools to continue their normal learning and educational studies with their peers at school within the frame of achieving the integrated and comprehensive growth of the student’s personality.\nAL- Sadeem school for Special education and Learning disability’ award form Inclusion Quality Mark IQM] for its outstanding practice across each of the following areas:\n\nElement 1 The Inclusion Values and Practice of the School\n\nElement 2 The Learning Environment, Resources and ICT\n\nElement 3 Learner Attitudes, Values and Personal Development\n\nElement 4 Learner Progress and the Impact on Learning\n\nElement 5 Learning and Teaching\n\nElement 6 Parents, Careers and Guardians\n\nElement 7 Governing Body and Management External Accountability/Support\n\nElement 8 The School in the Community\n\nAL- Sadeem school for Special education and Learning disability’ member of NESCO Associated Schools Network\n\nIn Kuwait, schooling usually begins at age six. Pre-school or nursery education is also available to children from four to six years old. Under a new system, primary education will begin at age 5 years.\n\nThere is the option of attending one of the private schools, which have foreign sponsors and mostly offer co-education, whereas the Kuwaiti public schools are segregated by gender starting at the primary levels. Examples of private foreign schools in Kuwait are the British School of Kuwait (BSK), Bayan Bilingual School, the American School of Kuwait, the New English School (Kuwait), the American International School of Kuwait, the Kuwait English School, the French School and the Canadian School of Kuwait (CSK). Private schools are not subsidised by the state. In 2007, the primary gross enrollment rate was 98.5 percent. The gender parity index, which is the ratio of female enrollment to male enrollment, was 0.98. This shows parity in gender for the enrollment at primary level. The percentage of Kuwaitis studying in private schools in kindergarten is 20 percent.\n\nThe Kuwaiti government puts about KD5.6 million per annum into private educational facilities, in addition to allocating land for school construction and paying for the distribution of books. The Kuwait government also ensures that each school is equipped with a library. The government has focused on expanding the collection of books from 230,000 to 3 million today. The government is also promoting the use of information technology at school level. The launch of the 'Education Net' project is a manifestation of that, as it connects every government school and library in Kuwait to a telecommunications data network.\n\nStudents are required to spend 4 years at the intermediate level, up to grade 9, after which they move on to the secondary level. Secondary education is for 3 years, after which students can adopt the higher education track by entering university or gaining admission into a vocational college to study for technical or vocational qualifications. The secondary education system is now being standardized from the present academic and credit system to a single system. The application of this new organization started during the academic year 2006/07. \n\nEnrollment rates at the secondary level have been rising since the year 2000, except for the period 2005/06, when the system changed from 4-4–4 years at each education level to 5-4–3 years, thus distorting the figures. The gender parity index of the secondary level gross enrollment rate in 2007 was 0.98, reflecting parity in gender at the secondary level. Now the focus of the Ministry of Education will be on improving the quality of the education system. Girls outperform boys in every subject of the 12th grade examinations, particularly in philosophy, English, Arabic languages, chemistry, physics, mathematics and biology. International indicators such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study are not very encouraging. Special attention is being given to reducing repetition and dropout rates.\n\nThe Ministry of Education in Kuwait is also trying to foster the use of information technology (ICT) in schools by including e-learning in the curriculum. For fourteen-year-olds in 2006, there were 13 students per computer on average in Kuwait's public schools. This is very similar to the OECD average, back in 2000, for 15-year-olds. Despite the availability of computers in schools and at home, there is no guarantee that computers will be used solely for learning, however, and the government may need to rethink the strategy of making technology accessible to a large number of students, whilst developing a curriculum that incorporates e-learning in most of the subjects.\n\nThe Ministry of Education in Kuwait is making efforts to provide equal educational opportunities by opening special needs institutes. In total there are 44 special needs schools out of which 33 are public schools and 11 are private schools. Some of the special needs children are also enrolled in special needs classes offered in general schools.\n\nPost-secondary education comprises technical and vocational courses offered by the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET), a state institution, and degree programs offered by Kuwait University, and 14 private universities .\n\nThe Government of Kuwait is encouraging its citizens to opt for vocational training programs to fulfill the demand for a skilled workforce. Students enrolling for vocational training at PAAET can join programs after primary, intermediate or secondary school, although the majority of students, about 70 percent, are enrolled having completed secondary level education. In 2005/06 there were 12,285 students enrolled in after-secondary training courses, of which 62 percent were female. The total number of students in vocational training at PAAET increased by 8 percent from the previous year, to 17,459 students. The male enrollment decreased by 10 percent whereas the female enrollment increased by 42 percent. This substantial increase was due to the introduction of new vocational programs in line with the demands of the female students .\n\nPost-secondary education include courses at a PAAET technical college lasting for two and a half years, following which the students receive a certificate that is less than a tertiary diploma, but does allow the graduates to enter the workforce.\n\nThere are four state-supported higher education institutions in Kuwait.\n\nIn the academic year 2005/06, the total enrollment within these institutions reached 27,308, an increase of 7 percent from the previous year. The proportion of females in the undergraduate studies is 70 percent. The gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education in both private and public institutions in 2006 was about 18 percent; the male gross enrollment ratio was 11 percent, a slight increase from the previous year, and for females it was 26 percent, a three percentage points decrease from the previous year.\n\nKuwait University was established in 1966. It is a co-educational institution and comprises five campuses in Kuwait City. Since its inception, the number of students has increased considerably, from 400 at its inception to 19,711 in 2005/06. It offers a wide range of academic courses.\n\nThe Public Authority for Applied Education and Training was established in 1982 to fill the need for a vocational and technical training institution. PAAET has two missions: PAAET is responsible for providing and developing the skills of the national labor force to meet the demands of a developing nation, and it provides training to students to have careers beyond the oil industry. The College of Basic Education in PAAET, with an enrollment of 7,132, enjoyed an increase of 26 percent from the previous year.\n\nThere are also a number of private post-secondary institutions in Kuwait that are accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education - Private Universities Council:\n\nA total of 20,537 undergraduate & post-graduate students were enrolled in the above private universities as per the first semester of academic year 2012-2013.\n"}

His work also influenced Lowell Mason, whose work with Woodbridge eventually led to music education being introduced into the public schools of Boston.\n\nLittle is known of Ives' early life. He was born to Elam Ives, Sr., and Sarah Hitchcock Ives in Hamden, Connecticut, on 7 January 1802. He married Louisa Todd of Hamden on 15 April 1822, at which time he was already working as a singing teacher and choir director. He later moved to New Haven and then to Hartford sometime before 19 October 1827, when he was hired by the Christ Church there to teach music.\n\nIves worked with a friend and fellow musician, Deodatus Dutton, on a collection of hymn tunes called \"American Psalmody\" which also contained singing instructions by Ives.\n\nIn 1829, a fellow citizen of Hartford, William Channing Woodbridge, returned from Europe, where he had been studying methods of education, and where he had spent time with Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg, Michael Traugott Pfeiffer, and Hans Georg Nägeli. Upon returning to the United States, he wanted to use the methods he had seen in Europe to improve music teaching. He was friends with Dutton, who placed him in contact with Ives. Woodbridge provided Ives with books and materials by Nägeli, Pfeiffer, and Georg Friedrich Kübler, who then translated them with the help of Dutton and a Mr. Taylor from Andover.\n\nWoodbridge by this time had become associated with Lowell Mason, a music teacher in Boston. He sent Mason to Hartford to work with Ives on the method. According to Ives, both had concerns about the method, but chose to proceed. After studying the Swiss works, and incorporating them into his teaching method, Ives put together an experimental choir of about 70 children during the summer of 1830. The choir evidently sang very well and word of its success was spread by Woodbridge to Boston and elsewhere.\n\nDuring this same summer, Ives was working on a revision of the instruction portion of \"American Psalmody\" that would reflect the Pestalozzian-based ideas promoted by Woodbridge. He also began work on \"The American Elementary Singing Book\" that same year. Additionally, he began working with Mason on \"Juvenile Lyre\", a collection of three-part children's songs, published in 1831. This collection consisted primarily of arrangements of songs by Nägeli and Pfeiffer, with some original compositions. There has been some debate over who wrote what in \"Juvenile Lyre\"; it appears that the Preface and final song, \"Suffer Little Children to Come unto Me\", are definitely by Mason, while many of the arrangements were done by Ives with versification of the German texts by Dutton. Other songs were originals by one of the composers, several with texts by Sarah Josepha Hale.\n\nIves left Hartford for Philadelphia late in 1830, where he established the Philadelphia Musical Seminary. There, he taught violin, pianoforte, and singing. He also continued writing singing manuals and collections music, including materials for the American Sunday School Union. He also made a major revision of \"American Psalmody\", removing most of the Pestalozzian elements introduced in the second edition.\n\nIves moved from Philadelphia to New York in 1836, where he started another musical academy. He continued publishing music collections with appended instruction manuals and an entire series intended specifically to help students learn to read music and sing. While in New York, Ives spent some time writing essays and periodical articles. He edited \"The Musical Review\" during its one year run in 1838-39. He also wrote four articles for \"The Harbinger\", a transcendentalist journal, beginning in 1847. Most of this writing concerned musical events, music educators, and music education materials.\n\nIn both Philadelphia and New York, Ives wrote parlor songs, though he was not a remarkable composer. Their difficulty and complexity do seem to indicate the quality of singers and pianists he was producing in his academies, though.\n\nIves moved to Trenton, New Jersey, sometime before 1857. He lived there with his second wife, Lucy, and daughter, Ella. As in Philadelphia and New York, Ives established an academy of music. \n\nAt some point, Ives returned to his hometown of Hamden, Connecticut. He died there of apoplexy on 10 February 1864.\n"}

{"id": "6213952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6213952", "title": "Flying University", "text": "Flying University\n\nFlying University (, less often translated as \"Floating University\") was an underground educational enterprise that operated from 1885 to 1905 in Warsaw, the historic Polish capital, then under the control of the Russian Empire, and that was revived between 1977 and 1981 in the People's Republic of Poland. The purpose of this and similar institutions was to provide Polish youth with an opportunity for an education within the framework of traditional Polish scholarship, when that collided with the ideology of the governing authorities. In the 19th century, such underground institutions were important in the national effort to resist Germanization under Prussian and Russification under Russian occupation. In the communist People's Republic of Poland, the Flying University provided educational opportunities outside government censorship and control of education.\n\nAfter the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was partitioned in the late-18th century, its lands were divided among its neighbors: Imperial Russia, Prussia and Austro-Hungary. Warsaw, the historic Polish capital, fell under Russian control. In the Russian and Prussian partitions the situation of Poles progressively worsened. Particularly in the Russian sector, the initially moderate ethnic policies were revised in the aftermath of the Polish revolts aimed at overthrowing Russian control, the November Uprising (1830–1831) and the January Uprising (1863–1864). Following the defeats of the uprising the autonomy of the Congress Poland was initially limited (1831) and finally abolished (1865).\n\nAmong the increasing policies of Germanization and Russification, it became increasingly difficult for Poles to obtain a Polish higher education. Also, like in most parts of Europe at the time, the higher education opportunities for women that existed in the Russian Empire were severely limited, and teaching or research into some fields, like Polish language, Catholicism or Polish history, ranged from difficult to illegal.\n\nAs a response to such policies, and inspired by the Polish positivism movement, secret courses began in 1882 in private houses in Warsaw. At first it was a series of conspiratorial education courses for women, and among the first teachers were Józef Siemaszko, Stanisław Norblin, Piotr Chmielowski and Władysław Smoleński. In 1885 transformed due to the efforts of one of the students, Jadwiga Szczawińska (also known as Zofia Szczawińska), the various pro-education groups were united into a single, informal, and illegal, secret university open for both sexes known as the Flying University (the courses, spread throughout the city, often changed locations to prevent the Russian authorities from learning the location and arresting the teachers and students). The fees (2–4 rubles per month) were used as gratification for the teachers, and to create a secret library. The curriculum of the Flying University covered 5–6 years with 8–11 hours per week and was divided into four main subjects: social sciences, pedagogy, philology and history, and natural sciences.\n\nAmong the teachers of the university were the best contemporary Polish academics, such as Władysław Smoleński and Tadeusz Korzon (history), Bronisław Chlebowski, Ignacy Chrzanowski, Zofia Daszyńska-Golińska and Piotr Chmielowski (literature), Jan Władysław David and Adam Mahrburg (philosophy), Ludwik Krzywicki (sociology), Józef Nussbaum-Hilarowicz (biology).\n\nDuring the twenty years of the existence of the university, its courses were attended by approximately 5,000 women and thousands of men. Among the most famous of its students was the future Nobel Prize winner, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, more commonly known as Madame Curie. Other well known students included Zofia Nałkowska and Janusz Korczak.\n\nAround 1905–1906 the Flying University was able to start legal activities, and was transformed into the Society of Science Courses (\"Towarzystwo Kursów Naukowych\"), as Poland's partitioners, anticipating the coming war, sought to convert the Poles to their cause. Around 1918–1919, after Poland regained independence (as the Second Polish Republic), the Association was transformed into the private university, Free Polish University (Wolna Wszechnica Polska). In 1927 it founded a branch in Łódź.\n\nDuring the Second World War, when Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany which forbade Poles to attend university-level courses, many teachers of the Flying University used their experience and took part in secret teaching during World War II.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Wolna Wszechnica Polska was not immediately recreated in Warsaw, although its branch in Łódź served as the foundation for the University of Łódź.\n\nDuring the time of communist domination in the People's Republic of Poland, as the curriculum became a tool of politics, and much of Polish history (like the Polish-Soviet War, Katyn Massacre or Praga Massacre) was censored in an attempt to 'erase' the history of Polish-Russian conflicts, the tradition of the Flying University was revived once again, first by the Society of Free Polish University (Towarzystwo Wolnej Wszechnicy Polskiej) active in Warsaw from 1957, later from 1977 by the new Flying University and Society of Science Courses, supported by Polish dissidents: Stefan Amsterdamski, Andrzej Celiński, Bohdan Cywiński, Aldona Jawłowska, Jan Kielanowski, Andrzej Kijowski, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Wojciech Ostrowski.\n\nMany participants of this second flying university were abused by milicja, with common incidents like a prominent dissident, Jacek Kuroń, being thrown down the stairs or his apartment ransacked by milicja-supported thugs; despite such harassment the Flying University was active until the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981, which, although designed to destroy the Solidarity movement, stifled the flying university's activities too. With Solidarity's peaceful victory in the Polish legislative elections, 1989, the goals of the Flying University — the freeing of Polish education from party's control and censorship — have been achieved.\n\n"}

Following a supporting role in \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001), Garner gained recognition for her performance as CIA officer Sydney Bristow in the ABC spy-action thriller \"Alias\", which aired from 2001 to 2006. For her work on the series, she won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, and received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations.\n\nWhile working on \"Alias\", Garner gained a cameo role in \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), followed by a praised leading performance in the romantic comedy film \"13 Going on 30\" (2004). Garner has appeared in supporting as well as lead film roles, including the superhero films \"Daredevil\" (2003) and \"Elektra\" (2005), the comedy-drama \"Juno\" (2007), and the fantasy-comedy \"The Invention of Lying\" (2009). In the 2010s, she appeared in the romantic-comedy \"Valentine's Day\" (2010), the fantasy comedy-drama \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green\" (2012), the biographic drama \"Dallas Buyers Club\" (2013), the comedy film \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\" (2014), the drama film \"Miracles from Heaven\" (2016), and the romantic comedy-drama film \"Love, Simon\" (2018).\n\nGarner works frequently as an activist for early childhood education and is a board member of Save the Children. She is also an advocate for anti-paparazzi campaigns among children of celebrities. Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley from 1998 to 2003, during which they married. Garner married actor Ben Affleck in 2005; they separated in 2015 and divorced in 2018. Garner and Affleck have three children together.\n\nJennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972, in Houston, Texas, but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three. She is the second of three daughters. Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide, and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister. While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household, her father was \"very conservative\" and her mother \"quietly blue.\" She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School. As teenagers, she and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair; she has joked that her family's \"take on the world\" was \"practically Amish.\"\n\nGarner attended George Washington High School in Charleston; she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team. While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get \"straight As\" and instead wanted to perform \"in any kind of production.\" She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild, and took piano, singing and ballet lessons. In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, where she changed her major from chemistry to theater and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority. She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. In 1994 she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.\n\nAs a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues. She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992, the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993, and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994. Garner moved to New York City in 1995. During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of \"A Month in the Country\", starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham, and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries \"Zoya\". In 1996 she played an Amish woman in the television movie \"Harvest of Fire\" and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries \"Dead Man's Walk\". She appeared in the independent short film \"In Harm's Way\" and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas \"Swift Justice\" and \"Law & Order\". She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of \"Spin City\" and became an occasional babysitter for his children. Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie \"Rose Hill\" and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama \"Washington Square\". She appeared in the comedy movie \"Mr. Magoo\", the independent drama \"1999\" and Woody Allen's \"Deconstructing Harry\"; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film. In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of \"Fantasy Island\" and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama \"Significant Others\". Will Joyner of \"The New York Times\" praised her ability to \"provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight\" but Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner. Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama \"Felicity\". During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley. In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, \"Time of Your Life\", but it was cancelled midway through the first season. Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries \"\" and in two episodes of the action drama \"The Pretender\". Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama \"Stealing Time\" and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic \"Pearl Harbor\".\n\nGarner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama \"Alias\". The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: \"I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that.\" However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role. Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" remarked: \"You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross.\" Julie Salamon of \"The New York Times\" said she brought \"an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness\" to the role. \"Alias\" aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end. During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.\n\nWhile \"Alias\" was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an \"other-worldly\" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in \"Catch Me if You Can\" (2002). After seeing her in \"Alias\", Speilberg felt sure \"she would be the next superstar\". She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot. Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie \"Daredevil\" (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's \"Daredevil\". The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered \"an aptitude for\" while working on \"Alias.\" Elvis Mitchell of \"The New York Times\" said she \"realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material.\" While \"Daredevil\" received mixed reviews, it was a box office success. Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nGarner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy \"13 Going on 30\" (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year-old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011. Manohla Dargis of the \"Los Angeles Times\" found her \"startling\": \"Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised an \"utterly beguiling\" performance: \"You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star.\" Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" remarked: \"Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for.\" \"13 Going on 30\" grossed US$96 million worldwide. Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 \"Daredevil\" spin-off \"Elektra\"; it was a box office and critical failure. Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" concluded that Garner \"is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in \"13 Going on 30\". Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama \"Catch and Release\". Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of \"Alias\", it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" praised Garner's ability \"to blend charm and gravity\" but Peter Hartlaub of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" felt that, while her \"natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role.\"\n\nAfter a one-year break following the conclusion of \"Alias\", her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in \"Juno\" as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of \"New York Magazine\" as a turning point in her career: \"She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said she had never \"been lovelier or more affecting.\" She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller \"The Kingdom\" (2007). She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke. In late 2007 and early 2008 Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" described her performance as \"captivating\": \" Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess's peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she's a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable.\" \"The New Yorker\"s theater critic was impressed by her \"feistiness\" and \" lightness of comic touch\". The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.\n\nGarner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\", portraying the childhood friend of a famous photographer and womanizer (McConaughey). While the film received lukewarm reviews, it grossed US$102.2 million worldwide. Michael Phillips of \"The Chicago Tribune\" found Garner \"easy to like and sharp with her timing\", he was disappointed to see her as \"the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character.\" Similarly, Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" was dismayed to see the actress appear as \"less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words \"enter generic female lead\" in [the] screenplay).\"\n\nGarner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut \"The Invention of Lying\". Gervais was keen to cast Garner – \"always happy and always pleasant to everyone\" – against type. In the film, she played the love interest of the first human with the ability to lie (Gervais) in a world where people can only tell the truth. Reviews for the movie were mixed and it made US$32.4 million worldwide. David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\" said she \"proves again (the first time was \"13 Going on 30\") what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on.\" while Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said she \"has never been better onscreen [...] Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before.\"\n\nIn Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy \"Valentine's Day\" (2010), she shared scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey. The film made US$56.2 million in its U.S. opening weekend,; it eventually grossed US$110.4 million domestically and US$216.4 million worldwide. In 2011, she had a supporting role as a villainous arranged bride in the comedy \"Arthur\", a remake of the 1981 film of the same name, directed by Steve Gordon and co-starring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren.\n\nGarner played a mother for the first time in 2012, starring opposite Joel Edgerton, in the drama \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green\", which followed a magical pre-adolescent boy whose personality and naïveté have profound effects on the people in his town. The film received mixed reviews from critics and made a modest US$56 million worldwide. Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" found her \"convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom\" while Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said she brought \"fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity\" to the role. Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy \"Butter\", in which she played an overly competitive and socially ambitious woman participating in a local butter sculpturing competition in a small Iowa town. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States only, \"Butter\" received mixed reviews and grossed US$105,018. Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" praised \"the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner's comedy gifts since \"13 Going on 30\"\" while Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" described her as the \"best in show\" : \"[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd.\" However, Scott Bowles of \"USA Today\" remarked: \"Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one.\" Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short \"Serena\", and became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.\n\nGarner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 drama \"Dallas Buyers Club\", portraying the role of a doctor treating AIDS patients in Texas during the mid-1980s. The film received significant acclaim and was a box office success. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" described her as \"a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity\" and Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said: \"Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here.\" David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\" said: \"It's not a well-shaped role, but I've gotten to the point where I'm happy to see Garner in anything. She's incapable of phoniness.\" Also in 2013, Garner became the first celebrity spokesperson of the Italian fashion brand Max Mara.\n\nIn 2014, Garner starred opposite Kevin Costner in the sports drama \"Draft Day\", as the fictional salary cap analyst of Cleveland Browns. Critical reception towards the film was mixed and Mick LaSalle of \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" describing her part, remarked: \"It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice.\" Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\", taking on the role of the mother of the titular character. The film grossed US$101 million worldwide. Sandie Angulo Chen of the \"Washington Post\" said: \"Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled.\" Her other film role in 2014 was that of an overprotective mother in the dramedy \"Men, Women & Children\", directed by Jason Reitman and co-starring Rosemarie DeWitt, Judy Greer, Dean Norris, and Adam Sandler. The film made a US$2.2 million worldwide, and Christopher Orr of \"The Atlantic\" said: \"Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it's not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in \"Juno\", minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption.\" In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.\n\nIn 2015's \"Danny Collins\", a drama inspired by the true story of folk singer Steve Tilston and starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner played the supporting role of the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. The film was released in selected cinemas and was warmly received by critics; Stephanie Merry of the \"Washington Post\" felt she \"gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion.\" In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama \"Miracles from Heaven\", playing the mother of a young girl who had a near-death experience and was later cured of an incurable disease. The film grossed US$73.9 million worldwide and received generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt it \"makes the most out of an outstanding performance\" from Garner. Ken Jaworowski of \"The New York Times\" praised a \"dedicated\" and \"heartfelt\" performance while Nigel Smith of \"The Guardian\" found \"her subtly wrought work [...] tremendously effective\" in an otherwise \"crassly manipulative\" film. Also in 2016, she starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the critically panned comedy \"Nine Lives\", playing the second wife of a workaholic father who has his mind trapped inside of his daughter's new cat. Garner made an uncredited cameo appearance in \"Mother's Day\" (2016).\n\nGarner appeared in the drama \"Wakefield\", which premiered at TIFF and was released in May 2017. Also in 2017, she starred in \"The Tribes of Palos Verdes\", and in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut \"A Happening of Monumental Proportions.\" In 2018, she co-starred in \"Love, Simon\", an adaptation of the young adult novel \"Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda\". Also that year, Garner voiced the role of Mama Llama for Netflix's original animated preschool series \"Llama Llama\", and starred as the lead in the action-revenge film \"Peppermint\", which was released on September 7. In August 2018, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts. Since 2014, Garner has served on the board of trustees for the organization, advocating for early childhood education. As an ambassador she frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.\n\nIn 2011, Garner partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: \"My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone.\" In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign. In 2015, she appeared in \"A Path Appears\", a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.\n\nIn 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates. In 2006, she spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California. In 2008 she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary. In 2007, Garner said she was \"not a particularly outwardly political person.\" In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser in support of Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana. Garner also attended voter registration and phone bank events in support of Clinton in Reno, Nevada.\n\nIn 2007, Garner appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\nGarner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. \"There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids.\" In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers. The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.\n\nGarner met co-star Scott Foley on the set of \"Felicity\" in 1998. They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000. The couple separated in March 2003. Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were signed in March 2004. She dated her \"Alias\" co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.\n\nGarner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004, having established a friendship on the sets of \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001) and \"Daredevil\" (2003). They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony. Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests. Garner and Affleck have three children together: two daughters and one son. The couple announced their intention to divorce in June 2015, and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children. The divorce was finalized in October 2018.\n\nAlthough Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles, each of her three children was baptized as a member of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia. In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.\n\nGarner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008. Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool. He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1931 during the government of Mohammed Nadir Shah and then Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Khan\n\nKabul University is attended by approximately 25,000 students, of which around 40% are women. The main building was renovated about 500 metres from the old one, which has almost the same design.\n\nThe mission of Kabul University is to mature and prosper as an internationally recognised institution of learning and research, a community of stakeholders committed to shared governance, and a centre of innovative thought and practice.\n\nKabul University was established in 1931 during the reign of Mohammed Nadir Shah and then Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Khan, opening its doors one year later to students from across the country. It benefitted from partnerships with the governments of France, Germany, Russia, and the United States.\n\nIn the 1960s foreign-educated scholars populated the campus, exposing the new generation to new topics such as communism, feminism and capitalism. Students influenced during this era included Ahmad Shah Massoud, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Dr. Faiz Ahmad, and Saydal Sokhandan.\n\nMany different political groups were influenced in the university such as Khalqists, Parchamites, Sholayees, and Ikhwanists.\n\nIn a clash between Ikhwanis and Sholayees, a poet named Saydal Sokhandan was killed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the 1970s. Saydal was fired upon and shot by Gulbuddin during an argument.\n\nDuring the governance of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), Kabul University lost several lecturers and staff. The majority of the university's faculty left during the ten-year period of unrest or civil war that followed after the fall of the PDPA government in 1992. The area around the university and Karte Char was a major battleground in the Afghan Civil War (1992-96).\n\nAfter the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, the international community focused on rebuilding the educational institutions in Afghanistan. By January 2004 the campus had only 24 computers. As part of its recovery program the university has established partnerships with four foreign universities, including Purdue University and the University of Arizona. Furthermore, the Information Technology Center was founded in 2002 with the cooperation of German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and Technical University of Berlin. The number of students in higher education had increased across the country from 22,717 in 2002 to 56,451 in 2008. By 2008, the university was attended by 9,660 students, 2,336 (24%) of them being women.\n\nIt was reported in 2007 that Iran donated funds to the university's dentistry faculty and donated 25,000 books. The main library of Kabul University was built by the United States, which is the best-equipped library in Afghanistan. It is equipped with computers, books and magazines. Nancy Dupree, wife of Louis Dupree, was the Director of the Afghanistan Center at the university.\n\nIn 2008, the campus of Kabul University was provided with local network facilities by the Information Technology center of Kabul University (ITCK). Each building is connected to the campus network and is provided with the internet connection from a fiber optic backbone. The Voice over IP (VoIP) technology was also part of the networking project, which improved the quality telephone communication at the university level.\n\n\n\nThe faculty of Computer Science was separated from faculty of Natural Sciences in 2008. At that time the faculty had 17 lecturers, 215 students, 3 modern and equipped laboratories, one library, examination centre for long-distance exams, and was part of the CISCO regional project. The faculty has started lectures with three departments namely software engineering, information system and technology and database in 2010. The computer sciences faculty has close contacts with the University of Maryland, University of Washington, University of Cape Town, Technical University of Berlin and the computer sciences department of all domestic universities. The graduates of the faculty can work in information technology centers of all governmental and non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe National Centre for Policy Research was established at Kabul University by the Ministry of Higher Education and Konrad Adenauer Foundation in 2003, and includes faculty in the departments of Law and Politics, Economics, and Social Science.\n\nIn 1992, the library held 200,000 books, 5,000 manuscripts, 3,000 rare books, periodicals, photographs and calligraphic specimens. Following a civil war, most materials were sold in book markets, burnt, destroyed, or lost. It served as the National Library of Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10118105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10118105", "title": "Music education in the United States", "text": "Music education in the United States\n\nMusic education in the United States can be traced through historical documentation to the colonial era. Among the Native Americans prior to European and African settlement, music education was entirely oral.\n\nThe earliest systematic music education in the country was centered on the training of singers for Protestant church services, to lead the congregation in psalm-singing. In the 18th century, the first singing schools in the country were founded, and a number of legendary traveling singing masters traveled New England, teaching in barns, schoolhouses and other informal locations; these masters included Francis Hopkinson and William Billings. By the end of the century, more formal singing schools in cities like Savannah, Philadelphia and Boston became social singing societies.\n\nPublic education in the United States first offered music as part of the curriculum in Boston in the 1830s, and it spread through the help of singing teacher Lowell Mason, after he successfully advocated it to the Boston School Committee in 1838. The committee ultimately decided to include music as a curricular subject because it was of a moral, physical, and intellectual nature. Music was considered moral because it played such a part in religion, as well as the fact that it had been documented to produce \"happiness, contentment, cheerfulness, and tranquility.\" It was of a physical nature because singing was exercise for the lungs. The committee justified music's intellectual nature by stating that it had been studied as a part of the quadrivium in the Middle Ages, and that it \"contributes to memory, comparison, attention, and intellectual faculties.\"\n\nAnother advocate of music in public education was Swiss educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Pestalozzi believed that nature was the ultimate and original source of knowledge, therefore his educational theories placed a high value on sensory, kinesthetic, and active learning. He felt students should start with simple concepts in all subjects and move later to more complex ideas. Pestalozzi's method was one of the earliest methods that could be considered \"student-centered learning\" and his ideas of discipline and a student-teacher rapport based on love and trust were markedly different from the common practice of corporal punishment at the time. The first music educator to use Pestalozzian ideas in teaching music was Hans Negeli, a colleague of Pestalozzi in Switzerland. His Pestalozzian approach to music was brought to the United States, translated, and popularized by William Channing Woodbridge, Elam Ives, and Lowell Mason. This approach prized active and sensory learning, taught sounds before signs, separated music into melody, rhythm, and expression, and also moved from the simple to complex within the context of each element. Many of these ideas are found in later established music teaching methods, such as Orff-Schulwerk, Kodaly, and, Dalcroze-Eurthymics.\n\nMusic education, primarily vocal, remained most common in women's schools, though many private academies also existed, offering boys and girls instruction in orchestral instruments like the violin, viola, cello and piano.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, educator Luther Whiting Mason established music education in the schools of Cincinnati, and become a prominent author of textbooks. His \"National Music Course\", first published in 1870, was a widely adopted standard part of many American curricula. Music education continued to expand across the country, and gained in respect as an essential part of educational development. There was a music section in the National Education Association by the 1890s.\n\nAfter the Civil War, pragmatism and the scientific aspects of sequential skill building, accurate evaluations, examinations, systematic teaching methods, and scientific methods were popular in education. Music educators' responses showed that music could be studied scientifically through the use of different methodologies, systematic textbooks and graded music series, and instructional material for teachers. The scientific and more pragmatic goals of education in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the development of music education in the schools.\n\nTwo main methodologies used to teach music were the \"rote\" method and the \"note\" method. The rote method followed many Pestalozzian ideologies. Songs were taught first and musical ideas were presented later, one at time, carefully and systematically. Singing by rote was the basis for this methodology. Lowell Mason authored what is believed to be the first music series using the rote method. Lowell Mason's \"The Song Garden\" from 1864 set the stage for other rote methodologies of the late nineteenth century. Luther Whiting Mason was a prominent rote method name presented in the textbook. Luther Mason was employed in Cincinnati schools but later moved to Boston to be the \"superintendent of music in the primary schools\" (p. 195). Luther Mason wrote school textbooks using rote methodology. The National Music Course, published by Ginn in 1870, had seven books presented in a sequential approach of using rote songs to teach music reading. (p. 196) Luther Mason included very detailed lesson plans for the classroom teacher, since at the time music was taught by the classroom teacher but overseen by a music specialist. The series was designed for fifteen minutes of music instruction each day given by the classroom teacher and overseen by a music educator once per week. The book series was so popular Luther Mason was invited to apply his methods in Japan and Germany. The rote method was less favored than the \"note\" method later in the nineteenth century. However, the debate continues today.\n\nAn example of the note method is Joseph Bird's 1861 \"Vocal Music Reader\" and Benjamin Jepson's three book series using \"note\" methodology. \"The Elementary Music Reader\" was published in 1871 by the Barnes Company, one year after Luther Mason's \"The National Music Course\". Benjamin Jepson was a military man turned music teacher in New Haven after an injury in the war. His music textbooks had exercises and songs presented systematically for the goal of music reading and sight-singing. Jepson later published two revisions of his series under the names \"The Standard Music Reader\" in 1888, and in 1904 \"The New Standard Music Reader\". Following in Jepson's footsteps of note methodology were Hosea Edson Holt and John Wheeler Tufts, who wrote \"The Normal Music Course\" published in 1883 (twelve years after Jepson's \"The Elementary Music Reader\"). Click here to read the Normal Music Course. This series had five books all geared toward sight-singing and reading music. A few other note methodology textbook were presented to show the seriousness of music reading as a scientific and pragmatic study. These other note methodology books included: \"The Graded School Singer\" by Blackman and Whittemore-1873, and the Cincinnati Schools\"' The Young Singer\"-1860, \"The Young Singer's Manual\"-1866, and the \"Cincinnati Music Reader\"-1893 (p. 207). The culmination of the scientific method and note methodology advances was presented in Thomas Tapper's and Frederick Ripley's \"The National Music Course\" published in 1895. The book focused on a no-nonsense systematic approach to music literacy to develop beauty in singing. It emphasized the systematic and pragmatic delivery of materials.\nMusic Education in the United States took a big turn with the creation of the Music Supervisors National Conference. The first meeting of the Music Supervisors Conference was held on April 10–12, 1907 in Keokuk, Iowa, at Westminster Presbyterian Church. A music educator by the name of Philip C. Hayden made the first meeting possible by sending invitations and announcing the meeting in the \"Music School Monthly\" of which Hayden was the founder and editor of the publication. The gathering was primarily meant for educators to come observe new teaching techniques in rhythm and observe Hayden's music students.\n\nDuring the three-day convention, music demonstrations took place provided by Hayden and his students. Informal discussions on current topics in music education would also take place during the convention. Future conventions and clinics would be based on this model. Throughout the convention, many educators discussed the importance of having a more permanent organization dedicated to music supervisors and teaching techniques. On the last day of the convention, a forum of sixty-nine music supervisors voted to have another convention and became charter\nmembers of an organization that would remain nameless.\n\nThe Music Supervisors National Conference was officially established during the third meeting of the organization in Cincinnati, OH, in 1910 with the adoption of the constitution and bylaws. As the role of the music supervisor changed into more of an administrative position, the conference began to focus primarily on the teaching methods provided in the classroom. At the 1934 Chicago meeting, members decided to change the name to .\n\nSince the inception of Music Supervisors National Conference, the organization has worked diligently in making sure that every student has access to music instruction in the public school system provided by a qualified music teacher.\n\nVocal instruction dominated public schooling at all levels. Instrumental education was handled largely through private enterprise, until the early 20th century. Inspired by the band music of Frederick Innes, John Philip Sousa and others, many schools offered orchestral instrument bands. This accelerated following World War I, when many soldiers returned with knowledge and interest in the band music they learned as soldiers.\n\nThe first formal school for music educators was founded in 1884, in Potsdam, New York, by Julia Ettie Crane, but Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio in the 1920s became the first school to offer a four-year degree in music education.\n\nBands during the mid to late nineteenth century were an intricate part of every community. These bands would march in parades, provide free concerts, supported soldiers, and played for those in hospitals. During the golden age of bands which occurred from 1865 to 1917, there were approximately over 10,000 brass bands in existence across the country. The band membership did consist of males, but past photographs indicate that there were also all women bands. The female bands continued their popularity into the twentieth century and influenced the evolution of the high school band from totally male to the integration of female into the programs. High schools often housed the standard male band, but also often included a female band. There were also female bands created to support industry. With the beginning of WW II\nfemale bands expanded into women's military bands. These bands were created to entertain female troops, sell war bonds, and perform at concerts, graduations, dances, parades, and hospitals (2008). The WAC (Woman's Army Corp) bands were used to entertain injured soldiers returning from the war.\n\nOne Ohio music educator, Joan A. Lamb, provided great contributions to world of military bands. Lamb was a public music teacher until enrolling in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps later known as WAC. In her basic training, she was asked to become a candidate for officer, but she insisted she had joined to play in the WAC band. She was even sent to a psychiatrist because of her persistence in the effort to become a member of the band. Finally, she located the WAC band director, auditioned for him with her oboe, and was immediately reassigned to the band. Lamb held several music positions within the band which was a first for women. She graduated from Army Music School, directed the 400th WAC Band, started an African American WAC Band, and performed in the Armed Forces Radio Orchestra. After her service in the WACS, she returned to her life as a music teacher, educator, and administrator in Los Angeles public schools where she served for 30 years.\n\nAfrican American women also wanted to serve in the WAC Band. A 404 WAC Band was created. The WAC branch of the military was the only branch who allowed African American female bands. The Coast Guard also created their version of the female band. The SPAR Band played for the troops and performed many of the same activities as the WAC Band. After the war, the SPAR Band was disbanded and the Coast Guard again became all male. After the war, the female SPAR band members became teachers, performers, and parents. There were some female members of the WAC and SPAR military bands who used the G.I Bill to go to college while others continued performing professionally post war. During the war, women's swing bands also became popular replacing the male counterpart serving in the war effort. These swing bands were highly successful and were well received by the public longing for a diversion from the war effort.\n\nThe Ingenues was an all-girl jazz band popular in the late 1920s through the 1930s. This performing band would often perform in vaudeville and variety theaters. Anna Mae Winburn was an African American band leader of an all-girl jazz band in the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Frances Klein was another famous female instrumentalist of the 30's and 40's who played in Kermit Dart's All-Girl Band, under the direction of Irene Vermillion.\n\nThe women military bands and post war all-girl bands opened the door to more female participation in instrumental music. Through the efforts of these frontier-like women, perspectives changed as to the female purpose and level of reliability. Suddenly, female bands were found to be as entertaining as male bands. Women found a place and purpose in the entertainment world. Women who were thought to only have the ability to be mothers were leaders in the music world. Women's equality began to emerge during this time in history and music was a primary avenue for the movement. These women of the past created an environment which the women of today now enjoy. This environment is one of fairness and the ability to seek success in all career areas. Women of today attend college and may become professionals in the work force. Women like Joan Lamb conquered what had in the past seemed like a forbidden world.\n\nThe entrance of the United States into World War I (1917–1918) prompted the Wilson administration to promote a \"patriotic mind-set.” Community singing of patriotic songs such as \"America\" and \"The Star Spangled Banner\" were popular outlets for citizens as a way to promote \"...strong community efforts of all kinds\" and also assisted immigrants to learn English. In addition to community singing, concert bands and marching bands were also used to promote patriotism for \"maintenance of civilian morale.” College and university marching bands were also culturally influential during and after World War I, especially in the Midwest of the United States. Following the war, members of these collegiate bands were looking for ways to \"develop good will, fellowship and understanding...and recognize the value of dedicated leadership.\" Two leading band service organizations were established to fit that calling, the Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity (ΚΚΨ) and the Tau Beta Sigma sorority (ΤΒΣ).\nKappa Kappa Psi was the first of those organizations, established on November 27, 1919 at Oklahoma A & M College. The strong sense of patriotism during World War I was wearing off in the U.S., and the band members of the university wanted to continue to advocate band music. Ten collegiate band members were selected including the band leader William A. Scroggs by the director of the ensemble, Bohumil \"Boh\" Makovsky. The fraternity quickly became national with the addition of the University of Washington and Montana State College in 1920. Since 1919, Kappa Kappa Psi members have been advocating, supporting and serving over 200 higher education institutions with around 5,000 active members each year. Famous fraternal brothers include John Philip Sousa, Karl King, and William Revelli.\n\nThere are currently five distinctive purposes for Kappa Kappa Psi today which include: (1) promoting the existence and welfare of secondary school bands and cultivate a respect for their endeavors, (2) honoring outstanding band members through fraternal membership, (3) stimulating campus leadership and respect through positive conduct, (4) fostering a positive bond among collegiate bands and a high level or performance achievement, and (5) providing a positive social experience to all involved in college bands or other musical organizations.\n\nCollegiate bands in the 1920s were the domain of young men. Women were rarely involved, if at all. However, as the progressive movement of the U.S. was developing, bands became less militaristic and were accepting more women in the 1930s. Even with the progressive movement, some higher education bands held out much longer as a men only ensemble. Michigan State University did not admit women into the Spartan Marching Band until 1972.\n\nTau Beta Sigma sorority was established on March 26, 1946, twenty seven years after Kappa Kappa Psi. The charter institution was Oklahoma State University, renamed from Oklahoma A & M, after the organization decided it would be easier to start in Oklahoma rather than Texas. A major circumstance for creating a band service organization for women was simply due to the fact that more women were now involved with university bands in the United States. Wava Banes along with some other women classmates at Texas Tech University approached their director, D. O. Wiley about forming a \"group of bandswomen\" in 1937. The local organization was formalized as Tau Beta Sigma and structured after the Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity.\n\nTau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to become a chapter under their national fraternity in 1943, however a complete constitution re-write and difficulties associated with the U.S. entrance in World War II led Kappa Kappa Psi to suggest that Tau Beta Sigma form their own organization just as they had done in 1919. Due to complications with Texas corporation laws of 1945, A. Frank Martin from Kappa Kappa Psi suggested using a similar women group at Oklahoma State University (OSU) as the founding chapter for Tau Beta Sigma. One month after OSU's charter was granted, the women traveled back to Texas to install the founding women of Tau Beta Sigma. Kappa Kappa Psi was able to convene in 1947 and officially accepted Tau Beta Sigma as their sister sorority.\n\nBoth organizations grew in the post-World War II era. Society was still evolving and changing and women's rights became front and center in 1972 with the passage of the Title IX law. This law \"requires gender equity for boys and girls in every educational program that receives federal funding.\" Since both groups were federally funded, women were allowed to join Kappa Kappa Psi and men were allowed to join Tau Beta Sigma. Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma are still active today and strive to promote the bands they are associated with as their founders did over a half century ago.\n\nMusic is generally optional in high school in the United States, and may or may not be required in middle or junior high school. Concert bands and marching bands are also commonly offered, as are choirs and theatrical performances that often include music.\n\nIn 2015 a study was released from 2010 showing that according to the U.S. Department of Education, 40 percent of high schools don't require coursework in the arts for graduation. More than 8,000 public schools in the US are currently without music programs as of 2010. Across the country, 1.3 million elementary school students don't have access to a music class.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Education, the core academic subjects studied in schools are currently English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, and geography. In order to teach a core subject in the United States, one must be a Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT), meaning they must have a bachelor's degree from a four-year institution, be licensed in the state in which they wish to teach, and be fully competent in their subject area. However, individual competencies vary from state-to-state. Historically, music and fine arts had not been a part of core curriculum in schools in the United States, however, in July 2015, the United States Senate, passed a bipartisan revision naming music and art core subjects in curriculum under the Every Child Achieves Act. \n\nThe core subjects that were added were \"technology, engineering, computer science, music, and physical education.\" This was an action against the No Child Left Behind Act, which many United States Education Advocates felt had narrowed down the subjects incorporated into the core curriculum. The No Child Left Behind Act was initially entitled the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, but then was later renamed No Child Left Behind in 2002. The National Association for Music Education, or NAfME, is an \"organization of American music educators dedicated to advancing and preserving music education and as part of the core curriculum of schools in the United States.\" The NAfME is an organization founded in 1907 of more than 60,000 people who advocate for the benefits of music and arts education for students at the local, state, and national levels. NAfME published a press release with the bipartisan senate revision and the impact they believe it will have on the United States Core Curriculum.\n\nMusic is implemented as an academic subject in schools around the world, in places such as Greece, Germany, Slovenia, Spain India, and Africa. This is not a comprehensive, as music is considered a cultural necessity in many countries worldwide. Although the NAfME addresses the plan for implementation for music and arts as core subjects at the national level, the fulfillment of this revision of the Every Child Achieves Act varies from state to state. As of 2014, forty-one states currently have an arts education requirement at all levels, but only seventeen of these states have programs with deliberate assessment policies. Twenty-seven of the fifty United States consider the arts a core subject. Georgia and Arkansas have very specific outlines of music, while Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, and D.C. have no arts instruction requirements for any level of schooling. \n\nThe National Coalition for Core Arts Standards (NCCAS), has a series of performance assessments entitled Model Cornerstone Assessments, or MCAs, which have been expended in high schools as a pilot program in recent months. In addition to this, NAfME also has nine National Music Education standards, which include: \"singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music; performing on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music; improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments; composing and arranging music within specified guidelines; reading and notating music; listening to, analyzing, and describing music; evaluating music and music performances; understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts; and understanding music in relation to history and culture.\"\n\nMany policymakers and initiators for music and the arts as a part of the core curriculum believe that students participating in music and arts programs which hold them to high standards will bring a creative outlook now seemingly required in the workforce. Since music has traditionally been viewed as a subject outside of academia, and music has been incorporated into schools as a secondary subject, or often as an elective, there is limited research on classroom benefits of music as a core subject. Many researchers have explored both the benefits to listening to music passively as well as pursuing music actively, as with learning an instrument. The benefits music in the classroom and its effects on brain development, academic performance, and practical life skills have been observed through research by Jenny Nam Yoon. She concluded that the two hemispheres of the brain are stimulated when music is played and how the corpus callosum, the bridge that connects the two hemispheres is larger in musician's brains. \n\nThe effects of strictly listening to music have long been explored and has been given the name the \"Mozart Effect,\" which is known to cause a \"small increase in spatial-temporal reasoning\". As seen with the Mozart Effect, listening to music has been proven to affect the brain and mood, as well as spatial temporal reasoning, but does not have any long-term benefits. A 1981 study at Mission Vejo High School proved that music students had a higher GPA than students who did not participate in music (3.59 vs. 2.91). There have been studies done verifying music as an enrichment activity that causes an increase in self-confidence, discipline, and social cohesion, as well as academic benefits.\n\nAlthough the US Senate has endorsed music as a core subject, many, including Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, argue music and the arts to be extra-curricular. Many also believe that among Federal budget cuts, music and the arts would be the first to go because they are not part of our foundation of core curriculum in America. The benefits of music as a core subject and its impact on the education system through the arithmetic, language, concentration, and other skills involved still have to be assessed before conclusions can be drawn about the concrete, measurable impacts music and the arts have on children in the United States public school system.\n\nThe funding of music education has been debated in the United States due to budget cuts to music programs and varying beliefs on learning priorities in public schools.\n\nProponents of increasing federal funds for music education have argued that music provides children with cognitive and emotional benefits, such as improving spatial and temporal brain functions, which may help them succeed in other school subjects. Socially, advocates describe music as something that provokes peace, passion, and reduces stress, which they feel provides multiple benefits to students. Opponents of increasing federal funding believe that music is not important enough to warrant federal financial support, as they view it as a waste of tax dollars. Some assert that music programs distract students from gaining practical skills and takes money away from more useful areas, where funds could be more wisely spent. Others argue that the research showing cognitive or academic benefits stemming from music is unproven and needs to be further investigated before reaching a conclusion.\n\nElementary schools in the United States typically offer music classes several times a week, with classes ranging from thirty to forty-five minutes in length. Beginning in about fourth grade, performance opportunities are often provided in the form of choirs or orchestral (especially wind) bands.\nThere are several developed teaching methods intended for use in elementary schools. The Kodaly Method was developed in Hungary by Zoltan Kodaly. The Orff-Schulwerk Method was developed by Carl Orff, the German composer who wrote Carmina Burana. The Dalcroze-Eurythmics Method was developed in Switzerland by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, who was teaching at the Geneva Conservatory at the time. All three methods place an emphasis on activity and learning by doing. The Kodaly Method is known best for its use of solfege syllables and corresponding hand signals. The Orff-Schulwerk Method is most famous for its use of varying sizes of xylophones and glockenspiels, known as \"Orff instruments.\" The Dalcroze-Eurythimics Method's most visible characteristic is its use of movement to music, ideally live music.\n\nIn a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Education, OECD, it is explained that the amount of time students typically spend in school during primary and lower secondary levels is 7,751 hours. Of these 7,751 hours, the schools surveyed for the report spent eleven percent of the time of the whole year on the arts in elementary schools, and only eight percent of the time on the arts in lower secondary schools. This report also explains that the arts classes combined receive almost the same amount of time as physical education classes do, which is between eight and nine percent for both levels of schooling. (\"How\")\nThe United States Department of Education conducted a survey of 1,201 secondary schools during the 2009-2010 school year, Parsad explains. This survey reported that the majority of secondary teachers teaching the different arts classes were specialists in their field (Parsad). In a secondary investigation, the United States Department of Education concluded that 94 percent of elementary schools offered instruction in music, and 83 percent of schools offered instruction in the visual arts in elementary schools during the same time period. Drama and dance classes were offered to only three and four percent of the elementary schools involved in the study, but more than half of the schools incorporated dance into other subjects (Parsad). Art and music classes were offered to elementary students at least once per week, Parsad explains.\n\nThroughout the history of music education, many music educators have adopted and implemented technology in the classroom. Alice Keith and D.C. Boyle were said to be the first music educators in the United States to use the radio for teaching music. Keith wrote \"Listening in on the Masters\", which was a broadcast music appreciation course. Another advocate who promoted the use of technology was Marguerite V. Hood, who was born on March 14, 1903 in Drayton, North Dakota. Hood graduated high school early, at the age of sixteen. She then attended Jamestown College, in Jamestown, North Dakota where she graduated with degrees in romance languages and music, and minors in history and English.\n\nHood's professional career led her to Montana in 1923, where she pursued teaching, writing, and public speaking. In 1930, Hood became Montana's second state music supervisor. \nDuring Hood's teaching career, the radio was used as an educational tool. Montana received poor radio reception because of the mountain interference, so Hood created local radio station broadcasts. Hood began the music education radio broadcast project, \"Montana School of the Air\", in 1937. These broadcasts aired weekly on four radio stations. Using the radio for educational broadcasts received positive reviews because it allowed students to be reached all over the United States during the unstable time of the Great Depression. Radios were cost effective and could reach isolated, rural schools.\nThe National Broadcasting Company (NBC) played a major role in music education. NBC would broadcast musical examples for students enrolled in public school. Walter Damrosch directed the radio program, \"Music Appreciation Hour\". In the course of this broadcast, teachers were able to obtain the musical selections in advance along with student notebooks and teacher instruction manuals. Two other popular music broadcast programs were \"Alice in Orchestralia\" and the \"Standard Symphony Hour\". These broadcasts were an innovative teaching strategy which promoted and encouraged active listening and music appreciation. Prior to the radio, listening to music was limited to live performances and the skill of the teacher to play music, specifically on the piano.\n\nThe impact of the radio in the 1930s can similarly be compared to some of today's technology, such as iPods, compact discs, and computers. Technology has become much more widely available in the classroom since the 1930s. Today, children have access to many musical devices and options that were not available in the 1930s. In essence, technology has been used in music classrooms throughout the United States with the intent to improve the quality of music education for students.\n\n\"How Much Time do Primary and Lower Secondary Students Spend in the Classroom?\" OECD.org.

It is considered to be a desirable skill among musical performers.\n\nMany forms of classical music throughout the world are fundamentally rooted in the concept of playing by ear, where musical compositions are passed down from generation to generation. In this respect, playing by ear can be also seen as a music-specific example of oral tradition. However, there are some examples of musical traditions where greater importance is placed on a tradition of writing down the music, in some form of musical notation.\n\nThe concept of playing by ear has led to the development of the idiom, to play by ear.\n\nLearning music by ear is done by repeatedly listening to other musicians, either their live shows or sound recordings of their songs, and then attempting to recreate what one hears. Audiation involves hearing sounds mentally, although on a different level than just \"hearing a song in one's head\". The skill of reproducing those sounds involves the ability to mentally hear and recognize rhythms, tell the interval between a note and a reference note in a melody, play a specific interval between a melodic note and bass note (typically 1, 3, or 5 intervals below the melodic note), and play the notes of a specific chord based on the a given bass note (e.g., notes at 1, 3, and 5 intervals above the bass note).\n\nIn most instances, those traditions where learning music from playing by ear is paramount do not use musical notation in any form. Some examples of this such as by early Blues guitarists and pianists, Romani fiddlers and folk music guitarists.\n\nOne particularly prominent example is of Indian classical music, where the teaching methods of its two major strands (\"Hindustani\" and \"Carnatic\") are almost exclusively oral.\nHistorically, the Western classical music tradition has been based on the process of learning new pieces from musical notation, and hence playing by ear has a lower importance in musical training.\n\nHowever, many teaching methods in this tradition incorporate playing by ear in some form. Examples include the \"ear training\" courses that are a standard part of conservatory or college music programs (including use of Solfège), and the Suzuki method, which incorporates a highly developed focus on playing by ear from a very young age.\n\nIn the West, learning by ear is also associated with the genres of folk music, blues, rock, and jazz.\n\n\n"}

The Kalsom Movement became a fully registered youth-led organisation in 2012.\n\nSince 2012, as the organiser of Projek Kalsom, the youth-led education charity continues to focus on developing Malaysia’s future leaders by empowering university students to share their knowledge and skills to help younger economically-disadvantaged Malaysian students achieve their ambitions. In turn, these Malaysian university students also benefit from discovering their own leadership potentials and organisational skills as well as becoming more perceptive of issues surrounding education inequality in Malaysia which will hopefully instil a sense of civic awareness towards their local community and towards the country as whole. The Kalsom Movement's education programmes are open to all Malaysian students regardless of ethnicity, gender, religious or political background.\n\nEvery year, The Kalsom Movement brings together the brightest, most talented and academically-gifted 16-year-old Malaysian secondary school students from Band 3 and below schools (underperforming schools), as outlined by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia) for Projek Kalsom, a week-long programme of English Language modules, careers and scholarship and personal development workshops as well as other education programmes organised by the movement.\n\nA significant proportion of The Kalsom Movement's facilitators are top Malaysian university student-leaders from Oxford University, University of Cambridge and Russell Group universities as well as Ivy League universities such as Harvard, Cornell and Princeton University.\n\nThe idea for a Projek Kalsom motivational camp was initially mooted by a group of Malaysian students in London in 1993 upon reading a newspaper cutting of a Mrs Kelthom Abdullah, a single mother living in the rural areas of Kelantan, Malaysia, who could not bear the cost of her children's education. Aside from raising funds for Mrs Kelthom Abdullah, these students decided to organise the first Projek Kalsom motivational camp for underprivileged students in Jerantut, Pahang in 1994. Of note, as the founders of Projek Kalsom were also the founders of the United Kingdom & Eire Council for Malaysian Students (UKEC), it is not surprising that Projek Kalsom has been associated with UKEC in the past.\n\nSubsequent Projek Kalsom motivational camps were rotated between the 11 states and federal territories of West Malaysia as a one-off motivational camp annually. In 2012, under the leadership of Dr Hannah Nazri (2011 Projek Kalsom 17 Director), formerly a medical student of University of Bristol, Projek Kalsom finally became a registered entity known as Kelab Belia Kalsom under the Registrar of Youth Societies (Ministry of Youth & Sports, Malaysia); ensuring its sustainability and continuity. 2012 also saw the Projek Kalsom motivational camp being held for the first time in East Malaysia, in Miri, Sarawak. The following year, saw the first Bristol Commonwealth Cultural Programme involving 10 British university students joining Projek Kalsom motivational camp in Kuantan, Pahang. In 2014, under the leadership of Mohd Zulikhwan Ayub (2013-2015 Kelab Belia Kalsom President), a medical student at University of Aberdeen, Kelab Belia Kalsom underwent a major transformation phase with an expansion plan of partnerships in place, an increase in the number of volunteer applications by nearly 300%, an introduction of a one-year Kalsom Harapan plan, as well as a re-branding exercise where the youth-led charity became widely known as The Kalsom Movement.\n\nSince 2014, The Kalsom Movement remained the only student-led organisation to receive support and endorsement from Bursa Malaysia (formerly Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange). In 2015, The Kalsom Movement was nominated as one of the Top 10 Organisations (Education and Community) for Merdeka Award, a highly prestigious award in Malaysia. Projek Kalsom itself, is endorsed by the Malaysian Book of Records as the longest student run motivational camp in Malaysia. For 2018, The Kalsom Movement received the support of Shell Malaysia and was the only student-led charity to benefit from Shell Raya Charity Campaign 2018.\n\nThe 'tour' of all 14 states and federal territories of Malaysia was completed with the organisation of the 2015 Projek Kalsom 21 in Papar, Sabah. In 2015, the movement received 364 applications as facilitators from Malaysian students studying in 15 different countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States of America, Canada, Poland, Spain, Egypt, Indonesia and Malaysia for 40 places. 11 international facilitators through the Bristol Commonwealth Cultural Programme (third year running) and American Fulbright Scholars were also selected with a dual aim in mind, to encourage bilateral relationships between the two countries and to encourage English speaking between Projek Kalsom student-participants.\n\nSince the establishment of The Kalsom Movement, many other education programmes were organised.\n\nFlagship programmes are programmes that are always held annually. As The Kalsom Movement aims to provide a training ground to Malaysian university student-leaders to organise and get involved in projects of their interest, Executive Committees are encouraged to introduce and pursue new education programmes each year that can benefit younger Malaysians.\n\nFlagship programmes that are held annually:\n\nOther programmes:\n\nMembers of The Kalsom Movement alumni consists of both Malaysian university student-leaders (facilitators) and beneficiaries (student-participants) have gone to have very successful careers in their chosen field. A substantial number have started up their own businesses, charities and social enterprises. A non-exhaustive list of The Kalsom Movement alumni members are as below: \n\n\nAmong the alumni members of The Kalsom Movement are also scholarship recipients of the most prestigious academic scholarships in Malaysia such as the Bank Negara Kijang Emas Scholarship (awarded to top four or five best Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia students nationally), Biasiswa Nasional (awarded to top 20 (previously top 50) best Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia students nationally) and Biasiswa Yang di-Pertuan Agong (The King's Scholarship):\n\n"}

L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 394 (Sept. 26, 1973), codified at et seq., is American legislation that guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities. It was one of the first U.S. federal civil rights laws offering protection for people with disabilities. It set precedents for subsequent legislation for people with disabilities, including the Virginians with Disabilities Act in 1985 and the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.\n\nSection 504 states (in part):\n\nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.\n\nIt is codified as 29 U.S.C. 794.\n\nAs amended in 1974, Section 111, Pub L. 93-516, 88 Stat. 1619 (Dec. 7, 1974), \"Individuals with Disabilities\" are:\n\nAny person who (a) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (b) has a record of such an impairment, or (c) is regarded as having such an impairment\n\nwhere\n\nMajor life activities include caring for one's self, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, working, performing manual tasks, and learning.\n\nHowever, \"For purposes of employment\", \"Qualified Individuals with Disabilities\" must also meet \"normal and essential eligibility requirements\", such that:\n\nFor purposes of employment, \"Qualified Individuals with Disabilities\" are persons who, with \"Reasonable Accommodation\", can perform the essential functions of the job for which they have applied or have been hired to perform.\n\nwhere\n\n\"Reasonable Accommodation\" means an employer is required to take reasonable steps to accommodate [one's] disability unless it would cause the employer undue hardship.\n\nThat is, \"Qualified Individuals with Disabilities\" must be able to perform the job duties associated with the job for which they would be hired. The United States Department of Labor also indicates that \"Small Providers\" do not have to make \"\"significant\" structural alterations to their existing facilities\" to accommodate individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) was passed in 1990, and seems to pick up where the Rehabilitation Act left off. Borrowing from the §504 definition of disabled person, and using the familiar three-pronged approach to eligibility (has a physical or mental impairment, a record of an impairment, or is regarded as having an impairment), the ADA applied those standards to most private sector businesses, and sought to eliminate barriers to disabled access in buildings, transportation, and communication. To a large degree, the passage of the ADA supplants the employment provisions of §504, reinforces the accessibility requirements of §504 with more specific regulations\".\n\nSection 504 covers \"any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\" If an organization receives federal support of any kind, even if the organization is not a federal or state organization, the organization must comply with Section 504. For example, airports in the United States can be at least partially funded by grants from federal and state governments, thus must be compliant. In many communities, public libraries receive federal financial assistance, directly or indirectly, so they must comply as well. Airports and public libraries became accessible according to Section 504 stipulation within a few years of the implementation of Section 504.\n\nThe intention of Section 504 was to impact employment of people with disabilities, thus included education. Section 504 was the first national civil rights legislation that provided equal access for students with disabilities to higher education institutions receiving federal financial assistance. Both public and private colleges and universities supported by federal grants and funding programs must comply with Section 504. The common way higher education institutions are linked to federal funds is through the federal student aid programs. Initially, colleges, universities, and community colleges complied with the regulations imposed by Section 504 in the late-1970s and early to mid-1980s.\n\nHigher education institutions are required to make their programs accessible to qualified students with disabilities. Qualified students with disabilities are determined by the admissions criteria of the individual higher education institution. Students wishing to receive accommodations must initiate the process, which varies per higher education institution. This process largely subscribes to the medical model of disability, as many higher education institutions require medical documentation of diagnosis and functioning regarding the disability during the accommodation application process. These colleges and universities are required to make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities who attend their institutions.\n\nThe law also pertains to any \"local educational agency (as defined in section 8801 of Title 20), system of vocational education, or other school system\". As applied to K–12 schools, \"the language broadly prohibits the denial of public education participation, or enjoyment of the benefits offered by public school programs because of a child's disability.\" Although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) also applies to K-12 schools, the existence of IDEA does not mean the Rehabilitation Act is superfluous. IDEA only protects a subset of children and youth who have disabilities—those who satisfy its definition for \"child with a disability\". The definition of disability under Section 504 is broader than that of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, so some children who do not meet the IDEA definition of disability are served under Section 504.\n\nSection 504 requires school districts to provide Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) to children with disabilities, who may benefit from public education, within the individual district's jurisdiction. Regardless of the child's disability, the school district must identify the child's educational needs and provide any regular or special education to satisfy the child's educational needs just as well as it does for the children without disabilities. This may be accomplished by developing an education plan for the child. When done so under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, it is referred to as a 504 plan. This 504 plan covers accommodations, services, and support the child will be receiving in order to have access to education at school. A 504 plan is different and less detailed than an Individualized Education Program (IEPs).\n\nSection 504 supports rights for students for needs outside of the school day, such as extracurricular activities, sports, and after-school care, because Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. While the process for accommodating students varies per institution, schools generally comply with Section 504 by identifying students with disabilities and evaluating those students. If the students are eligible, they create a written accommodation plan, often called a \"504 Plan.\" It is similar to, but often shorter than, the IDEA Individualized Education Program (IEP). Parents, teachers, and school staff are a part of the process. Parents have due process rights; where they disagree with the determinations of the school, they have a right to an impartial hearing.\n\nViolations of Section 504 in the educational environment can be addressed locally with the education agency or with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education. Violations of Section 504 can result in a loss of the federal funding. According to the Department individuals may also file a private right of action for violations of Sec. 504. Thus, Section 504 is enforced by OCR. IDEA is carried out by another unit of the Department, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP).\n\nSection 504 covers extracurricular and after school programs such as sports, music lessons, and afterschool care. 34 C.F.R. § 104.37.\n\nThe Department of Education Office of Civil Rights has determined that Section 504 applies to:\n\nAlthough not in the text of the statute, courts have held that individuals have a private right of action under Section 504. While punitive damages are not available, compensatory damages are available to plaintiffs. Arguably, these rights extend to include emotional distress damages.\n\nIn addition to its responsibility for enforcing other federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in housing, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a statutory responsibility under Section 504 to ensure that individuals are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving HUD assistance. Section 504 charges HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity with enforcing the right of individuals to live in federally subsidized housing free from discrimination on the basis of disability. Further, Section 504 covers employment discrimination based on disability and requires HUD and HUD-assisted agencies to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an employee or qualified applicant. It covers all HUD programs except for its mortgage insurance and loan guarantee programs.\n\nAny housing that receives federal assistance, such as Section 8 public housing, is subject to Section 504 regulations and requirements. Any person with a disability who feels himself or herself a victim of discrimination in a HUD-funded program or activity may file a complaint with HUD under Section 504. A complaint can be filed with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. If a person with disabilities feels subject to discrimination in a housing situation that does not receive federal assistance, they can also file a complaint through the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe early history of federal legislation benefiting people with disabilities includes the Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1920 (Smith-Fess Act) passed after World War I, one of the first U.S. laws that provided services for all Americans with disabilities, not just veterans with disabilities. Over the years, subsequent laws and amendments included additional vocational rehabilitation measures.\n\nSection 504 brought the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the Rehabilitation of Act of 1973. As a law that fell within the office of Health, Education, and Welfare, this was an unlikely place for a social justice provision, yet inserting such a rights clause happened without fanfare. Working behind the scenes on what most believed was a bill related to budget, a staffer added the thirty-five words that addressed issues of discrimination related to disability. This was a departure from prevailing views that considered disability to be purely a medical condition. The law prohibited any entity receiving federal funding (such as government offices, schools, universities, hospitals, and post offices) from discriminating against someone because of a disability.\n\nConcerned about costs and enforcement, the Nixon and Ford Administrations attempted to stall the regulations both by rewriting them and calling for further study regarding their impact if they did stay in their present form. Institutions such as universities and hospitals hoped to avoid bad publicity and huge expenses by waiting out the regulation process.\n\nDisability rights groups, especially the American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD), understood the implications and advocated to keep them in place unchanged. Section 504 required another step before being implemented (and thus enforced), a signature from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). In 1975 a federal lawsuit was filed to force the agency to act. In July 1976, a federal district for Washington DC ruled that the regulations should be issued \"with no further unreasonable delays.\" As the arrival of a new president drew near, HEW Secretary under departing President Gerald Ford, David Matthews, left them unsigned.\n\nDuring his campaign, Jimmy Carter promised to change this if he was elected president. When he took office in January 1977, he too grew concerned about costs and invited Joseph Califano, the new HEW head, to study the legislation and its implications by establishing a task force that did not include representation from ACCD or anyone with a disability. Word leaked out that the 504 regulations that insisted on full integration of people with disabilities were being changed into something more akin to \"separate but equal.\" ACCD members tried to reach President Carter, who had promised to support disability rights during a campaign speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, a significant location because it had been President FDR's wheelchair-accessible \"home away from home\" while he was in the White House. Carter insisted that the matter fell to Califano.\n\nAfter resistance from Joseph Califano to signing the regulations, national protests were organized, which are now known as the 504 Sit-in. Due to the pressure of the protests, Joseph Califano signed the regulations unchanged on April 28, 1977. In San Francisco, the occupation would last another two days, until April 30, 1977, to give the occupiers time to clean up and to allow their fellow protesters time to return from Washington so they could all leave the building together with raised fists in triumph. Some also seemed reluctant to leave the disability city, the \"mini-Woodstock\" they had created. The 504 Sit-in lasted a total of 25 days, and remains the longest nonviolent occupation of a federal building in U.S. history.\n\nProtesters held a large victory rally in Civic Center Plaza where occupiers sang \"We Have Overcome,\" then toasted with champaign and gave victory speeches. Organizer Kitty Cone captured the mood and the accomplishment by saying: \"We showed strength and power and courage and commitment, that we the shut-ins or the shut-outs, that we the hidden, supposedly the frail and the weak, that we could wage a struggle at the highest level of government and win!\"\n\nOver the next several years, Section 504 was controversial because it afforded people with disabilities many rights similar to those for other minority groups in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Throughout the Reagan administration, efforts were made to weaken Section 504. Patricia Wright and Evan Kemp, Jr. (of the Disability Rights Center) led a grassroots and lobbying campaign against this that generated more than 40,000 cards and letters. In 1984, the administration dropped its attempts to weaken Section 504; however, they did end the Social Security benefits of hundreds of thousands of disabled recipients.\n\nThe protest is considered \"perhaps the single most impressive act of civil disobedience in the United States over the last quarter-century.\" The success ensured that disability rights would be understood to be a civil right, that disabled people could claim an identity alongside those of racial, ethnic, and gender identities. It has been described as the Stonewall of the disability rights movement because it solidified the American struggle for disability rights. The successful action showed people with disabilities to be capable of grassroots action and ongoing public protest for the first time in history. It brought together people with different disabilities to forge coalitions that would work together to draft and pass the 1990s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nThe protests also led Califano to sign the regulations for the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act, another law awaiting a signature from the head of HEW after congress had passed it. Along with provisions from 504, this law paved the way for bringing children with disabilities into the educational mainstream, giving them access to better schooling and opportunities.\n\nThe new law provoked some resistance and backlash from organizations that complained of costs.\n\nAs part of the 504 victory, the federal government funded disability activists to travel across the United States to explain to people with disabilities and local officials the rights guaranteed by the law. This helped spread the disability rights movement beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe 504 occupation created a generation of disability rights activists and advocates who would go on to draft the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. The ADA can be viewed as picking up where 504 left off, handling the more difficult, complex situations. Using Section 504 as a template, the framers of the ADA sought to extend provisions that now applied to government to much of the private sector (notably private employers, stores, hotels, and restaurants). The new law also specifically stated that the ADA would not amend or weaken Section 504. Because of being drafted based on 504, the ADA also framed disability in the context of civil rights rather than as a medical need, using terms such as \"discrimination,\" \"reasonable accommodation,\" and \"otherwise qualified.\" The cross-disability coalitions forged during the 504 protests also ensured that the ADA would employ a broad definition of disability so that it could encompass a wide variety of impairment groups. Like Section 504, the ADA includes people with psychiatric disabilities, alcoholics, and recovered drug addicts (though current drug users are excluded).\n\nActivists formed by the 504 occupation such as Patricia Wright spent the next thirteen years building relationships in Washington that would help pave the way for passing the ADA.\n\nWith thirteen years of Section 504 on the books, framers of the ADA could point to evidence that the earlier law had not led to the massive economic collapse that some had predicted.

Thomas helped in running the first Wesleyan Mission Canarese school in the erstwhile Mysore State. Thomas was a linguist and a Kannada scholar, and was also fluent in Tamil and Bengali. Hodson helped in establishing the Wesleyan Canarese Chapel (now the Hudson Memorial Church) at Nagarthpete in the Bangalore Petah. In 1864, Hodson wrote \"An Elementary Grammar of the Kannada, or Canarese Language\", a treatise on the grammar of the Kannada language.\n\nThomas Hodson was born in 1804, at North Scarle, Lincolnshire, England. In 1829, we came to India as a missionary of the Wesleyan Mission. Initially he was stationed in Calcutta between 1829-1833, where he learned Bengali for nearly 3 years. Between 1833-1836, he was transferred to Bangalore, where he learnt Canarese and Tamil. In 1836, he was appointed to Mysore, and then to Gubbi in 1837. Appointed back to Mysore, he served between 1838-1843. In 1843, he returned to England due to bad health. However, in 1853, he returned to India, and was appointed the Chairman and Superintendent of the Wesleyan Canarese Mission in the Mysore District. Leaving India in March 1878, for England where he died on 9 September 1882.\n\nMary Ann Hodson, the wife of Thomas died on 10 August 1866, aged 68 years, and is buried at the Agram Protestant Cemetery in Bangalore. The Agram cemetery also has the graves of Jane Peach Rice wife of Benjamin Rice of the London Missionary Society who died on 11 March 1864 aged 57, Catherine wife of Matthew Trevan Male of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who died on 29 August 1865 aged 49, Fanny Lees child of Catherine and Matthew Male born 29 January 1861 and died 24 April 1861, and Rev. Alexander Maceallum, Missionary of the Free Church of Scotland died 10 June 1862.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife Mary Ann, Thomas married Sophia Simpson (born 1836) and had another child Margaret Hodson born in 1871. Thomas also had a son from his first marriage, Richard George Hodson (born 1830), who has contributed articles on Bangalore in the Wesleyan Magazine.\n\nArriving in Bangalore from Calcutta, Thomas Hodson and his wife, temporarily lived at the Wesleyan Mission House at the Bangalore Cantonment, along with Rev. Hardy. His initial days was spent learning Kannada and Tamil. In particular, Hodson intended to follow the example of the American missionaries in Ceylon and establish an extensive educational system in Bangalore.\n\nAccording to Captain Woodward of the 32 NI, reporting on 4 November 1832, the Wesleyan Mission was established in the Bangalore Cantonment in 1819. The contact till then was restricted to the Tamil population of the Cantonment and the English soldiers. A Wesleyan Chapel had been established in the Bangalore Cantonment (the present Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road), and services were conducted regularly in Tamil and 1 service every Sunday for the English soldiers. Contact with the Canarese population of the Bangalore Pettah was restricted. For reaching out to the Canarese, Thomas Hodson was learning the language, so he would be able to interact with them.\n\nIn 1832, Hodson was appointed to Bangalore, along with Peter Percival. Wesleyan missionaries were supposed to take up the dual task of educating and preaching to the locals. Around this time, Hodson decided to start a Mission at Gubbi, which a native town in the Mysore Kingdom. The reason for Hodson choosing Gubbi to set up the mission was that, in Bangalore he found that his time and efforts were taken away in preaching to the British and European officers, and he could not concentrate on the local population. However, the Gubbi mission was temporarily abandoned and Hodson returned to Bangalore. In 1834, Hodson purchased about 20 acres of land, just outside the Bangalore Petah (the current United Mission School and College, Unity Buildings, etc.). In the same year, Hodson had to take up the role of Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission. During his tenure, he started an Anglo-Tamil school in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. The reputation of the school spread, and several respected Hindu gentlemen of the Petah, requested Hodson to open a Canarese School in the Petah. Hence, a room was rented within the Fort walls and Canarese (Kannada) school was started. In this room, Hodson preached his first sermon in Canarese in 1835.\n\nFor some time, Hodson was involved in managing the Tamil works at Bangalore. After some time he moved back to Goobie, living out in a tent. Rev. Thomas Cryer took over from Hodson as the Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission. At this time William Arthur (an Irishman, after whom the William Arthur Memorial Church at Goobie is named after) and Peter Batchelor, laymen who came to Madras to run the Church Ministry Service (CMS) Press joined the Wesleyan Mission, and were transferred to the Weslyan Tamil Mission at Bangalore Cantonment. Arthur them moved to Gubbi as the Wesleyan missionary. Thomas Hodson recorded the experiences of the Gubbi Mission in his book \"Old Daniel, or, Memoir of a converted Hindoo: with observations on mission work in the Goobbe circuit and description of village life in India\", which provides an excellent account of village life in the 19th century Mysore State.\n\nAccording to William Arthur, the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was located in the Bangalore Petah, at about 3 miles from the Wesleyan Tamil Mission house. The land for the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was obtained by Thomas Hodson, and was located just outside one of the town gates. Initially, it was a school with a school room which served as the residence of the school master. The school provided English education and considerable number of students were enrolled. Thereafter Mr. Webber was sent to this mission. In 1840, Garrett and Jenkins were appointed as Wesleyan Canarese missionaries, with an authority to build a printing press and a mission-house. Thus was established the Wesleyan Mission Press, with the funding coming from English gentry. The missionaries started to preach in the streets of the petah in the early hours of the day. The sermon was simple Christian concepts such as unity of God, atonement of Christ, etc.\n\nThomas Hodson in 1856, describes Bangalore as consisting of two parts - the Cantonment where the soldiers lived and Tamil was primarily spoken, and the Old Town or the native town (Bangalore Pete) where Kannada was the main language. In both parts a total of 130,000 Indians lived. Further he describes the shops of the Bangalore petah, with mud being used for the walls and the floor, wooden pillars and clay used for flat roofs. There were no windows or any protection from the dust, with a mat from the rooftop for shade. At night, the shops were secured by wooden shutters. The shop-keeper sat on the floor of the shop, or on one of the lower shelves. The traders were cloth merchants, grocers, gold smiths, etc. The shops sold sugarcane, coconut, bananas, rice, sweets which were hung on a string and various grains which were kept in baskets with were smeared with cow-dung. Water carriers carrying water was a common site. There were thousands of moneys which created mischief, but were unharmed by the natives due to their religious beliefs.\n\nThomas Hodson made several sketches about the life in the Bangalore Petah and the Mysore State. Many of these were published as engravings in the 'Wesleyan Juvenile Offering'. The original colour sketches are in museums and in private collections. Some of Hodson's sketches are with the Museum of Sydney, The Rocks.\n\nA series of sketches associated with Thomas Hodson, currently in the possession of the Museum of Sydney could unfortunately not be displayed here, due to licensing issues.

It was made in a series of scales, from a small plaster maquette, through a half-size working model made in plaster and cast in bronze (LH 415), to a full-size version carved in Roman travertine marble in 1957–1958 (LH 416). The final work was installed in 1958 at the World Heritage Centre, the headquarters of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) at the Place de Fontenoy in Paris. This was Moore's last major public commission in which he created a new work for a specific site; he afterwards generally worked from an existing sketch or model.\n\nMoore was commissioned in 1955 to create a sculpture for the piazza in front of UNESCO's new headquarters in Paris, designed by the architect Marcel Breuer. Early ideas included groups of standing or seated figures, such as \"Draped Reclining Woman 1957–58\" and \"Draped Seated Woman 1957–58\", but he settled on a single and more abstract reclining figure for the UNESCO commission. Some of his early drawings are held by the British Museum. \n\nMoore took several maquettes to Paris in February 1957 for UNESCO representatives to select the best one. The selected sculpture depicts the abstracted form of a reclining female human figure, with recognisable arms, torso, and legs, and a disproportionately small head, with hollows representing eyes. Parallels can be drawn with his early stone \"Reclining Figure 1929\" and his elmwood \"Reclining Figure 1935–6\". Moore made the suggestion that the final work should be carved in white stone, to contrast with the dark windows of the building behind, rather than casting it in bronze as originally intended.\n\nMoore completed a half-size working plaster model in August 1957, which measures . This model was made by applying layers of plaster to an armature, the surface of which was then worked with chisels and other tools. \n\nThe plaster working model is held by the Art Gallery of Ontario. The working model (LH 415) was cast in bronze in edition of 7 (5 plus and artists copy, plus one extra cast made for the Tate Gallery), in 1959–1961: three at the Corinthian Art Bronze Foundry in London, two at in Paris, and two at the Hermann Noack foundry in Berlin. One example of the bronze is held by the Tate Gallery (cast 2/5). Other examples are held in the collections of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, the Chicago Art Institute, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (cast 4/5), and the Kunsthaus Zürich (cast 5/5).\n\nThe completed plaster working model was sent to the Société S. Henraux quarry at , near Seravezza and close to Carrara in northern Italy, in September 1957, where it was copied as a full-size version using four large blocks of Roman travertine marble. Moore visited frequently to check on how the work was progressing, and to finish parts roughed out by the Italian workmen. He took his wife Irina and daughter Mary on one trip, and instituted a tradition of taking regular summer holidays in the area, later buying his own cottage. \n\nThe final sculpture (LH 416) was finished in mid-1958, over long and high, and weighing 38 tons, making it one of Moore's largest sculptures. It was installed near the new Y-shaped UNESCO building at the Place de Fontenoy in Paris in October 1958, and it was in place when the building was inaugurated the following month. The sculpture was moved in 1965, when UNESCO extended its offices, and it is now sited near Building IV.\n\n"}
