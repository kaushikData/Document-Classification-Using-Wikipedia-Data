Lehninger\n\nAlbert Lester Lehninger (February 17, 1917 – March 4, 1986) was an American biochemist in the field of bioenergetics. He made fundamental contributions to the current understanding of metabolism at a molecular level. In 1948, he discovered, with Eugene P. Kennedy, that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes, which ushered in the modern study of energy transduction. He is the author of a number of classic texts, including: \"Biochemistry, The Mitochondrion, Bioenergetics \" and, most notably, his series \"Principles of Biochemistry\". The latter is a widely used text for introductory biochemistry courses at the college and university levels.\n\nLehninger was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, US. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in English from Wesleyan University (1939) and went on to pursue both his Masters of Science (1940) and PhD (1942) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His doctoral research involved the metabolism of acetoacetate and fatty acid oxidation by liver cells.\n\nAfter earning his doctorate in biochemistry, Lehninger held various faculty positions at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of Chicago. In 1952, he went to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, assuming the title of DeLamar Professor of the Department of Biological Chemistry. He served in this position until 1978, when he was appointed to the role of University Professor of Medical Sciences. He held this title until his death in 1986.\n\n\n"}

It is taught as part of the school curriculum to all pupils aged 11–16 years old in maintained schools in England.\n\nThe National Curriculum for citizenship in England contributes to the overall aims of the national curriculum, that children should develop as successful learners, confident individuals and responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to society. The Citizenship curriculum is based on key concepts (democracy, justice, rights and responsibilities, identities and diversity) that children need to understand and key processes and skills (critical thinking and enquiry, advocacy and representation, taking informed and responsible action) they need to develop. The National Curriculum for citizenship sets out teaching requirements that address a wide range of content including politics, parliament and government, the operation of the legal system, how the economy functions, the role of the media, human rights, Europe and international relations. Teachers use topical political and social issues to bring citizenship content to life and to help pupils develop key citizenship skills of research, discussion and debate, as well as to represent the views of others, think critically, evaluate and reflect. The Citizenship curriculum aims to develop student's ability to participate in communities and wider society as informed, critical and responsible citizens. The purpose of \"active citizenship\" is to teach students to work together and take practical action, using their Citizenship knowledge and understanding to contribute to a better society. For example, after learning about human rights, diversity and inequality, students might decide to set up a project to address racism in their school or local community. Other examples of active Citizenship projects include starting recycling programmes, setting up student action groups to address bullying or promote fair trade or campaigning to lower the voting age to 16.\n\nA GCSE in \"Citizenship Studies\" is available for students in key stage 4. The three main awarding bodies in England (AQA, OCR and Edexcel) offer this qualification as a full and a short course. The qualification includes a controlled assessment based on an active citizenship project they have taken part in. There is also an A level in Citizenship Studies which is available through AQA. This qualification is valued by leading Universities including the University of Cambridge. More than 500,000 young people have now attained qualifications in Citizenship Studies since 2002.\n\nA review by Sir Jim Rose of the primary national curriculum during 2009, was expected to lead the introduction of citizenship as a statutory part of the primary education during 2010. However, the Education Bill fell at its last hurdle in parliament so the subject remains non-statutory in primary schools. Most primary schools already teach citizenship through their curriculum. Materials to support the teaching of citizenship in primary and secondary schools and in post 16 settings were published by QCA (now the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency).\n\nIn October 2005, the House of Commons Education and Skills Select Committee began an inquiry into Citizenship Education, which reported in March 2007. They took written and oral evidence from a wide range of individuals including a range of Headteachers and Sir Bernard Crick, and organisations including the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Learning and Skills Network, Ofsted, the Association of Citizenship Teachers (ACT), the Citizenship Foundation and the Hansard Society.\n\nThe Committee concluded that \"It is too early to say with any degree of confidence whether citizenship education is producing the wide range of impacts originally hoped for. Initial evidence from small-scale studies and the experience of individual institutions is promising but on its own not enough...The imperative now is to ensure that patchiness [in the provision of citizenship teaching] is not allowed to remain, that high quality provision becomes the norm, and that progress is accelerated. This will require action from those on the ground, but also needs strong support from the DfES and Ministers.\"\n\nComparisons with civic and citizenship education in other countries have been subject to extensive research by the NfER and further information is available at http://www.nfer.ac.uk/research/projects/cels/ and http://www.iea.nl/icces.html\n\nThe Coalition government is currently reviewing the National Curriculum in England. For more see http://www.democraticlife.org.uk\n\nCitizenship studies was introduced as a compulsory subject in the 1990s in Ireland. It is known as CSPE (Civic, Social and Political Education) and is taught to 12- to 16-year-olds. In 2009 it is expected that an additional subject currently under the working title 'Society and Politics' will be offered as a subject to students between 16–18 years of age in secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn France citizenship education is known as ECJS (education civique, juridique et sociale) in the high school and \"éducation civique\" in the middle school and primary school.\n\nAs a response to the terror attacks in Paris on January 7–9, 2015, France announced a new plan to reintegrate citizenship into the French educational system. The plan seeks to restore authority to teachers, reinforce the values of the Republic, and promote community values and service. It includes training for teachers, a yearly charter to be signed by both student and guardian, community service assignments for student misbehavior, and a day of laïcité, or secularism, yearly on December 9.\n\nIn Poland, citizenship is known as WoS (\"Wiedza o Społeczeństwie\", literally \"Knowledge of Society\") and studied as one of the matura subjects.\n\nIn Spain a recent law introduced EpC (Educación para la Ciudadanía). However, a new education law that has passed is going to remove it from the curriculum. See Education for Citizenship (Spain)formation.\n\nIn Finland citizenship education is known as YH, YT or YO. (Yhteiskuntaoppi)\n\nIn Norway citizenship education is the primary mandate of Social Studies.\n\nCitizenship education in Indonesia is nationally designed and implemented.\n\nThere is a curious kind of citizenship education in China which could be called \"peopleship\" education.\n\nIn Honduras, to graduate from 6th grade, students are required to pass the \"Anthem Test\". This test aims to measure students' understanding of the country's history as well as the flag and coat of arms.\n\nThere are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education. Secondly, some educationalists argue that merely teaching children about the theory of citizenship is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflect democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say in decision making. They suggests that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact. Some educationalists relate this criticism to John Dewey (but see critical comments on this interpretation of Dewey: Van der Ploeg, 2016).\n\n\nCitizenship education in schools\nEuropean Citizenship Education\n"}
{"id": "2931151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2931151", "title": "Civic engagement", "text": "Civic engagement\n\nCivic engagement or civic participation is any individual or group activity addressing issues of public concern. Citizens acting alone or together to protect public values or make a change or difference in the community are common types of civic engagement. Civic\nengagement includes communities working together in both political and non-political actions. The goal of civic engagement is to address public concerns and promote the quality of the community.\n\nCivic Engagement “is a process in which people take collective action to address issues of public concern” and is absolutely “instrumental to democracy” (Checkoway & Aldana, 2012). Underrepresentation of groups in the government cause issues faced by groups such as minority, low-income, and younger groups to be overlooked or ignored. In turn, issues for higher voting groups are addressed more frequently causing more bills to be passed to fix these problems (Griffin & Newman, 2008). Understanding all options of civic engagement does develop and “emergence of diversity democracy” which is defined as a way to “influence agency decisions” from ways outside of voting (Checkoway & Aldana, 2013). An informed voter is beneficial for a democracy and the only way for this to occur is through education. One potential solution is to create a mandatory training course for younger voters to learn of the opportunities with civic engagement. Additionally historically lower voter turnout groups may lack basic resources to understand how to register to vote or even how to get to voting locations.\n\nCivic engagement can take many forms—from individual volunteerism, community engagement efforts, organizational involvement and government work such as electoral participation. These engagements may include directly addressing a problem through personal work, community based, or work through the institutions of representative democracy. Many individuals feel a sense personal responsibility to actively engage as a sense of obligation to their community. \"Youth civic engagement\" has similar aims to develop the community environment and cultivate relationships, although youth civic engagement places an emphasis on empowering youth.\n\nA study published by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning & Engagement at Tufts University, divided civic engagement into three categories: civic, electoral, and political voice. Scholars of youth engagement online have called for a broader interpretation of civic engagement that focuses on the purpose behind current institutions and activities and include emerging institutions and activities that achieve the same purposes. These civic engagement researchers suggest that the reduction of civic life into small sets of explicitly electoral behaviors may be insufficient to describe the full spectrum of public involvement in civic life.\nA Civic Engagement reform arose at the beginning of the 21st Century after Robert Putnam's provocative book, Bowling Alone, brought to light changes in civic participation patterns. Putnam argued that despite rapid increases in higher education opportunities that may foster civic engagement, Americans were dropping out of political and organized community life. A number of studies suggested that while more youth are volunteering, fewer are voting or becoming politically engaged.\n\nThe State of the World's Volunteerism Report 2015, the first global review of the power of volunteer voices to help improve the way people are governed, draws on evidence from countries as diverse as Brazil, Kenya, Lebanon and Bangladesh. The UN report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the Sustainable Development Goals, which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.\n\nAt the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 online volunteers from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN E-Government Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.\n\nCivic engagement can foster community participation and government involvement.\n\nAccording to ICMA: Leaders at the Core of Better Communities, these are the benefits of civic engagement:\n\n\nWhen those who serve listen to the citizens, they become better informed of what is needed by the community and generally make better decisions. Miriam Porter states that elected officials should communicate with their citizens to have this better understanding, \"Without this, turmoil, suspicion, and reduction of public trust ensues\".\n\nVolunteering personal time to community projects is widely believed to support the growth of a community as a whole. Community engagement could be found at: Food pantries, community clean-up programs and the like can bolster efforts to create a strong community bond.\n\nCommunity collaboration includes democratic spaces where people are open to discuss concerns for particular issues regarding public interest and means to make the changes necessary. These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).\nColleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.\n\nAccording to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment(TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. \n\nPolitical participation is another key element that is practiced with regularity. Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.\n\nOnline engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their local government that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming advocacy groups pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.\n\nCivic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.\n\nCivic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.\n\nStates implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\". States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.\n\nStates practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol, the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".\n\nTheir research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\". The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.\n\nThe goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement. Director Regina Lawrence of Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life states \"Politics and all other forms of engagement are really about trying to make your community, your state, and your nation a better place to live.\"\nVoter Turnout ensures civic engagement among the state with incentives that promises volunteer organizations, charity, and political involvement with everyone in the community who will have a voice to be heard.\n\nThe state can help promote civic engagement by ensuring fair voter and redistricting processes; by building partnerships among government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private citizens; and by maintaining networks of information about volunteer and charitable opportunities.\n\nOne of the main factors that determine civic engagement among the people is voter turnout. Voter turnout gauges citizens' level of political involvement, an important component of civic engagement—and a prerequisite for maintaining public accountability.\n\n\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, marginalized is defined as \"to put or keep (someone) in a powerless or unimportant position within a society or group\". In diverse communities it is perceived that awareness and participation according to a study, using three different types of community service for the interaction between diverse individuals and understanding each other's perspective and enhancing relationships within the community. In addition, specifically Black Youth, there is an underlying gap of early civic education where there is lack of and where it thrives. According to Hope and Jagers, they studied civic engagement among Black youth using data acquired from the Youth Culture Survey from the Black Youth Project. The assumption is that Black youth who experience racial discrimination are fueled to be aware and participate in politics.\n\nAnother study by Chan describes the effect of the association of development and environmental factors among a group of at-risk youth such as African-Americans and Latino participants who come from low-income families that dwell in inner-city neighborhoods. Their research resulted in variations according to their participants as the racial minority youth were motivated and had aspiring goals for their futures due to early participation in civic engagement activities, but there was no sufficient evidence that this type of mindset will follow them into their adulthood. Looking into another oppressed group, Latinos, according to this report in the New York Times, states between 2000 and 2012 the number of Hispanics eligible to vote increased to an estimate of 10 million, but there is a lack of taking an active approach towards dealing with the issues such as immigration and causing a stir within the Latino community. The Hispanic demographic is becoming a potential influence of power within political polls. To expand on another group that are oppressed is immigrant parents and their children in Jensen's study their concentration is on Asia and Latin America. In their study they sampled a small group from a metropolitan area, the difference between both generations varies as the children who were in high school which is 87.5% were stated to be civically engaged. Whereas for the parents they were not civically engaged in issues but developed \"bilcultural consciousness\" such as sending money back their original country of origin and these participants saw it as their duty in their current state of opportunity to be civically engaged.\n\nCivic engagement, interpersonal trust, and television use – Social capital has been on the decline for years and Putnam looked into why this is. One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.\n\nNowadays, the internet has become the main social media outlet. Xenos and Moy found that the internet does help civic engagement but also give \"unjustifiable euphoria, abrupt and equally unjustifiable skepticism, and gradual realization that web-based human interaction really does have unique and politically significant properties\". We have all the information we want about and candidate at our fingertips, and the wealth of information is creating a more informed body. But with this comes misinformation and the two collide and do the opposite, creating a public with clashing opinions.\n\nThe Knight Foundation outlines four different ways technology can assist in civic engagement. The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production. E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.\n\nThere are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at Center for Civic Participation and Democracy from SNSPA, Romania. Center for Civic Participation and Democracy (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and European level.Created at the National School of Political Science and Public Administration, CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of \"School of governance\". It is run by Remus Pricopie and Dan Sultanescu.\n\nIt can be argued that a fundamental step in creating a functioning society begins with the civic education of children within the community. According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\". Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school. Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.\n\nTo answer this challenge, the incorporation of service-learning into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners. Campus Compact, a coalition of nearly 1200 college presidents (as of 2013) promotes the development of citizenship skills by creating community partnerships and providing resources to train faculty to integrate civic and community-based learning into the curriculum. Building on the acceptance of service learning and civic engagement in higher education, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement in Teaching created the Political Engagement Project in 2003 to develop the political knowledge and skills of college-aged students. The American Democracy Project (ADP) was launched in the same year by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). The American Democracy Project was joined by the American Democracy Commitment, a partnership of community colleges, to sponsor an annual national conference focused on higher education's role in preparing the next generation of informed, engaged citizens. The American Democracy Project also sponsors campus-based initiatives including voter registration, curriculum revision projects, and special days of action and reflection, such as the MLK Day of Service. In a report entitled,\" A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future \"issued in 2012 by the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, a joint project of the U.S. Department of Education and the American Association of Colleges and Universities, the authors argue that higher education must serve as an intellectual incubator and socially responsible partner in advancing civic learning and democratic engagement.\n\nThe report recommends four basic steps to build civic minded institutions:\n\n\nThese higher education-based initiatives endeavor to build in college students, a politically engaged identity while enhancing the capacity to evaluate the political landscape and make informed decisions about participation in our democracy. As evidenced by the growth in coalitions, professional development opportunities and civic education research, institutions of higher education and their association partners are committed to help prepare the next generation of citizens to become tomorrow's \"Stewards of Place\".\n\nMany universities, like the University of Minnesota, have begun to focus on increasing the civic engagement of students and have mandated that educators begin incorporating it into several school activities. Edwin Fogelman, author of \"Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,\" states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.\n\nSome schools such as Widener University, have made civic engagement a core goal of the university. The university strives to get students involved in the local community to become more aware and civically engaged. (Civic Engagement And Service Learning In A Metropolitan University: Multiple Approaches And Perspectives).\n\nIn January 2012, the U.S. Department of Education issued a road map and a call to action entitled \"Advancing Civic Learning and Engagement in Democracy \" that offers nine steps to enhancing the Department of Education's commitment to civic learning and engagement in democracy.\n\nThese steps include:\n\n"}

The last two decades have seen a significant growth in the mobility of higher education programs and providers through physical and virtual modes of delivery. This presents many new opportunities such as improved access to higher education, strategic alliances between countries and regions, as well as the expansion of human resource and institutional capacity. May students in cross-border education are \"glocal students\" who seek global education at local cost.\n\nThe \"provider country\" is the source country of the program, qualification or other intellectual property (e.g. component of a course of study) that is delivered in another country.

Given the diversity of regulatory environment, it is often difficult to assure quality at the same time protect students' interests.\n\nThe increasing movement of education between countries means education is becoming increasingly “globalized”. As a consequence, educational products have been regarded as a trade commodity. It has become increasingly tied to the market and consumer demand, as well as to the need to make financial returns for providers. When consumer demand and the need to make financial returns become factors in influencing the offer of educational provision, it can create tension with other priorities such as academic standards, autonomy and integrity.

Burchard, who was gay, testified as an expert witness in several court cases involving prosecutions on grounds of Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexual practices.\n\nBurchard was born in Heilsberg (modern Lidzbark Warmiński, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship). He studied medicine in Tübingen, Würzburg and Kiel, taking his doctoral degree in 1900 with a dissertation on \"Einige Fälle von vorübergehender Glycosurie\". After his studies, he worked as a physician in Berlin and opened his own practice. Here he met Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld and joined him to found the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee along with the pastor Georg Plock and Baron Hermann von Teschenberg.\n\nBurchard had a successful career in medicine. After several years as a general practitioner in Berlin, he assisted Hirschfeld in starting the Scientific Humanitarian Committee with publisher Max Spohr, lawyer Eduard Oberg and writer Max von Bülow. The group aimed to undertake research to defend the rights of homosexuals and to repeal Paragraph 175, the section of the German penal code that had criminalized homosexual acts between men since 1871. They argued that the law encouraged blackmail, and the motto of the Committee, \"Justice through science\", reflected Hirschfeld's belief that a better scientific understanding of homosexuality would eliminate hostility toward homosexuals. Hirschfeld was a tireless campaigner and became a well-known public figure.\n\nBenedict Friedländer and some others left the Scientific Humanitarian Committee and formed another group, the \"Bund für männliche Kultur\" or \"Union for Male Culture\", which however did not exist long. It argued that male-male love is a simple aspect of virile manliness rather than a special condition.\n\nThe Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, under Hirschfeld's leadership, managed to gather over 5000 signatures from prominent Germans for a petition to overturn Paragraph 175. Signatories included Albert Einstein, Hermann Hesse, Käthe Kollwitz, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Rainer Maria Rilke, August Bebel, Max Brod, Karl Kautsky, Stefan Zweig, Gerhart Hauptmann, Martin Buber, Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Eduard Bernstein.\n\nThe bill was brought before the Reichstag in 1898, but was only supported by a minority from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, prompting a frustrated Hirschfeld to consider the controversial strategy of \"outing\" — that is, forcing some of the prominent lawmakers who had remained silent out of the closet. The bill continued to come before parliament, and eventually began to make progress in the 1920s before the takeover of the Nazi party obliterated any hopes for reform.\n\nHe and Hirschfeld co-authored several articles on sexology. In 1913, Burchard published his books \"Zur Psychologie der Selbstbezichtigung\" and \"Der sexuelle Infantilismus\", and in 1914 he published his \"Lexikon des gesamten Sexuallebens\". Burchard also wrote lyric poems for the gay periodicals \"Der Eigene\" and \"Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen\", including the poem \"Vivat Fridericus\". Burchard died on February 5, 1920, in Berlin and was buried at the \"Luisenfriedhof\" cemetery.\n\n\nThe German director Rosa von Praunheim made the film Der Einstein des Sex in 1999, based on the life of Magnus Hirschfeld.\n\n\n"}

Funded by tuition and philanthropic grants, they were created by parents, teachers, and students in opposition to contemporaneous schooling practices across the United States and organized without central organization, usually small and grassroots with alternative curricula. Their philosophical influence stemmed from the counterculture, A. S. Neill and Summerhill, child-centered progressive education of the Progressive Era, the Modern Schools, and Freedom Schools. Influential voices within the movement included Paul Goodman, Edgar Z. Friedenberg, Herb Kohl, Jonathan Kozol, and James Herndon, with titles such as A. S. Neill's 1960 \"Summerhill\", George Dennison's 1969 \"The Lives of Children\", and Jonathan Kozol's 1972 \"Free Schools\". The movement's transference of ideas was tracked through the \"New Schools Exchange\" and American Summerhill Society.\n\nThe definition and scope of schools self-classified as \"free schools\" and their associated movement were never clearly delineated, and as such, there was a wide variation between schools. The movement did not subscribe to a single ideology, but its \"free schools\" tended to fall into the binaries of either utopian cultural withdrawal from external concerns, or built on the legacy of freedom schools with direct political address of social injustices. This dicotomy was also seen in the type of students the school attracted with the aforementioned being of white, middle class students and the second usually poor, black, and inner-city. Some schools practiced participatory democracies for self-governance. The \"free schools\" movement was also known as the \"new schools\" or \"alternative schools movement\". Author Ron Miller defined the free school movement's principles as letting families choose for their children, and letting children learn at their own pace.\n\nAllen Graubard charted the growth of the free schools from 25 in 1967 to around 600 in 1972, with estimates of 200 created between 1971 and 1972. These schools had an average enrollment of 33 students. Almost all of the first American free schools were based on Summerhill and its associated book. Many of the schools were started in nontraditional locations, including parks, churches, and abandoned buildings.\n\nThe movement peaked in 1972 with hundreds of schools opened and public interest in open education.\n\nThe movement subsided with the rise of 1970s conservatism, particularly due to the Nixon administration's education policies.\n\n\"The Huffington Post\" wrote in 2012 that \"the movement is revving up again\", citing Education Revolution's listing of over 100 free schools in America. The schools are mostly private in America, and generally serve middle and upper-middle-class families. Author Ron Miller credits the rise of standardization with grassroots interest in alternative schools. CBS News reported in 2006 that the remaining free schools, while unknown in number, are \"democratic\", as the students share in the school's governance.\n\nEducation historian Diane Ravitch said in 2004 that these schools function best for students from educated families due to the free schools' emphasis on individual contribution. Victoria Goldman of \"The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools and Selective Public Schools\" and E. D. Hirsch, Jr. echoed similar thoughts, with Hirsch adding that \"it doesn't work for children who haven't had those advantages.\" Ravitch believed that the free schools' values would conflict with predominant student testing trends.\n\n\n"}

Membership is open to all, and the organization is self-governing.\n\nThe Friends of the Vermont State House describes it mission as \"a non-profit corporation dedicated to the fulfillment of the Capitol building's full potential as the structure of first importance to Vermont. To accomplish this, the Friends focus on conservation and restoration of the Capitol's historic integrity and promotion of public appreciation of the building and its collections. We work in close cooperation with the Legislature and government officials to ensure that the historic and symbolic dignity of the building continues to enhance the vital continuing function it fills.\"\n\nIn the early 1980s the Friends commissioned a master plan for the long term restoration of the building. Research was undertaken using historic documents, photographs, stereoscope views, drawings, and plans for the 1859 building. The Friends funded a curator and tour guide coordinator, both positions the state government came to realize deserved state funding. The master plan examined the whole building through its history, giving consideration to the range of period styles various rooms had undergone over time. Much of the initial work was towards negating the results of a 1970 renovation that paid little attention to historic scholarship. As the plan emerged, a complex schedule based on the building's heavy use during the legislative session needed to be negotiated. Over the course of twenty years, a dramatic transformation has occurred. The two main legislative chambers have been restored to their 1859 appearance. Period furniture upholstered in a vinyl product in the 1970s were restored using authentic silk satin, silk velvet, and horsehair fabrics. Complex period carpeting was rewoven and installed, chandeliers and sconces were restored, and new drapery based on old photographs were recreated and hung. Today, the Vermont State House shines; the \"New York Times\" has described it as being \"like a Fabergé egg.\" Whereas the taxpayers may finance large ticket items, like new carpeting and restoration of plaster, the Friends help acquire special pieces with a history associated with the State House. Recently, the Friends acquired a c. 1858 bronze desk lamp with the sculptor Hiram Powers' figure of the \"Greek Slave\" cast in ormolu. The Friends are currently working on a new book documenting the history of the State House.\n\nThe Friends of the Vermont State House have raised and spent well over a million dollars on the building's restoration. Funding comes from membership; individual contributions; sale of books and items in their gift shop, \"Under the Dome\"; and through special events, many held in the State House. The Friends receive major funding from Cabot Creamery Cooperative, National Life Group, The Preservation Trust of Vermont, and Rock of Ages Corporation.\n\nThrough special events, and lectures, but more often through on-site interpretation by volunteer tour guides, the Friends help tourists, local residents, and sometimes even members of the General Assembly, better know and appreciate the State House. The Friends have brought historic preservation architects, artisans and crafts people, historians, musicians, and writers to the State House for public events. Volunteer tour guides take groups through the State House and show the real life workings of Vermont's seat of government.\n\n"}

{"id": "29278708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29278708", "title": "History of Heidelberg University", "text": "History of Heidelberg University\n\nThe history of Heidelberg University starts from its founding in 1386.\n\nAround 1400, the city of Heidelberg had approximately 3,000 inhabitants, but the Great Schism in 1378, which split European Christendom into two hostile groups made it possible for this relatively small city to get its own university.\n\nThe Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year. One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals). The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.\n\nRupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately lead to the creation of the Papal Bull for the Foundation of a university. After having received on October 23, 1385 the permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies (), the final decision to found the university was taken on June 26, 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine. As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.\n\nOn October 18, 1386, a special Pontifical High Mass in the \"Heiliggeistkirche\" commemorated the opening of the doors of the university. On October 19, 1386, the first lecture was held, making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany. In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university. As a motto for the seal, he chose \"semper apertus\"—i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"\n\nThe university grew up quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university\n\nThe newly created university acted from the outset as an intellectual center for theology and jurisprudence scholars from throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Nominalism had been prevalent from the time of Marsilius until after 1406, when Jerome of Prague, the friend of John Hus, introduced realism at Heidelberg, on which account he was expelled by the faculty. Six years later, the teachings of John Wycliffe were also condemned. Between 1414 and 1418, several distinguished professors of Heidelberg University took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm, and had John Hus executed as a heretic. In 1432, the university, pursuant to papal and imperial requests, sent two delegates to the Council of Basle who faithfully supported the legitimate pope.\n\nThe transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity of provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefice to secular professors.\n\nMartin Luther's disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany. With the Palatinate's turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinsitic institution. In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school. As the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matthäus Merian taught at the university. It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center. However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.\nAs a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits. In 1735, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borromæum, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward, and the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Meyer labored as director. In connection with the commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the university, a revised statute book, which several of the professors had been commissioned to prepare, was approved by the elector. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that period, the number of students varied from 300-400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated. As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.\n\nIt was not until 1803 that this decline stopped. In this year, the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.\nThe German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity. The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school. The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University. Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them. In the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber. Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.\n\nWith the advent of the Third Reich in 1933, the university supported the Nazis like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racist reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors that did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror.\n\nOn 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at \"Universitätsplatz\" (\"University Square\") and Heidelberg was eventually infamous as NSDAP university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from \"The Living Spirit\" to \"The German Spirit\", and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in Nazi eugenics : forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychiatric clinic then directed by Carl Schneider was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.\n\nAll universities in the American zone were closed. In April 1945, the Counter Intelligence Corps (aka CIC) started investigating on the University nazi activities and at the same time contributed to set up the \"Committee of Thirteen\" aiming at the re-opening of the University. This group of professors among which antinazi economist Alfred Weber and philosopher Karl Jaspers prepared a new constitution for the university. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to \"The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity\".\n\nIn 1945 and 1946, the university underwent an extensive denazification. Since Heidelberg was spared from destruction during WWII, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly.\n\nBecause of their role during the nazi era, the student corporations () were forbidden by the American authorities. These dueling fraternities were not included either in the plans for a democratic university of the Committee of Thirteen. Inspired by the English colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, Professor Karl Heinrich Bauer who would become the first rector after the war, proposed the foundation of the \"Collegium Academicum\".\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing student protests in Germany. In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament AStA. Shortly thereafter, the building of the \"Collegium Academicum\", a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the universities main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. The Collegium was dissolved in 1975 and the \"old barracks\" () were refurbished and transformed into administration buildings. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.\n\nToday, about 28,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University. There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors. In 2007, the university was appointed \"University of Excellence\" within the scope of an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation to enhance the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate a strong international appeal.\n\n"}
{"id": "14236113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14236113", "title": "How Children Fail", "text": "How Children Fail\n\nHow Children Fail is a non-fiction book by John Holt that was published in 1964 and republished in 1982 in a revised edition. It has sold over a million copies. In it, he cites personal teaching and research experiences that led him to the belief that traditional schooling does more harm than good to a child's ability and desire to truly learn.\n\nIn \"How Children Fail,\" John Holt states that children love to learn but hate to be taught. His experiences in the classroom as a teacher and as a researcher brought him to conclude that every child is intelligent. However, children become unintelligent because they are accustomed by teachers and schools to strive only for teacher approval and the “right\" answers and consequently forget everything else. There, children see value not in thinking, discovery, and understanding but only in playing the power game of school.\n\nChildren believe that they must please and obey the teacher, the adults, at all costs. They learn how to manipulate teachers to gain clues about what the teacher really wants. Through the teacher’s body language, facial expressions and other clues, they learn what might be the right answer. They mumble, straddle the answer, get the teacher to answer their own question, and take wild guesses while waiting to see what happens, all in order to increase the chances for a right answer.\n\nWhen children are very young, they have natural curiosity about the world, trying diligently to figure out what is real. As they become \"producers\" rather than \"thinkers,\" they fall away from exploration and start fishing for the right answers with little thought. They believe that they must always be right and so quickly forget mistakes and how the mistakes were made. They believe that the only good response from the teacher is a yes and that a no is a defeat.\n\nThey fear wrong answers and shy away from challenges because they may not have the right answer. That, in the school setting, does their thinking and learning a great disservice. A teacher's job is to help them overcome their fears of failure and explore the problem for real learning s often, teachers are doing the opposite, building children’s fears up to monumental proportions. Children need to see that failure is honorable and that it helps them construct meaning. It should not be seen as humiliating but as a step to real learning. Being afraid of mistakes, they never try to understand their own mistakes and cannot and will not try to understand when their thinking is faulty. Adding to children's’s fear in school is corporal punishment and humiliation, both of which can scare children into right/wrong thinking and away from their natural exploratory thinking.\n\nHolt maintains that when teachers praise students, they rob them of the joy of discovering truth for themselves. They should be aiding them by guiding them to explore and learn as their interests move them. In mathematics, children learn algorithms, but when faced with problems with Cuisenaire rods, they cannot apply their learning to real situations. Their learning is superficial in that they can sometimes spit out the algorithm when faced with a problem on paper, but they have no understanding of how or why the algorithm works and no deep understanding about numbers.\n\nHolt believes that end of year achievement tests do not show real learning. Teachers (Holt included) generally cram for these tests in the weeks preceding. Meanwhile, the material learned is forgotten shortly after the tests because it was not motivated by interest and has no practical use.\n\n"}

He attended the then all-black Southern University, at which he was a member of the Reserve Corps program. He was quickly called to active duty in the United States Army, in which he served until his discharge in 1945 at the rank of Sergeant 4th Class. For fifteen years thereafter, he owned and operated an Esso service station in Baton Rouge.\n\nEven before he entered politics, he was involved in bringing Little League competition to Scotlandville. In 1972, Newman won the first of his three four-year term on the East Baton Rouge Parish Council as the representative from the Scotlandville area. In 1983, he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives to succeed Joseph Delpit, who had also been the first African American city council member from Baton Rouge. Newman served a single term in the House from 1984 to 1988 which corresponded with the third term of Governor Edwin Edwards. He defeated the 31-year-old lawyer Kip Holden, later the first black to serve as Baton Rouge Mayor-President. Through his \"Help Our People for East Baton Rouge\" program, Representative Newman in 1985 raised $14,000 through bingo games to keep open three food stamp offices in north Baton Rouge, which had been marked for closure under state budget restraints. In the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary, Holden unseated Newman. The two subsequently became warm friends.\n\nAfter his legislative term, Newman continued to work as a community organizer. He served on the boards of the American Cancer Society and several organizations seeking to control narcotics, the predecessors to the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program in public schools. He also worked against alcohol abuse through Mothers Against Drunk Driving. His activities paved the way for the first community centers in Baton Rouge. He sat on the board of the Foster Grandparents Program and the Louisiana Lottery Corporation. An active Roman Catholic, Newman served on the board for Catholic Community Services in the Diocese of Baton Rouge. He was a member of the charitable St. Vincent de Paul Society of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. With other craftsmen from St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Newman helped to build the Immaculate Conception sanctuary, which was completed in 1959. He managed the St. Vincent de Paul dining room for two years in Baton Rouge until sidelined by illness. He also worked to establish the Bishop Ott shelters and a thrift store for the needy.\n\nOn October 4, 2014, Newman died at the age of ninety-three. He was survived by his wife of more than a half-century, the former Sallie Gillespie Newman (born September 1928); children, Brenda Joyce Cooks (born May 1948), Linda Cooks Narcisse (born January 1950) and husband Johnny S. Narcisse (born December 1949), Edwin Cooks (born April 1951) and wife Jocelyn H.Cooks (born May 1953), Urlecia Cooks, and eight grandchildren. He was preceded in death by two other daughters, Constance Newman Douglas and Karen Newman Norris (1948-2005). A memorial mass was held on October 11, 2014, at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. Newman donated his body to the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans.\n\nJoseph Delpit called Newman \"the hardest-working elected official I knew, including me ... There wasn't a person who needed help that Jewel would not get out of his bed at midnight to see about helping him.\"\n\nMayor Holden said that Newman, who later became his mentor, \"paid special attention to the needs of people in the district he represented, which is also the district I grew up in. If someone called to say they [sic] had a problem with their ditch, he would go out to the home himself to see what the problem was.\"\n\nThe Jewel J. Newman Community Center on Central Road off Interstate 110 North is named in his honor.\n"}
{"id": "603717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=603717", "title": "John Gardner (American writer)", "text": "John Gardner (American writer)\n\nJohn Champlin Gardner Jr. (July 21, 1933 – September 14, 1982) was an American novelist, essayist, literary critic and university professor. He is best known for his 1971 novel \"Grendel\", a retelling of the Beowulf myth from the monster's point of view.\n\nGardner was born in Batavia, New York. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught English at a local school. Both parents were fond of Shakespeare and often recited literature together. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank. As a child, Gardner attended public school and worked on his father's farm, where, in April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a cultipacker. Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother's death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks. The incident informed much of Gardner's fiction and criticism — most directly in the 1977 short story \"Redemption,\" which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration.\n\nGardner began his university education at DePauw University, but received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1955. He received his M.A. (1956) and Ph.D. (1958) from the University of Iowa. He was Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Detroit in 1970.\n\nGardner's best-known novels include \"The Sunlight Dialogues\", about a disaffected policeman asked to engage a madman fluent in classical mythology; \"Grendel\", a retelling of the Beowulf legend from the monster's point of view, with an existential subtext; and \"October Light\", about an embittered brother and sister living and feuding with each other in rural Vermont (the novel includes an invented \"trashy novel\" the woman reads). This last book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976.\n\nGardner was a lifelong teacher of fiction writing. He was a favorite at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. His two books on the craft of writing fiction—\"The Art of Fiction\" and \"On Becoming a Novelist\"—are considered classics. He was famously obsessive with his work, and acquired a reputation for advanced craft, smooth rhythms, and careful attention to the continuity of the fictive dream. His books nearly always touched on the redemptive power of art.\n\nIn 1978, Gardner's book of literary criticism, \"On Moral Fiction\", sparked a controversy that excited the mainstream media, vaulting Gardner into the spotlight with an interview on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" (May 16, 1978) and a cover story in \"The New York Times Magazine\" (July, 1979). His judgments of contemporary authors—including such luminaries of American fiction as John Updike and John Barth—which could be termed either direct, courageous, or unflattering, depending on one's perspective—harmed his reputation among fellow writers and book reviewers. Gardner claimed that lingering animosity from critics of this book led to unflattering reviews of what turned out to be his last finished novel, \"Mickelsson's Ghosts\", although literary critics later praised the book. What was seemingly lost in the furor over \"On Moral Fiction\" was Gardner's central thesis: that fiction should distinguish right from wrong.\n\nGore Vidal found the book, as well as Gardner's novels, sanctimonious and pedantic, and called Gardner the \"late apostle to the lowbrows, a sort of Christian evangelical who saw Heaven as a paradigmatic American university.\"\n\nGardner inspired and, according to Raymond Carver, sometimes intimidated his students. At Chico State College (where he taught from 1959 to 1962), when Carver mentioned to Gardner that he had not liked the assigned short story, Robert Penn Warren's \"Blackberry Winter,\" Gardner said, \"You'd better read it again.\" \"And he wasn't joking\", said Carver, who related this anecdote in his foreword to Gardner's book \"On Becoming a Novelist\". In that foreword, he makes it clear how much he respected Gardner and also relates his kindness as a writing mentor.\n\nIn addition to Chico State, Gardner taught at Oberlin College (1958-1959), San Francisco State College (1962-1965), Southern Illinois University Carbondale (1965-1974) and Binghamton University (1976-1982).\n\nIn 1977, Gardner published \"The Life and Times of Chaucer\". In a review in the October 1977 issue of \"Speculum\", Sumner J. Ferris pointed to several passages that were allegedly lifted either in whole or in part from work by other authors without proper citation. Ferris charitably suggested that Gardner had published the book too hastily, but on April 10, 1978, reviewer Peter Prescott, writing in \"Newsweek\", cited the \"Speculum\" article and accused Gardner of plagiarism, a claim that Gardner met \"with a sigh.\"\n\nHe is the author of the famous saying : \"There are only two plots in all literature : a person goes on a journey, a stranger comes to town\".\n\nOn December 10, 1977, Gardner was hospitalized with colon cancer. He remained in Johns Hopkins Hospital for about a month and a half. He struggled with substance abuse (alcoholism and smoking) late in his life.\n\nGardner married Joan Louise Patterson on June 6, 1953; the marriage, which produced children, ended in divorce in 1980. Gardner married poet and novelist Liz Rosenberg in 1980, but this marriage also ended in divorce in 1982.\n\nGardner was killed in a motorcycle accident about two miles from his home in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, September 14, 1982. State Police said that at about 2:30 pm Gardner completed a curve on Route 92 about north of Oakland (41.986246, -75.601200). Passing the home of photographer John Wood, he lost control of his 1979 Harley-Davidson, went into the dirt shoulder, struck the guard rail, and was thrown from the motorcycle, suffering blunt force trauma to his body from his handlebars. He was pronounced dead at Barnes-Kasson Hospital in Susquehanna. Gardner's fiancée, Susan Thornton, stated that Gardner had been drinking the night before the accident. An autopsy revealed Gardner had a blood alcohol level of 0.075; the legal limit for driving at the time was 0.08. Thornton also mentioned exhaustion from overwork as a contributing factor, and that the curve on Route 92 had been freshly-oiled gravel. The crash was four days before his planned marriage to Thornton. He was buried next to his brother Gilbert in Batavia's Grandview Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This scholarship provides non-Korean scholars (or overseas Koreans who fulfil certain criteria) with the funding and opportunity to conduct undergraduate or postgraduate level studies in South Korea after completing one year of intensive Korean language studies. Since its conception in 1967, over 3,000 students from 148 countries have successfully completed the scholarship program.\n\nThe Korean Government Scholarship Program is designed to bring overseas talent to South Korea, and to integrate the scholars into Korean culture and society. If accepted, each scholar typically spends one year in South Korea learning the Korean language, followed by a 2 - 4 year university program, depending on their level of studies. In 2015, 820 students from 162 countries were accepted into the scholarship program. However, 270 scholars failed to obtain their degree in the years 2011 - 2015, citing language and cultural barriers.\n\nEach scholar is provided financial support by the Korean government in the form of a monthly allowance. Undergraduate students receive 800,000 KRW a month whereas graduate students receive 900,000 KRW a month. In addition, NIIED provides airfare to student to and from their home country at the beginning and end of the program. Stipends and other allowances are also given to each scholar.\n\nPrior to starting their degree studies, KGSP scholars are required to take one year of intensive language studies at a designated language institute. All scholars are required to obtain at least level 3 (intermediate) in the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK) before they can continue to their degree studies. According to NIIED, TOPIK level 3 allows the individual to \"perform basic linguistic functions necessary to use various public facilities and maintain social relationships.\"\n\nThe normal duration for the language program is one year, but it can be waived, shortened or extended depending on the scholar's TOPIK results. Scholars who have previously obtained a TOPIK level of 5 or 6 (advanced) are exempted from the language program, and are required to start their studies immediately. If a scholar obtains TOPIK 5 or 6 within the first six months of the language program, then they are required to start their studies at the beginning of the next semester, reducing their time at the language institute by six months. Additionally, scholars who fail to achieve TOPIK 3 after one year of language studies cannot proceed to their degree studies, and must do another six months of language study at their language institute. Students may not leave South Korea during the language program so that they may concentrate on their studies. However, exceptions are made in case of emergencies and family matters .\n\nThe language institute is designated by NIIED and cannot be changed. The language institutes include schools like Keimyung University and Dongseo University, and are typically in a different city than the school chosen for the degree program. This gives each scholar the opportunity to explore multiple cities within South Korea.\n\nThose without a resident visa are required to have a D-4 visa to undergo language studies.\n\nDuring the application process, scholars choose a program and university for their degree program which cannot be changed, barring extreme circumstances. The scholarship program allocates four years for scholars pursuing their bachelor's degree, two years for a master's degree and three years for a PhD. The graduation requirements for each scholar is dependent on their program and university.\n\nScholars who have TOPIK level 5 or greater are granted an additional 100,000 KRW a month for their monthly allowance during their degree studies. Additional money is given to scholars in postgraduate research based fields.\n\nThose without a resident visa are required to have a D-2 visa to undergo their studies.\n\nAs of 2014, citizens from 157 countries are able to apply for KGSP.\n\nAs of 2014, 60 universities are designated by NIIED as eligible institutions for postgraduate degree studies.\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Holistic Designs and published by Take-Two Interactive. It has two sequels: Mall Tycoon 2 (which also had a \"Deluxe\" extended edition) and Mall Tycoon 3.\n\nThe game begins as an empty plot of land upon which the player develops his or her mall. Players can build shops, customize decorations, organize special events such as fashion shows, and manage mall employees. It is important for the player to work out what is profitable and what is not to ensure the survival of the fledgling mall. The mall may become overrun with zombies or aliens which can be eradicated when the player calls upon the Men in Black.\n\nIn the United States, \"Mall Tycoon\" sold 420,000 copies and earned $7.6 million by August 2006, after its release in January 2002. It was the country's 36th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all \"Mall Tycoon\" series entries released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 820,000 units in the United States by the latter date.\n\nThe game received \"generally unfavorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. \"Computer Gaming World\" criticized the game for its wonky camera and frustrating interface. The magazine opined that even the poorly received Airport Tycoon is a better game than Mall Tycoon.\n\n\"Mall Tycoon 2\" is a business simulation game, released in 2003. It is the sequel to \"Mall Tycoon\", which allows the gamer to construct, expand and thereafter manage a shopping mall. It describes itself as the \"Ultimate Mall Experience\".\n\nThe Mall is visited by many types of customers, from children to seniors. There are also criminals among the clientele, who should be caught by the mall's security guards, and visits by dogs, which indicates a low level of hygiene and security. Staff can be hired to perform these duties, such as janitors for cleaning floors, but some of the hiring specifications require background checks, which cost money and affect bottom line.\n\nThe number of stores and the rating also affect the number of customers the mall gets. For every store, five people can fit into your shopping mall, and the higher the rating, the more people come to your mall. The game provides a wide variety of stores. They include electronics, clothing, food, entertainment, sports and services. Many of the more advanced stores need to be researched before they can be constructed. A player can build a mall atrium and arrange monthly events to promote the mall. Such promotions include car shows, a mall oasis and a circus. An \"owner\" also can build restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys and arcades to attract customers. As with hiring research, these new additions also must be researched and evaluated.\n\nFloors may be changed easily and can be customised. Wood is the most common flooring medium, but other types include a puzzle floor for the kids' area and tiles for the food court. Adding floors to the mall is expensive, but is a necessary investment when all vacant areas have been occupied and expanded to their limits.\n\nThe Deluxe version of \"Mall Tycoon 2\" adds certain scenarios, more customer types and other new features.\n\"Mall Tycoon 3\" is a business simulation game, released in 2005. It was developed by Cat Daddy Games and published by Global Star Software. It is the third and final installment in the Mall Tycoon series, after the original \"Mall Tycoon\" and \"Mall Tycoon 2\". The game was released to mixed reviews, getting lower than the previous games.\n\nAfter selecting to play in sandbox mode, three starting locations are given. You may choose to build your mall in a neighborhood, a big city, or beside the beach. One may also choose to play a campaign game instead, and select from several different challenges.\nUnlike in the previous installments of the series, Mall Tycoon 3 allows players to create customized stores. Over 40 types of stores of various types are available for placement in a pre-made store or a player may design their own, putting in everything from sale signs to the merchandise racks. Also customizable are the employees; their job capabilities and personal appearances are adjustable. In addition to regular in-line stores, there are also a handful of kiosks, such as one that sells cellular phones.\n\nIn the first two Mall Tycoon games, stores were created by placing the set store size, and then adding a store to them. In Mall Tycoon 3, the player paints the floor to create a store, allowing for them to be of any shape or size.\n\nMall Tycoon 3 features a total of 5 buildable mall levels.\n"}

She is the widow of Sir Hugh Lloyd-Jones, former Regius Professor Emeritus of Greek at Oxford University.\n\nLefkowitz earned her B.A. from Wellesley College in 1957, \"Phi Beta Kappa\" with honors in Greek, and received her Ph.D. in Classical Philology from Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard University) in 1961. She returned to Wellesley College in 1959 as an instructor in Greek. In 1979 she was named Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities, a position she held until her retirement in 2005. Lefkowitz holds an honorary degree from Trinity College (1996), which cited her \"deep concern for intellectual integrity,\" and also from the University of Patras (1999) and from Grinnell College (2000).

{"id": "530021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=530021", "title": "Mathcounts", "text": "Mathcounts\n\nMathcounts, stylized as MATHCOUNTS, is a nationwide middle school mathematics competition held in various places in the United States. Its founding sponsors include the CNA Foundation, the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.\n\nThe subject matter includes geometry, counting, probability, number theory, and algebra.\n\nThe competition is divided into four stages: school, chapter, state, and national. The problems increase in difficulty between levels, such that school-level problems are rather simple while national-level problems are extremely challenging. Each school is allowed to register ten students, including a group of four designated as the school team.\n\nThe top two teams as well as the top four individuals from each Chapter competition advance to States. The exact number of qualifiers varies from chapter to chapter, because sometimes the 3rd place team or even both the 3rd place and 4th place teams from a chapter might qualify for States. At the State Round, only the top 4 individuals reach Nationals. The coach of the first place team at States becomes the coach for that state at Nationals. At the National Competition, all the competitors compete individually, in the Sprint and Target Rounds, but also, the four individuals from each state compete in the team round to represent their state. \n\nThe Mathcounts program is open to sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade students in 56 U.S. states and territories. Students can participate through the Competition Program, the Club Program, and the Real Math Challenge. Prior to 2010, homeschools and virtual schools were allowed to compete in all aspects of the program. In the 2010–2011 program year, such schools were limited to individual participation with one exception: homeschool clubs that participated as a team in 2009–2010 were grandfathered into the 2010–2011 competition. Starting with the 2010–2011 program year, the Board of Directors established new guidelines that again allowed home and virtual schools to participate both as individuals and as members of a team.\n\nThe standard Mathcounts competition contains four rounds: Sprint, Target, Team, and Countdown. At some state competitions, the top four contestants, determined by the Countdown Round, participate in the Masters Round. Some state and regional competitions add extra rounds, such as the Ciphering round.\n\nIn the Sprint Round, contestants solve a written exam consisting of 30 problems with a time limit of 40 minutes. There are no penalties for incorrect answers. Calculators are not permitted, and contestants work individually.\n\nQuestions in the Sprint Round are usually the easiest problems in the written individual contests because the Sprint Round is intended to test contestants' ability to solve problems within a tight time constraint. The problems generally increase in difficulty so that nearly all students can solve the first few problems while few to none correctly answer the last few. Sprint round questions are worth one point each. Contestants work individually.\n\nThe Target Round contains eight problems, presented in four pairs of two. Students have six minutes to work on each pair of problems. Calculators may be used during this round. The problems in the Target Round are usually more difficult than most of the problems in the Sprint Round. Each correctly answered problem is worth two points. The problems generally increase in difficulty as the round progresses. Contestants work individually.\n\nThe Team Round is a ten question exam which teams have twenty minutes to complete. Calculators are allowed, and up to four teammates take the examination as a group. Contestants are allowed to discuss the problems with their teammates. Team round problems are typically more difficult than those on the individual rounds. Each question is worth two points.\n\nThe Countdown Round is a fast-paced head-to-head competition. It is the only oral round, and it is the final round in most Mathcounts competitions. The Countdown Round is an optional round at State and Chapter competitions. At some competitions, including Nationals, the winner of the Countdown Round is considered the overall champion. Otherwise, the round is purely for fun. Calculators are not allowed in the Countdown Round. The National Countdown Round was shown on ESPN from 2003 to 2005, and now it is presented in a webcast every year.\n\nThe Countdown Round consists of several matches in which two students are pitted head to head. A problem is displayed by a projector, and the two contestants race to finish the problem (with pencil and paper). Forty-five seconds are allotted per problem. Upon finishing the problem, a contestant is expected to press his/her buzzer. The first person to buzz in with the correct answer gains a point. If an incorrect answer is given, the contestant will not get a point and is not allowed to buzz in again. It is not uncommon for a contestant to press their buzzer before actually solving the problem, intending to make use of the allotted 3 seconds to finish solving the problem.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2003, the National Countdown Round was a head-to-head ladder-style competition. The tenth and ninth-place finishers on the written portion played a match; the loser was ranked tenth while the winner played against the eighth-place competitor. The loser of this match ranked ninth while the winner moved on to play against the seventh-place student. This continued until a challenger reached the first-place student; the loser of this final match ranked second while the winner was declared the champion. It is from this pattern of the tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, etc. that the name \"Countdown\" was derived. This format is still used in many Chapter and State competitions, in part because Mathcounts requires that this structure be used if the Countdown Round will determine the final individual rankings.\n\nBeginning in 2004, the format of the Countdown Round at the national competition changed to a weighted single elimination bracket. The top twelve scorers on the written portion advance to the Countdown Round. In the first round, the top four scorers on the written portion received a bye into the second round leaving the fifth place to face off against the twelfth place, and the sixth place to face off against the eleventh place, etc. This change was presumably made to ensure that the final round would be more exciting and more suspenseful, since now the champion must win at least three consecutive matches, while previously a student could potentially win the championship after defeating a single opponent. \n\nThis round has been replaced by the Math Video Challenge in current years. At the national level and in some states, there is an additional round known as the Masters Round, open only to the top four contestants. Participants are given thirty minutes to develop a fifteen-minute oral presentation based upon an advanced mathematical topic, not known to them before their preparation time begins. While an award is given for the best presentation as determined by a panel of judges, the Masters Round does not affect participants' rankings. \n\nIn some states (most notably Florida), at both the chapter and state levels, there is an extra Ciphering Round. In this round, which does not count for overall individual or team scores, each school sends one representative to a stage. A problem is then flashed up on a projector screen, and competitors, working individually, have one minute to answer. No calculators are allowed. Using a buzzer system, the judges then determine the order in which the students determined their answers. The first person to answer correctly earns his/her school five points, the second person four points, etc. After four questions, each school switches their representative. The process is repeated four times so that each team member has a chance to compete in a round. The winner of this round is the school that accumulates the most points. Because no calculators are allowed, competitors must be able to do calculations quickly and mentally.\n\nScholarships are awarded to high-ranking students at the national competition, and many universities give scholarships to the top finishers at the state level. Some math summer programs, such as MathPath, give out scholarships to top Mathcounts students. Some of Mathcounts' other sponsors, such as Texas Instruments, General Motors, and Lockheed Martin, also provide scholarships.\n\nQualification for Mathcounts scholarships usually vary by state, but scholarships and prizes are often awarded to the top ten individuals and the top three state teams at the national level. Raytheon offers scholarships to undergraduate students who volunteer as coaches for Mathcounts teams.\n\nEach contestant's individual score is equal to his or her Sprint Round score (out of 30) plus twice his or her Target Round score (out of 8). A perfect score is 46.\n\nAt the Chapter and State levels, ranking is determined by either raw individual score or by the results of the Countdown Round, depending on the state/chapter. Ties are broken by comparing performance on the Sprint Round. If contestants are still tied, the last five problems of the Sprint Round are compared. If contestants are still tied, pairs of Target problems are used to break ties. Occasionally, a tie-breaker round may be needed if the contestants have answered exactly the same questions correctly and incorrectly.\n\nAt the National Competition, ranking on the written portion is used to determine seeding in the Countdown round. The final place is determined by performance in the countdown round. \n\nA team's score is equal the average of the sum of its members' individual scores plus twice the number of questions answered correctly on the team round. With the individual scores of a maximum of 46 each and team-round scores a maximum of 20, a perfect team score is 66.\n\nMathcounts was started in 1983 by the National Society of Professional Engineers, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and CNA Foundation to increase middle school interest in mathematics. The first national-level competition in the modern format was held in 1984. Before 2002, every national Mathcounts competition was held in Washington, D.C. The competition spread quickly in middle schools, and today it is the best-known middle school mathematics competition.\n\nEach year, at the National level, teams of four students per state compete. The top team as well as the participants in the Countdown round often win a trip to the White House and meet the current President of the United States. They also may receive scholarships from Mathcounts' sponsors. The 2018 National Competition was hosted in Washington D.C.\n\n!Year\n!Individual winner\n!State-team winner\n!Winning-state coach\n!Location\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n\n\n"}

One-third of all schools nominated in any state must serve student populations of at least 40% from disadvantaged backgrounds. \n\nMore than 8,000 schools have been honored as National Blue Ribbon Schools since the program's founding in 1982.\n\nIn 1981, then-Secretary of Education Terrel H. Bell commissioned a study of American education. The report, issued two years later as \"A Nation at Risk\", described a “rising tide” of mediocre schools that threatened the nation’s future.\n\nSecretary Bell created the National Blue Ribbon Schools Award to bring exemplary U.S. schools to public attention and to recognize those schools whose students thrived and excelled. Working with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, Bell launched the National Blue Ribbon Schools and the National Distinguished Principals Programs. Both programs highlighted outstanding models of American schools and school leadership.\n\nInitially, the National Blue Ribbon Schools program honored only secondary schools; it was later expanded to include primary schools. It was changed again to honor secondary schools and primary schools in alternate years and now honors secondary, middle, elementary, and K-8 and K-12 schools each year. In 2003, the program was restructured to bring it in line with the No Child Left Behind Education Law, placing a stronger emphasis on state assessment data and requiring schools to demonstrate high academic success. Schools must show how data are interpreted and used and how curriculum, instruction, professional development, and student support promote student success.\n\nIn 2012 the program was renamed the National Blue Ribbon Schools program to distinguish it from a for-profit company which had appropriated the Blue Ribbon School name.\n\nDuring its first 25 years of existence, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Award was granted approximately 5,600 times, recognizing 5,200 different schools. (Some schools have been selected two or more times.) More than 133,000 public, charter, private and parochial schools serving grades K-12 are eligible for the award. More than 8,000 schools have been honored as National Blue Ribbon Schools since the program's inception.\n\nStates, territories, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Department of Defense Education Activity schools have joined the competition over the years. Special emphases have changed from year to year based on national priorities. Among National Blue Ribbon Schools there is much diversity: the award recognizes rural, urban, and suburban schools; large and small schools, and public and non-public schools.\n\nThe National Blue Ribbon Schools Program accepts nominations of both public and non-public schools that meet one of two criteria:\n\n• Exemplary High Performing Schools are among their state’s highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. \n\n• Exemplary Achievement Gap-Closing Schools are among their state’s highest performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school’s subgroups and all students over the past five years. \n\nEligible schools must have been in existence for five years and cannot have received the award within the five prior years.\n\nMust have excellence in the fields of academics, arts and athletics.\n\nAlthough at one time schools self-nominated for the award, this is no longer the case. At the invitation of the U.S. Secretary of Education, Chief State School Officers (including Washington, DC, the Department of Defense Education Activity, the Bureau of Indian Education) and the Council for American Private Education nominate eligible schools for the annual award. Eligible schools must demonstrate high or strongly improving student scores on state or nationally normed assessments in the last year tested; schools must also make Annual Yearly Progress in accordance with No Child Left Behind.\n\nNominated schools submit applications describing school operations such as the use of assessments and assessment data, instructional methods, curricula, professional development, leadership, and community and family involvement. A total of 420 schools may be nominated in any year; state quotas are determined by numbers of students and schools.\n\nThe Blue Ribbon award is considered the highest honor an American school can achieve. A school's use of the National Blue Ribbon Schools logo is restricted. \n\nDavid W. Kirkpatrick, the Senior Education Fellow at the US Freedom Foundation, noted in an editorial titled, \"Awarding Blue Ribbons: Recognizing Schools or Students?\" that criteria for the awards do not take into account the socioeconomic status of the students and that studies show that students who come from homes with higher income and better educated parents do better than students without these advantages by virtue of their backgrounds. Thus, the award is usually given to schools with students from wealthy backgrounds. As evidence to support his case, he pointed to the distribution of awards given in Pennsylvania one year; of eight schools receiving the award, only one was in a district whose income level was near the state average, and the rest went to districts with above average income, including two in the wealthiest community in the state. Kirkpatrick proposed an alternative to recognizing \"blue ribbon students\"; he wrote, \"Thus a more accurate indication of a good school would be one that adjusts for such socioeconomic factors and identifies those in which students do better than would normally be expected, based on their backgrounds.\"\n\nFrom the program's inception through 2003, schools were permitted to nominate themselves. As of 2003 nominations are handled through a state liaison which schools must contact for nomination.\n\nThe program has also been criticized for assessment of schools coming from the school itself rather than an independent 3rd party and a nomination and assessment process that favors schools with the know-how and resources to complete the review assessment.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1963, the conference links a general audience with the world's foremost scholars and researchers in conversations centered on contemporary issues related to the natural and social sciences. It is the first ongoing academic conference in the United States to have the official authorization of the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nGustavus Adolphus College was founded by Swedish immigrants in 1862 and throughout its history, has continued to honor its Swedish heritage. As the College prepared to build a new science hall in the early 1960s, College officials asked the Nobel Foundation for permission to name the building the Alfred Nobel Hall of Science as a memorial to the great Swedish inventor and philanthropist. Permission was granted, and the facility's dedication ceremony in 1963 included 26 Nobel laureates and officials from the Nobel Foundation.\n\nFollowing the 1963 Nobel Prize ceremonies in Stockholm, College representatives met with Nobel Foundation officials, asking them to endorse an annual science conference at the College and to allow use of the Nobel name to establish credibility and high standards. At the urging of several prominent Nobel laureates, the foundation granted the request and the first conference was held at the College in January 1965.\n\nFor four and a half decades, world-class research scientists and scholars have come together to discuss leading topics in science with audiences of thousands.\n\nThe goal of the conference is to bring cutting-edge science issues to the attention of an audience of students and interested adults, to engage the panelists and the audience in a discussion of the moral and societal impact of these issues, and to continue to attract world class speakers. Beginning with the help of an advisory committee composed of Nobel laureates such as Glenn Seaborg, Philip Showalter Hench, and Sir John Eccles, the conferences have been consistently successful in attracting the world's foremost authorities as speakers.\n\nPast speakers have included David H. Hubel, Fritz Lipmann, Sir Harold Walter Kroto, and Mitchell Jay Feigenbaum.\n\nFifty-nine Nobel laureates have served as speakers, five of whom were awarded the Noble prize after speaking at the Noble conference at Gustavus.\n\nThe Noble conference has a focus on scientific topics such as \"Medicine: Prescription for Tomorrow\" (2006), \"The Legacy of Einstein\" (2005), \"The Science of Aging\" (2004), \"The Nature of Nurture\" (2002), \"Virus: The Human Connection\" (1998), and \"The New Shape of Matter: Materials Challenge Science\" (1995). The social sciences are also well represented and many topics are interdisciplinary; focusing on economics, politics, the social sciences and philosophy. For example, the 2016 Nobel Conference: \"In Search of Economic Balance\" brought economists from around the world to discuss the challenges facing real world implementation of economic theories.\n\nThe Noble conference is open to the general public.\n\nThe 2017 Nobel Conference is titled \"Reproductive Technology: How Far Do We Go?\" and took place October 3–4, 2017 in Saint Peter, Minnesota at Gustavus Adolphus College.\n\nLecturers include:\n\n\nLecturers included:\n\n2015 - \"Addiction: Exploring the Science and Experience of an Equal Opportunity Condition\"\n\nLecturers included:\n\n2014 - \"Where does Science Go from Here?\"\n\nLecturers included:\n\n2013 - \"The Universe at its Limits\"\n\nLecturers included:\n\nOther past Noble Conferences include:\n\n2000 - \"Globalization 2000: Economic Prospects and Challenges\"\n\nLecturers included:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Oreopoulos's research focuses on the economics of education, labour economics, public finance, and child development.\n\nPhilip Oreopoulos earned his B.A. from the University of Western Ontario in 1995, his Master of Arts from the University of British Columbia in 1996, and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2002, where he researched on labour economics and public finance under the supervision of David Card, Alan J. Auerbach, and John M. Quigley.\n\nAfter his Ph.D., Oreopoulos worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Economics of the University of Toronto, where he was promoted first to associate professor in 2007 and then to full professor in 2012. In addition, he has also held visiting appointments at MIT and at Harvard University. Moreover, Oreopoulos is the co-chair of J-PAL's education sector (together with Karthik Muralidharan), a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, with which he has been affiliated since 2003, and a senior fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (since 2012), where he previously worked as research scholar (2006–12). In terms of professional service, Oreopoulos has worked as a (co-)editor or on the board of editors for the \"Journal of Labor Economics\" (2009–present), \"Labour Economics (2013-present), and the 'American Economic Review\" (2013-present), in addition to refereeing for numerous academic journals (mostly in economics).\n\nPhilip Oreopoulos is ranked among the top 2% of economists by IDEAS/RePEc. Most of his research relates to education, labour economics, urban economics, experimental economics, and the sociology of economics. A substantial part of Oreopoulos' research deals with the consequences of changes in compulsory schooling laws, especially in the United Kingdom, which provide an exogenous variation of education. In this context, among else, he found \nOther findings of Oreopoulos include (i) that workers who graduated from college during recessions suffer from persistently lower earnings for up to a decade, beginning their careers working for lower paying employers and then gradually upgrading their jobs by moving to better firms, with the speed of the upgrading determined by graduates' socioeconomic backgrounds (with Till von Wachter and Andrew Heisz); (ii) that the non-financial benefits of schooling - e.g. higher work enjoyment, patience, trust, ambition, and risk aversion or also better decisions regarding health, marriage or parenting - are at least as large as the financial benefits of schooling and would - ironically - benefit school dropouts most (with Kjell Salvanes); (iii) that the quality of neighborhoods in which children grow up in has only a very small impact in determining their adult earnings, likelihood of unemployment, or dependence on welfare benefits, but that the quality of the children's family environment does;; and (iv) that poor infant health predicts both mortality within one year, and mortality up to age 17, as well as long-term educational and labour force outcomes such as high school completion and welfare takeup. \n\nMore recently and in line with his work at J-PAL, Philip Oreopoulos has used randomized controlled trials to investigate issues in education, e.g. finding that combining academic support services and financial incentives for good grades may be particularly effective in improving the grades and long-term study skills of female freshmen but will have no effect on men, in part because of poor male take-up, or that combining the offer of assistance with completing the college financial aid applications with information about aid estimates may be effective in substantially increeasing the likelihood of college attendance, persistence and aid receipt for low-income individuals whereas simply providing information isn't.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "430374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=430374", "title": "Sandra Cisneros", "text": "Sandra Cisneros\n\nSandra Cisneros (born December 20, 1954) is a Mexican-American writer. She is best known for her first novel \"The House on Mango Street\" (1984) and her subsequent short story collection \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\" (1991). Her work experiments with literary forms and investigates emerging subject positions, which Cisneros herself attributes to growing up in a context of cultural hybridity and economic inequality that endowed her with unique stories to tell. She is the recipient of numerous awards including a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, was awarded one of 25 new Ford Foundation Art of Change fellowships in 2017, and is regarded as a key figure in Chicana literature.\n\nCisneros's early life provided many experiences she would later draw on as a writer: she grew up as the only daughter in a family of six brothers, which often made her feel isolated, and the constant migration of her family between Mexico and the United States instilled in her the sense of \"always straddling two countries ... but not belonging to either culture.\" Cisneros's work deals with the formation of Chicana identity, exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo-American cultures, facing the misogynist attitudes present in both these cultures, and experiencing poverty. For her insightful social critique and powerful prose style, Cisneros has achieved recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities, to the extent that \"The House on Mango Street\" has been translated worldwide and is taught in American classrooms as a coming-of-age novel.\n\nCisneros has held a variety of professional positions, working as a teacher, a counselor, a college recruiter, a poet-in-the-schools, and an arts administrator, and has maintained a strong commitment to community and literary causes. In 1998 she established the Macondo Writers Workshop, which provides socially conscious workshops for writers, and in 2000 she founded the Alfredo Cisneros Del Moral Foundation, which awards talented writers connected to Texas. Cisneros currently resides in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nCisneros was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 20, 1954, the third of seven children. The only surviving daughter, she considered herself the \"odd number in a set of men\". Cisneros's great-grandfather had played the piano for the Mexican president and was from a wealthy background, but he gambled away his family's fortune. Her paternal grandfather was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution, and he used what money he had saved to give her father, Alfredo Cisneros de Moral, the opportunity to go to college. However, after failing classes due to what Cisneros called his \"lack of interest\" in studying, Alfredo ran away to the United States to escape his father's anger. While roaming the southern United States with his brother, Alfredo visited Chicago where he met Elvira Cordero Anguiano. After getting married, the pair settled in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. Cisneros's biographer Robin Ganz writes that she acknowledges her mother's family name came from a very humble background, tracing its roots back to Guanajuato, Mexico, while her father's was much more \"admirable\".\n\nTaking work as an upholsterer to support his family, Cisneros's father began \"a compulsive circular migration between Chicago and Mexico City that became the dominating pattern of Cisneros's childhood.\" Their family was constantly moving between the two countries, which necessitated their finding new places to live as well as schools for the children. Eventually the instability caused Cisneros's six brothers to pair off in twos, leaving her to define herself as the isolated one. Her feelings of exclusion from the family were exacerbated by her father, who referred to his \"seis hijos y una hija\" (\"six sons and one daughter\") rather than his \"siete hijos\" (\"seven children\"). Ganz notes that Cisneros's childhood loneliness was instrumental in shaping her later passion for writing. Cisneros's one strong female influence was her mother, Elvira, who was a voracious reader and more enlightened and socially conscious than her father. According to Ganz, although Elvira was too dependent on her husband and too restricted in her opportunities to fulfill her own potential, she ensured her daughter would not suffer from the same disadvantages as she did.\n\nHer family made a down payment on their own home in Humboldt Park, a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel \"The House on Mango Street\". For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that it took a while to find her own voice. She explains, \"I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me.\"\n\nCisneros was awarded a bachelor of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences between her and her classmates: \"It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it had anything to do with why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about.\" She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her \"neighbors, the people [she] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through.\"\n\nCisneros says of this moment: \n\nSo to me it began there, and that's when I intentionally started writing about all the things in my culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of \"Wicked Wicked Ways\"—and the stories in \"House on Mango Street\". I think it's ironic that at the moment when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me. \n\nDrawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the \"thousands of silent women\" whose struggles are portrayed in \"The House on Mango Street\".\n\nFive years after receiving her MFA, she returned to Loyola University-Chicago, where she had previously earned a BA in English, to work as an administrative assistant. Prior to this job, she worked in the Chicano barrio in Chicago, teaching high school dropouts at Latino Youth High School. Through these jobs, she gained more experience with the problems of young Latino Americans.\n\nIn addition to being an author and poet, Cisneros has held various academic and teaching positions. In 1978, after finishing her MFA degree, she taught former high-school dropouts at the Latino Youth High School in Chicago. The 1984 publication of \"The House on Mango Street\" secured her a succession of writer-in-residence posts at universities in the United States, teaching creative writing at institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. She was subsequently a writer-in-residence at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. Cisneros has also worked as a college recruiter and an arts administrator.\n\nCisneros currently resides in San Miguel de Allende, a city in central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial \"Mexican-pink\" home with \"many creatures little and large.\" In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the \"Americas Review\" why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, \"I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us.\" She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In the introduction to the third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's \"Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza\", Cisneros wrote: \"It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to... Because writing is like putting your head underwater.\"\n\nCisneros's writing is often influenced by her personal experiences and by observations of many of the people in her community. She once confided to other writers at a conference in Santa Fe that she writes down \"snippets of dialogue or monologue—records of conversations she hears wherever she goes.\" These snippets are then mixed and matched to create her stories. Names for her characters often come from the San Antonio phone book; \"she leafs through the listings for a last name, then repeats the process for a first name.\" By mixing and matching she is assured that she is not appropriating anyone's real name or real story, but at the same time her versions of characters and stories are believable.\n\nCisneros once found herself so immersed in the characters of her book \"Woman Hollering Creek\" that they began to infiltrate her subconscious mind. Once while she was writing the story \"Eyes of Zapata,\" she awoke \"in the middle of the night, convinced for the moment that she was Ines, the young bride of the Mexican revolutionary. Her dream conversation with Zapata then became those characters' dialogue in her story.\"\n\nHer biculturalism and bilingualism are also very important aspects of her writing. Cisneros was quoted by Robin Ganz as saying that she is grateful to have \"twice as many words to pick from...two ways of looking at the world,\" and Ganz referred to her \"wide range of experience\" as a \"double-edged sword.\" Cisneros's ability to speak two languages and to write about her two cultures gives her a unique position from where she is able to tell not just her story, but also the stories of those around her.\n\nCisneros has been instrumental in building a strong community in San Antonio among other artists and writers through her work with the Macondo Foundation and the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation. The Macondo Foundation, which is named after the town in Gabriel García Márquez's book \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", \"works with dedicated and compassionate writers who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community-building and non-violent social change.\" Officially incorporated in 2006, the foundation began in 1998 as a small workshop that took place in Cisneros's kitchen. The Macondo Writers Workshop, which has since become an annual event, brings together writers \"working on geographic, cultural, economic, social and spiritual borders\" and has grown from 15 participants to over 120 participants in the first 9 years. Currently working out of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, the Macondo Foundation makes awards such as the Gloria E. Anzaldúa Milagro Award honoring the memory of Anzaldúa, a fellow Chicana writer who died in 2004, by providing Chicano writers with support when they are in need of some time to heal their \"body, heart or spirit\" and the Elvira Cordero Cisneros Award which was created in memory of Sandra Cisneros's mother. Macondo offers services to member writers such as health insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Casa Azul Residency Program. The Residency Program provides writers with a furnished room and office in the Casa Azul, a blue house across the street from where Cisneros lives in San Antonio, which is also the headquarters of the Macondo Foundation. In creating this program, Cisneros \"imagined the Casa as a space where Macondistas could retreat from the distractions of everyday life and have a room of his/her own for the process of emotional, intellectual and spiritual introspection.\"\n\nCisneros founded the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation in 2000. Named in memory of her father, the foundation \"has awarded over $75,500 to writers born in Texas, writing about Texas, or living in Texas since 2007\". Its intention is to honor Cisneros's father's memory by showcasing writers who are as proud of their craft as Alfredo was of his craft as an upholsterer.\n\nLiterary critic Claudia Sadowski-Smith has called Cisneros \"perhaps the most famous Chicana writer\", and Cisneros has been acknowledged as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican-American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher. In 1989, \"The House on Mango Street\", which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte Público Press, was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press; and in 1991 \"Woman Hollering Creek\" was published by Random House. As Ganz observes, previously only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers. That Cisneros had garnered enough attention to be taken on by Vintage Press said a lot about the possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized. Cisneros spoke of her success and what it meant for Chicana literature in an interview on National Public Radio on 19 September 1991:\n\nAs a pioneer Chicana author, Cisneros filled a void by bringing to the fore a genre that had previously been at the margins of mainstream literature. With her first novel, \"The House on Mango Street\", she moved away from the poetic style that was common in Chicana literature at the time and began to define a \"distinctive Chicana literary space\", challenging familiar literary forms and addressing subjects such as gender inequality and the marginalization of cultural minorities. According to literary critic Alvina E Quintana, \"The House on Mango Street\" is a book that has reached beyond the Chicano and Latino literary communities and is now read by people of all ethnicities. Quintana states that Cisneros's writing is accessible for both Anglo- and Mexican-Americans alike since it is free from anger or accusation, presenting the issues (such as Chicana identity and gender inequalities) in an approachable way. Cisneros's writing has been influential in shaping both Chicana and feminist literature. Quintana sees her fiction as a form of social commentary, contributing to a literary tradition that resembles the work of contemporary cultural anthropologists in its attempt to authentically represent the cultural experience of a group of people, and acknowledges Cisneros's contribution to Chicana feminist aesthetics by bringing women to the center as empowered protagonists in much of her work.\n\nCisneros often incorporates Spanish into her English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where she feels that Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves the rhythm of the passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\" Cisneros writes: \"La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely \"arroyo\". But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house.\" Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that \"arroyo\" means \"creek\", Cisneros soon translates it in a way that does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: \"And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy.\" Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that \"I gave light\" is a literal translation of the Spanish \"dí a luz\" which means \"I gave birth.\" Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and Junot Díaz, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: \"All of a sudden something happens to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language.\" Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing \"The House on Mango Street\" primarily in English, \"the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects\" were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.\n\nCisneros's fiction comes in various forms—as novels, poems, and short stories—by which she challenges both social conventions, with her \"celebratory breaking of sexual taboos and trespassing across the restrictions that limit the lives and experiences of Chicanas\", and literary ones, with her \"bold experimentation with literary voice and her development of a hybrid form that weaves poetry into prose\". Published in 1991, \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\" is a collection of twenty-two short stories that form a collage of narrative techniques, each serving to engage and affect the reader in a different way. Cisneros alternates between first person, third person, and stream-of-consciousness narrative modes, and ranges from brief impressionistic vignettes to longer event-driven stories, and from highly poetic language to brutally frank realist language. Some stories lack a narrator to mediate between the characters and the reader; they are instead composed of textual fragments or conversations \"overheard\" by the reader. For example, \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\" is composed of fictional notes asking for the blessings of patron saints, and \"The Marlboro Man\" transcribes a gossiping telephone conversation between two female characters.\n\nWorks by Cisneros can appear simple at first reading, but this is deceptive. She invites the reader to move beyond the text by recognizing larger social processes within the microcosm of everyday life: the phone conversation in \"The Marlboro Man\" is not merely idle gossip, but a text that allows the reader to dig into the characters' psyches and analyze their cultural influences. Literary critics have noted how Cisneros tackles complex theoretical and social issues through the vehicle of apparently simple characters and situations. For example, Ramón Saldívar observes that \"The House on Mango Street\" \"represents from the simplicity of childhood vision the enormously complex process of the construction of the gendered subject\". In the same vein, Felicia J. Cruz describes how each individual will interact differently with \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\", thus eliciting such varied reader responses as \"it is about growing up\", to \"it's about a Chicana's growing up\", to \"it is a critique of patriarchal structures and exclusionary practices\". Cisneros's writing is rich not only for its symbolism and imagery, deemed by critic Deborah L Madsen to be \"both technically and aesthetically accomplished\", but also for its social commentary and power to \"evoke highly personal responses\". this helped her achieve the way she taught.\n\nWhen Cisneros describes the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, the theme of \"place\" often emerges. \"Place\" refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, but also to the positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, or in the case of their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In \"The House on Mango Street\" the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: \"Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after.\" An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for \"a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem.\" She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead \"a site of poetic self-creation.\" One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay \"A Room of One's Own\", that \"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction,\" or put another way, \"economic security\" and personal liberty are necessary for \"artistic production.\"\n\nCisneros explores the issue of \"place\" in relation not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, \"Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well.\" He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors to those who are less fortunate. Esperanza says \"Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house.\" According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to \"the necessity for a decent living space\" that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.\n\nAs Madsen has described, Cisneros's \"effort to negotiate a cross-cultural identity is complicated by the need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures.\" The lives of all Cisneros's female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions. As Cisneros has said: \"There's always this balancing act, we've got to define what we think is fine for ourselves instead of what our culture says.\"\n\nCisneros shows how Chicanas, like women of many other ethnicities, internalize these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In \"The House on Mango Street\", for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman's hips have: \"They're good for holding a baby when you're cooking, Rachel says... You need them to dance, says Lucy... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know.\" Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her \"sexual initiation\"—an assault by a group of Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but \"by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex\". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\", where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives.\n\nWhen Cisneros addresses the subject of female sexuality, she often portrays negative scenarios in which men exert control over women through control over their sexuality, and explores the gap she perceives between the real sexual experiences of women and their idealized representation in popular culture. However, Cisneros also describes female sexuality in extremely positive terms, especially in her poetry. This is true, for example, of her 1987 volume of poetry \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\". According to Madsen, Cisneros refers to herself as \"wicked\" for having \"reappropriated, taken control of, her own sexuality and the articulation of it – a power forbidden to women under patriarchy\". Through these poems she aims to represent \"the reality of female sexuality\" so that women readers will recognize the \"divisive effects\" of the stereotypes that they are expected to conform to, and \"discover the potential for joy in their bodies that is denied them\".\n\nCisneros breaks the boundary between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not, using language and imagery that have a \"boisterous humor\" and \"extrovert energy\" and are even at times \"deliberately shocking\". Not all readers appreciate this \"shocking\" quality of some of Cisneros's work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\" cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: \"The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that's also why it's wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying 'I defy you. I'm going to tell my own story.'\" Some readers \"failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture\", thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros's initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking \"Wait a second, where's your sense of humor? And why can't a feminist be sexy?\"\n\nThe challenges faced by Cisneros's characters on account of their gender cannot be understood in isolation from their culture, for the norms that dictate how women and men ought to think and behave are culturally determined and thus distinct for different cultural groups. Through her works, Cisneros conveys the experiences of Chicanas confronting the \"deeply rooted patriarchal values\" of Mexican culture through interactions not only with Mexican fathers, but the broader community which exerts pressure upon them to conform to a narrow definition of womanhood and a subservient position to men.\n\nA recurrent theme in Cisneros's work is the triad of figures that writer and theorist Gloria Anzaldúa has referred to as \"Our Mothers\": the Virgen de Guadalupe, La Malinche and La Llorona. These symbolic figures are of great importance to identity politics and popular culture in Mexico and the southwest United States, and have been used, argues theorist Norma Alarcón, as reference points \"for controlling, interpreting, or visualizing women\" in Mexican-American culture.\n\nMany theorists, including Jacqueline Doyle, Jean Wyatt, Emma Perez and Cordelia Candelaria, have argued that the gender identity of Mexican and Chicana women is complexly constructed in reference to these three figures. La Virgen de Guadalupe, a Catholic icon of the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the Americas, is revered in Mexico as a \"nurturing and inspiring mother and maiden\". La Malinche, the indigenous mistress and intermediary of conquistador Hernán Cortés, has according to Wyatt \"become the representative of a female sexuality at once passive, \"rapeable,\" and always already guilty of betrayal\". Cisneros describes the problematic dichotomy of the virgin and the whore presented by these two figures: \"We're raised in a Mexican culture that has two role models: La Malinche and la Virgen de Guadalupe. And you know that's a hard route to go, one or the other, there's no in-betweens.\" Madsen has noted that these 'good' and 'bad' archetypes are further complicated by the perception, held by many Chicana feminists, that they would be guilty of betraying their people, like La Malinche, if they attempt to define their femininity in more \"Anglo\" terms. Through her work, Cisneros critiques the pressures Chicanas face to suppress their sexuality or channel it into socially acceptable forms so as to not be labeled \"Malinchista[s]...corrupted by gringa influences which threaten to splinter [their] people\".\n\nThe third figure, La Llorona, who derives from a centuries-old Mexican/Southwestern folktale, is \"a proud young girl [who] marries above her station and is so enraged when her husband takes a mistress of his own class that she drowns their children in the river\". She dies grief-stricken by the edge of the river after she is unable to retrieve her children and it is claimed that she can be heard wailing for them in the sound of the wind and water. These entities, from the gentle and pure Virgen de Guadalupe, to the violated and treacherous la Malinche, to the eternally grieving la Llorona give rise to a \"fragmentary subjectivity\" often experienced by Chicanas, and their need to come to terms with them, renegotiate them on their own terms, or reject them altogether.\n\nThe three \"Mothers\" come out most clearly in \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\". In the stories \"Never Marry a Mexican\" and \"Woman Hollering Creek\", the female protagonists grapple with these \"Mexican icons of sexuality and motherhood that, internalized, seem to impose on them a limited and even negative definition of their own identities as women\". The protagonist in \"Never Marry a Mexican\" is haunted by the myth of la Malinche, who is considered a whore and a traitor, and defies la Malinche's passive sexuality with her own aggressive one. In \"Woman Hollering Creek\" the protagonist reinvents the la Llorona myth when she decides to take charge of her own future, and that of her children, and discovers that the \"grito\" of the myth, which is the Spanish word for the sound made by la Llorona, can be interpreted as a \"joyous holler\" rather than a grieving wail. It is the borderland, that symbolic middle ground between two cultures, which \"offers a space where such a negotiation with fixed gender ideals is at least possible\".\n\nEven though that Cisneros does not explicitly locate her stories and novels on the Mexico-U.S. border, Sadowski-Smith identifies the concept as perhaps Cisneros's most salient theme due to the constant border crossings, both real and metaphorical, of characters in all of her works. \"The House on Mango Street\" takes place in Chicago where the narrator lives, and in Mexico City where she visits extended family. \"Caramelo\" primarily takes place in those settings as well, but part of the book details the narrator's experiences as a teenager in San Antonio, TX. Various characters in \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\" also make trips to Mexico to reunite with family members. However, to quote literary critics Jesús Benito and Ana María Manzanas, the \"image of the border has become fully meaningful not only when we consider it as a physical line but when we decenter it and liberate it from the notion of space to encompass notions of sex, class, gender, ethnicity, identity, and community.\" Cisneros frequently divorces the border from its strictly geographic meaning, using it metaphorically to explore how Chicana identity is an amalgamation of both Mexican and Anglo-American cultures. The border represents the everyday experiences of people who are neither fully from one place nor the other; at times the border is fluid and two cultures can coexist harmoniously within a single person, but at other times it is rigid and there is an acute tension between them. Literary critic Katherine Payant has analyzed the border metaphor in \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\", which manifests in references to the Chicana/o characters' Mexican roots and the (im)migration between the two countries, the recurrence of overlapping pre-Columbian, mestizo and Southwestern Chicano myths, and the portrayal of Chicanas/os as \"straddling two or three cultures.\" Payant makes use of Gloria Anzaldúa's concept of living \"on the borderlands\" to describe the experience of Cisneros's Chicana characters who, in addition to their struggle to overcome patriarchal constructs of their gender and sexual identity, must negotiate linguistic and cultural boundaries.\n\nAt a ceremony in September 2016 was awarded a 2015 National Medal of Arts.\n\nSandra Cisneros received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1981 and 1988, and in 1985 was presented with the American Book Award by the Before Columbus Foundation for \"The House on Mango Street\". Subsequently, she received a Frank Dobie Artists Fellowship, and came first and second in the Segundo Concurso Nacional del Cuento Chicano, sponsored by the University of Arizona.\n\nShe has further received the Quality Paperback Book Club New Voices Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, the PEN Center West Award for best fiction, and the Lannan Foundation Literary Award for \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\". This book was selected as the noteworthy book of the year by both \"The New York Times\" and \"The American Library Journal\", and an anthology of erotic poetry, \"Loose Woman\", won the Mountain & Plains Booksellers' Award.\n\nCisneros was recognized by the State University of New York, receiving an honorary doctorate from Purchase in 1993 and a MacArthur fellowship in 1995. In 2003, \"Caramelo\" was highly regarded by several journals including \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", the \"Chicago Tribune\", and \"The Seattle Times\", which led to her Premio Napoli Award in 2005; the novel also was shortlisted for the Dublin International IMPAC award, and was nominated for the Orange Prize in England. In 2003, Cisneros became part of the second group of recipients of the newly formed Texas Cultural Trust's Texas Medal of Arts. In 2016, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill awarded Cisneros an honorary Doctor of Letters.\n\nThe Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds some of her papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a denomination for an official in the so-called \"higher service\" as opposed to the \"elevated\", \"middle\" and \"lower\" service ranks. This office is located on the 4th \"service level\" and remunerated according to \"A 13\" which marks the first salary level of \"higher service\" officials. The Studienrat normally works as a teacher in higher education up to the Abitur which corresponds to A-Level exams.\n\nIn the GDR Studienrat was an honorary title for a teacher.\n\nBesides, there are also civil servants at ecclesiastical church-owned grammar schools that hold the title of a „Studienrat im Kirchendienst“ (\"Educational Councillor in Church Service\"), short „StR i. K.“ They are \"officials of the church\", on a legal basis comparable to officials of the state.\n\nThe following ranks are Oberstudienrat (\"Upper Educational Councillor\"), Studiendirektor (\"Educational Director\") and Oberstudiendirektor (\"Upper Educational Direktor\")\n\nNomination of a Studienrat requires a master's degree in at least two subjects like Mathematics and Physics and additional educational studies. The next step is a teacher training at an Educational College for mostly two years including practical training on the job, and a three-year probationary period at a grammar school.\n\nIn 1918, Wilhelm II made a decree to replace the title \"Oberlehrer\" (upper teacher) by the honorary title \"Studienrat\". In Prussia, since 1892 two thirds of the grammar school teachers held the title of Oberlehrer, a third was addressed by the honorary title of grammar school professor: \"Gymnasialprofessor\". Oberlehrer were entitled to teach in higher education. As early as 1892 they were seen as equal to judges or magistrates, acknowledged as \"higher service officials of the fifth class\". This higher ranking and the coveted title of a councillor (\"Rat\") boosted the previously rather low social prestige of the grammar school teachers, a success mainly owed to the unremitting efforts of the \"Vereinsverband akademisch gebildeter Lehrer\" (\"Association of unions of academically educated teachers\"), founded in 1903, which from 1921 onwards called itself \"Philologenverband\" (\"Association of philologians\"). The teachers' union represented the professional interests of the 95% of grammar school teachers who were union members.\n\nAs explained by the legal expert Rudolf Summer, the basic official title of \"Rat\" (\"councillor\") has to be specified by the obligatory supplement of \"Studien\" (education, studies) to convey the relation to schooling and education. This is meant to avoid the general title of \"councillor\". With respect to the title of director the supplement is expected to avoid confusion because \"Director\" like the English \"director\" is used for a variety of leading positions in different fields.\n\nAccording to the magazine Der Spiegel the town of Bremen has so far been the only federal state that attempted to abolish the official title of \"Studienrat\" in 1979 and to introduce the new title \"Lehrer/in an Öffentlichen Schulen\" (\"Teacher at public schools\"). After several prolonged judicial procedures, the Federal Constitutional Court decided that official titles are not allowed to level off the distinctive qualities of different professional levels of performance, they have to be differentiated, in order to indicate publicly the graded recognition of performance and to refer clearly to the area of service, in this case to education or schooling as opposed to administrative or military services.\n"}

Currently, the university consists of 6 faculties, and trains highly skilled professionals in technical and engineering fields. In this year, it is estimated that there are 56 departments at this university in which there are over 10 746 students, who are taught by 6 academicians of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, 74 doctors of sciences and 314 candidates of sciences.\n\nHistory of \"Tashkent State Technical University\" named Abu Rayhan Beruni ('’’TSTU'’’) goes back to the Soviet Union times. University currently is one of the oldest educational places in Uzbekistan. Its first establishment date refers to the April 21, 1918. Firstly, the university was created as the small technical faculty of \"Turkistan National University\", and it worked for the whole Central Asia.\nThat technical faculty saw many changes in its history but it is the base of current \"Tashkent State Technical University\". In 1923 it was re-set as the new faculty called \"Engineering-melioration faculty\". After 6 years, in 1929 in base of this faculty, there was created new institute called \"Central Asian cotton-irrigation institute\". After 4 years, in 1933 this institute became the fundament for new and unique technical university in Central Asia. From the year of 1949 it was renamed to \"Central Asian Poly Technical Institute\". From the year 1961 it was called as the \"Tashkent Poly Technical institute\". In 1973 it was named after one of the greatest scientists of Uzbekistan Abu Rayhan Beruni, and was called as the \"Tashkent Poly Technical Institute named Abu Rayhan Beruni\". After the Independence of Uzbekistan, by the edict President of Republic Uzbekistan Islam Karimov, university was renamed to its current name and it became one of the leading educational centers of Uzbekistan. University has passed about 100 years of history to get its current name \"Tashkent State Technical University named Abu Rayhan Beruni\" and to reach its current prestige. President of Republic Uzbekistan Islam Karimov has also graduated from this University.\nDuring its long history the \"Tashkent State Technical University\" has become the base for 16 other universities and colleges in Uzbekistan, which are \"Fergana Poly Technical Institute\" (1967), \"Tashkent Institute of Automobile and Highways\"(1972), \"Samarkand architectural institute\"(1980), \"Bukhara Technological Institute of Food and Light Industry\" (1977), \"Namangan Engineering-Economic Institute\" (1973), \"Navoi State Mining Institute\" (1995), \"Andijan Institute of Engineering Economics and Management (1995), \"Tashkent Engineering Institute\" (1989), \"Tashkent Institute of Chemical Technology\" (1991), \"Tashkent Architecture and Construction Institute\" (1991), \"Karshi Engineering-economic Institute\" (1995), \"Tashkent State Institute of Aviation\" (1995), \"Nukus Industrial-Pedagogical Institute\" (1995), \"Angren Technical College\" (1995), \"Almalyk Technical College\" (1995), \"Chirchik Technology College\" (1995).\n\nThere are 7 faculties, 58 departments, 735 professors-teachers and more than 11 thousand students at Tashkent State Technical University.

{"id": "10162382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10162382", "title": "Tasmanian Certificate of Education", "text": "Tasmanian Certificate of Education\n\nThe Tasmanian Certificate of Education or TCE, is the main credential awarded to secondary school students who successfully complete senior high school level studies (years 11 and 12 or equivalent, referred to generally as College within Tasmania) in Tasmania, Australia. It was introduced in 1992 to replace Tasmania's old \"High School Certificate\", and partially restructured for 2007.\n\nThe majority of students undertake TCE-related courses over the final two years of school (out of six years of high school), however it is possible to undertake different study patterns over different time periods or through different teaching organisations. These two years are normally completed either at separate campuses of Tasmanian independent schools, or at government colleges.\n\nThe onus of TCE education is the promotion of independent learning for students, with the aim of equipping students to be able to learn independently of guided education. It is felt this is better preparation for higher education.\n\nThe courses offered for study within the TCE are divided into categories according to the relevant knowledge types or skills. These reflect the nature of the subject and are similar to the way universities allocate areas of study according to faculty. These are: Arts, English, Health & Physical Education, Information Technology, Languages, Mathematics, Science, Society and Environment, Student-Directed Inquiry, Technology and Manufacturing Studies.\n\nThe following is the complete list of TCE Courses available to students by area of study.\n\nThe study of English at TCE level is divided up into specialist sub-categories, including: English, English Applied, English Communications, English Studies, English Writing, English as a Second Language, Communicating with the Deaf, & Study Material (the study of previous examinations and course work).\n\nHealth and Physical Education is divided up into specialist sub-categories including: Adventure education, Athlete Development, Health, Recreation and Health, Sport studies & Sport Science.\n\nInformation Technology consists of Computer Science, Computing and Information Systems.\n\nSeveral languages are offered for study within the TCE and focus tends to be on languages of countries which have significant trade status with Australia, or large numbers of international speakers. The main languages included are: Chinese, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, & Japanese, although several others, particularly those of Australian ethnic minority groups can also be studied.\n\nThe study of mathematics at TCE level is offered at varying levels of complexity, ranging from maths for every day living skills, through to complex equations. The subjects within the field of mathematics are: Mathematics Applied, Mathematics Methods, Mathematics Specialised, Maths after College, Maths at Work, Maths for Living & Study Material (the study of previous examinations and course work).\n\nThe following sciences can be studied towards a TCE qualification: Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Physics, Science of Natural Resources, & Science of the Physical World.\n\nSociety and Environment focuses on subjects which apply skills to the understanding of human interactions with each other, and the environment around them, including: Psychology, Sociology, Economics, Religion & Philosophy, Legal Studies, Ancient Civilisations, Modern World History and World & Environment.\n\nThis is an experimental area of study that the TCE has offered on a trial basis in 2006 and 2007 and encourages students to develop their own learning designs and research approaches. It is very much focused on allowing students to develop an academic approach to learning within an area of personal interest, and offers the freedom to approach the gathering of knowledge, research or skill acquisition through their own initiative.\n\nMany areas of technical skills can be studied through the TCE including: Applied Technology, Automotive Technology, Catering, Computer Graphics and Design, Design Graphics, Design in Metal, Design in Wood, Electronics, Food Studies, Housing and Design & Lifestyle and Fashion.\n\nManufacturing studies is another new pilot area of study in 2007, and is designed to equip students with knowledge and skills related to the manufacturing industries, which are currently the second largest industry sector in Australia.\n\nThe Tasmanian Certificate of Education is awarded based upon a criterion based assessment. This basically means students can be assessed depending upon their meeting or successful completion of standards and criteria. These criteria usually assess knowledge, skills and competencies in differing ways to ensure a wide understanding of the course syllabus has been obtained by the student. It is felt that this is fair and more practical that just relying upon traditional examinations, although many areas of study still utilise exams in conjunction with other methods of assessment.\n\nSubjects are offered at varying levels of difficulty, ranging from a basic understanding, through to a pre-tertiary entrance qualification. The difficulty of a subject is guided by its rating as a 1-3 level subject. Subjects are also given an A, B or C rating based on the number of hours that are required for the course, C being the longest. In this way, all subjects will have a rating such as 3A, or 2C etc., depending on the time it involves and the difficulty of the work involved.\n\nC level subjects can also be offered as pre-tertiary (level 3C), and for students wishing to gain university entrance, enough points from pre-tertiary entrance subjects must be obtained to gain a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) score above the requirements for the applied course.\n\nUpon successful completion of a satisfactory pattern of study students are awarded the \"Tasmanian Certificate of Education\" (TCE) by way of a testamur. This may also come with a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) if the student has nominated to attempt a university entrance qualification, and the TER score will dictate which university courses the student is eligible to apply for.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6162658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6162658", "title": "The Food Project", "text": "The Food Project\n\nThe Food Project is a non-profit organization that employs teenagers on farms in Lincoln, Roxbury and the North Shore of Massachusetts. It focuses on community improvement and outreach, and education about health, leadership, charity, and sustainable agriculture. The youth are recruited from urban areas of Boston, Lynn, and surrounding suburbs to plant and harvest crops for sale at Farmers' Markets and CSAs, and donation to local hunger-relief organizations and homeless shelters. The program emphasizes community building and fosters good work ethic, providing a good foundation for future employment.\n\nFounded in 1991 by Ward Cheney, a local farmer and educator, the Food Project (sometimes abbreviated as TFP) is a non-profit organization committed to bringing youth together from the urban neighborhoods of Boston and the surrounding suburbs.\n\nThe core of The Food Project's program is employment of youth on farms in Lincoln and Roxbury, called the Summer Youth Program. Participants are hired in the Spring, with equal representation from the city and nearby suburbs, and are divided into crews of about 10 crew workers, an assistant crew leader and a crew leader. The program is 8 weeks long (now 6.5 due to budget), beginning in late June and ending in August to coincide with the Massachusetts public school calendar. There is also an academic year program and an internship program, both of which run throughout the year, though with fewer participants than the Summer Program.\n\nCrews are rotated throughout the growing season so each has experience working on the farms in Lincoln and Roxbury. In addition to doing farmwork and harvesting, all crews also work in local hunger-relief institutions like the Pine Street Inn, ReVision House and Urban Farm and Rosie's Place, where they help serve food cooked from the vegetables they grow. Using this paradigm, summer crew workers experience all aspects of their labor, from planting and harvesting to food donation.\n\nThe Food Project has 10 growing sites in total. Lincoln, Massachusetts, and several in Roxbury, Massachusetts. The North Shore branch has a farm in Lynn and a farm in Beverly. The main offices for The Food Project are located in Lincoln Center.\n\nOne of the main tenets of The Food Project is that the land that the program uses is a part of the community and therefore must be integrated. One of the innovative ways in which this is accomplished is through community-supported agriculture (CSA), an agricultural model founded in Japan (teikei) and implemented in the U.S. by Indian Line Farm, in Massachusetts. In this model, local consumers buy a share of the farm's harvest. Produce from the harvest is then distributed at the farm to shareholders up to a defined limit. Selection and volume depends on the time of year, but freshness is frequently unmatched by standard retail vendors because the food can be consumed immediately after harvesting.\n\nThe Food Project's 400 member CSA Farm Share program offers fresh vegetables, herbs and flowers and has pickup locations in Lincoln, Cambridge, Somerville, Arlington and Jamaica Plain. They publish a CSA Newsletter which is distributed to all shareholders weekly. Additionally, shareholders can harvest their produce themselves from specially designated plots at certain Food Project growing sites.\n\n1991: Founded by Ward Cheney in conjunction with the Massachusetts Audubon Society.<br>\n1992: First growing season funded with $100,000 and farmed on a plot on Drumlin Farm in Lincoln.<br>\n1993: Groundbreaking of the half-acre Langdon Street Lot in Roxbury.<br>\n1994: First growing season for the Langdon Street Lot.<br>\n1995: West Cottage Street Lot is cleared by summer crew workers and land is prepared for growing.<br>\n1998: A video, two books and many manuals document The Food Project's program and philosophy. The Rooted in Community Network is also co-founded.<br>\n2001: A neighborhood gardener lends some land, an undeveloped lot blocks away from the other two sites on Albion Street in Roxbury. Remediation completes in 2001 and growing begins in 2002.<br>\n2003: The Food Project launches BLAST, an international initiative focusing on the next generation of leaders, farmers and practitioners in food systems work.<br>\n2008: In conjunction with the City of Boston, The Food Project pioneers the use of EBT/SNAP/food stamps at its farmers markets with a program called Boston Bounty Bucks.<br>\n2010: The Food Project receives a $600,000 stimulus grant from the Obama administration. US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius visits Boston land.<br>\n2014: The Wenham Conservation Commission starts leasing the 34-acre Reynolds Farm to The Food Project.<br>\n2015: Dudley Neighbors Inc. (DNI), which has ownership over the parcel of land at 40 West Cottage where The Food Project has farmed on a year-to-year basis since 1998, has granted The Food Project a 99-year lease.<br>\n2017: North Shore Community College receives grant from the Massachusetts Skills Capital Grant Program to build an environmental horticulture greenhouse in Lynn, offering seedling and nursery space to The Food Project starting in summer 2018.<br>\n\nIn 2004, The Food Project was supported by the Cirque du Soleil through a donation of tickets to their Varekai Benefit performance at Suffolk Downs in Boston. Because of the show's history and origins in youth street performing, the donation was a sign of continued support to youth programs.\n\nIn 2005, The Food Project won the Mayor's Award for Excellence in Children's Health, given by the Boston Mayor's Office, the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), and Children's Hospital Boston.\n\nThe Food Project receives support from a variety of local and national private foundations, corporations, nonprofits, government agencies, and other institutions.\n\n"}

{"id": "2071765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071765", "title": "Visual arts education", "text": "Visual arts education\n\nVisual arts education is the area of learning that is based upon only the kind of art that one can see, visual arts—drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, and design in jewelry, pottery, weaving, fabrics, etc. and design applied to more practical fields such as commercial graphics and home furnishings. Contemporary topics include photography, video, film, design, and computer art. Art education may focus on students creating art, on learning to criticize or appreciate art, or some combination of the two.\n\nArt is often taught through drawing, an empirical activity which involves seeing, interpreting and discovering appropriate marks to reproduce an observed phenomenon. Drawing instruction has been a component of formal education in the West since the Hellenistic period. In East Asia, arts education for nonprofessional artists typically focused on brushwork; calligraphy was numbered among the Six Arts of gentlemen in the Chinese Zhou Dynasty, and calligraphy and Chinese painting were numbered among the Four Arts of scholar-officials in imperial China.\n\nAn alternative approach to art education involves an emphasis on imagination, both in interpreting and creating art. Alternative approaches, such as visual culture and issue-based approaches in which students explore societal and personal issues through art, also inform art education today.\n\nProminent curricular models for art education include:\n\nIn addition, especially in higher education in the liberal arts tradition, art is often taught as \"art appreciation\", a subject for aesthetic criticism rather than direct engagement.\n\nSome studies show that strong art education programs have demonstrated increased student performance in other academic areas, due to art activities' exercising their brains' right hemispheres and delateralizing their thinking. Also see Betty Edwards' \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\".\n\nArt education is not limited to formal educational institutions. Some professional artists provide private or semi-private instruction in their own studios. This may take the form of an apprenticeship in which the student learns from a professional artist while assisting the artist with their work. One form of this teaching style is the Atelier Method as exemplified by Gustave Moreau who taught Picasso, Braque and many other artists.\n\nHistorically art was taught in Europe via the atelier method system where artists took on apprentices who learned their trade in much the same way as that of guilds such as the stonemasons or goldsmiths. During their free time formal training took place in art workshops or, more often, in homes or alone outside. It was in these ateliers that artists learned the craft through apprenticeship to masters, a relationship that was controlled by guild statutes. Florentine contracts dating from the late 13th century state that the master was expected to clothe and feed the apprentice, who was called upon to be a faithful servant in return. An apprentice often paid the master during the early years of his education; assuming the apprenticeship was productive, the student would be compensated later in his training. Northern European workshops featured similar terms.\n\nInitially, learning to draw was a priority in this system. Michelangelo recommended that a young painter spend a year on drawing alone, then six years grinding colors, preparing panels and using gold leaf, during which time the study of drawing would continue. Another six years would be required to master fresco and tempera painting.\n\nHistorically, design has had some precedence over the fine arts with schools of design being established all over Europe in the 18th century. These examples of skill and values from the early European art inspired later generations, including the Colonists of early America.\n\nIndividuals who employ cultural appropriation have the ability to produce works of considerable aesthetic merit. Using properties of art from different cultures such as decoration or emulation of creative process can foster a greater understanding and appreciation of crafts from different cultures. This technique can be appreciated in the production of African or Native-American mask making projects, where students emulate technique and explore new material use and construction methods which esteem those practices of different cultures.\n\nLeading country in the development of the arts in Latin America, in 1875 created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts, founded by painters Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo Sívori, and other artists. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic Ernesto de la Cárcova, as a department in the University of Buenos Aires, the Superior Art School of the Nation. Currently, the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes.\n\nAustralian Universities which have Visual / Fine Art departments or courses within their institutions have moved from Studio Based teaching models, associated with Art Schools, to more integrated theoretical / practical emphasis. University of Western Australia has moved from a master's degree with theoretical emphasis to a theoretical BA Art degree.\n\nStudio based teaching initiatives integrating contextual and media elements have been implemented as part of a national Studio Teaching Project supported by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) since 2007.\n\nThe first modern art school in Egypt was opened in 1908 as the Cairo College of Fine Arts. These early art schools largely taught the Western aesthetic traditions. As a result, after independence there was an effort to incorporate Egyptian and Middle Eastern traditions into art and art appreciation courses. However, the process was slow; students at Cairo College of Fine Arts were not able to major in non-European art history until 1999.\n\nArt schools were established in Italy as early as the 13th century, starting with a painting school in Venice founded by a Greek painter named Theophanes around 1200.\n\nThe Dutch Art Teachers Association (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs) was founded in 1880 and began to publish a monthly magazine in 1884. Since the late 20th century, the growing diversity of Dutch society has made Dutch art and art education increasingly multicultural.\n\nFormal art education emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century, motivated in part by a desire to match the quality of design work being done in France. The model initially adopted was that of the German commercial schools. Prince Albert was particularly influential in the creation of schools of Art in the UK.\n\nCurrently in the UK, the art curriculum is prescribed by the government's National Curriculum except in public or fee paying schools. Prince Charles has created The Prince's Drawing School in Hoxton to preserve the teaching of academic drawing.\n\nThe study of art appreciation in America began with the Artists of Today Movement in the late 19th century and began to fade at the end of the 1920s. Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents. The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.\n\nAmerican educational philosopher and school reformer John Dewey was influential in broadening access to art education in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nSince World War II, artist training has moved to elementary schools, and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not usually need a college degree. Since that time the Bachelor of Fine Arts and then the Master of Fine Arts became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, facilitated by the passage of the G.I. Bill in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the Art Students League, Black Mountain College, or the Hans Hofmann School of Art in Greenwich Village; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The School of Visual Arts, Pratt Institute, and Cooper Union in New York City and other art schools across the country like the Kansas City Art Institute, the San Francisco Art Institute, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Princeton and Yale had become one of the first art academies. This trend spread from the United States around the world.\n\nEnrollment in art classes at the high school level peaked in the late 1960s—early 1970s. With No Child Left Behind (NCLB) (which retains the arts as part of the \"daily life\", but does not require reporting or assessment data on this area) there has been additional decline of arts education in American public schools. The United States Department of Education now awards Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula. After 2010, an estimate of 25% of the nation's public high schools will end all art programs. Various \"ed-tech\" companies like Kadenze and edX have attempted to mitigate this loss through online arts education.\n\nNational organizations promoting arts education include Americans for the Arts including \"Art. Ask For More.\", its national arts education public awareness campaign; Association for the Advancement of Arts Education; Arts Education Partnership.;\n\nProfessional organizations for art educators include the National Art Education Association, which publishes the practitioner-friendly journal \"Art Education\" and the research journal \"Studies in Art Education\"; USSEA (the United States Society for Education through Art) and InSEA (the International Society for Education through Art).\n\nEducation through the visual arts is an important and effective influence in allowing students, from an early age, to comprehend and implement the foundational democratic process emphasized within the United States societal structure.\n\nOlivia Gude, the 2009 recipient of the National Art Education Association’s Lowenfeld Lecture Scholarship, spoke about the numerous ways in which art education is instrumental in forming an informed self- and world-aware citizen. She asserts that:\n\nArt education was combined with special education even before there were reforms to create special accommodations for children with special needs in typical classrooms. When it comes to art, art therapists are often used to connect with students with special needs. However, some art therapists pull students out of the classroom, causing them to fall behind in their other schoolwork such as math, English, and science. Because of this, art therapy is reserved for students who do not have much chance for long-term improvements, but rather short-term developmental skills, or for those who seek to increase their all-round capabilities.\n\nSpecial educator Jean Lokerson and art educator Amelia Jones wrote that “the art room is a place where learning disabilities can turn into learning assets.” Special needs students often come out of their shells and get enthusiastic about creating. Art is also a way that special educators teach their students fundamentals that they may not even realize.\n\nThere are ongoing studies that continue to prove that art and special education go hand in hand. Testing continues to prove that art in any classroom, but especially special education classrooms causes students to be motivated, enthusiastic, and in some cases, even promote learning in other subject areas.\n\nThe domain of art education is broadening to include a wider range of visual and popular culture. Current trends in scholarship employ postmodern and visual culture approaches to art education, consider effects of globalism on the production and interpretation of images and focus renewed interest on issues of creativity. Within the NAEA, research and publications are being geared toward issues of learning, community, advocacy, research and knowledge. Since 2016, the Art Education Research Institute (AERI) has held an annual symposium that supports critical, systematic, empirical, and theoretical research and scholarship that addresses key intellectual and practical issues in the field of art education. AERI seeks to promote a broad range of rigorous research practices and methodologies drawn from the arts, humanities, and social sciences to improve inquiry related to teaching and learning in and through the visual arts.\n\n\n"}

Armstrong\n\nWilliam Howard Armstrong (September 14, 1911 – April 11, 1999) was an American children's author and educator, best known for his 1969 novel \"Sounder\", which won the Newbery Medal.\n\nWilliam Howard Armstrong was born in Lexington, Virginia in 1911 during the worst hailstorm and tornado in the memory of his neighbors. He was the third child born to Howard Gratton Armstrong, a farmer, and his wife, Ida Morris Armstrong. He had a difficult time in school, being a small child with asthma and glasses.\n\nWhile his father taught him to work hard, his mother taught Armstrong to love stories. \"No one told me the Bible was not for young readers, so I found some exciting stories in it,\" Armstrong said.\n\"Not until years later did I understand why I liked the Bible stories so much. It was because everything that could possibly be\nomitted [left out] was omitted. There was no description of David so I could be like David... .\" Armstrong later used the art of omission in his own writing of \"Sounder\" which he wrote based on an account told around his family's kitchen table in Virginia. One story in particular, told by an elderly black man about Argus, the faithful dog of Odysseus, fascinated him; the dog recognized his master when he returned home after being away for twenty long years. This story stayed with him throughout his life and ultimately was the inspiration for his award-winning children's book, \"Sounder\".\n\nAfter growing up on a farm near Lexington, Armstrong graduated from the Augusta Military Academy. He attended Hampden-Sydney College, where he wrote for the college newspaper\nand edited its literary magazine. Armstrong graduated cum laude in 1936, then continued his higher education with graduate work at the University of Virginia. He farmed in Connecticut near the Housatonic River, also learning to be a carpenter and a stonemason. In 1945, he became a history master at Kent School in Kent, Connecticut, where he remained for fifty-two years, teaching general studies, classics, and ancient history to generations of ninth grade students.\n\nArmstrong was loved, admired, and feared by his students. A truly formidable character and head of \"study hall\", he suffered no fools lightly. More than once he was known to send a textbook flying across the classroom with unerring accuracy to awaken one inattentive student or another.\n\nIn 1956, at the request of his school headmaster, he published his first book, a study guide called \"Study Is Hard Work\". Armstrong followed this title with numerous other self-help books, and in 1963 he was awarded the National School Bell Award of the National Association of School Administrators for distinguished service in the interpretation of education.\n\nIn 1969, Armstrong published his masterpiece, an eight-chapter novel entitled \"Sounder\" about an African-American sharecropping family. Praised by critics, \"Sounder\" won the John Newbery Medal and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1970, and was adapted into a major motion picture in 1972 starring Paul Winfield and Cicely Tyson. Despite its success, it was criticized by some African-Americans because they claimed that a white writer couldn't really understand their experience.\n\nAmong his other novels are \"The Sour Land\" which is a sequel to \"Sounder\", though not labeled as such, \"The Mills of God\" and \"The MacLeod Place\", the story of a multi-generational family farm displaced by the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\nBy the mid 1970s, enriched by earnings from \"Sounder\", among other works, Armstrong was thoroughly ensconced in Kent School. He raised sheep for passover on a beautiful hillside piece of property provided by the school and reportedly only charged Kent one dollar per year for his academic services.\n\nHe continued to be prolific in his writing output, mainly publishing books with historical or biblical main characters, such as \"Hadassah: Esther the Orphan Queen\" (1972) and \"The Education of Abraham Lincoln\" (1974).\n\nHampden-Sydney College awarded Armstrong an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1986.\n\nHe died in 1999 at his home in Kent, Connecticut at the age of 87.\n\nHis Newbery Medal currently resides in the William Armstrong children's book section at Bortz Library at Armstrong's alma mater Hampden-Sydney College.\n\n\n"}
