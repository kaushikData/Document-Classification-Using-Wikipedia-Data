The name ABISY means \"The Plan (also in the sense of committee) for collecting History of the Whole of India\". It was envisioned in 1973 by Moropant Pingley, a \"pracharak\" of the RSS. The main leaders of the organisation have been described as having a Hindutva ideology, although its participants may have their own reasons for participating, \"which may have nothing to do with political ideology.\"\n\nThe organisation holds that India's history was distorted by the British Raj: \nAccording to organising secretary Balmukund Pandey, Indian historians have been exposed to western distortions, which created a false impression of Indian cultural diversity, and screened its uniformly Aryan past. According to ABISY, beneath the diversity of India's culture is a unifying Hindu culture. It regards the Vedic culture to have originated in the Janjati and Adivasis traditions, the local Indian cultures: \nABISY tries to show this link by investigating those local cultures, teaching its participants to write history based on Indian evidence. Berti notes that this kind of \"new local historiography\" is not unique to Hindutva-writers, but has also appeared in African nationalistic discourse, and that \"the political construction and utilisation of folklore was at the very heart of the XIX century’s European nationalisms.\"\n\nIn August 2014, the organisation stated that it had completed four research projects, namely retracing the journey of the Saraswati river, countering the theory that Aryans migrated into India and instead claiming that Aryans were originally from India who had migrate out of India, dating the Mahabharatha, Shankaracharya and Buddha, and emphasizing that the 1857 rebellion was the First War of Independence.\n\nIt announced that its next ten-year project would be to compile all Hindu \"Puranas\" into an encyclopedia, get scholars to interpret its original meaning, and to put it forward as India's real history. The ABISY is also going to document the history of all the 670+ districts in India, as describe the history of the more than 600 tribal communities in India.\n\nThe ABISY centers its historical work around Hindu scriptures. Organising secretary Balmukund Pandey stated that according to the RSS, the \"puranas\" were the most significant source of Indian history.\n\nBerti states that ABISY methodology, as exemplified in its interpretation of Kullu mythology, is to collect orally preserved stories of the gods, or \"bharthā\", which are to be regarded as reliable sources for an understanding of those gods:\nABISY leaders \"decipher\" those texts, or often just snippets of them, to reveal their similarity with , by focusing on specific words or expressions. This would reveal the Sanskrit identity of the village gods.\n\nThe ABISY publishes the journal \"Itihas Darpan\" (Mirror of History), edited in Delhi. A majority of the articles are written in English, while a few are in Hindi. The editorial standards of the journal emphasize the urgency of \"scientific character\" in Indian historical research, with repeated reference to a \"scientific\" framework, such as \"the importance of making reference to sources, and to proving with documents what is put forward. Not all local history is deemed worth researching, but only those facts which have a \"historical basis\" and are in accordance with the organisation's ideology.\n\nABISY headquarters are located at Keshav Kunj, the Delhi office of the RSS. Under the central office are thirteen \"ksetra\", or provincial, offices, each run by a president. These centres are responsible for connecting ABISY ideology to local cultural lore and tradition. Branches of ABISY exist in Chandigarh, Shimla and Kullu.\n\nABISY also has links to historians from multiple universities. ABISY states that it has 500 professors associated with it.\n\nIn July 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, the head of the Andhra Pradesh chapter of ABISY, was appointed Chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) by the National Democratic Alliance government headed by Narendra Modi. In March 2015, three other ABISY-affiliated historians were nominated as members to the Council:\n\n"}

It is one of the International Science Olympiads. The first APhO was hosted by Indonesia in 2000. The next Asian Physics Olympiad (2019) will be held in Australia.\n\nAPhO has its origins in the International Physics Olympiad and is conducted according to similar statutes (One five-hour theoretical examination and one or two laboratory examinations). It is usually held about two months before the IPhO and can also be seen as additional training for the teams.\n\nEach national delegation is made up of eight competitors (unlike five in the IPhO) plus two leaders. Observers may also accompany a national team. The leaders are involved in the selection, preparation and translation of the exam tasks, and the translation and marking of exam papers. The students compete as individuals, and must sit through intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. For their efforts the students can be awarded a medal (gold, silver or bronze) or an honorable mention.\n\nIn 1999, the team leader of Indonesia, Prof. Yohanes Surya, Ph.D., together with the president of IPhO, Prof.Waldemar Gorzkowski, undertook to create and organize the first APhO, which was held in Indonesia, between April 24 and May 2, 2000. At this time, prof. Gorzkowski was also working in Indonesia to help with the IPhO team. The event attracted participants from 12 Asian countries. It now is attended by up to 27 countries.\n\nActively participating countries include Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, China Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Macau, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Russia and Romania have participated as guest teams in the past years.\n\nAPhO has 8 students in each delegation, while IPhO has 5.\n\nIn 2001, the IPhO International Board accepted a new system of awarding the prizes. The new system, designed by Cyril Isenberg and Dr. Gunter Lind was based on relative number of contestants for each type of award, instead of the score boundaries defined by percentage of the best contestant's score.\n\nThis was not acceptable for APhO, because the average level of contestants is different. The old system remained in power for APhO since the beginning up to 9th APhO in Mongolia, where the leaders voted for replacing it by a new award system suggested by Dr. Eli Raz from the Israeli delegation. The new system, sometimes unofficially referred to as the Israeli Award System, is based on a reference score that is the lowest between twice the median score and the mean score of the top 3 participants. It was first used on 10th APhO in Thailand.\n\nDates and locations of the APhO:\n\n"}

After independence it was part of the Universitas Indonesia before becoming an independent institute on September 1, 1963. Prof. Dr. Ir. Herry Suhardiyanto, M.Sc. serves as its director.\nThe first school in Bogor was established in 1876 under Rudolph Scheffer, under the name \"landbouwschool te Buitenzorg\" (agriculture school). New schools for different fields were opened in the following years for Native Indonesians. The institute started in the early 20th century as a veterinary medicine and agricultural school. Before World War II, the institutions were known as Middelbare Landbouwschool (secondary agricultural school), Middelbare Bosbouwschool (secondary forestry school) dan Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool (veterinary school). appointment as department director of agricultural education in 1910 marked a curriculum shift toward training for the government and private sides of colonial agribusiness, including basic biology classes augmented with practical education about cultivation techniques and technologies. argued that department officials in the Ministry of Agriculture \"needed to familiarize themselves with Javanese farming practices.\"\n\nIn 1940, the Dutch government founded an Institution of Agricultural Higher Education in Bogor with the name Landbouw Hogeschool, which later on 31 October 1941 was called Landbouwkundige Faculteit (Agronomy Faculty). However, the school was closed down during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945). The Nederlandsch Indische Veeartsenschool remained in operation, but its name was changed to Bogōru jūigakkō (ボゴール獣医学校) (Bogor Veterinary School).\n\nSometime after the declaration of independence in 1946, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the new Republic of Indonesia upgraded the Veterinary School in Bogor to the College of Veterinary Medicine (PTKH).\n\nThe Netherlands returned to Indonesia and retook control of the institution in 1947, thus Landbouwkundige Faculteit was reopened as the Faculteit Voor Landbouw-Wetenschappen, which had majors in Agriculture and Forestry. In 1948 the PTKH or College of Veterinary Medicine was changed to Faculteit voor Diergeneeskunde under Universiteit van Indonesië (later the University of Indonesia). \nAfter Indonesia gained its independence in 1950, Landbouw-wetenschappen became the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Indonesia, with three departments — Socio-Economics, Physical Sciences, and Forestry. In 1957 the Department of Land Fishery was formed. Meanwhile, Faculteit voor Dieergeneeskunde became the Faculty of Veterinary Medicines and Animal Husbandry.\n\nIPB was founded on September 1, 1963 by the decision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education No. 92/1963 and was approved by President Sukarno's decree No. 279/1965. At the time, the two faculties of University of Indonesia which is in Bogor were separated into an independent institution. The new university (IPB) has five faculties: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Fisheries, Animal Science, and Forestry. In 1964 the Faculty of Technology and Mechanization of Agriculture was added.\n\nOn December 26, 2000 the Indonesia government changed IPB's autonomy status to a state-owned university.\n\nIn 2005, IPB applied the minor and major system instead of the national curriculum system. This allow IPB students to take more than one department field.\n\nThe logo consist of \"Institut Pertanian Bogor\" text, a tree with three branches and five leaves, and an open book which are all lined by a white circle on a blue background. The logo reflects IPB as an academic institution, source of knowledge and technology, with the \"Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi\" obligation.\n\nThe basic blue color symbolizes IPB as a science and technology university, the open book symbolizes IPB as a source of knowledge, the circle symbolizes that science has no limits and always growing, the three branches growing from the book symbolize Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi (IPB's three commitments: Education, Research, and Community Service), and the five leaves represent the first five faculties of IPB and symbolize Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi which is based on Pancasila.\n\nThe Institut Pertanian Bogor main flag is yellow with IPB emblem in the middle. Each faculty has its own logo and flag based on the IPB logo and flag.\nFaculties have a white IPB emblem in the middle, except the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science. The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science have a blue colored IPB emblem in the middle.\n\n\nInstitut Pertanian Bogor has agricultural, livestock, veterinary, and life science studies.\n\nIPB consist of nine faculties providing an undergraduate program. Graduate and postgraduate programs are managed by a separate graduate school. In 1972, IPB implemented a four-year undergraduate curriculum and, in 1975, opened the first graduate school in Indonesia.\n\nIPB undergraduate new students are required to pass a Common First Year Program (\"Tingkat Persiapan Bersama (TPB)\") before entering any faculties or department although they are enrolled as a student of specific faculties and department. They are also required to live in dormitories during the first year.\n\nInstitut Pertanian Bogor has a diploma program that is separated from the faculties and managed under the Directorate of Diploma Program. Unlike the undergraduate students, a common first year program is unavailable for diploma program students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Faculty of Forestry in 1963 consisted of two departments: Forest Management and Exploitation; and Forest Products Processing. Which later became the Department of Forest Products in 1969 and then the Department of Forest Products Technology in 1983, when Department of Forest Resources Conservation was formed. In 2005, Faculty of Forestry developed into its present four departments: \n\nIt offers bachelor's and master's degrees and doctorates in forest management science, fiber and composite technology, forest product quality improvement and engineering, tropical biodiversity, ecotourism and environmental services management, and tropical silviculture.\n\n\n\n\nThe Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA) is the youngest faculty in IPB; it was established on August 2, 2005 by the Rector’s decree no. 112/K13/OT/2005. his establishment was IPB’s answer to changes that were taking place toward the era of higher education autonomy (IPB BHMN) which granted the university the power to form new study programs, departments, and faculties.\n\nThe roots of FEMA IPB were the former Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture; Study Program of Agriculture Extension and Communication of Socioeconomy Department, Faculty of Agriculture; and socioeconomic study programs of all the other faculties in IPB.\n\nThe Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture was developed into Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ) and Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK). While the Department of Agricultural Socioeconomy (SOSEK) of Faculty of Agriculture was transformed into Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM), Department of Agribusiness, and Department of Environmental Resource Economy (ESL). Furthermore; through the clustering process; the Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ), the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK), and the Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM) merged up to become the Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA).\n\nFEMA IPB is the first and only faculty of its kind in Indonesia and it is one of the three faculties of human ecology throughout South East Asia. The others are in the College of Human Ecology University of Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB) and the Faculty of Human Ecology, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).\n\n\n\nMandate:\n\nTo develop human nutrition science and its application in individual, family and community that involves agriculture, food, nutrition, and health.\n\nSections:\n\nThe university plans develop a Seed Center at Leuwikopo, Dramaga, Bogor due to Indonesia has to import seeds so far and facing a problem of seed supply.

{"id": "20670767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20670767", "title": "Enlaces", "text": "Enlaces\n\nEnlaces is a Chilean educational program designed to create a structural change in Chilean education in order to prepare youth, along with their parents and guardians, to participate in the emergent society of knowledge, and to create networks of communication that help integrate them with the world. Enlaces was started in 1992 by Chile's Ministry of Education.\n\nThe testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in Santiago, the capital of Chile. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the Araucanía Region, (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program. When the government decided that this project was viable, it focused all of its efforts on the spread of this program to all the regions of the country.\n\nFrom 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, computers, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training. In 2003, in order to continue their efforts to connect the country, the Ministry of Education signed an agreement with local telecommunication companies to offer low-cost broadband connection for educational institutions. Sixty percent of the students in Chile have access to broadband internet because of this agreement. In 2007, the Enlaces Program had 3,372,943 students, and 95% of the students in the country have access to computer.\n\nIn 2007, the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom. That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration. The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile. Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions.\n\nExamples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are electronic whiteboards for math, palm pilots or pocket PCs for physics, and projectors for teaching sciences. Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010.\n\nThe science program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI (hypothesis, experimentation, instruction) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet.\n\nThis new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for chemistry, and animals for dissection for biology) that many schools in Chile face.\n\nPart of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through adult education. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally. For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18-hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a word processor, how to use the internet, and how to create and use an email account.\n\n"}

It is home to the Liszt Collection, which features several valuable books and manuscripts donated by Franz Liszt upon his death, and the AVISO studio, a collaboration between the governments of Hungary and Japan to provide sound recording equipment and training for students. The Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music was founded by Franz Liszt himself (though named after its founder only in 1925, approx. 50 years after it was relocated to its current location at the heart of Budapest). Between 1877-1879 the Academy moved into its present building, a masterpiece of art Neo-Renaissance architecture.\n\nThe Academy was originally called the \"Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music\" and it was also called \"College of Music\" from 1919-1925. It was then named after its founder Franz Liszt in 1925. It was founded in Liszt's home, and relocated to a three-story Neo-Renaissance building designed by Adolf Láng and built on today's Andrássy Avenue between 1877 and 1879. That location is referred to as \"the old Music Academy\" and commemorated by a 1934 plaque made by Zoltán Farkas. It was repurchased by the academy in the 1980s, and is now officially known as \"the Ferenc Liszt Memorial and Research Center.\" \n\nReplacing \"the old Music Academy\", the Academy moved into a building erected in 1907 at the corner of Király Street and Ferenc Liszt Square. It serves as a centre for higher education, music training, and concert hall. The Art Nouveau style building is one of the most well known in Budapest. It was designed by Flóris Korb and Kálmán Giergl at the request of Baron Gyula Wlassics, who was the Minister of Culture at that time.

To realize this vision, Aerospace began working with the University of Southern California's Center for Software Engineering (USC-CSE), which was pursuing a project on complex software design cosponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory.\n\nThe workshop became a reality in February, 1997, when Aerospace and the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) cosponsored the first Ground System Architectures Workshop (GSAW) held at the Aerospace campus in El Segundo, California, USA. More than 200 participants met for three days of plenary presentations, panel discussions, and a keynote address by the SMC commander. That first GSAW focused on the role of software architectures in spacecraft ground system standardization, implementation (using commercial products, middleware, and frameworks), and interoperability.\n\nSince 1997, the Ground System Architectures Workshop (GSAW) has served as the premier forum for spacecraft ground system experts from around the world.\n\nGSAW is sponsored by The Aerospace Corporation in cooperation with:\n\n"}

She was one of the founders of the German Women's Association () and worked to improve women's rights to access education and employment. As part of that effort, she founded the Society for Family Education and for People's Welfare () and the first school offering higher education to women in Germany.\n\nHenriette Benas was born on 23 November 1825 in Krotoschin, Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, to Eva (née Laski) and the Jewish merchant, Levin Benas. Her mother died when she was five years old and her father remarried an illiterate woman who was not a nurturing maternal figure. Benas completed school at the Higher School for Girls () at age 14, but her education was limited to subjects which taught women how to be effective housewives. She supplemented her meager education by reading German classics and the newspaper, \"Breslauer Zeitung\", which aroused her early interest in politics. In 1853 Benas married her cousin, Abraham Meir Goldschmidt, a widower with three sons, who was the rabbi of the Warsaw German-Jewish congregation. Five years later, her husband was appointed to succeed Adolf Jellinek as rabbi of Leipzig and the family relocated.\n\nGoldschmidt equated the move to the university town of Leipzig with an awakening to freedom and humanitarian spirit. She quickly became involved in the German-Jewish community and was exposed to the ideas of Friedrich Fröbel, founder of the early-childhood kindergarten education system. Encouraged by her husband to pursue her interests in education, Goldschmidt studied history, literature, pedagogy and philosophy on her own. In 1865, she, Louise Otto-Peters and Auguste Schmidt organized a conference of German women and founded the German Women's Association () to work towards improving the lives of women. Goldschmidt had initially been hesitant about becoming a board member of the group, as the legal statutes at that time forbade women voting in volunteer organizations, but with her husband's encouragement, she became an active member. Between 1867 and 1906, she served as a member of the board and presented many lectures for the organization.\n\nIn 1867, Goldschmidt organized petition drives for submission to the Reichstag in support of women's rights to access education and employment and she was a signatory to the petition to protect illegitimate children. She also proposed that women be participants in their communities, because women would lend a sensitivity to dealing with culturally divisive issues. The following year, she proposed a mandatory social service initiative requiring women to serve for a year in social work. In 1871, Goldschmidt founded the Society for Family Education and for People's Welfare (), with the goal of training kindergarten teachers in the Fröbel method. She served as president of the organization for over four decades. By the following year, the organization was sponsoring teaching seminars to a growing number of adherents and had opened a public kindergarten. By 1878, she organized the High School for Ladies (), where professors from the University of Leipzig gave lectures to students. Because women were barred from attending college, and only a few private schools offered inferior education, the lectures were attended by hundreds of women and offered them the chance for not only an education, but employment as a teacher.\nIn 1889, the Jewish community sponsored a donation drive and purchased a house for the organization's operations. It was located at 16 Weststraße (later named Friedrich-Ebert-Straße) and became not only Golschmidt's home after her husband's death, but the center of women's education, sponsoring educational courses and lectures, as well as cultural and social events. Members of the association were also allowed to reside in the house and both the writer and educator Anna Zabel were known to have lived there. In 1898 Goldschmidt and Auguste Schmidt, on behalf of the German Women's Association prepared a petition to establish the Fröbel educational method as the official municipal and state educational system. The petition asked for kindergartens to come under state standardization and supervision, with mandatory attendance for all children. They were met with waves of opposition from those who saw forced education as supplanting familial rights to children's upbringing and accused the women of trying to destroy the family. There were also opponents who saw the measure as forcing children of different social classes to mix. Though Goldschmidt defended the plan, publishing a response to her critics \"Ist der Kindergarten eine Erziehungs- oder Zwangsanstalt?\" (Is kindergarten an educational institution or forced?) in 1901, it was ultimately defeated.\n\nGoldschmidt did not give up and continued writing and giving speeches on the need for kindergartens and women's education. In 1906, women were finally admitted to university study in Germany, but the coursework did not prepare women to meet their societal obligations, as Goldschmidt believed that the natural calling of woman was to transform society through their cultural involvement. She strove to fill a gap and not compete with university studies and in 1911, Goldschmidt achieved the high point of her career, with the establishment of the first institution in Germany offering higher education specifically to women. The () designed its classes for women as a means of formalizing Goldschmidt's vision of womanhood. It aimed to teach women to participate in the intellectual life of their culture, prepare them to be successful mothers and teachers, and to develop a sensitivity to the needs of their community and the skills to perform charitable works to help their community. Once again, she utilized professors from the University of Leipzig, to supplement the coursework, but Goldschmidt and taught classes between 1911 and 1913. After the 1916-1917 term, Goldschmidt retired and turned the operation of the school over to the Saxon Ministry of Worship and Public Instruction. Goldschmidt died on 30 January 1920 in Leipzig, Weimar Republic and was buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery of Leipzig.\nIn 1921, the clubhouse of the Society for Family Education and for People's Welfare was renamed as the Henriette Goldschmidt House, in her honor. But, that same year, the society was dissolved and merged with the Henri Hinrichsen Foundation, with Hinrichsen in charge of the school. During the Nazi era, the school eradicated any ties to its Jewish founder, Goldschmidt and later director, Hinrichsen, also barring admittance to Jewish girls. With the establishment of East Germany, the school was renamed after Henriette Goldschmidt and served as a pedagogical training school for kindergarten teachers. In 1992, the school, now called the Henriette-Goldschmidt Vocational School, became a technical training institution for social work and special education. While the school survived, in 1999, the city demolished the Henriette Goldschmidt House, despite protests, for a road expansion, which never took place.\n\nThere are two public plaques honoring Goldschmidt in Leipzig. One was dedicated on the 75th anniversary in 1986 at the entry to the Henriette Goldschmidt School, which states: \"Here in 1911 the Academy of Women opened, initiated and supported by the women's rights activist and Fröbel educator Henriette Goldschmidt (1825-1920), financially made possible by Dr. Henri Hinrichsen (1868-1942).\" The second plaque in honor of Goldschmidt was affixed to a house located at 7 Spittastraße in 1996 to mark the location of the first children's day care center. A bust of Goldschmidt's likeness was cast in 2001 to mark the 90th anniversary of the school. The original is in the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts and a replica is on a stele at the Henriette Goldschmidt School with a plaque inscribed to match the one removed by the Nazis and originally added to the wall by Hinrichsen, with the words \"To the noble pursuit of German women\".\n\n\n"}

Over, 1.9 million youths have benefited from participating in INJAZ activities since its inception.\n\nThis non-profit organization focuses on developing skills of the youth in four main thematic areas:\n\n1. Financial Education\n\n2. Life Skills\n\n3. Business and Entrepreneurship\n\n4. Employment\n\nThese four fundamental skills are developed through a variety of demand-driven programs, which are delivered to youth in schools, universities, community colleges, and various social institutions.\n\nThis organization implements programs across Jordan, in twelve governorates, by working with partners from the private and public sectors.\n\nSponsored by Queen Rania, INJAZ was established in 1999 as a project under the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded organization Save the Children. In the early stages the project encountered opposition, notably in Ma'an; it was re-launched in 2001 by Soraya Salti as an independent non-profit. Its activities reached over 100,000 school students in Jordan during the 2010–11 academic year.\n\nOver the past 17 years, it has established itself as a leading solution provider, linking the public, private, and civil society sectors.\n\nIt has developed its own programs in consultation with local and regional experts. It has collaborated with international development organizations to bring new, high-impact programs to Jordan and adapt them to local sensibilities.\n\nINJAZ has a broad network of domestic and international partners. It has also developed solid strategic partnerships with key ministries, including the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD), the King Abdullah II Fund for Development (KAFD), the Vocational Training Center (VTC), and the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ).\n\nIts aim is to meet a perceived need for vocational training, providing young people with entrepreneurship skills and enhancing their employability. The program has been funded in part by the business sector, and involves volunteers from private business in delivering the training.\n\n\"Inspire and prepare youth to become productive members of their society and accelerate the development of the national economy.\"\n\nINJAZ provides youth with skills and resources to enter the workforce by filling the gap between the national educational system and the needs of the job market.\n\nIn Jordan, the unemployment rate among the youth is staggeringly high. One of the major reasons behind the worrying unemployment rate is that Jordan has an underdeveloped entrepreneurial culture.\n\nHowever, young Jordanians were more likely than their regional counterparts to have a favorable view of entrepreneurship. This suggests that it is not a lack of interest that keeps Jordanians from becoming entrepreneurs, but other factors, such as the perceived legal, financial, and bureaucratic challenges, as well as the lack of educational resources necessary to prepare for such a career.\n\n\"Inspire and prepare youth to become productive members of their society and accelerate the development of the national economy.\"\n\nINJAZ provides youth with skills and resources to enter the workforce by filling the gap between the national educational system and the needs of the job market.\n\nINJAZ’s portfolio of programs addresses the wide range of needs of young Jordanians. The programs complement the education and training provided by traditional educational institutions. These programs are designed to develop their vital soft and hard skills. They also help build entrepreneurial skills necessary to be strong candidates and entrepreneurs in a competitive job market.\n\nINJAZ reaches over 130,000 youth a year with its programs. It implements over 44 programs throughout Jordan's 12 governorates, in close collaboration with 3000 schools, 41 universities/colleges, and 50 youth centers.\n\nINJAZ has a platform to set up volunteer services in a more coordinated, systematic, and efficient manner. It offers effective means to engage volunteers in building their society and to spread a culture of volunteerism in Jordan.\n\nINJAZ already succeeded in institutionalizing volunteerism within the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, which have been already adopted by many of its over-300 private and public sector partners.\n\nINJAZ removes typical logistical and/or bureaucratic barriers to enable members of the private sector to work directly with the youth. This model has been developed in consultation with partners, which includes government officials and institutions, the private sector, educators, volunteers and students.\n\nINJAZ is headquartered in Amman, Jordan with field offices in Irbid, Zarqa, Karak, Wadi Musa, Tafilah and Aqaba.\n\n"}

She was the principal and drama teacher of the \"Dramatens elevskola\" twice: from 1831 to 1834, and from 1841 to 1856. She was an elite actress of the Royal Dramatic Theatre.\n\nKarolina Richter was born to the hautboist Carl Johan Richter and Magdalena Sofia Rytting.\n\nShe was a student of the \"Dramatens elevskola\" at the Royal Swedish Opera between 1806 and 1810. She was a student of Sofia Lovisa Gråå, and belonged to those female stage artists of her generation referred to as the \"Grå Girls\".\n\nKarolina Bock was engaged at the \"Djurgårdsteatern\" and the \"Nya komiska teatern\" of Isak de Broen in 1813-14. In 1814, she was engaged at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, where she remained active until her retirement in 26 June 1863.\n\nKarolina Bock came to belong to the elite of Swedish actors generation. She was not regarded suitable for heroine parts, which where often the women main roles of the plays of the epoch, but established herself well already in her youth in the roles of old women in comedies, a category in which she formed a successful career and never lacked assignments, becoming: \nIt was said of her that she had a rare quality: she knew her own limitations.\n\nAmong her most successful roles were the title role in \"Min tante Aurore\" by Boieldieu, Veneranda in \"Slottet Montemero\", Mrs Slammerström in \"Bildhuggaren\", Aunt Vivika in \"General Eldhjelm\", Mrs Griponiai in \"Brodertvisten\" by Kotzebue, Mrs Miller in \"Kabal och kärlek\", Viarda in \"Preciosa\", Mrs von Fromuth i \"Porträttet\", Mrs Wunschell in \"Grefvarne Klingsberg\", Theodolinda in \"Doktor Wespe\", Mrs Darmantiéres in \"Dottersonen\", Margarita in \"Mazarin\", Fadette in \"Syrsan\" (the dramatisation of \"La Petite Fadette\" by George Sand), Mrs Malapropp in \"Rivalerna\", Mrs Harleigh in \"Jane Eyre\" and Gunilla Fipps in \"Mäster Smith\". On 26 June 1863, Bock retired after having made her final performance in her favorite part, the grandmother in \"Porträttet\".\n\nKarolina Bock was given the \"Litteris et Artibus\" by the king in 1857, in recognition of her dramatic career.\n\nKarolina Bock was the principal and drama teacher of the \"Dramatens elevskola\" twice: from 1831 to 1834 and from 1841 to 1856. She also served as instructor of declamation there.\n\nSeveral generations of Swedish actors were shaped by Bock. Among her students were Emilie Högquist and Jenny Lind. Her method was that of the French technique which had been introduced at the school by Anne Marie Milan Desguillons and kept at the time of her own tenure as student there under Sofia Lovisa Gråå. She was known for her skill at giving instruction in the correct distinction of the language in both song and speech, and it was said that all of her students were recognizable by having the distinction taught during her tenure.\n\nHer technique, however, belonged to the elder French school of solemnity which was replaced by the new romantic schools more natural acting by the mid-19th century. Furthermore, though Karolina Bock was described as an excellent teacher, she was also described as one who forced a more strict discipline upon her students, and in 1856, she was deposed as principal after protests by the acting class.\n\nThe \"Bock Woman\" was described as a \"theatre original\" with a fierce temperament. When she was given the task to instruct the Danish guest artist Charlotte Bournonville (daughter of August Bournonville) in the Swedish language in 1857, she performed the task so well that Bournonville could perform soon after as a native Swede in the part of Fatima in \"Oberon\", where she made success. When the direction thanked Bock for this, she \"gave them such a load of barking that they quickly retreated.\"\n\nKarolina Bock was married twice. In 1813, she married Johan Gabriel Svanberg violinist at the royal chapel, from whom she divorced in 1822, assuming the name Mrs Richter.

{"id": "533398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533398", "title": "Royal Veterinary College", "text": "Royal Veterinary College\n\nThe Royal Veterinary College (informally the RVC) is a Veterinary school located in London and a constituent college of the federal University of London. The RVC was founded in 1791 and joined the University of London in 1949. It is the oldest and largest Veterinary school in the United Kingdom, and one of only eight in the country where students can study to become a vet.\n\nThe Veterinary College of London was founded in 1791 by a group led by Granville Penn, a grandson of William Penn, following the foundation of the first veterinary college in Europe in Lyon, France in 1762. The promoters wished to select a site close to the metropolis, but far enough away to minimise the temptations open to the students. Earl Camden was just then making arrangements to develop some fields he owned to the north of London, and he replied to the College's newspaper advertisement for a suitable site with an offer to sell it some of his land. The site was rural, but urban developments appeared on all sides in the early decades of the 19th century, creating Camden Town.\nCharles Benoit Vial de St Bel of the Lyon establishment was appointed as the first principal of the new college. The first students, just four of them, began their studies in 1792, and the first horse was admitted for treatment in 1793. St Bel died later that year and was succeeded by Edward Coleman, who managed the college for nearly forty six years and established its reputation. Among the first students were Delabere Pritchett Blaine and Bracy Clark. In its early years it was mainly concerned with horses, but the range of animals covered gradually increased. The original building was a quadrangle in a neoclassical style, and there was a paddock on the opposite side of Royal College Street, but this was later sold for housing development.\n\nIn 1796 John Shipp was the first qualified veterinary surgeon to join the British Army.\n\nThe college first acquired royal patronage from King George IV. In 1844 it was awarded a Royal Charter.\n\nIn 1865 RVC Professor James Beart Simonds was appointed as the first Chief Inspector and Veterinary Advisor to the Privy council, with particular regard to cattle plague.\n\nIn 1875 college was granted a Royal Charter as the Royal Veterinary College; it remains the only veterinary college in the UK to have its own Royal Charter.\n\nIn 1879 the Cheap Practice Clinic was established, later known as the Poor People's Out-Patients Clinic. Some veterinary surgeons were concerned that the college was threatening their livelihoods, but the college argued that poor people could not afford veterinary fees, therefore their animals would go untreated if the Clinic were closed.\n\nThe college celebrated its centenary in 1891 and in that year the Students' Union was founded. In 1895 the first X-ray machine was acquired.\n\nThere was a major renovation in 1907 of the college horse boxes, which had fund-raisers' commemorative shields hung at their doorways.\n\nIn 1924 the Research Institute in Animal Pathology was built, headed by Professor John McFadyean.\n\nVarious extensions were added to the Camden Town site over the years. The buildings had become obsolete and in 1927 were officially declared dangerous structures. A fund-raising scheme for the total rebuilding of the college was launched by the new Principal, Professor Sir Frederick Hobday.\n\nIn 1932 the Beaumont Animals' Hospital opened.\n\nNew buildings were opened by King George VI in November 1937.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the RVC evacuated to Streatley, Berkshire, although the Beaumont Animals' Hospital remained open at Camden Town.\n\nIn 1949 the RVC became a school of the University of London.\n\nIn 1958 the Hawkshead field station, in Hertfordshire, was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn the 1980s the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust was launched with the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as patron, and the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals was opened at Hawkshead by the Queen Mother. Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, and Chancellor of the University of London, opened the surgical wing of the Sefton Equine Referral Hospital.\n\nThe bicentenary celebrations were held in 1991. The skeleton of the famous racehorse Eclipse, dissected in 1789 by St. Bel was once more the property of the RVC and was placed on display in the Museum at Hawkshead.\n\nThe London BioScience Innovation Centre was opened in 2001.\n\nThe Learning Resource Centre (Eclipse Building) was officially opened at Hawkshead by Her Majesty the Queen in October 2003. The Large Animal Clinical Centre was officially opened by HRH Prince Philip The Duke of Edinburgh in October 2003.\n\nIn 2005 the Duchess of Cornwall visited the Hawkshead Campus as new Patron of the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust.\n\nThe LIVE Centre at Hawkshead was officially opened by HRH The Princess Royal in February 2007.\n\nStuart Reid was appointed principal of the RVC in late 2010.\n\nThe RVC has two campuses, one in Camden in central London and the other near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire. On the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine course, students spend two years in Camden followed by three years in Potters Bar.\n\nThe 1930s buildings on Royal College Street in Camden Town, near St Pancras railway station remain, with minor extensions. Around half of the undergraduate students are based there at any one time. The Camden campus is also home to the main bulk of the RVC Student Union (RVCSU), including the main college bar, the Haxby.\n\nThe Hawkshead Campus is located in Brookmans Park, rural Hertfordshire, about north of central London, was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1959. The majority of the college sports teams train and play on the sports courts and fields at this campus, which is also home to the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Bolton's Park Farm and the Buttery (a second union-run bar).\n\nThe college provides a number of undergraduate courses, including the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine (BVetMed) as well as accelerated graduate entry BVetMed and a combined BVetMed, Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BSc) degree. BSc degrees are also provided in veterinary nursing, bioveterinary sciences, biological sciences and veterinary pathology, and a foundation degree in veterinary nursing is also offered.\n\nThe college also offers the Gateway course; the first year of an extended six-year veterinary degree programme, created for students who are part of the UK Widening Participation cohort. It is designed to equip students with the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to join a career-building veterinary degree course. This is a widening participation programme for UK non-selective state school students whose parents have not been to university and who receive, or would be eligible for, an Education Maintenance Allowance payment.\n\nThere is a distance learning department and the Graduate School provides masters courses, PhD studentships and clinical training scholarships in a wide range of disciplines. The College's Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Unit is a major academic provider of educational services to the veterinary community.\n\nThe RVC has an e-Media Unit which collaborates with other UK veterinary schools on the development of the WikiVet site.\n\nStudents are encouraged to participate in extra-curricular activities both inside and outside of the college authority. Some examples of sports offered are rowing (see: the Royal Veterinary College Boat Club), rugby, netball, hockey, football, and, more unusually, dance, ice-skating, polo and shooting. For purpose of sports, the RVC is a part of the United Hospitals, and the sports clubs compete (and sometimes socialise) with the London medical schools (such as Barts, ICSM, and RUMS).\n\nThere are also a number of academically-inclined clubs, such as the Farm Animal Clinical Club, the Dissection Club and the RVC Zoological Society, and non-academic societies, such as wine-tasting, games society, and the RVC Christian Union.\n\nThe Student Union runs a number of events throughout the year. In the past, these have included May Ball, Christmas Ball and Sports Ball, as well as Halfway Dinner (which takes place in the second term of third year for students on the BVetMed course), Burns Night, an elaborate Freshers' Week and Raising and Giving (RAG) Fortnight.\n\nStudents on the BVetMed course are also invited to attend events organised by the Association of Veterinary Students (AVS) such as Sports Weekend (which, in 2016, will be held at the RVC) and AVS Congress (which will be held at the University of Liverpool). These allow veterinary students from the UK veterinary schools and the University College Dublin veterinary faculty to convene once or twice a year to socialise, network and compete.\n\nRVC students are also invited to participate in societies run by other universities in London, as, given the relatively small size of the college, the provision for extra-curricular arts and music is not great; the University of London Union offers a selection of sports and societies, as does the Imperial College School of Medicine Student's Union, and students tend to use these opportunities as well as being involved in RVC societies.\n\nThe Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 ranked the RVC as England's best veterinary school of those institutions whose research is exclusively veterinary related. 55% of their submitted academic staff were viewed as producing \"world class\" or \"internationally excellent\" research. It is a self-governing college within the University of London and its scientists work together in interdisciplinary teams within one research division.\n\nThe disciplines of Epidemiology, Microbiology, Pathology, Immunology and Clinical Science are drawn together in the Centre for Emerging, Endemic and Exotic Diseases (CEEED Centre), opened in 2008.\n\nAnimal Welfare and the Animal Welfare unit situated at the college are fundamental to the RVC's research mission and underpins their research programmes. The Structure and Motion Laboratory of the College also has facilities to study locomotion. Understanding how animals and people move is fundamental to musculoskeletal health and diseases that result from ageing, physical activity and the environment. The leaders of this Centre of Excellence are at the forefront of developing technologies to study animal movement, which are used in both basic and applied research.\n\nThe RVC has a Clinical Investigation Centre, co-ordinating disciplined study of its clinical caseload through its electronic patient record system and undertaking Phase II Clinical Trials under a Home Office license. They aim to translate research into solutions for veterinary and human medicine and use their expertise and veterinary patient caseload to undertake comparative research of both biomedical and veterinary significance.\n\nThe RVC runs three animal hospitals and three first opinion practices, all based in London and Hertfordshire. The hospitals treat over 20,000 patients per year.\n\nFor small animals, the RVC runs the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital, a first-opinion hospital based at the RVC's Camden campus, and the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, an animal referral hospital which provides clinical services in a wide range of specialities.\n\nThe equine services include the Equine Practice which is a first opinion ambulatory service, serving Hertfordshire and other local areas and the Equine Referral Hospital which provides referral clinical services to equine practices and horse owners throughout the south of England.\n\nThe RVC operates a referral farm animal hospital at its Hawkshead Campus, which provides full hospitalisation, diagnostic and surgical facilities for individual farm animals. The college has a collaboration with the Dairy Development centre, the Welsh Regional Veterinary Centre (WRVC), which provides a farm health investigation service to vets and farmers in the South Wales region.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly known as \"the Milan Conference\". After deliberations from September 6 to 11, 1880, the conference declared that oral education (oralism) was superior to manual education and passed a resolution banning the use of sign language in school. After its passage in 1880, schools in European countries and the United States switched to using speech therapy without sign language as a method of education for the deaf. A formal apology was made by the board at the 21st International Congress on Education of the Deaf in Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2010 accepting the dangerous ramifications of such ban as an act of discrimination and violation of human and constitutional rights.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell and Edward Miner Gallaudet, both prominent U.S. figures in deaf education, had been debating the effectiveness of oral-only education versus an education that utilizes sign language as a means of visual communication, culminating in the Milan Conference in 1880 that passed eight resolutions on deaf education.\n\nThe Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (which, despite its name, was actually the first) was an international meeting of deaf educators from at least seven countries. There were five delegates from America and approximately 164 delegates total in attendance. The Congress was planned and organized by a committee created by the Pereire Society, a group that was against sign language. More than half of the people invited were known oralists; therefore, the Congress was biased and most, if not all, of the resolutions that were voted on by the delegates gave results in favor of the oral method. Many of the resolutions were worded in ways that supported the oral method, such as \"Considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society, and in giving him a more perfect knowledge of language,/Declares –/That the Oral method ought to be preferred that of signs for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb\".\n\nThe Milan Conference was organized by the Pereire Society, an organization formed by the family of Jacob Rodrigues Pereira of France and financed by their numerous railroad and bank holdings (including the Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier). The Pereire Society was a strong supporter of oralism. They organized the Milan conference with the intent to ban sign language. They secured this outcome by carefully selecting who was invited, inviting the delegates to see the oralist success in a local school, and by encouraging negative reactions to those giving speeches supporting sign language and cheering those supporting oralism.\n\nThe Milan Conference was attended by 164 delegates of various countries. Out of these 164 delegates only one, James Denison, was deaf. The conference president was Abbe Giulio Tarra.\n\nThe nationality of the remaining delegates is unknown. The five U.S. delegates present were James Denison, Edward Miner Gallaudet, Reverend Thomas Gallaudet, Isaac Lewis Peet and Charles A Stoddard.\n\nThe Conference was held in the Regio Instituto Tenico di Santa Martha, Milan. It was held from 6 September to 11 September 1880. The aim of the conference was to ban sign language from deaf education. During the conference there were 12 speakers who gave their opinions on the issues connected with deaf education. Nine of the twelve speakers gave an oralist view, and three (the Gallaudet father and son, and Richard Elliot, a teacher from England) supported the use of sign language.\n\n1. The Convention, considering the incontestable superiority of articulation over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society and giving him a fuller knowledge of language, declares that the oral method should be preferred to that of signs in education and the instruction of deaf-mutes.\n\n2. The Convention, considering that the simultaneous use of articulation and signs has the disadvantage of injuring articulation and lip-reading and the precision of ideas, declares that the pure oral method should be preferred.\n\n3. Considering that a great number of the deaf and dumb are not receiving the benefit of instruction, and that this condition is owing to the impotence of families and of institutions, recommends that governments should take the necessary steps that all the deaf and dumb may be educated.\n\n4. Considering that the teaching of the speaking deaf by the Pure Oral method should resemble as much as possible that of those who hear and speak, declares \n\n5. Considering the want of books sufficiently elementary to help the gradual and progressive development of language, recommends that the teachers of the Oral system should apply themselves to the publication of special works on the subject.\n\n6. Considering the results obtained by the numerous inquiries made concerning the deaf and dumb of every age and every condition long after they had quit school, who, when interrogated upon various subjects, have answered correctly, with sufficient clearness of articulation, and read the lips of their questioners with the greatest facility, declares:\n\n7. Considering that the education of the deaf and dumb by speech has peculiar requirements; considering also that the experienced of teachers of deaf-mutes is almost unanimous, declares\n\n8. Considering that the application of the Pure Oral method in institutions where it is not yet in active operation, should be to avoid the certainty of failure prudent, gradual, progressive, recommends \n\nDelegates from the United States and Britain were the only ones who opposed the use of oralism as a sole method of instruction, but were unsuccessful in their efforts at the congress. Edward Miner Gallaudet and Reverend Thomas Gallaudet were among the protesters who fought against the oralist method. Since failing to overturn the Milan resolutions, Gallaudet ensured that the United States would not be completely converted to oralism-only, which included allowing high school students in institutes for the deaf to use sign language and maintaining Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University) as a university that permits full usage of sign language.\n\nThe National Association of the Deaf was also formed in the United States in response to the Milan Conference and was dedicated toward preserving American Sign Language.\n\nAt the 15th International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) held in Hamburg, West Germany in 1980, the first major precedent for the repudiation of the 1880 resolutions was set by a large group of attendees who rejected the 1880 resolutions in practical-moral terms by the method of informal consensus in deciding that the 1880 resolutions had no appropriate standing, originally, in 1880. As explained by Richard G. Brill: \"At the International Congress in Hamburg in 1980, however, the Milan resolutions were challenged head-on in major professional addresses at the opening of the congresses. It was recognized and accepted that resolutions concerning methodology were not appropriate at such international congresses because of the unlikelihood that the delegates fully represented the practices and philosophies of their home countries.\" Rather than seek to directly overturn the 1880s resolutions, the Congress put forward \"Recommendations\" for informational purposes, including the following: \"Recommended that this International Congress on Education of the Deaf, in convocation gathered at Hamburg, West Germany, in August 1980, affirms and declares that all deaf children have the right to flexible communication in the mode or combination of modes which best meets their individual needs.\" Sharkey and Hikins deemed this Recommendation, along with the others, as constituting overturning the 1880 Milan Congress's resolutions.\n\nIn spite of the previous precedent set in 1980, in July 2010 in Vancouver, Canada, the board of the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) formally voted to reject all of the 1880 Milan resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Known as the 'Resoluciones 919 del MECyT and 3164 MRREECIyC)', it recognised the role of universities in the development of the evaluation.\n\nMeanwhile in 2004, a group of national universities created an inter-university consortium oriented towards the teaching, evaluation and certification of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language (o ELSE from the Spanish, Español como Lengua Segunda y Extranjera), aiming to contribute to political and educational linguistics.\n\nBy June of the same year, three national universities (University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Universidad Litoral (UNL) and the University of Córdoba (UNC)) were working together to design and implement the first official examination to measure competence of Spanish as a foreign language. The exam is called CELU (Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish)) and was approved by Resolution 28 in January 2005.\n\nThe CELU (Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish) is a certificate of competence in the Spanish language from Argentina. Like the DELE (Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera), it also has international validity. The Certificate can be taken by speakers of any language other than Spanish in order to validate their knowledge of Spanish as a second language in their work or study.\n\nIn Argentina it is the only examination officially recognised by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture. Any speaker who can use Spanish in an effective manner, whose goal is to interact efficiently with the other members of the community can take the CELU, independently of the course or method that was used to learn the language.\n\nEspañol como lengua extranjera (ELE) is the term used to refer to various systems used by different learning institutions that teach the Spanish language to speakers of other languages, like the Escuelas Oficiales de Idiomas and the Instituto Cervantes.\n\nFollowing the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages or the \"CEFR\", these institutions offer examinations that will measure the competence of a learner. There are six exams (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) which can be taken independently (i.e. it is not necessary to pass A1 to get B2) no matter the method of instruction used by the learners.\n\nEspañol en Toledo, a Spanish course started by the University of Castile-La Mancha General Foundation, brings students to monuments and historical sites in the city of Toledo, Spain for more experiential learning.\n\nThe \"Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera\" (Certificates of Spanish as a Foreign Language) is an official diploma granted by the Instituto Cervantes on behalf of the Spanish Ministry of Education to evaluate a person's knowledge of Spanish.\n\nThere are six levels of qualification, each corresponding to a certain level described by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages:\n\nThere are a vast number of resources online, including both resources dedicated specifically to the study of Spanish as a second language, as well as more general resources, such as Infoling.\n\n"}

He was the founder of the first modern Albanian school in the County of Durrës.\n\nOriginally from the city of Krujë, where he was born in 1892, Sulejman Zalla pursued elementary studies in his home city and later pursued a degree in the \"Shkolla Normale\" of Shkodër in order to become an Albanian teacher.\n\nOn 4 March 1913, in Ishëm, Zalla opened the first school in the County of Durrës (which at that time included the cities of Tirana, Krujë, Durrës and Kavajë). As recorded by contemporary sources, the opening of the school was met with opposition from the local authorities, which saw the teaching of Albanian in the Latin alphabet as a heresy, given the Muslim dominant culture of the area. As a result of this opposition, the student count was reduced within the first months from 40 pupils to only 10. In addition, the prefect decided to transfer away the local Muslim clergy, but the decision was reverted by governor Esat Toptani. In these conditions Muslim fanatics organized the killing of Sulejman Zalla, who was the teacher of the school, and who was declared by them as a heretic. This intention was countered by the local population of Ishëm, who took the teacher under their protection. Zalla's love for the Albanian language earned him the name of \"Sulë Shqipja\" (\"Sulejman the Albanian language\").\n\nEsat Pasha had Zalla arrested in 1914 and kept him in prisons of Durrës and then Krujë. Rebels of the Peasant Revolt in Albania got him out of prison and Zalla had to become the secretary of Haxhi Qamili, leader of an egalitarian and anti-feudal Peasant Revolt in Albania in 1914–15. Later he managed to leave Qamili and to go to Prênk Bibë Doda, the bayraktar of Mirdita, where he obtained protection under the Albanian besa. At the end of the Peasant Revolt, Zalla returned in the municipalities of Krujë, Prezë, and Ishëm, to teach, and, eventually, in 1927, settled down in the town of Shijak, where he continued to teach Albanian.\n\nWhen Albania was under Italy during World War II, Zalla put his house at the use of the resistance against fascist Italy. For this reason a decision was made that he be transferred to Tuzi of Montenegro, then part of Albania. The decision was never implemented.\n\nDuring Communist Albania, Zalla and his brother were both arrested in 1947 for unknown reasons. He was released two years later with no right to teach. Some years later this right was granted back. At that point he went back to his teaching career and was recipient of several government medals for his educational endeavors, including the People's Teacher () which was granted in 1994.\n"}

The PAAET offers a wide variety of programs across its different colleges and training institutes.\n\nIt was established on December 28, 1982, by law number (63) with the objective of developing and upgrading manpower to meet the challenge of shortfall in technical manpower created by industrial and economic development of the country.\n\nThe foundation of applied education and training was laid along with the initiation of oil exploration, production and export in Kuwait. In the 1950s, the State began to establish training centres and organised programmes to prepare the manpower needed for the oil industry. After building the fundamental structure of the educational system, the Ministry of Education established a number of specialised institutions to meet the increasing demand for skilled manpower. The other ministries established their own training centres and institutes as well. The State found it essential to establish a central body to supervise and coordinate the activities of these numerous institutes.\n\nThe Technical and Vocational Education Department was established in 1972 to supervise technical and vocational education. The Central Training Department was established to supervise training centres and institute set up by to State Ministries.\n\nThe Technical and Vocational Education Department continued to function until 1982 when the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) was established as an autonomous body to supervise technical and vocational training and envision and implement an overall plan for the sector.\n\nThe goal of PAAET is to develop the national technical manpower and to meet human resource needs of the country through its two sectors: Education and Training.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Authority’s Training Coordination Department offers programs predicated on the requested needs of the various Kuwaiti ministries, state institutions and the private sector. These differ from the regular programs offered by the colleges and institutes of the Authority in that they are implemented in response to special requests only, and in almost all cases the students are already in the employed or guaranteed employment after graduation, by the government or private sector. \n\nThe objectives of this department are to prepare a well skilled cadre to meet the various and particular needs for manpower as requested by the public and/or the private sector.\n\nThe very nature of this department is such that the programs offered will depend almost entirely upon the requested needs of the government and private sectors. Listed below are some of the most often requested programs:-\n\nThe programs offered by this department are of varying duration, a matter of weeks or months, while others are of the usual two year institutional span. If they are of two year duration or longer the successful graduate will be granted the normal PAAET diploma, if less than the minimum required for a diploma, they will be granted a certificate of attendance and/or a certificate of participation.\n\nAs the participants in these programs are already guaranteed employed by the Kuwaiti government or the private sector, the question of employment does not arise. However successful completion of one of these programs almost inevitably leads to promotion.\n\n"}

On November 8, 2016 the successor, \"Transport Fever\", was released: it is based on the same engine and has new transport types and larger map sizes.\n\nThe game is heavily inspired from other transport simulation games, such as \"Transport Tycoon\", \"Railroad Tycoon\" and \"OpenTTD\"; and, to a lesser extent, \"Cities in Motion\".\n\nOn 22 June 2012, the \"Train Fever\" team announced that they would need to seek funding in order to be able to develop the final release of their game. It was decided to use a crowd-funding platform, although no name was given at that time. The first activities on \"Train Fever\"'s Gambitious page were observed on 26 August. The crowd-funding campaign started officially on 1 September 2012. The original funding target was €300 000, split by €20 shares, with an initial equity of 60% for private investors. The deadline was fixed for 1 March 2013, for a total duration of six months.\n\nOn 14 October 2012, \"Train Fever\" lead developer announced that everyone investing €40 (2 shares) or more in the project will receive a copy of the final version of the game. On 27 October, a new gameplay video was released and announced on both the Gambitious project page and the official website.\n\nThree months after the beginning of the campaign, on 12 December 2012, the campaign had reached 6.5% completion, with 70 investors and €20,000 invested. On 27 December 2012, \"Train Fever\" was accepted on Valve's Steam Greenlight, in the \"Concept\" section. Reception was very positive, allowing \"Train Fever\" to reach the first page of Steam Greenlight \"Top Rated All Time\" at beginning of February. At that time, the project was supported by 200 investors on Gambitious.\n\nOn 18 February 2013, eleven days before the campaign deadline, the \"Train Fever\" team announced that an institutional investor backed the project for a total of €50,000. As a consequence, several decisions were made:\n\nOn 25 February 2013, the \"Train Fever\" team announced that the game will be available at release on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. On 2 March 2013, €155,000 was invested, with €95,000 remaining to find, and 29 days to the deadline. Finally, on 20 March 2013, the crowd-funding campaign reached its target of €250,000, with 651 investors.\n\nAt the beginning of the crowdfunding campaign in September 2012, Train Fever was already in development at a prototype stage. The initial release date was set for May 2014, and pushed back to Q3 2014 at the end of February 2014.\n\nTrain Fever was originally developed by two people, Urban and Basil Weber, but the team grew to three developers with two additional artists.\n\nOn August 2013, an update explained the major gaming design decisions taken by the team:\n\n\nSince November 2013, several more updates added content, such as procedurally generated terrain, in addition to improved road and rail systems.\n\nOn 22 January 2014, another developer update explained more precisely the in-game freight simulation functions, welcoming feedback on the current implementation from the community. This update listed only six transportable goods out of the nine explained in the \"major design decisions\" update (stock, grain and steel were no longer listed as goods). Developers explained that this number will likely be increased through downloadable content and community-developed modifications.\n\nThe beta test was announced 30 June 2014, and planned between 14 and 24 July. The number of beta testers was limited, and the total number will be split equally between Gambitious supporters and newcomers. The test was done on Windows only, and a NDA signed by testers.\n\nTrain Fever is distributed online (on Steam and GOG.com). In German speaking countries, the game is also sold on physical media (published by Gambitious and Astragon Software GmbH).\n\nThe game is a single-player game designed for 20 hours of gameplay in which the story-time runs from 1850 until 2050.\n\nThe game takes place in an environment comparable with Europe and the cities are procedurally generated and evolve accordingly. The player builds transport infrastructure like railroads and stations and has to maintain this infrastructure. The player also buys vehicles and creates routes. They need to develop their transport company, eventually becoming a transport empire.\n\nThe in-game soundtrack, totaling over 70 minutes, is entirely composed by Admiral James T., a Swiss solo musician from Winterthur.\n\nOn 11 April 2016, Urban Games announced \"Transport Fever\" as a successor to \"Train Fever\", described as a \"next generation transport simulation game coming to PC on the 8 November 2016. Players build up a thriving transport company and create complex rail-road-water-air networks. In addition to the genre-typical endless game mode, two historical campaigns offer real world challenges from more than 150 years of transportation history\".

Scholarships are made solely based on financial need, and may be used for tuition at a trade school, college or graduate school.\n\nTuition Mission Foundation began as a Dollars for Scholars chapter. It was incorporated on November 28, 1962.\n\nThe chapter made its first tuition awards in 1963. These scholarships totaled $9,750 and were made to 20 needy college-bound students from the school districts of East Liverpool, Beaver Local, Chester-Newell (West Virginia) and Wellsville.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, the board of directors voted to disaffiliate from Dollars for Scholars and its parent organization, Scholarship America. This was in response to an early 2013 effort by Scholarship America to update standards and practices among all Dollars for Scholars chapters, which number about 1,000 nationwide. Specifically, Scholarship America had decided that it would no longer allow repayments by past recipients.\n\nThe Tri-State Area Citizens' Scholarship Foundation chapter of Dollars for Scholars had, from its inception, required that past recipients repay their tuition awards. About half of the monies granted each year come from repayments, so negating that source of funding was unsupported by the board. This fundamental philosophical difference became the impetus for the chapter to disaffiliate and take on the new name of Tuition Mission Foundation.\n\nTuition awards are funded by donations from area residents and former area residents; local businesses and clubs; investment income; and repayments from recipients who have graduated or discontinued their education.\n\nAll tuition awards are essentially interest-free loans. Applicants sign a pledge stating that upon graduating or discontinuing their education, they will repay their tuition award. Past recipients determine the pace at which they can comfortably make repayments, and generally do so on a monthly basis.\n\nFrom 1992 to present, Tuition Mission has put 100% of its income towards scholarships. The only exception to this rule is when a donor asks that his or her contribution be invested. In those cases, the investment income is put towards scholarships. All overhead and administrative costs associated with the foundation are donated by a few generous local supporters.\n\nSince 1963, the foundation has provided tuition awards to over 6,000 individual students, totaling over $6.7 million. For the 2018 - 2019 academic year, awards totaling over $284,950 were made. The top award was $6,000 per student, with the vast majority of recipients receiving this top amount.\n\nTuition Mission has a board of directors, representing the seven school districts served by the foundation. There are five officers: president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and alumni vice-president.\n\nStudents who reside within seven specific school districts in the tri-state area are eligible to apply. In eastern Ohio, these districts are Beaver Local, East Liverpool and Wellsville. In northern West Virginia, Tuition Mission serves the Oak Glen district (also known as the Hancock County district). In western Pennsylvania, districts served include Midland, South Side and Western Beaver.\n\nTuition Mission also serves students who attend a number of tri-state area non-traditional schools such as Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School and the Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School, both in Midland, Pennsylvania, Quaker Digital Academy (headquartered in New Philadelphia, Ohio) and Buckeye Online School for Success and East Liverpool Christian School, both in East Liverpool. If enrolled in any of these non-traditional schools, applicants must reside in any of the seven school districts served by the foundation.\n\n"}

{"id": "3299927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3299927", "title": "University of Graz Library", "text": "University of Graz Library\n\nThe University of Graz Library (), in Graz, Austria is the largest scientific and public library in Styria and the third largest in Austria. It holds the right of legal deposit. It is part of the University of Graz and consists of the main library, two faculty libraries (for law and social and economic sciences, and for theology) and several branch libraries and is open to the public.\n\nThe University of Graz Library owes its origin to the Counter-Reformation. Since 1571 the Jesuits had been pushing the re-catholization in the predominantly Protestant city of Graz according to the wishes of the Archduke Charles II of Austria. For that reason a Jesuit college with a school and a library were founded next to the cathedral in 1573. In 1585 this school was confirmed by Pope Gregory XIII as a Jesuit University, thus the library came into the status of a university library. It grew rapidly because many books got transferred from monasteries to Graz and because of donations and continuous purchases. The university was more or less a theological faculty, and the library's main focus in purchasing books was also theology – but not necessarily Catholic theology. Natural sciences were well represented due to the influence of the mathematician Paul Guldin, who was one of the university professors. When the Jesuit order was abolished in 1773 the university became a state university.\n\nIn 1775 the university was officially founded again by a decree and was put under national control together with its library. However, most of the imperial officials who administrated the university as well as the library were former Jesuits. In 1781 the library was re-opened after several adjustments of its new premises and became open for the public for the first time. Unfortunately, the 28 volume library catalogue was untraceable, it might have been taken away or destroyed by some glowering Jesuits and has never been detected until today. The considerable increase of books from monasteries aggravated the chaos.\n\nAs well as several other universities the University of Graz was downgraded to the status of lyceum in 1782 by the emperor Josef II. Its collections increased nonetheless.\n\nOn the 19. April 1827, after 45 years, the old rights were re-confirmed by the emperor Francis I of Austria. Since then the university mentions both founders in its name \"Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz\". Adjunctive to the re-installation was a requirement: the university must not cause any additional costs to the state. Therefore, it stayed dependent on donations and bequests. Only when the number of personnel was raised from 3 to 6 and the endowment from 830 to 4000 guilder in 1870, the university could again accomplish its tasks properly.\n\nDue to the limited space at the city centre, a new complex of buildings was erected in the periphery (present day Geidorf) in 1891. The various buildings were opened at different times. Between 9 and 22 September 1895 the library moved 135.000 volumes to the main building of the new university. Its further development in stock increase and administration suffered heavy setbacks in both world wars. 60.000 volumes were evacuated to save them from air raids in 1944. On 22 October 1945 the library was re-opened. 4.500 volumes (including 200 incunabula) had been destroyed during World War II.\n\nThe second half of the 20th century is predominantly characterized by constructional changes and progressive decentralisation. In 1950 both stacks situated edgeways behind the reading room got an annex in the south-east. 1970 a new building (of no architectural value whatsoever) was added-on to the old house with a new entrance and hall. From 1994 to 1996 the ReSoWi-Library which accommodates the Law and Social and Economic Sciences Libraries was built. At the same time another building was erected directly attached to the library's original front leaving it unaltered. This addition is exclusively used by the library. Additionally, there were several branch libraries opened in some distance to the main library, e. g. in the Universitätszentrum Wall situated in Merangasse 70. In 1996, a media library for visual media was installed. As a consequence of the university-splitting in 2004, the medical branches became an autonomous university library. Together with the University Libraries of Vienna and Innsbruck Graz has been assuming control of the establishment of national and international consortia installed in order to use electronic journals and books in cooperation and thus more cost-effectively in 1998. On 1 July 2005 the \"Cooperation of e-media in Austria\" was constituted. The University of Graz Library authoritatively participates in the Austrian Literature Online project, the digitisation of Austrian literature.\n\nWhen the library was taken over by the state, it got two employees: the director and a library servant. At the beginning of the 20th century the staff numbered 17, 8 of them being scientific civil servants. At the turn of the millennium the library staff had grown to 120.\n\nThe number of books in the old library is historically uncertain. According to one source there were 10.000 volumes in 1773, and according to another one 42.000 in 1776. Another similarly unreliable source counts 50.000 volumes or fewer for the year 1839. A survey in the year 1860 states 38.000 printed works, many of them had more than one volume. In 1879 the library owned about 100.000 volumes, in the first year of the 20th century 200.000. At the turn of the millennium, the actual stocks were almost 3 million printed books, more than 2000 manuscripts, about 1200 incunabula, bequests of many scholars and about 1400 current periodicals.\n\nThe Special Collections Department holds all manuscripts and works printed up to 1900. Some of the most notable parchment manuscripts are the five oldest Georgian scripts (7th to 11th century) found in the Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. Some of the most important paper manuscripts are Johannes Kepler's letters to Paul Guldin. 42 papyrus-manuscripts from Oxyrhynchos and Hibeh must also be mentioned. They were found by the British Egypt Exploration Society between 1896 and 1907 and entered into the library's possessions as quid pro quo for the city's financial support of the Society's excavations. Today, the greatest part of these findings is located in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the British Museum in London and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "579740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=579740", "title": "University of Salamanca", "text": "University of Salamanca\n\nThe University of Salamanca () is a Spanish higher education institution, located in the city of Salamanca, west of Madrid, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It was founded in 1134 and given the Royal charter of foundation by King Alfonso IX in 1218. It is the oldest university in the Hispanic world and the third oldest university in the entire world still in operation. The formal title of \"University\" was granted by King Alfonso X in 1254 and recognized by Pope Alexander IV in 1255.\n\nIts origin, like all older universities, was a Cathedral School, whose existence can be traced back to 1130. The university was founded in 1134 and recognized as a \"General School of the Kingdom\" by the Leonese King Alfonso IX in 1218. Granted Royal Chart by King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, as the University of Salamanca this established the rules for organization and financial endowment.\n\nOn the basis of a papal bull by Alexander IV in 1255, which confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X, the school obtained the title of University.\n\nThe historical phrases \"Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat\" (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and \"Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet\" (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.\n\nIn the reign of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish government was revamped. Contemporary with the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims, and the conquest of Granada, there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state. This involved the massive employment of \"letrados\", i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were \"licenciados\" (university graduates), particularly, of Salamanca, and the newly founded University of Alcalá. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the Consejo de Indias and Casa de Contratacion, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the Spanish Empire in the New World.\n\nWhile Columbus was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca. In the next century, the morality of colonization in the Indies was debated by the School of Salamanca, along with questions of economics, philosophy and theology.\n\nBy the end of the Spanish Golden Age (c. 1550–1715), the quality of academics in Spanish universities declined. The frequency of the awarding of degrees dropped, the range of studies shrank, and there was a sharp decline in the number of its students. The centuries-old European wide prestige of Salamanca declined.\n\nLike Oxford and Cambridge, Salamanca had a number of colleges (\"Colegios Mayores\"). These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the University. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. Today some have been turned into faculty buildings while others survive as halls of residence.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.\n\nThe faculty of this university discussed the feasibility of Christopher Columbus's project and the effects his claims brought. Once America was discovered, they discussed the rights of indigenous people as being recognized with full plenitude, which was revolutionary for that period, economic processes were analyzed for the first time and they developed the science of law as it became a classical scholarly focus. It was the period when some of the brightest minds attended the university and it was known as the School of Salamanca. The school's members renovated theology, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration were nourished. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Lucía de Medrano, the latter being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.\n\nSalamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions. It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.\n\nToday the University of Salamanca is an important center for the study of humanities and is particularly noted for its language studies, as well as in laws and economics. Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre], Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León], Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre].\n\nIn conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.\n\nIn 2018, the institution will celebrate its eighth centennial, for which preparations are currently being made.\n\nThe library holds about 906,000 volumes.\n\n\n\nOther notable students and academic teachers include:\n\n\n\n"}

She was a backing vocalist for American and British rock and pop acts of the 1960s and 1970s including Ike & Tina Turner, Pink Floyd, Barbra Streisand, Elkie Brooks, Neil Diamond, Steely Dan, and the Rolling Stones. Having emigrated to Australia in 1982 she took dual Australian-American citizenship. She recorded or toured as a backing singer for Australian artists, Richard Clapton, Australian Crawl, Cold Chisel, Jimmy Barnes, James Morrison and John Farnham.\n\nFields was born in Buffalo, New York in 1941, into a religious family. Her early musical training was from regular gospel performances at church. Her inspiration was Aretha Franklin. Fields singing career began with the Templaires, a group she formed with members of her church, followed by the Corinthian Gospel Singers. In late 1961 Ike and Tina Turner Revue were playing in Buffalo; Fields successfully auditioned as a new member of Tina's backing vocalists, the Ikettes. Fields joined the revue in addition to backing Tina in performance and on recordings.\n\nShe is recorded on singles by the Ikettes, including \"Peaches 'N' Cream\" (1965), and was given some solo songs on live recordings, such as \"You're My Baby\" (1963), \"The Love of My Man\" (November 1964), \"I Know (You Don't Love Me no More)\" (February 1965) and \"Good Time Tonight\" (February 1965). Ruby Jane a Canadian DJ described \"Peaches 'N' Cream\" on \"WeFunk Radio\" as \"a boisterous romp of a '60s R&B tune about the joys and perils of young love... It could be called schoolyard soul, with girls in pigtails chanting it as they play Double Dutch. The harmonica playfully echoes the line peaches and cream, and the throaty ah, ah, ah at the top of the chorus is delivered with a raucous enthusiasm that shouts at you to get on the dance floor. This is one of those girl-group anthems that’s fun and rowdy and fills you with sweet, sweet joy.\"\n\nIke Turner moved his base to Los Angeles and, in 1966, Fields left the revue, along with fellow Ikettes: Jessie Smith and Robbie Montgomery. Fields later recalled \"I was an Ikette for five years. It was a rough job, but it was a very good experience. It's just like a school. You go from grade 1 to 2, not from 1 to 8. And when you graduate you have to leave. There is such a thing as staying too long; when you start getting stagnant and stifled by what you're doing. We almost stayed too long.\" The trio signed to Mirwood Records and they became the Mirettes from 1966 to 1970. They issued some singles, \"In the Midnight Hour\" and \"Take for a Little a While\", which \"made impressions.\"\n\nFields worked as a session vocalist from about 1969, often with Clydie King and Sherlie Matthews, for Quincy Jones, Paul Butterfield, Tim Buckley, Steely Dan, Joe Walsh, Joe Cocker, Elkie Brooks, Neil Diamond, Leonard Cohen, Bob Seger, Burt Bacharach and Burton Cummings. Others: Diana Ross, Bette Midler, Bob Dylan, the Supremes, and for Aretha Franklin – her mentor and inspiration. Notable performances during this time included \"Wish You Were Here\" (September 1975) with Pink Floyd, and recording the Rolling Stones' album \"Exile on Main St.\" (May 1972). Fields later reflected on her sessions for the latter album, they were at midnight but she wanted money for clothing, \"I was more interested in the coat than I was in the Rolling Stones\". With King, she sang on four tracks, \"Tumbling Dice\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\", \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\", which she felt \"were wonderful songs and they were just right for us... We knew gospel. That's what most people wanted from us, a gospel sound.\"\n\nIn about 1971, Fields, King, and Matthews formed the Blackberries, with Matthews as producer and songwriter as well as vocalist. When backing Ray Charles, the trio worked as the Raelettes. In 1972 Steve Marriott asked them to record and tour with his band, Humble Pie, and produced an unreleased Blackberries LP with Humble Pie as the backing band – they parted company in 1973. Michael Little of \"Vinyl District\" reviewed \"Eat It\" (April 1973), which showed Humble Pie \"at its most eclectic. Each of its four sides emphasized a different aspect of the band, and the concept works.\" He described the track, \"Get Down to It\", which \"makes maximum use of the band’s backing singers\" including \"the immortal\" Fields. Fields and King acted as Barbra Streisand's backing singers (The Oreos) in the 1976 musical film, \"A Star Is Born\" (December 1976), and sang on its associated film soundtrack (November 1976). Fields had previously sung on two of Streisand's albums from 1971.\n\nAs a member of Boz Scaggs backing band, Fields toured Australia in 1978 and 1980. While in the country in the latter year she contributed backing vocals to Marc Hunter's (ex-Dragon) solo album, \"Big City Talk\". Back in the US she provided backing vocals for \"So Lucky\" (December 1981), by Renée Geyer – the Australian artist was then working in California. Fields decided to relocate permanently to Australia in 1982, \"I had all that experience and a good reputation but I felt like I was stuck in a stereotyped box... I needed to do something else and I had to get away to somewhere where I could start again.\"\n\nFields continued to work with US artists when they toured her adopted country until 2000, including George Benson, Dionne Warwick, Streisand, Thelma Houston, and Randy Crawford. She also recorded or toured as a backing singer with Australian artists, Richard Clapton (1983–84), Jimmy Barnes, Australian Crawl, Cold Chisel, James Morrison, Mark Gillespie (Australian singer), and as a long-term touring and session harmony vocalist for John Farnham (1986–95). Neil Lade of \"The Canberra Times\" reviewed Clapton's album, \"Solidarity\" (September 1984), and described its final track, \"New World\", as \"It's a song that's slow and softly lulling. A song of peace and hope... and Clapton's voice is at its tuneful best. And the backing vocals of Vanetta Fields add a powerful and echoing dimension to what may be just the album's finest song.\"\n\nIn the mid-1980s in Melbourne, Fields formed a new group, Venetta's Taxi, with a line-up including vocalist Sherlie Matthews, guitarist Michael den Elzen, and Chong Lim on keyboards, while also performing regularly as a backing vocalist for local and touring artists. During this period Fields coached singing, including Karen Knowles and Colette Mann, at Tony Bartuccio's Dance Academy in Prahran. She took vocal workshops at the Victorian College of the Arts.\n\nFields and Farnham were both guest vocalists with The Incredible Penguins in late 1985, for a cover of \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", a charity project for research on little penguins, which peaked at No. 10 on the Australian Kent Music Report in December. Fields starting work for Farnham on his Jack's Back Tour in support of his album, \"Whispering Jack\" (October 1986). Debbie Kruger of \"Variety\" magazine caught the show at the State Theater in March 1987, \"Midway through the show, Farnham left the stage, and backing Singer Venetta Fields sang three songs which kept the audience warm but eager for more of their hero.\"\nIn January 1989 Fields made her musical theater debut as Alice in the Australian production of \"Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney. She followed with other stage appearances including two plays for the Melbourne Theatre Company – \"Racing Demon\" (April 1991) and \"The Crucible\" (May 1991) – \"Blues in the Night\" (August, October 1992), \"Chess\" (concert version), and as Ruby in the Buddy Holly show \"Buddy the Musical\". In 1986 she formed and toured her own show, \"Gospel Jubilee\"; the line-up of the band of the same name was Joanne Campbell, Joe Creighton, Chong Lim, Sherlie Mathews and Fellon Williams.\n\nSince 2000, she has lived on the Gold Coast, and has no longer toured or recorded with visiting artists. In 2002 she received the Australian Gospel Singer of the Year award, and three years later released her album, \"At Last\" (2005). Fields is active as a vocal coach, with several students including 2005 \"Australian Idol\" winner Kate DeAraugo, singer-songwriter Cody Simpson, and 2011 \"Australia's Got Talent\", finalist Bree De Rome.\nIn recognition of her achievements, Fields was inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame on September 29, 2005.\n\n\nCredits at AllMusic\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24060903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24060903", "title": "Victoria II", "text": "Victoria II\n\nVictoria II is a grand strategy game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive. It was announced on August 19, 2009, and released on August 13, 2010.\n\nVirtual Programming published the Mac OS X version of the game on September 17, 2010. The game was localized for Russia by 1C Company and Snowball Studios.\n\nLike its , \"Victoria II\" allows for the player to take control of and manage a 19th-century state, including its political, diplomatic, economic, military, and technological aspects. The game has many historical aspects to it, such as the ability to colonize places that, at the time, were not under the control of any European power, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, and North-Western Canada. The time frame of the game is 1836-1936.\n\n \"Victoria II\" spans the globe from 1836 to the start of 1936 with over 200 playable nations. Like its predecessor, \"Victoria II\" focuses on internal management, covering the industrialization and social/political changes in a country with 8 different government types. The game gives a lot of importance to the economy of a country by having a complex market system with over 50 types of goods and factories. While warfare is a component of the game it is not the primary focus as in other Paradox Interactive games such as the Hearts of Iron series.\n\nNations' populations are divided into cultures, religions, and occupations. There are several different population groups or \"pops\" including aristocrats, officers, clergy, capitalists, clerks, craftsmen, soldiers, laborers, and farmers. \"Victoria II\" introduces two new groups, artisans and bureaucrats. As in other Paradox titles, like Europa Universalis, historical missions called \"decisions\" that are micro-objectives in the larger game have been added. There are thousands of historical events and decisions as well. These events and nationalist forces can lead to the creation or disintegration of nation states.\n\n\"Victoria II\" contains a number of changes and improvements from its predecessor. The interface was streamlined when compared to the original game, which was described by producer Johan Andersson as, \"the interface God forgot\". Automation of various tasks has been added, including trade and population promotion. The education system has received an overhaul by having clergy educate people of the same religion, and each population group now has their own literacy levels. Education and literacy's importance is reflected in the vast technology system that contains thousands of inventions. Additionally, the functioning of ideology in the game was tweaked such that population groups are more sensitive to changes in their country's situation, as well as inclined to agitate for specific levels of political and social reforms.\n\nThe economic system in \"Victoria II\" attempts to simulate the flow of resources in a world market. Every province in the game produces a resource in resource gathering operations (RGOs). Some resources, such as wheat, are demanded principally by the population. Other materials, like iron, are consumed primarily by industry, but are still tradeable.\n\nThe production and unemployment system from the original Victoria has been revised to better reflect market forces, whereas in the original the state provided the funds for resources and the player possessed a wide range of options with which to build their economy, provided they had access to the proper raw materials. All resources can be collected or produced by industry. The game also has a cottage production system simulating pre-industrial economies.\n\n\"Victoria II\" contains a deep political simulation reflected in 8 different types of governments, 7 ideologies and a new sphere of influence system, gunboat diplomacy, and a new election system with coalition governments and legislatures.\n\nThe diplomacy in \"Victoria II\" is similar to that of other Paradox titles. Each country has a relation value of –200 to +200 which represents how much they like each other. Diplomatic and in game actions shift this relationship around and it factors into the AI's decisions. However, Paradox Interactive has expanded parts of this system. War goals from Heir to the Throne, an expansion for Europa Universalis III have been integrated though they function in a slightly different way. More war goals can be added as the war progresses, although this does affect the population's temperament. Failure to achieve a war goal will increase the population's militancy, which can lead to revolts.\n\nIn the game controlling a Great Power, one of the eight countries with highest total score, gives special diplomatic options not available to other countries. Great Powers do not just influence how a country sees them; they have the added ability to use their influence on other countries to change their perception of other Great Powers. The struggle for influence that the Great Powers wage around the world is not a simple bilateral basis but occurs with each other inside different countries, giving an added dimension to diplomacy which was not present in the original Victoria.\n\nWarfare is regarded as a lesser priority than politics and economics in \"Victoria II\", though it follows the basic pattern used in other Paradox grand strategy games, with armies moving between provinces and engaging enemy armies and capturing enemy territory. The basic combat system is a combination of the systems used in Europa Universalis III, , and Hearts of Iron III. A key component to combat is \"frontage\": the number of units in an army at the front line, which decreases as technology improves to simulate the change from the roving armies of the Napoleonic Era to the continuous trench lines of World War I.\n\nSeveral aspects of the military have been changed from \"Victoria\". The base unit has been reduced from a 10,000-unit division to a 3,000-unit brigade, which is no longer raised from a national manpower pool but directly raised from a provincial soldier POP, to which the brigade remains connected. A new aspect to the military is reconnaissance. This is a value that gives a bonus (or penalty, if low) to capturing provinces and defeating enemy armies; in prolonged combat, however, the reconnaissance value drops. Units such as cavalry and aeroplanes have high reconnaissance values and are intended to be used as scouts.\n\nThe decision to create \"Victoria II\" was influenced by voting on the Paradox Interactive forums and debate within the company. The CEO of Paradox Interactive, Fredrik Wester, publicly announced his belief that the game would never see a profit while other members of the company such as Johan Andersson were confident it would be profitable. To this end Wester promised that if the game did indeed make a profit he would shave his head and post the pictures onto the forum. This belief stemmed from lackluster sales numbers. It was revealed in a German interview with Fredrik that 70,000 copies would need to be sold in order for Victoria II to be profitable. On June 17, 2010, Jessica Chobot from IGN shaved it off for him.\n\n\"Victoria II\" has received two main expansion packs, as well as numerous other smaller additions. It was released before Paradox's current DLC plan was used, so differs from games such as \"Europa Universalis IV\" and \"Crusader Kings II\" in regards to this.\n\nMany players consider the expansions to be essential to gaining full enjoyment from the game, going as far as to dismiss \"Victoria II\" without expansions as unplayable; having added not only new content and mechanics, but also significant user experience improvements like the ability to queue unit production, move/select units, and transport these over water (a common complaint addressed in early releases of Paradox titles such as CK2 and EU4 which Paradox has subsequently patched).\n\n\"A House Divided\" was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 as an expansion pack with an aim on \"[improving the] political and economical aspects of the game, with focus on the American Civil War era\". It was released on February 2, 2012 for Windows and on March 30, 2012 for OS X; it is currently only available for purchase by download. It includes the following features:\n\nThe \"Victoria II: Heart of Darkness\" expansion was released on April 16, 2013. It includes the following features:\n\n\nA selection of smaller DLC has been made available for purchase for \"Victoria II\". These have little to no effect on gameplay but alter the game's appearance or music, and are significantly less expensive than their larger counterparts.\n\nSpecial pre-order content: \n\n\nVictoria II received generally favourable reviews, achieving a 75% average on Metacritic.\n\nGameSpot said that there was much less micromanagement than in its predecessor. The reviewer stated: \"Thanks to a friendlier interface and tutorials, Victoria II is a lot more playable and enjoyable than its predecessor.\"\n\nGameShark was less enthusiastic. The reviewer said: \"As a strategy game, Victoria II frustrates me. It is an orgy of detail for detail's sake, yet the information I really want never seems to be at hand. The decisions I make seem mostly inconsequential, changing the game only by a slow process of accretion. Modeling has overtaken game design. Watching Victoria II is hypnotic and frequently awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, you only occasionally might want to play it.\"\n\nThe release of A House Divided drew increased praise and averaged 76% on Metacritic, and Heart of Darkness further increased positive reviews, averaging 81%. Gaming Nexus gave the final product a verdict of 8.5 (\"very good\") and commented that \"after some patching and a couple of expansions, Victoria 2 is rounding into shape. It is still deep with a killer learning curve, but it is starting to feel like a fun game rather than a buggy spreadsheet.\"\n\nIn an Ask Me Anything thread on reddit in October 2013, PDS manager Johan Andersson stated that they would consider making a sequel to \"Victoria II\", but that this would likely come after \"Hearts of Iron IV\".\n\nIn December 2015, a beta patch was made for \"Victoria II\", long after it was assumed that no further patches would be released. This prompted speculation that there could be refreshed interest in the \"Victoria\" series, although in a Reddit thread these rumours were played down by Paradox developers.\n\nDuring an interview for the company’s Paradox Podcast on February 2018, CEO Fredrik Wester mentioned \"I'm not a firm believer that Victoria II is the most prioritised game to make a sequel out of\", that he won't be the one making the decision either and that it would come \"before 2025\".\n\n\n"}

The success of the Outward Bound outdoor education program in the 1940s inspired the approach taken by many current-day wilderness therapy programs, though some adopted a survivalist methodology. Clients typically range in age from 10–17 for adolescents, and 18–28 for adults.\n\nThe New York Asylum and the San Francisco Agnew Asylum played an early role in the development of wilderness therapy, drawing upon the philosophies of Kurt Hahn. Although the therapy is often used for behavior modification by the families of young people, the aims and methods of wilderness therapy do not center on behavior modification.\n\nThe pioneers in the field of wilderness therapy include Larry D. Olsen and Ezekiel C. Sanchez at Brigham Young University; Nelson Chase, Steven Bacon, and others at the Colorado Outward Bound School; Rocky Kimball at Santa Fe Mountain Center and others. Madolyn M. Liebing, Ph.D. (of Aspen Achievement then, and currently of Journey Wilderness) was the first clinical psychologist to integrate clinical therapy with wilderness programming.\n\nGiven the proliferation of such programs, lax regulation, and absence of research setting uniform standards of care across programs, advocates have called on increased accountability to ensure programs are capable of providing care that is consistent with their marketing claims.\n\nSome programs which advertise as \"wilderness therapy\" are actually boot camps in a wilderness environment. These can sometimes be distinguished from other wilderness therapy by such programs promising behavior modification for troubled teens, but it is hard to tell just from the ads.\n\nOne of the major differences between boot camps and wilderness therapy is the underlying philosophical assumptions (wilderness therapy being driven by the philosophy of experiential education and theories of psychology and boot camps being informed by a military model). Additionally, most wilderness therapy programs have highly trained clinical staff either on the expedition or in active and ongoing consultation with the team. Boot camps may have no clinically trained staff working in the programs. Some staff members are from a correctional or military background. Nevertheless, incidents of alleged and confirmed abuse and death of youth, have been widely reported across many wilderness programs claiming to provide a less coercive environment than that of boot camps.\n\nThe industry reports that, as with any type of treatment program, abusive situations have been reported and accidental deaths have taken place in some of these programs, but that compared with similar outdoor adventure activities deaths are extremely rare. These assertions cannot be independently verified due to inadequate regulation, poor monitoring, and a pattern of unreported deaths and state failure to prosecute offenders.\n\nThere is also controversy over whether parents should be allowed to make their child attend a wilderness therapy program by force, as is often the case. Apart from the thousands spent on the actual program (around $500/day), some parents pay a teen escort company thousands to ensure their child gets to the program by any means necessary, without the child's consent or foreknowledge. Generally the \"transfer\" occurs at night, when children are disoriented. Due to the trauma and alleged harm reported by former wilderness program residents who have been forcibly escorted into placement, psychologists have heavily criticized this approach as inappropriate, and grossly inconsistent with establishing the necessary trust required for building a therapeutic relationship between youth and providers.\n\nOctober 2007 and April 2008, the United States Government Accountability Office convened hearings to address report of widespread and systemic abuse. In relationship with the hearing, they have issued a report about the wilderness therapy industry. The Federal Trade Commission has published a list of questions for parents to ask when considering a wilderness program.\n\nPrograms seeking additional accreditation and certification often pursue partnerships and memberships with associations such as; \n\nIndependent researchers have called into questions industry claims, criticizing the industry's use of 'bad science' due to methodological flaws in the research and ethical concerns.\n\nAfter a wilderness therapy program, students may return home or may be transferred to a therapeutic boarding school, young adult program or an intensive residential treatment center. Some estimate that 40% of children enrolled in wilderness programs are later sent to long-term residential behavioral care facilities.\n\n\n"}
