These behaviors are divided into a number of development stages based upon the child's age.\n\nLack of exposure to age appropriate activities and experiences is commonly thought to prevent a child from gaining the skills necessary for their current and thus their next stage of development.\n\nIn the United States, age determination guidelines for toys and games are suggested by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and consider child development (for children under 12 years of age) and toy characteristics. When considering child development, the CPSC looks at the physical development, cognitive development, emotional development and social development of children. The CPSC guidelines are then separated into four categories which include: play categories, toy subcategories, age groups, and toy characteristics.\n\nContent ratings often indicate at which age that content is considered by the rating body to be age-appropriate. For example, in the United States, TV-14 indicates that the television program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years old; it is the equivalent to PG-13 for motion pictures.\n\n"}

{"id": "3029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3029", "title": "Arthur Jensen", "text": "Arthur Jensen\n\nArthur Robert Jensen (August 24, 1923 – October 22, 2012) was an American psychologist and author. He was a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen was known for his work in psychometrics and differential psychology, the study of how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.\n\nHe was a major proponent of the hereditarian position in the nature and nurture debate, the position that genetics play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as intelligence and personality. He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals and sat on the editorial boards of the scientific journals \"Intelligence\" and \"Personality and Individual Differences\".\n\nHe was rated as one of the 50 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. He was also a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of race-based differences in intelligence.\n\nJensen was born August 24, 1923, in San Diego, California, the son of Linda Mary (née Schachtmayer) and Arthur Alfred Jensen, who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company. His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half Polish Jewish and half German descent. He studied at University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1945), San Diego State College (M.A., 1952) and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with Percival Symonds on the Thematic Apperception Test. From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the University of London, Institute of Psychiatry with Hans Eysenck.\n\nUpon returning to the United States, he became a researcher and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of culture, development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received tenure at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first sabbatical in 1964. He concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.\n\nJensen had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a conductor himself. At 14, he conducted a band that won a nationwide contest held in San Francisco. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a seminar given by Nikolai Sokoloff. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to New York, mainly to be near the conductor Arturo Toscanini. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of Gandhi, producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in San Diego he spent time working as a social worker with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.\n\nJensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. \"Level I\", or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. \"Level II\", or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.\n\nLater, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the general factor of intelligence, a concept which was essentially synonymous with his \"Level II\" conceptual learning. The general factor, or \"g\", is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.\n\nJensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.\n\nJensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the \"Harvard Educational Review\", was titled \"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?\" It concluded, among other things, that Head Start programs designed to boost African-American IQ scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.\n\nThe work became one of the most cited papers in the history of psychological testing and intelligence research, although a large number of citations consisted of rebuttals of Jensen's work, or references to it as an example of a controversial paper.\n\nAfter the paper was released, large protests were held, demanding that Jensen be fired. Jensen's car tires were slashed, the university police provided him with plain-clothes bodyguards, and he and his family received threats that were considered so realistic by the police that they temporarily left their house. Jensen was spat on and was prevented from delivering lectures by disruptive protests. The editorial board of the \"Harvard Educational Review\" for a time refused to let him have reprints of his article, and said that they had not solicited the section on racial differences; Jensen later provided correspondence in which the board had requested he do so.\nIn a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:\n...nowhere have I \"claimed\" an \"innate deficiency\" of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: \"The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question.\" (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).\nAlthough a critic of Jensen's thesis, economist Thomas Sowell, criticizing the taboo against research on race and intelligence, wrote:\nProfessor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because \"I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate.\" What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had.\n\nHowever, Jensen's 1998 \"\" gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in \"g\": Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:\n\nThe relationship of the g factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., Spearman's hypothesis) suggests that the average white-black difference in \"g\" has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly \"g\".\nIn 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence, \" an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the \"Wall Street Journal\", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book \"The Bell Curve\". Jensen received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund,\nan organization frequently described as racist and white supremacist in nature.\nThe fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter \"that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others\" with Jensen's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.\n\nIn 2005, Jensen's article, co-written with J. Philippe Rushton, named \"Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability\", was published in the APA journal \"Psychology, Public Policy and Law\". Jensen and Rushton present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.\n\nHe died on October 22, 2012 at his home in Kelseyville, California at age 89.\n\nMelvin Konner of Emory University, wrote:\n\nStatements made by Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions. Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.\nPaul E. Meehl of the University of Minnesota, after being honored by the APA, wrote that Jensen's \"contributions, in both quality and quantity, certainly excelled mine\" and that he was \"embarrassed\" and \"distress[ed]\" that APA refused to honor Jensen out of ideology.\n\nAccording to David Lubinski of Vanderbilt University, the \"extent to which [Jensen's] work was either admired or reviled by many distinguished scientists is unparalleled.\"\n\nSandra Scarr of Yale University wrote that Jensen possessed an \"uncompromising personal integrity\" and set the standard for \"honest psychological science\". She contrasted him and his work favorably to some of his critics, who she called \"politically driven liars, who distort scientific facts in a misguided and condescending effort to protect an impossible myth about human equality\".\n\nLisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of New York University wrote that Jensen had largely ignored evidence which failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent genetic racial differences.\n\nAfter Jensen's death, James Flynn of the University of Otago, a prominent advocate of the environmental position, told \"The New York Times\" that Jensen was without racial bias and had not initially foreseen that his research would be used to argue for racial supremacy and that his career was \"emblematic of the extent to which American scholarship is inhibited by political orthodoxy\", though he noted that Jensen shifted towards genetic explanations later in life.\n\nFrancis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, considered that there was \"much substance to Jensen's arguments\" and that it was \"likely that more than half the difference between the average I.Q. of American whites and Negroes is due to genetic reasons, and will not be eliminated by any foreseeable change in the environment.\"\n\nPaleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould criticized Jensen's work in his 1981 book \"The Mismeasure of Man\". Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of \"heritability\", which is defined as a measure of the variation of a trait due to inheritance \"within\" a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences \"between\" populations. Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, \"g\", or \"the general factor common to a large number of cognitive abilities\" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.\n\nThis is a claim most closely identified with Charles Spearman. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of L. L. Thurstone to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's factor analysis of intelligence revealed \"g\" to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of Catharine Cox's 1926 \"Genetic Studies of Genius\", which examines historiometrically the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153-154).\n\nIn 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled \"Bias in Mental Testing\". Reviewing this book, psychologist Kenneth Kaye endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination, saying that he found many of Jensen's opponents to be more politically-biased than Jensen was.\n\nIn Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled \"The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons\", Jensen begins his paper with this observation:\nStephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, \"Biology as a Social Weapon.\" Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist Edward O. Wilson, a leader in the development of sociobiology...\nWhile Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach:\nThis charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth. In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.\nJensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions:\nIn his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.\nJensen expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner, James R. Flynn:\nNow and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, \"Race, IQ and Jensen\" (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.\n\n\"Bias in Mental Testing\" (1980) is a book examining the question of test bias in commonly used standardized tests. The book runs almost 800 pages and has been called \"exhaustive\" by three researchers who reviewed the field 19 years after the book's publication. It reviewed in detail the available evidence about test bias across major US racial/ethnic groups. Jensen concluded that \"the currently most widely used standardized tests of mental ability -- IQ, scholastic aptitude, and achievement tests -- are, by and large, not biased against any of the native-born English-speaking minority groups on which the amount of research evidence is sufficient for an objective determination of bias, if the tests were in fact biased. For most nonverbal standardized tests, this generalization is not limited to English-speaking minorities.\" (p. ix). Jensen also published a summary of the book the same year which was a target article in the journal \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" to which 27 commentaries were printed along with the author's reply.\n\n\"\" (1998) is a book on the general intelligence factor (\"g\"). The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.\n\n\"Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences\" (2006) deals with mental chronometry (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information. Whereas IQ merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties, Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.\n\nIn 2003, Jensen was awarded the Kistler Prize for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human genome and human society. In 2006, the International Society for Intelligence Research awarded Jensen its Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been held at EPFL since 1981. Each year on a Friday night the school welcomes 15'000 people (since 2003) and 30 live concerts. In 2011, the Balelec Festival is held its 31st edition, while in 2012, the Balelec Festival is held its 32nd edition. Concerns about excessive consumption of alcohol at the festival are denied by the organizers.\n\nIn 2015 and again in 2016, the festival once again attracted a sold out crowd of about 15,000 spectators. The budget for the 2016 festival was 650,000 swiss francs.\n\nThe Balelec Festival is a student association listed as a non-profit organization. A part of the funds to mount the festival comes from sponsorships and the other part comes from the tickets sold for the event. The student association has an overall budget of 800'000 CHF . All the money earned during the event is used to fund the next edition.\n\nThe association is composed of a main committee of 50 volunteers, mostly EPFL and UNIL students, who are divided into four teams: Animation, Logistics, Promotion and Internal Resources. In addition, more than 300 volunteers and professional staff help with the setup on campus during the week preceding the event. On site, there are seven musical indoor and outdoor stages and about 30 live concerts, depending of the year.\n\nThe main live stages of the festival are outdoors. These 2 stages are called the Grande Scene (the main stage) and the Scene Azimuts. The main stage has an eclectic musical line-up while the other one is more rock/metal oriented. In 2012, the volume on these outdoor stages led to complaints from neighbouring residents, leading to a reduction in the volume of the bass frequencies in 2013.\n\nIndoor, the festival owns 4 scenes. The Satellite Scene is a live stage put in place with the collaboration of another EPFL student association called Satellite. Its line-up is oriented toward chanson française and balkan music. The festival has also two electronic music stages called the Coupole and the SoundGate, the last one taking place in the Faculty of Architecture's hall.

His own schooldays were deeply unpleasant to him and would affect his teaching methods and desire for reform. In 1915 he was recruited into the French army and was wounded in the lung, an experience that led him to becoming a resolute pacifist.\n\nIn 1920 he became an elementary schoolteacher in the village of Le Bar-sur-Loup. It was here that Freinet began to develop his teaching methods. He married Élise Lagier in 1926.\n\nIn 1923 Freinet purchased a printing press, originally to assist with his teaching, since his lung injury made it difficult for him to talk for long periods. It was with this press he printed free texts and class newspapers for his students. The children would compose their own works on the press and would discuss and edit them as a group before presenting them as a team effort. They would regularly leave the classroom to conduct field trips. The newspapers were exchanged with those from other schools. Gradually the group texts replaced conventional school books.\n\nFreinet created the teachers' trade union C.E.L. (Coopérative de l'Enseignement Laïc) in 1924, from which arose the French teacher movement \"Modern School Movement\" (). The goal of the C.E.L was to change public education from the inside with the co-operation of teachers.\n\nFreinet's teaching methods were at variance with official policy of the National Education Board, and he resigned from it in 1935 to start his own school in Vence.\n\n\nIn 1964, Freinet drafted the \"pedagogical constants\". Freinet laid out these constants to enable teachers to evaluate their class practices in relation to his basic values and thus appreciate the path that remains to be followed. \"It is a new range of academic values that we would like to work here to establish, with no bias other than our preoccupation for the search for truth, in the light of experience and common sense. On the basis of these principles, which we shall regard as invariable and therefore unassailable and sure, we would like to achieve a kind of pedagogical code ... \"The Pedagogical Code has several colored lights to help educators judge their psychological and pedagogical situation as teachers:\n\nThe constants cited below are only a part, a sort of summary of the pedagogical work of Celestin Freinet.\n\nFreinet's work lives on in the name of \"Pédagogie Freinet\", or the Freinet Modern School Movement, practised in many countries worldwide.\n\nThe Freinet classification (\"To organise everything\") is used in the libraries of some elementary schools, and was invented by Célestin Freinet to facilitate the easy finding of documents, and the use of the \"Bibliothèque de travail\".\n\nThe Institut universitaire de formation des maîtres (teacher training university) of Nice bears the name of Célestin Freinet.\n\nThe \"Modern School Movement\" or , based on the practices of the Freinets, has become an international network of educators and schools. In 1957, the International Federation of Modern School Movements (FIMEM) was founded to organize national groups around the world. They hold an international congress every two years to coordinate work and exchange ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Edmodo network enables teachers to share content, distribute quizzes, assignments, and manage communication with students, colleagues, and parents. Edmodo is very teacher-centric in their design and philosophy: students and parents can only join Edmodo if invited to do so by a teacher. Teachers and students spend large amounts of time on the platform, both in and out of the classroom.\n\nEdmodo was founded by Nic Borg, Jeff O'Hara, and Crystal Hutter in 2008. It is backed by Index Ventures, Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Learn Capital, New Enterprise Associates, Union Square Ventures, Glynn Capital Management, Tenaya Capital, SingTel Innov8, and KDDI. As of July 2017 Edmodo claimed to have over 78M users worldwide.\nAbout half of these users were in the US, with the rest being in 180 countries around the world. Significant concentrations exist in Singapore, Indonesia, Uruguay and Italy. About 10% of these users were teachers, an illustration of how popular Edmodo is in classrooms.\n\nIn 2013, Edmodo was included in the list of \"The Top Apps for Teachers\" by \"PC Magazine\".

The company has partnered with two major publishers in United Kingdom, Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press to provide access to educational content on the Edmodo Platform and bring Edmodo Snapshot to the UK.\n\nIn March 2015, Noodle named Edmodo as one of “The 32 Most Innovative Online Educational Tools\". In January 2017, Edmodo launched professional development (PD) courses for teachers in the state of New York in conjunction with NYPTI. These included both a synchronous video classroom component as well as an asynchronous, text based discussion component and have been used by thousands of teachers. In June 2017, Frost and Sullivan announced that Edmodo had won the Customer Value Leadership Award.\n\nOn May 17, 2017, Edmodo sent an email informing users that it was the victim of a major hack of user information.

Since passwords were both hashed and salted (encrypted) using the bcrypt algorithm the effort to decrypt all the passwords would have been very large. There were no reports of any school data being affected, nor any identities compromised, according to an external audit commissioned by the company.\n\nIn June 2017, Edmodo announced Ask Mo, an educational video search engine, as an illustration of the benefits of machine learning on educational data sets: the search is based on videos that had been shared by teachers in the context of educational discussions and can be filtered by subject and grade level.\n\nOn April 8, 2018, Edmodo announced that it was being acquired by NetDragon for $137.5M in cash and stock.\n\n"}

Following four years of primary and five years of lower secondary school, the system offers two years of upper secondary school, specialized secondary school, or vocational/technical school.\n\nThe Ministry of Education and Science (MES) is in charge of education in Kyrgyzstan. Budget cuts that have reduced teacher salaries and equipment availability are reflected disproportionately in reduced numbers of female students.\n\nIn 2008, 3.7 percent of gross domestic product was spent on education. In 2001 some 89 percent of the relevant age-group was enrolled in the compulsory program, but this figure has decreased in the early 2000s. In 2004 the literacy rate in Kyrgyzstan was 98.7 percent.\n\nPre-school is addressed to children from 3 to 6/7 and is not compulsory. Access to it is limited (net enrollment ratio of 10% in 2005).\n\nPrimary school usually starts at 6 or 7, lasts four years and is compulsory. Since 2007, uniforms are required in primary education. The law was pointed out as a source of school-drop out, as the uniform has to be bought by the parents. Teaching quality is sometime described as \"poor\": Kyrgyzstan ranked last in reading, mathematics and science at PISA 2006.\n\nSecondary education begins with the basic secondary education, which lasts four years and is compulsory. Students have then the choice between comprehensive and vocation educations. \n\nComprehensive education is constituted of a two-year curriculum, which grants — if completed — a certificate of completion (\"attestat\"). The certificate is generally required to join a university. \n\nVocational education is offered through three kinds of courses: A three-year course mixing vocational and general education and preparing for higher education, a two-year course mixing vocational and general education (without preparation to higher education), and a ten-month course of pure vocational education (also open to adults). Vocational education is given in professional lyceum and vocational technical colleges.\n\nHigher education includes universities, academies, specialized higher education institutes and institutes. There are 54 tertiary education institutions: 33 public for 21 private. The gross enrolment rate in higher education was 12.5% in 2011/2012.\n\nUniversities deliver bachelor (Bakalavr) degree in four years, which allows students to pursue master (Magistr) programs, lasting two years. They also offer a \"specialist degree\" (specialist) in five (or six for medical and architecture studies) years. The specialist and the master degrees open the door to PhD programs (aspirantura).\n\nAcademies offer the same degrees in fields of scientific activity. An institute is usually a specialized branch of a university or an academy. Specialized higher education institutes are narrow profiles institutions. \n\nThere were criticisms about the competency of university lecturers in Kyrgyzstan: if a Master degree is theoretically required to teach at university, most teachers actually hold a Bachelor or even no degree at all.\n\n"}

EITC provides Estonian applied higher education diploma-level (at least 180 ECTS credit points; equal to the Bachelor's degree under the Bologna process) education in information technology in four main programmes (IT Systems Administration, IT Systems Development, Information Systems Analysis and Technical Communication), carries out shorter-term vocational training programmes as well as various R&D-oriented activities.\n\nThe governing body of the IT College, the Estonian Information Technology Foundation, was established in March 2000 by the Republic of Estonia (represented by the Ministry of Education and Research), the University of Tartu, the Tallinn University of Technology, AS Eesti Telekom, and the Estonian Association of Information Technology and Telecommunications. One of the main forces behind the formation of EITC was the rapidly growing need for IT professionals which could not be met by universities and attracted people with uneven educational and professional background. During the first years, all students had to pay for the tuition (a small number of stipends were available for best students) - however, starting from 2007, 100 places are funded by the state, in a similar manner to state universities. In addition, up to 150 self-financing students are admitted every year.\n\nThe College was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Mart Laar in September 2000 and received the Estonian Award of Educational Achievement for that year. The location was in the downtown Tallinn until 2008 when the College moved into a new building in Mustamäe, at the vicinity of Tallinn University of Technology and Tehnopol.\n\nKalle Tammemäe served as the rector of EITC from the beginning to 2010. Linnar Viik held the office in 2011, the current rector Tiit Roosmaa was inaugurated in August 2011.\n\nThe College's three-year curriculum totalling at 180 credit points in the European Credit Transfer System produces a specific vocational qualification equal to a bachelor’s degree. The College’s priority is to train IT specialists, yet graduates may choose to pursue their studies at the Master’s level either in Estonia or abroad.\n\nThe IT Systems Development and IT Systems Administration programmes are available in the daytime study format either in full-time, part-time or external study forms. The Information Systems Analysis and Technical Communication programmes are available in the evening study format in full-time, part-time or external study forms. The evening study format with classes starting at 6 p.m. on business days is targeted at the people who work during the daytime. All four programmes have received full accreditation.\n\nThe graduates of the IT Systems Administration programme will have an in-depth knowledge of the structure, indicators and functions of appropriate IT systems (computer and telecommunications networks, Internet, databases etc.). They will be able to administer, expand and retune these systems, as well as contribute to developing new services and applications.\n\nThe IT Systems Development programme provides a comprehensive education in the field of software development and IT systems (computer and telecommunications networks, Internet, databases etc.). Graduates will develop thorough knowledge of different programming languages and tools, development environments and teamwork basics necessary for development of modern application software.\n\nThe graduates of the Information Systems Analysis programme will have a balanced knowledge of the processes occurring in both IT and business systems. They will be able to participate in devising complex business information systems, applications or services and work as applications integrators, system architects, data systems developers and system analysts.\n\nThe Technical Communication programme introduces students not only to the basics of IT but also skills in oral and written self-expression, and knowledge of design, printing technology, etc. Graduates in this subject area will be able to work in positions that require providing users of IT products and services with specific IT terminology and content. Graduates will have the skills of producing user guidelines, product catalogues and technical texts (both as publications and web-based presentations) for selected target groups, and designing advertising / promotional materials.\n\nThe language of instruction is Estonian, but some courses are available in English as well.\n\nCompleting a three-year programme of 180 credit points students acquire a special qualification that corresponds to the Bachelor’s degree and is aimed at working in a specific field. The graduates are able to continue their studies at the Master’s level at Tallinn University of Technology, Tartu University or elsewhere.\n\nAlthough EITC is not a research-oriented institution, it takes part in a number of applied research and development projects. Via the EITF as the mother institution, it also cooperates with the Estonian e-Learning Development Centre in various national and international development projects and events in e-learning.\n\nEITC offers a wide variety of vocational training courses on a diverse choice of subjects (operating systems, application software, software development, systems administration, data security etc.) on different levels. The College is also a training partner to the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, taking part in retraining programmes for unemployed people.\n\nThe tradition of public lectures at EITC is as old as the College itself (the first one took place in 2000.) Over the years, the lecturers have included Richard M. Stallman from the Free Software Foundation, Jon 'Maddog' Hall from Linux International, Mikko Hyppönen and Jarno Niemelä from F-Secure, Akira Hirooka from DoCoMo, Andrew Kass from Microsoft, U.S. Ambassador to Estonia Michael C. Polt and many others.\n\n\nEITC has given high priority to accessibility and special needs since its foundation. The current building was erected with accessibility in mind and was tested by a disability activist group in 2010, and as a result, received 2.7 points out of 3 (at the time, it was considered the only Estonian UAS to be fully accessible). The College subsequently received a commendation from the Estonian Chamber of Disabled People.\n\nThroughout the history of the College (as of 2012), the scholarships have been founded by Baltic Computer Systems, Datel, Elion, EMT, Eesti Ühispank / SEB, Hansapank / Swedbank, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Kungla Dialoog, Liewenthal Electronics, Mantador Estonia, Microlink, Microsoft, Nokia, Open Estonia Foundation, Oracle, Santa Monica Networks, Starman, Sybase Symantec, Tallinn City Government and Tele2.\n\nThe College takes part in the following partnership programmes:\n\nInternational partnerships include\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33295056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33295056", "title": "Moral development", "text": "Moral development\n\nMoral Development focuses on the emergence, change, and understanding of morality from infancy through adulthood. Morality develops across a lifetime and is influenced by an individual's experiences and their behavior when faced with moral issues through different periods' physical and cognitive development. In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for \"rightness\" or \"goodness\". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts. \n\nNotions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like Confucius, Aristotle, and Rousseau, who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like Sigmund Freud and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like Jean Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg, B. F. Skinner, Carol Gilligan and Judith Smetana. \n\nThe interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., philosophy, economics, biology, and political science) and specializations within psychology (e.g., social, cognitive, and cultural). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.\n\nFreud: Morality and the Superego: The founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual. According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).\n\nB.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory: A proponent of behaviorism, B.F. Skinner similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development. In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.\n\nPiaget's Theory of Moral Development : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), Jean Piaget (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.\nSocial Domain Theory: Eliot Turiel argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan. Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.\n\nKohlberg: Moral Reasoning\":\" Lawrence Kohlberg was inspired by the works of Jean Piaget and John Dewey.\n\nFor the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development\n\nA hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target’s intentions towards another. Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it. Recent research on children's theory of mind, ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman & Lui, 2004). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children. Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and Woodward (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one’s intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes. In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and Tomasello (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person. Beyond the ability to identify one’s intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, & Lau, 1996), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw & Wainryb, 2006). In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.\n\nMoral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. Psychoanalytic theory, founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on prosocial behavior has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.\n\nResearch on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several \"moral emotions\" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review). These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual’s set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska & Thompson, 1997). The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007). The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are guilt, shame, empathy, and sympathy. Guilt has been defined as \"an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event\" (Fergusen & Stegge, 1998). Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered \"self-conscious\" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, it should be noted that different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).\n\nThe relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, & Sadovsky, 2006). Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998; Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler & Robinson, 1995).\n\nWhile emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001; Haidt, 2001). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel & Killen, 2010). Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988, Arsenio & Fleiss, 1996). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise & Arsenio, 2000). In addition, Malti, Gummerum, Keller, & Buchmann, (2009) found individual differences in how children attribute emotions to victims and victimizers.\n\nChildren's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behaviorResearchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska & Askan, 1995; Kochanska, Askan, & Koenig, 1995) and social domain theory. \n\nResearch from the social domain theory perspective focuses on how children actively distinguish moral from conventional behavior based in part on the responses of parents, teachers, and peers. Social domain suggests that there are different areas of reasoning co-existing in development those include societal (concerns about conventions and grouping), moral (fairness, justice and rights) and psychological (concerns with personal goals and identity). Adults tend to respond to children's moral transgressions (e.g. hitting or stealing) by drawing the child's attention to the effect of his or her action on others, and doing so consistently across various contexts. In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home). Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions. \n\nResearch from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska & Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and temperament (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children. These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality. \n\nResearchers interested in intergroup attitudes and behavior related to ones moral development have approached the study of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination in children and adolescents from several theoretical perspectives. Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988); Social Domain Theory (Killen & Rutland, 2011; Killen, Sinno, & Margie, 2007); Social Identity Development Theory (Nesdale, 1999); Developmental Intergroup Theory (Bigler & Liben, 2006); Subjective Group Dynamics (Abrams, Rutland, & Cameron, 2003; Rutland, Killen, & Abrams, 2010); Implicit Theories (Levy, Chiu, & Hong, 2006) and Intergroup-contact Theory (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). The plethora of research approaches is not surprising given the multitude of variables, (e.g. group identity, group status, group threat, group norms, intergroup contact, individual beliefs and context) that need to be considered when assessing children's intergroup attitudes. While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).\n\nIn developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, & Sinno, 2006; Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (eg. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently delliberately because of the group they are associated with. Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954). Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009). Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen & Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity. \n\nOne explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.\n\nCulture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society. Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions. Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual’s behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood. Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.\n\nMoral relativism, also called “cultural relativism,” suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one’s own. Shweder, Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently. The term is also different from moral subjectivism which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of moral skepticism and is often misidentified as moral pluralism. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in moral absolutism and the views of moral universalism. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping). rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting armong others. Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works. When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles. \n\nThe role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through religion, which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. Religious development often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands. Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions. \n\nIn Indigenous American communities, morality is taught to children through storytelling. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations. Storytelling shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching. \n\nStorytelling in everyday life is used as an indirect form of teaching. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen attention to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do. The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.\n\nSpecific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the storytelling where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the Lakota tribe, coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model . In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.\n\nIntergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, & Stangor, 2002).\n\nFindings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003, Killen and Stangor, 2001). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, & Watanabe, 2002; Park, Killen, Crystal, & Watanabe, 2003). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen & Stangor, 2001)\n\nResource allocation is a critical part of the decision making process for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers). When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.). The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a locus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include “any combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values. The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.\n\nThe healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts. Concerns of morality arise when the initiation, continuation, and withdrawal of intensive care affects a patients well being due to medical decision making. Sox, Higgins, & Owens (2013) offer guidelines and questions for medical practitioners to consider, such as: \n“How should I interpret new diagnostic information?\nHow do I select the appropriate diagnostic test? \nHow do I choose among several risky treatments?” \nWithholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, in the United States, has had a moral consensus that there are no differences between these two therapies. However, even though a political decision offers support for medical practitioner's decision making, there continues to be difficulty withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.\n\n"}

{"id": "34682580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34682580", "title": "Sexism in academia", "text": "Sexism in academia\n\nSexism in academia refers to the discrimination and subordination of a particular sex in academic institutions, particularly universities, due to the ideologies, practices and reinforcements that privilege one sex over another. Sexism in academia is not limited to but primarily affects women who are denied the professional achievements awarded to men in their respective fields such as positions, tenure and awards.\n\nThere is controversy over whether women's under-representation in specific academic fields is the result of gender discrimination or of other factors such as personal inclination. Some individuals have argued that there are equal opportunities for women and men in sciences and that sexism no longer exists in these fields. Researchers note that as of 2015, women had closed the undergraduate degree gap for several STEM fields including both the social and biological sciences, but women only accounted for approximately 20% of the computer science and engineering undergraduate degree holders. Likewise, at the master's and doctoral level, the number of STEM degrees obtained by women had increased for many fields; however, only 27% of the master's degrees and 23% of the doctoral degrees in computer science and engineering were held by women. These claims of equal opportunity in scientific fields of academia are often attributed to women's \"preference\" and inclination for other fields of study and to teaching instead of research. However, such claims do not take into account that gender is central to the organization of higher education. This might explain women's under-representation in academia at more senior levels, and the way in which the organization of higher education institutions might be structurally disadvantaging women by the institutionalization, practice, and valuing of masculinity which ends up reinforcing hegemonic masculinities. Women are not represented in senior jobs in the humanities even though most students in these fields are women.\n\nWomen are underrepresented in tenured positions. From 2001 to 2009, women averaged 35% of all full-time faculty with tenure and 43% of all full-time faculty in non-tenure track positions in comparison to men's 50% and 32%, respectively. A case study performed by the Pennsylvania State University in 2006 attributes a majority of this gap to familial commitments and the avoidance strategies they create among faculty members. For instance, it takes approximately between five to seven years for a faculty member to be considered for the position of associate professor with tenure; this system limits caregiving and family responsibilities until tenure is achieved, so faculty members may choose to delay marriage, parenthood, etc. until the desired position is acquired. In particular, the careers of female academics are greatly hindered because the workplace tends to favor a male's career path. The travel, possibility of relocation and vigorous work schedules limit the participation of females due to family conflicts. A 2006 national survey, reported 16% of female faculty remained single because they did not have time for both a family and a successful career; of the female faculty who were parents, 17.2% chose to have one child but delayed even considering another until they had acquired their desired position. These challenges associated with balancing work life and family life raise questions regarding the influence both marriage and motherhood have on the academic positions available to wives and mothers at colleges and universities. Despite the increased support for family-friendly policies in the academic workplace, few have yet to be utilized fully. Many academies support paid parental leave, tenure-clock stoppage and flexible schedules; however, few faculty members of either sex choose to take advantage of these policies for fear of being penalized by their departments despite the institution's approval.\n\nWomen are less likely to win academic awards. For instance, there are 48 women Nobel Prize winners, compared to 844 men. About two-thirds of these winners won a Nobel Prize for a humanities discipline, not a science discipline. In most scientific disciplines, a small portion of women full professors are nominated for awards compared to the number of women in the field. The Recognition of the Achievements of Women In Science, Medicine, and Engineering (RAISE) project have reported that the women represent 8.6% of Lasker Award winners.\n\nWomen of color face specific issues related to sexism in academia as well. One such problem is referred to as the \"Chilly Climate\" problem, wherein, because women of color are infrequent in academia, they are often isolated and face a lack of institutional support. Additionally, because women of color's bodies are both viewed racially and in terms of their gender in academia, their voices and identities are often overlooked through \"elite racism\", as coined by Allen, Epps, Guillory, Suh, and Bonous-Hammarth (2000). Because women of color in academia are sometimes minorities in regards to their colleagues as well as their students, it is suggested that they feel the aforementioned isolation, racism, and sexism from both groups.\n\nWomen of color in academia are not only seemingly ostracized by their colleagues, but by their students as well. Women faculty of color reported having their authority questioned and challenged, their teaching competency questioned and their knowledge and experience disrespected by their students. White male students were also seen to behave more aggressively towards these women and would also employ intimidating behaviors.\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation's 2015 survey of Doctorate recipients, only 40.41% of U.S. doctorate scientists employed in teaching positions were women, 61,750 out of a sample of 152,800. Of the female population, 75.95% were White, 11.01% were Asian, 5.34% were Hispanic or Latino, 5.67% were Black or African American, 0.32% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 1.62% constituted other races, including Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and those who marked multiple races who were not Hispanic or Latino. In addition, Asian women held 3% of tenured positions, Latinas 2.4%, and Black women 2.3% according to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nIn many academic disciplines, women receive less credit for their research than men. This trend is especially pronounced in engineering fields. A study published in 2015 by Gita Ghiasi, Vincent Lariviere, and Cassidy Sugimoto demonstrates that women represent 20% of all scientific production in the field of engineering. The study examined 679,338 engineering articles published between 2008 and 2013, and it analyzed the collaborative networks among 974,837 authors. Ghiasi et al. created networking diagrams, depicting the frequency of collaboration among authors, and the success of each collaboration was measured by the number of times the study was cited. The collaboration networks illustrate that mixed-gender teams have a higher average rate of productivity and citations, yet 50% of male engineers have collaborated only with other men and 38% of female engineers have collaborated only with men. The researchers use impact factors—the average annual number of citation that a journal receives—to measure the prestige of academic journals. Their study shows that when women publish their research in journals with high-impact factors, they receive fewer citations from the engineering community. The authors explain their findings as a possible consequence of the \"Matilda effect\", a phenomenon that systematically undervalues the scientific contributions of women.\n\nIn addition to engineering, a gender bias in publishing is exemplified in economics. In 2015, Heather Sarsons released a working paper comparing credit allocated to men and women in collaborative research. Sarsons analyzed the publication records of economists at top universities over the past 40 years, and found that female economists publish work as frequently as their male cohorts, yet their tenure prospects are less than half that of men. Women receive comparable credit to men when they solo author their work or co-author with other female economist, evinced by a 8–9% increase in their tenure prospects, implying that tenure prospects decrease with collaborative work due to lack of credit given to women, not the quality of their work. Men receive the same amount of credit for solo authoring and co-authoring their work, shown by a 8–9% increase in their tenure prospects; however, when women co-author with men, there is no increase in their tenure prospects.\n\nIn the academic disciplines of political science and international relations, research has found evidence of gender bias in publishing and teaching. The Teaching, Research and International Policy (TRIP) project gathers data and publishes analysis on the discipline of international relations. In 2013, a study published by Daniel Maliniak, Ryan Powers and Barbara F. Walter used TRIP data from peer-reviewed publications between 1980 and 2006 to show that women are systematically cited less than men after controlling for a number of variables including year and venue of publication, substantive focus, theoretical perspective, methodology, tenure status, and institutional affiliation. In a 2017 study on publishing patterns in political science journals, Dawn Langan Teele and Kathleen Thelen found that women authors are underrepresented compared to the share of women working in the profession, are not benefiting from the trend toward co-authored publications (dominated by all-male author teams), and lose out from the methodological partiality of top journals in the field. Activism aimed at uprooting gender bias in academic publishing and teaching has increased over the years and has led to initiatives such as #womenalsoknowstuff, #womenalsoknowhistory, and Jane Lawrence Sumner's Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT). In 2015, Jeff Colgan conducted an analysis of American post-graduate international relations syllabi and found that 82% of assigned reading was written by all-male authors. At the London School of Economics, a student-led body called the Gender and Diversity Project (GDP) conducted a similar assessment of syllabi from the full teaching curriculum in the International Relations department from 2015 to 2016. The results, published in 2018 (see Kiran Phull, Gokhan Ciflikli and Gustav Meibauer), revealed that 79.2% of assigned reading from all undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate syllabi was authored exclusively by male authors, with the undergraduate curriculum being the least gender-diverse. \n\n\n\n"}

The concept of the show was Mr. Bar and Mr. Orian meet to study Gemara (Talmud) together. The show was incorporated in the past as part of the 7th-grade curriculum in secondary yeshivas, or 9th-grade curriculum in secular Hebrew-speaking schools, and a study booklet was added in 1989, written and edited by Benjamin Domovitz.\n\nThe show had two hosts, Baruch Bar (The tall one — Itzik Sayedoff) and Ori Orian (The chubby one — Avi Oriah), who used a study room that has been converted to a television studio where they learn different topics in the Talmud while focusing on explaining basic concepts. The hosts are aware of the cameras and audience. After explaining the topic from the writings the two argue among themselves over the explanation of the subject. Then in a fictionalized segment they go back in time to the period of the Mishnah (around 200 CE) and discuss the topic of the day with ordinary people from the era, to try to learn which of their interpretations is correct.\n\nAlmost all the chapters addressed interpretation and clarification of basic Talmud concepts.\n\nThe name of the show is \"Shnaim Ohazin\" (Two who are holding) with a double meaning: The show speaks of studying the Talmud, and \"Shnaim Ohazin\" is one of the famous Talmud chapters dealing with a division Principle, and also the name suggests that there are two teachers holding the Gemara and are learning and teaching it.\n\nThe point of this is explained by Dr. Yehuda Schwartz:\n\"The Talmudic study is active with negotiating in a \"Havruta\" while viewing is passive. The study of the Talmud is mostly textual, while the television medium is not characterized by book and words. On top of that, study of the Talmud involves continual negotiation between the study partners, and this is difficult to present by television. The solution to these problems is found in the broadcast through creation of a dialogue between two participants: \"Bar\" and \"Orian\". The broadcast does not come in order to replace the study of Talmud but it is used as a helping instrument along with a guide to the teacher and paper assignments for the student.\"\n\nThe names of the teachers on the show also hold a symbolic meaning: the names of both teachers Baruch Bar and Ori Orian () are an alliteration, their last names put together composes the term \"Bar Orian\" (Son/Student of the Torah in Aramaic, or \"scholar\" in Modern Hebrew). The name of Bar and Orian's teacher also suggests of his role: Shlomo Melamed (, Teaches).\n\nDirector:\nActors:\nGuest actors:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Headquartered in San Francisco, the organization is among the largest U.S. conservation nonprofits, with approximately 30 field offices across the U.S., including a federal affairs function in Washington, D.C. \n\nConsistent with its \"Land for People\" mission, The Trust for Public Land is widely known for urban conservation work, including New York City playgrounds and community gardens, Chicago's 606 linear park, Los Angeles green alleys, Climate-Smart Cities programs in 20 American cities, and \"The 10-Minute Walk\" initiative, which aims to put a high-quality park or open space within a 10-minute walk of every resident of every U.S. urban census tract. \n\nThe Trust for Public Land simultaneously focuses on public access-oriented land protection, such as additions to Yosemite National Park, the Appalachian Trail, Cape Cod National Seashore, and other national, state, and municipal parks across America. The organization also prioritizes projects that celebrate and advance social equity, like helping to create Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, the Stonewall National Monument, and the Kashia Coastal Reserve.\n\nAlthough The Trust for Public Land is an accredited land trust, the organization differs from conventional land trusts in that it does not generally hold or steward conservation property interests. Instead, The Trust for Public Land works with community members, public agencies, and other conservation NGOs to identify park-creation and land protection projects, and then helps plan, fund, protect, and/or create those spaces, with ownership of any resulting property interests typically transferring to locale, state, or federal public agencies, or to other conservation NGOs.\n\nIn addition to creating parks and protecting open spaces, The Trust for Public Land is a leading advocate for public conservation funding at the local, state, and federal levels. Through campaigns, ballot measures, and legislative advocacy, the organization works—often in concert with its affiliated 501(c)4 nonprofit, The Trust for Public Land Action Fund—to ensure adequate funding for many of the federal and state public funding programs relied on by public park and conservation agencies, and by conservation NGOs.\n\nThe Trust for Public Land also researches, publishes, and contributes to many authoritative national databases and platforms providing information about U.S. parks, protected open spaces, conservation finance, and urban climate risks, including ParkScore, ParkServe, Parkology, The Conservation Alamanac, the National Conservation Easement Database, LandVote, and \"Climate-Smart Cities\" Decision Support Tools. \n\n\n\nThe Trust for Public Land was founded in San Francisco in 1972 by Huey Johnson, the former western regional director of The Nature Conservancy, and other San Francisco Bay Area and national lawyers and conservationists. Johnson’s goal was to create an organization that would use emerging real estate, legal, and financial techniques to conserve land for human use and public benefit. An additional founding goal was to extend the conservation and environmental movements to cities, where an increasingly large segment of the population lived. Early Trust for Public Land programs of the 1970s and ‘80s included:\n\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, The Trust for Public Land is legally limited in the amount it can spend on campaigning for legislative and ballot measures. In 2000, the organization launched a 501(c)(4) affiliate, The Conservation Campaign, which is not limited in such spending. This affiliate entity is now called The Trust for Public Land Action Fund and frequently works with The Trust for Public Land to help pass local and state conservation finance measures.\n\n\n"}

He has published nine books of original poetry, one full-length translation of Euripides' \"Herakles\" and two books of essays. His most recent books are House of Fact, House of Ruin: Poems and The Land Between Two Rivers: Writing In an Age of Refugees (essays). At least five of his plays have been produced. He has won numerous awards, including the 2008 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, worth $100,000, an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, The Shelley Award from the Poetry Society of America, and a Guggenheim Foundation grant. He currently serves as director of Hunter College's Master of Fine Arts (MFA) program in Creative Writing. He is the recipient of the Anna-Maria Kellen Prize and Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin for Fall 2011.\n\nTom Sleigh was born in Mount Pleasant, Texas, where he lived until the age of five, when he moved to Utah. He lived in Utah until seventh grade, when he moved to California. He attended the California Institute of the Arts, Evergreen State College, and the Writing Seminars Johns Hopkins University for two years, where he graduated with an MA. In his mid-twenties he moved to Massachusetts, to work at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown. He began teaching at Dartmouth College in 1986 and later taught at New York University, the University of Iowa, UC-Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University. He lives in Brooklyn, New York, and serves as director of the Hunter College Master of Fine Arts Program in Creative Writing, where he also teaches poetry writing.\n\nIn an interview published in the literary journal \"AGNI\", Sleigh lists his poetic influences:\nI'd have to say that Browning for his technique; Wallace Stevens for a certain quality of gravitas, what Keats feels near his death, when he said he was living a sort of posthumous existence; Philip Larkin for his sense of extremity; Pound for his fluidity of conception and hardness of execution; Baudelaire for his music and intense scrutiny and affection for street life; and Bishop and Lowell for their immersion in the physical world, would be my fathers and mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

(It has six degrees of freedom when attached to the optional sliding base.)\nThe arm is constructed of aluminum and the workings of the robot, such as geared electric motors and their rotary encoders, are visible.\nA controller, based on the 6502 CPU also found in the robot's contemporary, the Apple II, can control up to eight motors - the robot and two other items, such as a turntable or the aforementioned sliding base.\nThere is a teach pendant, rather like those of full-size industrial robots, that can be connected to the controller. Using this, the robot can be \"taught\" simple programs using the pendant and can then repeat them.\n\nThe interface for the motor controller is based on a RS-232 serial port. (9600 baud, 7 data bits, 2 stop bits, even parity.) The controller, while in one physical box, is actually two machines. The one on the top is the teach pendant computer, the one below is the motor controller proper.\nOne can connect a computer to this serial port and send the robot commands. The commands are very simple, and many are based on text, so the controller can be commanded with a simple serial terminal or a terminal emulator program running on a PC.\n\nThe command 'F+100', for instance, will cause the F motor to move 100 units.\n'F-100' would reverse the movement. Generally, the commands refer to one of the eight motors that controller can move, labeled A, B, C ... H.\nThe number must not be larger than 127 or smaller than 128, or the signed byte holding it will overflow.\n\nAnother command is 'F?', (Where F could be any motor label). This command inquires how many steps of the current movement instruction have not yet been performed. A byte is returned, but 32 must be subtracted from this byte to get the true number of steps remaining - 32 is added so that the returned character is always a printing character and not a control character.\n\n"}
