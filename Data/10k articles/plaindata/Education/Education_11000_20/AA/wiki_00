Founded in 1899 by Amy Zwemer as the country's first Western school, it was formerly known as the Acorn School and then as the American Mission School. Located in near proximity of the heart of the capital, Al Raja School lies adjacent to the American Mission Hospital, Bahrain's financial and diplomatic area.\n\nIn 1899, Maryam Ali saw a need. There were a few students - her daughters and a few other girls from the neighborhood - who were eager and ready to learn. Armed with only a few books and an enthusiasm that was second to none, Ms. Zwemer met with these seven girls on her back porch and taught writing and reading. She called her school The Acorn School. Connected with the American Mission Hospital, and the work directed by her husband, Samuel Zwemer, her little school began to grow. In less than three years, there was a need for a school building to be built.\n\nWith donations from churches from the Reformed Church in America in the US, a church and school building was built. Every day 10-15 students attended to learn reading, writing and arithmetic. In the afternoons, trade crafts were taught by American staff and Bahraini members of the community. The school continued to grow over the years, eventually becoming an all girls school. In the 1930s, there was a demand to begin a formal boys section in the school. Eventually the school became known as the American Mission School, the name by which many in the community know it today, serving students from KG - Grade 9. During that time it held classes at the church facilities, which themselves morphed and changed over the decades.\n\nIn 1994, the current campus was built, and the school moved to its current campus. In the early 2000s, grades 10, 11, and 12 were added, and the first graduating class walked in 2008. Most recently, the school has added the Advanced Placement curriculum for students, and has begun the accreditation process with AdvancEd. The school continues to work towards building strong community through building strong students.\n\nThe school offers the American Diploma and is accredited by AdvancED, an American accreditation agency. The Ministry of Education has also approved the high school diploma as equivalent to their Tawjihi Diploma. Students in grades 11 and 12 have the option of taking Advanced Placement courses.\n\nSome of the classes provided by the school include: \n\n"}

It was formed in the 70s during the Kuala Lumpur days, and one of the earliest students association to be registered under Office of Students' Affair (HEMA, previously HEP), and is acknowledged as one of the most active students association in UTM. It resides within the Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, under the Faculty of Built Environment.\n\nThe main role of Architech is to manage the welfare of the UTM architecture students, organize events of various forms for the benefits of its members, to become the voice of the students in the school, and ultimately to ensure the advancement of non-academic qualities amongst its members.\n\nThe Architech logo was a result of a design competition held by the association in 1992, initiated by the president at the time, Zulhisham and Che Wan Ahmad Faizal. At the time, the name Architech have not come into being, and the logo competition was actually for PSUTM. The prize advertised was RM200, however the participations were poor and uninspiring (less than 20 entries), hence no winner was picked. Instead, Che Wan Ahmad Faizal then approached Fauzee Nasir to design a logo worthy for the association.\n\nUsing Aldus Freehand 2.0. on a classic Mac, Fauzee designed the logo, incorporating the name Architech for the first time. This was the first instance of the name in use. The logo and the name Architech was accepted by the general population, and remains in use until now.\n\nThe logo utilizes simple and straightforward typography, using Times New Roman, beginning with a capital A and with italic type applied to the last four letters. The letters \"Archi\" will normally be black on white/light background, or white on black/dark background. The letters \"tech\" will normally be red, or gray in monochrome print.\n\nThe Architech logo was designed and still owned by Fauzee Nasir until today. In a deal struck with the association, the association agreed not to pay the RM200 prize money to Fauzee Nasir as the design was not part of the competition. Hence, the designer retains ownership and rights to the logo. However, in a mutual agreement the designer gave right to use and reproduce the logo as long as it is not for commercial use. Any commercial use must have written permission from the designer.\n\nArchitech members consist of the entire population of architecture students in UTM, as students enrolled in the programme are automatically registered under it unless otherwise requested. Previously it also included students of landscape architecture until they formed their own students society in the late 1990s. When the diploma programme was shifted to UTM KL campus under the Razak School, the diploma students formed their own society called ARCO, which was intended as a sister society to Architech. However, due to logistics problem, especially since both are now under two different schools, ARCO became an independent body, but maintained close relations with Architech.\n\nBelow is the list of students batches and name. (Due to the various intake positions in the programme, it made more sense to list the batches according to their respective graduation year, instead of intake year).\nBeyond this the programme has been restructured into a 3-year (instead of 5 year) programme. It has not been decided on how or what convention to use for the 2-year M.Arch programme at this moment, particularly since it has two intakes per year (effectively two graduating batches annually as well).\n\nArchitech is led by its president, democratically elected amongst its members for a term of one year. The president is assisted by the vice president, secretary and treasurer, all of which are democratically elected as well. Together, they will form their government, electing individuals of various skills into official positions where their skills could be harnessed for the benefit of the society. These positions evolve and vary throughout the years to meet any needs.\n\nSome example of the positions over the years are:\n\nThe list of Presidents are as follows, according to year and batch.\n\nArchitext was initiated as a periodical newsletter for Architech. It started around 1997, led by Roshida Majid and advised by Dr. Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi. Copies of the first two issues were lost; #3 was the earliest remaining copy today. It was distributed free bilingually in Bahasa Malaysia and English, featured several articles relating to architectural studies, listed events and activities, as well as a cartoon sketch.\n\nArchitext was never resumed and was presumably forgotten, until recently some of its original members began discussing of bringing it back.\n\nThe Design Folio is a publication collecting selected students' thesis works from a particular year. It is published with the notion of showcasing works based on specific theme for each publication. Students works are then selected based on the theme, ideally spanning between three and five years of thesis works. However, in its two innumeration, the selection is limited within a group of students in a particular year.\n\nThe publication is intended for commercial publications. The editorial consists of entirely students from the thesis group, advised and consulted by the Thesis Coordinators. To date, there have been two successful publications: the first in 2005 and the second in 2007. There was another manuscript managed to be completed in 2008, however due to funding limitations, it did not get published.\n\n1997 Architectural Design Thesis.\n\nThe association have adopted a song written by one of the students in the late 80s, Zuhairi Harun. The song was titled 'Warisan', touching on the struggle of heritage and identity of architecture in Malaysia. The song have gone through a number of renditions, including quickening of tempo and change of melody, however the spirit of the song remains.\n\nThe architectural workshop is an annual national gatherings of architectural students in Malaysia. It began in 1987 in UTM, using the format of a jamboree, organised by Persatuan Arkitek (Architech) in Kuala Lumpur. Concurrently during the workshop, the PAM-Education Liaison Meeting would also take place to take advantage of the gatherings of students from various schools in one location.\n\nArchitech was the pioneer of the architectural workshop, which exists until today. The last architectural workshop hosted by Architech was in June 2011 using the theme \"Terang\". It was the biggest architectural workshop ever hosted by Architech, involving over 24 schools of architecture from all over Malaysia. It was officiated by PAM Vice President Ar. Saifuddin Ahmad. One of the outcome of the module was street furnitures, which became a feature in Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Johor Bahru. Over 20 sculptures were displayed and used by the public for a period of several days.\n\nAt the moment, it is undecided on when the next hosting by Architech will be, but it is estimated around 2016.\n\nThese notable people have been members of Architech society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of six Ivy League business schools, and has been referred to as among the most selective of top business schools. \n\nThe school was founded in 1916 with 11 full-time faculty members and an inaugural class of 61 students, including 8 women. Banking executive Emerson McMillin provided initial funding in 1916, while A. Barton Hepburn, then president of Chase National Bank, provided funding for the School's endowment in 1919. The School expanded rapidly, enrolling 420 students by 1920, and in 1924 added a PhD program to the existing BS and MS degree programs.\n\nIn 1945, Columbia Business School authorized the awarding of the MBA degree. Shortly thereafter, in the 1950s, the School adopted the Hermes emblem as its symbol, reflecting the entrepreneurial nature of the Greek god Hermes and his association with business, commerce and communication.\n\nIn 1952, CBS admitted its last class of undergraduates. The school currently offers executive education programs that culminate in a Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) and full alumni status, and several degree programs for the MBA and PhD degrees. In addition to the full-time MBA, the school offers four Executive MBA programs: the NY-EMBA Friday/Saturday program, the EMBA-Global program (launched in 2001 in conjunction with the London Business School), the EMBA-Americas program launched in 2012, and the EMBA-Global Asia program (launched in 2009 in conjunction with the London Business School and the University of Hong Kong Business School).

An auxiliary space, Warren Hall, is situated on Amsterdam Avenue and is shared with the law school.\n\nIn October 2010, Columbia Business School announced that alumnus Henry Kravis, the billionaire co-founder of private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR & Co.), pledged $100 million to fund expansion of Columbia Business School, the largest gift in its history. The donation will go toward construction of the business school’s new site in the Manhattanville section of New York City, where Columbia University is extending its campus. One of the school’s two new buildings will be named for Kravis. The buildings will be designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro.\nIn December 2012, Ronald Perelman also donated $100 million to the construction of the second business school building.\n\nThe Columbia MBA Program is highly competitive with an admission rate of 16% for the 2017 entering class. The student body is highly accomplished and diverse. Students in the class that entered in 2009 come from 61 countries and speak more than 50 languages.\n\nThe revised core curriculum, launched in the fall of 2008, represents about 40% of the degree requirement. It consists of 2 full courses and 12 half-term courses including Corporate Finance, Financial Accounting, Managerial Statistics, Managerial Economics, Leadership, Operations Management, and Marketing Strategy. While the first year of the program is usually devoted to completing the requirements of the core curriculum, the second year provides students with the opportunity to choose from the more than 130 elective courses available at the School and supplement them with more than 4,000 graduate-level classes from the University's other graduate and professional schools. Among the most popular electives at Columbia Business School are the Economics of Strategic Behavior, Financial Statement Analysis and Earnings Quality, Launching New Ventures, Modern Political Economy, and the Seminar in Value Investing.\n\nColumbia Business School has a firm grade non-disclosure policy, stating that students refrain from disclosing specific class grades, GPAs, or transcripts until they accept full-time, post graduation positions. Students enter Columbia's MBA program in two tracks. The traditional fall term is approximately 550 students, while the January term \"J-Term\" is approximately 200 students. Students entering in the fall are divided into eight clusters of approximately 65 students that take all first year core classes together. J-Term students are broken into three clusters. The J-Term is aimed at students who want an accelerated 18-month program who usually plan to return to their previous job, are company sponsored, and will not pursue a summer internship because they take classes during the summer.\n\nThe recently launched \"Columbia CaseWorks\" program utilizes the faculty’s research and industry experience and brings that perspective into the classroom through the development of new cases and teaching materials. Beginning in orientation and continuing through core classes and electives, students are immersed in cases that use faculty research to address real-world business issues. Columbia CaseWorks challenges students to debate corporate decision making and to develop appropriate recommendations and solutions. During their first year, students study and discuss an integrated case that focuses on a single company and is incorporated into several core courses. This encourages students to think about a company holistically, analyzing it from the perspective of various disciplines.\n\nIn 2013, the median starting base salary was $110,000, with a median $30,000 signing bonus and a median $20,000 of other guaranteed compensation. According to \"Forbes\" magazine, 90% of billionaires with MBAs who derived their fortunes from finance obtained their master's degree from one of three schools: Harvard Business School, Columbia Business School, or The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania..\n\nThe School's faculty are divided into five academic units:\n\nThough there are no official tracks within Columbia Business School, many students choose to focus on a particular area in order to gain deeper knowledge in a specific discipline. Columbia Business School offers the following areas of focus:\n\nAs part of its MBA curriculum, Columbia Business School offers the Value Investing Program at the Heilbrunn Center for Graham & Dodd Investing, for a handful of selected business school students. The program includes Applied Value Investing and Special Situations Investing. Adjunct professors include hedge fund managers, such as Joel Greenblatt, Paul Sonkin, Ken Shubin Stein and William Von Mueffling. The program also features an extensive list of guest speakers which include Seth Klarman, Michael Price, Bill Nygren, Charles Brandes, David Einhorn and Chris Browne. Notable graduates of the value investing program include Warren Buffett, Mario Gabelli, Leon G. Cooperman, Chuck Royce, Paul Sonkin and William von Mueffling.\n\nColumbia Business School's Entrepreneurship Program trains students for four career paths: entrepreneurship in new ventures, entrepreneurship in large organizations, private equity financing and social entrepreneurship. Consequently, entrepreneurship among Columbia MBA students is on the rise, with 20 students in the MBA Class of 2007 starting their own businesses directly after graduation. To supplement its Entrepreneurship Program, the Business School launched, in June 2012, an entrepreneurship lab in downtown Manhattan, an incubator space for entrepreneurs.\n\nColumbia Business School has a strong presence in consulting. All top five new MBA employers are consulting firms, with McKinsey alone offering positions to 50 new graduates in 2014. Over 30% of new graduates choose a career in consulting.\n\nFor 2017, national rankings of Columbia’s MBA program include #6 by \"Forbes\", #9 by \"Bloomberg Businessweek\", and #9 by \"U.S. News and World Report\". In global rankings, Columbia was ranked #9 by \"The Economist\" and #7 by the \"Financial Times\" in 2018.\n\nIn its 2017 ranking of the top-20 business schools in the Americas, the \"Financial Times\" ranked Columbia #2.\n\nColumbia Business School students can combine an MBA with one of ten other professional degrees. In general, a dual degree requires one less year than it would take to complete the two degrees separately. Candidates must apply separately to Columbia Business School and the other degree program.\n\nDual degrees offered with the following schools include:\n\nThe Columbia Business School Follies is a student club that works throughout each semester to put together a production in which students write, choreograph, and perform comedy skits. It achieved notoriety in 2006 for \"Every Breath Bernanke Takes\", its video parody of the Police song \"Every Breath You Take\". It purports to be from Glenn Hubbard, Dean of the Business School, in response to Hubbard's being a runner-up to the Fed Chairmanship assumed by Ben Bernanke.\n\nKey Admission Stats – Columbia MBA:\n\nAverage GPA of admits: 3.6\n\nAverage GMAT of admits: 732\n\nAverage Age of admits: 28\n\nAdmission requirements include a bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution, three essays, two letters of recommendation, a GMAT or GRE score and a TOEFL or PTE score for international applicants.\n\nColumbia offers various executive MBA programs.\n\nThe Executive MBA (EMBA) Friday/Saturday Program is a 20-month graduate program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education without interrupting their careers. The EMBA program is taught on campus at Columbia University by full-time faculty. The first year of classes consists of the same core curriculum as the Full-Time MBA program. Executive education is the focus of the second year. This Friday/Saturday program is targeted at individuals with approximately 10 years of work experience.\n\nThe Executive MBA (EMBA) Saturday Program is a 24-month graduate degree program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education, but cannot take any time away from work. This program is the same as the Friday/Saturday program, with the exception that classes only meet on Saturdays over a longer period of time.\n\nIn addition to the New York-based EMBA Program, Columbia offers three partner programs to meet the differing needs and geographical distribution of prospective students. Because students in the partner EMBA programs must satisfy the separate requirements of each school, they earn an MBA degree from each participating university. Likewise, they become alumni of each university and business school and may avail themselves of all programs and privileges afforded to alumni.\n\n\n\nColumbia Business School offers three separate Master of Science degrees in Management Science & Engineering, Financial Economics and Marketing. Admission to the programs is extremely competitive: in 2011, there were 543 applicants to the Financial Economics program and only 10 students were accepted.\n\nThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and is administered by the Business School. Admission is highly competitive with 894 applicants in 2010 for positions in an entering class of 18 students (2%). A PhD in Management or Business is a common precursor to an academic career in business schools.\n\nThroughout the program, students become familiar with research methods and the literature of their major fields through research projects and directed reading. Doctoral candidates begin the program mastering basic research tools by studying subjects such as economics, behavioral science and quantitative methods, in addition to completing course work and examinations in the major field of study. The completion of course work and qualifying examinations normally requires two to three years.\n\nThe research phase begins as early as the first year, when students serve as research assistants, and continues throughout their time at the School. Students gradually become more involved in the design and execution of research and, by the end of the second year, have typically produced at least one paper suitable for publication, often as coauthor with a faculty member. The later years of the program are dedicated to original research and the creation of the dissertation.\n\nRecent Columbia Ph.D. program graduates have placed in the following institutions: Harvard Business School, Wharton School, \nLondon Business School, Kellogg School of Management, Cornell University, University of Notre Dame, Stern School of Business, University of Minnesota, Fordham University, Polytechnic University, Baruch College, University of Washington, EWHA Womans University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Toronto, IAE Business and Management School, Universidad Austral, and University of Texas at Austin.\n\nColumbia Business School Executive Education offers custom non-degree programs for organizations and open-enrollment non-degree programs for individuals in topics including management, finance, leadership, marketing, social enterprise, and strategy. The school also offers executive certification programs, including the Advanced Management Program, the Certificate in Business Excellence and the Senior Leaders Program for Nonprofit Professionals.\n\nThe Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) is awarded to students who complete a total of 18 program days of executive education within a four-year period. Any executive education program at Columbia Business School can be applied toward the completion of the certificate.\nRecipients of the CIBE are granted full alumni status with Columbia Business School, including the following alumni benefits:\n\nResearch centers, special programs, institutes, and cross-disciplinary areas at Columbia Business School include:\n\n\nColumbia Business School employs 136 full-time faculty members, including Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 Nobel laureate in economics who also teaches at the university's School of International and Public Affairs; and Bernd Schmitt, the Robert D. Calkins Professor of International Business. The current Dean is the former Presidential Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Glenn Hubbard. Hedge fund gurus Joel Greenblatt and Ken Shubin Stein are currently adjunct professors. Bruce Greenwald teaches Value Investing and Economics of Strategic Behavior electives. Adam Dell, brother of Dell Inc. CEO Michael Dell, is a venture capitalist who teaches Business Innovation and Technology. Jonathan Knee teaches Media, Mergers, and Acquisitions and is the author of a book titled \"The Accidental Investment Banker\". James Freeman teaches Investment Banking and is the CEO of a boutique investment bank by the same name. Frederic Mishkin, member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, returned to teach at CBS starting fall 2008. Rita Gunther McGrath is a well known member of the strategy faculty and the author of four books on the subject, most recently \"The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast As Your Business\" (2013, Harvard Business Review Publishing) Steve Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class that he teaches a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup \n\nColumbia Business School has over 44,000 living alumni.

{"id": "42166505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42166505", "title": "Constantin Beldie", "text": "Constantin Beldie\n\nConstantin Dumitru Beldie (September 8, 1887 – June 11, 1954) was a Romanian journalist, publicist, and civil servant, famous for his libertine lifestyle and his unapologetic, sarcastic, memoirs of life in the early 20th century. After modest but happy beginnings in life, Beldie played a small but essential part in the promotion of literary modernism, building bridges between the mainstream and the avant-garde. He became a pioneer of cultural journalism at \"Noua Revistă Română\", before moving on to \"Ideea Europeană\" and ultimately \"Cuvântul\", befriending (and secretly resenting) philosopher-journalist Nae Ionescu. Like Ionescu, he promoted a vitalistic perspective on society and culture, veering into antiintellectualism after 1918.\n\nWhile working in the field of journalism and cultural criticism, Beldie advanced through the ranks of the bureaucracy, and held several important assignments between 1919 and 1935. He was the lover of female journalist Cora Irineu, and was possibly responsible for her suicide in 1924. This was only one of his many philandering affairs, some of them discussed in Beldie's own recollections of the period. These politically-charged manuscripts were published, with a noted delay, in 2000.\n\nBorn in Bucharest, Beldie grew up in the \"mahala\" of Gorgani, just south of Cișmigiu Gardens. He was a second-generation Bucharester, with his paternal family stemming from the western province of Oltenia. On that side, he descended from an old line of \"pandur\" rebels, called \"Beldie\", \"Băldan\", or \"Pietraru\". His great-grandfather Nicolae, Beldie recalled, participated in the 1821 uprising, only to betray the revolutionary cause, and then settled with other renegade \"pandurs\" on the Vâlsan River floodplain. His grandfather, Ghiță Beldie, resided in Stroeștii Argeșului, but traded in \"țuică\" all over the Argeș River valley.\n\nBeldie's father, Dumitru, left the impoverished countryside for a life in the city; his father and brothers, however, were committed to the a peasant life, and benefited from the land reforms. Dumitru, a restaurant owner, was a sympathizer of socialism, acquainted with a number of prominent contemporary Romanians. Young Beldie received a progressive education, which even included enrollment in pre-kindergarten. He was later given private lessons in French, German and English, in addition to attending school, and took classes in dance and bicycling.\n\nHowever, Beldie grew up mainly on the streets, describing life in the half-rural Bucharest of his youth as \"patriarchal, lazy, prosperous and good-to-all\". His summers were spent in the countryside, traveling with Ghiță Beldie on the trade route between Vâlsan region and Bucharest. He observed Westernization and urbanization as a bohemian outsider, commenting sarcastically on the universal spread of petty corruption and lassitude. Beldie went to the Saint Sava National College, followed by the Gheorghe Șincai Gymnasium. His time in school was an annoyance, and he twice failed to get his remove, passing his finishing exams in private. He would later complain of the corporal punishments he received in class, and that Saint Sava \"did not teach us anything, did not urge us to accomplish anything\".\n\nBeldie took a break from schooling, and worked various odd jobs, notably as a clerk in a medical laboratory, a choir singer for the Metropolitan Church, and a village teacher. One of Constantin Rădulescu-Motru's closest collaborators, in 1908 he became a secretary at the latter's magazine \"Noua Revistă Română\", remaining there until 1916. This period introduced Beldie to the Europeanist ideology of Rădulescu-Motru and Ion Trivale, who criticized the nationalist stances of schools such as Poporanism and \"Sămănătorul\"; Rădulescu-Motru struck Beldie as \"wise\" and \"kind\", but too pedantic when it came to assessing art. He also quickly learned the editing and typographical trades, as well as the administrative tasks involved in preparing a magazine.\n\nSoon, Beldie became a close observer of the day's literary and scientific milieu, reviewing the correspondence exchanged between \"Noua Revistă Română\" and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. As a literary chronicler and LTTE recipient, he helped discover writers such as Tudor Arghezi, George Bacovia, and Felix Aderca. He personally intervened to have Aderca's poems published in \"Noua Revistă Română\" (1913), but was much annoyed by Aderca's \"contentious and categorical\" nature. Allegedly, Beldie also met the literary innovator and prankster Urmuz. Beldie also worked on and off as a translator of French literature for Alcaly Publishers, whose Jewish Romanian owner, he recalled, was utterly illiterate. He became passionate about J. Barbey d'Aurevilly, Charles Baudelaire, Anatole France, Remy de Gourmont, Jean Moréas, Jean Richepin, and Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. In 1915, he translated and prefaced Villiers' \"Le secret de l'échafaud\".\n\nWith such professional credentials, Beldie was asked to contribute on other publishing projects, and became close to the burgeoning Symbolist movement. He met and befriended, or quarreled with, a host of Symbolists and post-Symbolists, leaving characterological notes on Adrian Maniu, N. Davidescu, Emil Isac, and Mihail Sorbul. Together with I. Dragoslav, he was one of the non-Symbolists involved with Ion Minulescu's Symbolist tribune, \"Insula\". Like the younger Symbolists, Beldie also took a keen interest in avant-garde aesthetics. He claimed to have played a personal part in bringing Expressionism to Romania, but was perplexed by Cubism, and declared himself unconvinced by Marinetti's Futurism. He not only disliked Futurism, but contended that its promoters at \"Noua Revistă Română\", including Ramiro Ortiz, were Italian proto-fascist nationalists and agents of influence.\n\nAnother one of his new friends was Nae Ionescu, with whom he would quarrel and reunite several times before 1940. According to Beldie's own testimony, they were both intrepid womanizers and self-seekers. Ionescu, Beldie claims, was \"not taken seriously\" as an author, mainly because \"he wouldn't take himself seriously\". The \"Gypsy-like knave\" Ionescu was, according to Beldie, \"a loser before it was his time to lose\". Joining their circle were Aderca and Maniu. Both of them, Beldie claims, squandered their talent on artistically irrelevant, lucrative, work.\n\nBeldie himself was notorious for his hedonism, later confessing: \"I have been a philanderer by nature all my life, but I was not a jealous one.\" He also admitted having been a confidant of women, \"their comrade and blood-brother\", and of thus receiving their sexual favors, but also claimed to have participated in at least one public sex orgy. He was a long-haired dandy with \"languid eyes\", taking special care in his appearance, which included such fashionable items as a Panama or a bowler hat, celluloid collar, a frock coat, nacre buttons, and a walking cane.\n\nDespite his libertine outlook, on July 29, 1910 Beldie married the actress Eugenia Gh. Ionescu, with whom he lived on Schitul Maicilor Street, Bucharest. On August 29, 1912, Eugenia gave birth to a son, Alexandru \"Puiu\" Beldie. This did not prevent Beldie from pursuing other women. Enrolling at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Philosophy and Literature, he met Cora Irineu, who became passionately in love with him, and whom Beldie helped introduce to literary life. Eventually graduating in 1912, Beldie was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces during the Second Balkan War. He was a teacher from 1913 to 1947 in the fields of Romanian language, professional education and project management.\n\nBeldie was again drafted into the Land Forces for the World War I Romanian campaign (1916-1918). During this time, his dislike of formalism had matured into vitalism and antiintellectualism. As Beldie later put it, the Romanian intellectual class had the artistic tastes of \"prostitutes\", being virtually incapable of producing \"an original idea of its own\". The youth, given to the \"drunkenness twinned with whoring\", would only read the football pages of \"Gazeta Sporturilor\". Its \"intellectual and moral crisis\", Beldie claimed, had to do with \"organic weakness\", \"exotic\" intellectual habits, but also with \"an insufficient training or an all-too-early lassitude\".\n\nThe ideological stance fueled Beldie's 1918 essay \"Glossa spiritului cărturăresc\" (\"Gloss on the Bookish Spirit\") as well as, attributively, the aphorisms published as \"Ce vrem? Catechism pentru suflete nehotărîte\" (\"What Is It We Want? A Catechism for Indecisive Souls\"). Both were came out with Yellow Books (\"Cărți Galbene\"), an imprint of Editura Minerva, and were seen by reviewers of the day as illustrating \"a heroic concept of life\". According to critic Gheorghe Grigurcu, Beldie should be regarded as an immediate but \"modest\" precursor for Ionescu's own brand of philosophic vitalism, or \"Trăirism\". To contemporary readers, he appeared more like an inconsistent follower of pragmatism, in the vein of William James.\n\nInstead of intellectualism, Beldie proposed a new brand of elitism and, historian Adrian Majuru notes, saw his as \"a solitary life among the idiots\". In \"Catechism\", Beldie declared that: \"There is no greater misfortune than when the strongest people on earth are not also the most obeyed by mankind. Because then all things are false, monstrous, and everything runs backwards.\" He advised youth not to be ashamed of \"their weaknesses, their tics, and their passions\", suggesting that \"they provide one's life with color, freshness, and the picturesque.\"\n\nIn 1919, Beldie became editorial secretary at another of Rădulescu-Motru's magazines, \"Ideea Europeană\", which took over the old offices of \"Noua Revistă Română\". This allowed him to organize a series of conferences held in various cities by, among others, Nae Ionescu, Ortiz, Irineu, Octav Onicescu, Mircea Florian, Virgil Bărbat, and Emanoil Bucuța. At the time, he became close friends with another \"Ideea Europeană\" contributor, the Jewish essayist Henric Sanielevici. Beldie was not especially visible in this company of intellectuals, but contributed a rather popular satirical column, \"Aplauze și fluierături\" (\"Applause and Heckling\"), and put to bed each printed issue. He soon began his affair with Irineu, leaving with her on official assignments to Transylvania. To the irritation of his \"Ideea Europeană\" friends, these trips turned into sexual escapades, with both Beldie and Irineu neglecting their real tasks. In 1922, Irineu left alone for an extended trip in Banat area, while Beldie stated behind in Bucharest. The letters he received from her convinced him that she was an outstanding reporter, and, on this basis, he pruned their content and published them as a separate column in \"Ideea Europeană\".\n\nFrom around 1919, Beldie was also working as a teacher at the Superior School for Arts and Crafts, in Bucharest. Having served as department head for the Social Reform Society (1919-1924), under sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, he was at the time a commercial director at Centrala Cărții publishing house and director of Editura Cultura Națională (1924-1928). As Beldie later recounted, this assignment pitied him against Nae Ionescu: according to Beldie, Ionescu was responsible for a major fraud, which he tried to pin down on Centrala Cărții. While at Cultura Națională, he arranged Irineu's letters for publishing as a volume.\n\nOn February 11, 1924, Irineu committed suicide by revolver. This was due either to Beldie's philandering (which probably caused some of his other lovers to kill themselves) or, as he asserts in his memoirs, a family illness that also claimed several of her siblings. Another version has it that she was driven to despair when Beldie intervened between her and her other admirer, Bucuța. Beldie arranged for her burial at Bellu cemetery, and put out a final version of her letters and essays.\n\nWith Rădulescu-Motru, Beldie frequented the salon of Alexandrina Cantacuzino. They joined her Union of Intellectuals club in 1926, but Beldie left sarcastic notes about the intellectual abilities of its other members. \"Ideea Europeană\" ceased publication in 1928. That year, Beldie became director of \"Cuvântul\" daily, headed by Ionescu—who, in 1930, joined the camarilla surrounding the authoritarian King, Carol II. Beldie himself became head of Imprimeria Națională (1930-1932), before becoming assistant director and then director for the census (1930-1932), in which capacity he was well paid. He was eventually head of Loteria de Stat (1932-1935).\n\nIn 1933, Ionescu defected to the Iron Guard, a fascist movement opposed to Carol II. As documented by Beldie, his wealth grew over the coming years, as he became the representative of Nazi-linked IG Farben in Romania, and included villas in Băneasa and Balcic and a Mercedes-Benz car with a chauffeur paid by the firm. Beldie, instead, retired from public life. He was embittered by Ionescu's politics, describing him as a \"ham actor\" on the far right and religious scene, a figure of \"turpitude, cynicism, amorality\".\n\nDuring World War II and the early years of the Romanian communist regime, Beldie lived in relative obscurity. From his retirement at age sixty until his death, he had financial difficulties and had to work as a proofreader for various publishers, eventually being forced to sell his personal book collection. During the early 1950s, Beldie began compiling and reviewing his scattered memoirs, in samizdat form. He only gave private readings, and was hailed by critic Vladimir Streinu, who attended such events, as Romania's answer to Saint-Simon. To minimize the risk of communist arrest and imprisonment, Beldie only dealt with the more distant past, with the notable exception of his chapter on Arghezi. This portion, which was not read in front of Arghezi, claimed that Arghezi was a compulsive liar, and discussed in detail the issue of his uncertain family origins.\n\nBeldie was supported morally and financially by old literary friends, including Arghezi and literary critic Tudor Vianu, who greatly enjoyed reading fragments from the work. He visited the house of another literary promoter, Șerban Cioculescu, his portrait picture prominently displayed in the lobby. Working clandestinely and under Securitate surveillance, Cioculescu collected memoirs of the previous regime; he organized reunions at which Beldie met other such late debutants, including politician Petre Ghiață and former counterespionage operative George \"Geacă\" Borneanu.\n\nBeldie was survived by his son Alexandru, whom he had educated in accordance with \"Glossa spiritului cărturăresc\", encouraging him to take up mountaineering. Beldie Jr became a distinguished dendrologist, forestry engineer, and environmentalist. Like his father before him, he was also a bohemian. He fought on the Eastern Front and spent 1944-1945 as a prisoner of war in Oranki, before returning to teach in Romania. He was married thrice, but had no children.\n\nBeldie looked forward to the promise of liberalization, believing that his bitter memoirs would eventually be given imprimatur by the communist authorities. He was worried that they would never be published in full, so he asked his literary friends, including Arghezi, Vianu, Cioculescu, and Perpessicius, to make sure no part of them went missing. Alexandru Beldie, underpromoted in his field of work because of his anticommunism and structural nonconformity, then forcefully retired, took up the task of raising awareness of his father's samizdat work. He preserved the manuscripts and, in the 1970s, presented them to Zigu Ornea, director of Editura Minerva. Although Ornea gave his approval, the memoirs were blocked from publication by communist censors, due to a chapter on Nae Ionescu. Despite the chapter's sharply critical tone, the regime's policy was not to publish any mention of Ionescu. After the 1989 Revolution, Ornea and Nicolae Manolescu arranged for the Ionescu chapter to be published in \"România Literară\".\n\nThe work only appeared in 2000, with Editura Albatros. As critics note, they were only printed in an altered form—with the Ionescu chapter conspicuously absent, probably cut out from the manuscript entirely. According to Ornea, this may be because Ionescu disciple Dan Zamfirescu, who reviewed the manuscripts for publishing at his own Editura Roza Vânturilor, wanted them lost. In 2005, however, Zamfirescu published \"Oameni văzuți de aproape\" (\"People Seen from Up Close\"), which reputedly covers the previously abridged part of Beldie's memoirs, and features notes that often challenge Beldie's account.\n\nAlexandru Beldie died on June 4, 2003, some 3 years after the original book saw print, in what his colleagues describe as undeserved anonymity. Constantin's memoirs were enjoying the attention of literary critics, including Dan C. Mihăilescu, who reviewed them together with a mass of recovered samizdats.\n\n"}

After the end of Soviet rule, reforms were established that required nationals to receive a basic education over 10 years, followed by enrollment in a technical school or an institution of higher learning.\n\nThe lowest grade (mark) in the Moldovan educational system is 1, the highest is 10. To pass a course, a subject, or an exam, the student must obtain a mark of 5 or above.\n\nAs of 2007-2008 academic year, Moldova had ten types of primary and secondary schools:\n\nIn Moldova, there are 16 state and 15 private institutions of higher education, with a total of 126,100 students, including 104,300 in the state institutions, and 21,700 in the private ones. The number of students per 10,000 inhabitants in Moldova has been constantly growing since the collapse of the Soviet Union, reaching 217 in 2000-2001, and 351 in 2005-2006. \n\nThere are 6,200 faculty members in Moldova's universities, institutes and academies (on average 1 faculty member per 20.3 students). Out of these, only 2,700 (43%) hold PhD degrees, including 358 (5.8%) that also hold the highest academic degree:\nHabilitation. Moldovan faculty members usually teach around 20 hours per week (one of the highest workloads in the world).\n\n52.5% of students major in economics, law, social sciences, or in some fields that the Moldovan Ministry of Education calls on its website \"professional formation fields\", 18.4% study engineering and architecture, 16.0% - education. There are a total of 90 specialities (majors) offered.\n\n101,100 students, or 80.2%, pay for their studies (from 2,000 to 7,300 Moldovan lei per year, i.e. from 120 to 430 euros per year). The state is trying to increase the number of places offered free of charge when students are admitted to public universities: there were 5,085 in 2001, 5,290 in 2002, 5,628 in 2003, 6,354 in 2004, 7,048 in 2005, 7,835 in 2006, but this rate (54% over 5 years) is lower than the rate of increase (65% over the same period) in the total number of places. 15% of the free of charge places are reserved, and distributed to candidates from low-income families. In an effort to support them, the state gives scholarships to 70% of students who occupy the free of charge places, i.e. to 14.4% of the total number of students. As of January 1, 2006, these scholarships are in three categories: 210, 230, or 270 Moldovan lei per month, i.e. 12, 14, or 16 euros per month respectively. \n\n78.4% of students study in Romanian, roughly corresponding to its respective linguistic group, while 19.5% study in Russian (including members of other linguistic groups like Gagauz or Bulgarian). Foreign languages became increasingly less popular in recent years: 1.8% studied in English or French during the 2010-2011 schoolyear, compared to 3.2% in 2006.\n\nThe National Council on Accreditation and Attestation is an organization that approves the examination programs for doctoral students, confers scientific degrees, and scientific and pedagogical ranks. The Council publishes online all PhD theses that are elaborated and defended in Moldova.\n\n\n\nAt present, the graduates get two types of diplomas: one type for fulfilling the curriculum and the \"Licence\" examination, and a second type, if in addition they write a Licence Diploma paper.\nThe Ministry of Education defines its strategic objective for higher education to be \"the integration into the European common space for higher education, and active participation in its construction\". In 2005 Moldova signed the commitment to implement the Bologna process agreements. In view of this, several changes have been operated since:\n\nThe Ministry of Education's declared objectives in taking these actions are:\n\nThe quality of the higher education has been declared a priority. In this context, a prime priority is declared to the implementation of the \"National Framework of Qualifications for Professional Formation\", which will determine the \"educational finalities and competences\", the \"compulsory minimum of realization in higher education\", and will somehow facilitate the rise in \"the quality of the preparation of graduates for the national economy\", and will also somehow contribute to \"ensuring the continuous rise of the quality of education\".\n\nUniversities and colleges are told to start creating own \"systems of internal management of quality\", with the aim of \"organizing the internal process of ensuring the quality, in accordance with national standards, and the demands of external evaluation systems\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2024825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2024825", "title": "Elizabeth Blackwell", "text": "Elizabeth Blackwell\n\nElizabeth Blackwell (February 3, 1821 – May 31, 1910) was a British physician, notable as the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, and the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. Elizabeth Blackwell played an important role in both the United States and the United Kingdom as a social and moral reformer. She acted as a pioneer in promoting the education of women in medicine. Elizabeth Blackwell's contributions remain celebrated through an Elizabeth Blackwell medal that is awarded to one woman every year who has added to the cause of promoting women in medicine. Furthermore, Hobart and William Smith College recently created a statue on their campus honoring Elizabeth Blackwell. \n\nElizabeth Blackwell was initially uninterested in a career in medicine especially after her schoolteacher brought in a bull's eye to use as a teaching tool. Therefore, she became a schoolteacher in order to support her family. This occupation was seen as suitable for women during the 1800s, however, being a schoolteacher did not interest Blackwell. Blackwell's motivation to go into medicine came after her friend fell ill and suggested that if a female doctor had cared for her, she might not have suffered so much. Blackwell began to apply to medical schools, however, she endured a lot of prejudice due to her gender. She was rejected from all the medical schools she applied to except Geneva Medical College. In 1847 Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the United States. \n\nElizabeth Blackwell had her inaugural thesis on typhoid fever published in the \"Buffalo Medical Journal\" right after she graduated college in 1849. This article was the first medical article published by a female student from the United States. Her article portrayed a strong sense of empathy and sensitivity to human suffering as well as a strong desire for social and economic justice. This point of view was considered very feminine. Furthermore, in 1857, Blackwell also opened up the New York Infirmary for Women and Children with her sister Emily. She also gave lectures to women about the importance of educating girls. \n\nElizabeth was born on February 3, 1821, in Bristol, England to Samuel Blackwell, who was a sugar refiner, and his wife Hannah (Lane) Blackwell. She had two older siblings, Anna and Marian, and would eventually have six younger siblings: Samuel (married Antoinette Brown), Henry (married Lucy Stone), Emily (third woman in the U.S. to get a medical degree), Sarah Ellen (a writer), John and George. She also had four maiden aunts: Barbara, Ann, Lucy, and Mary, who also lived with them. \n\nIn 1832, the family emigrated from Bristol, England to New York because Samual Blackwell had lost their most profitable sugar refinery to a fire. In New York, her father became active in abolitionist work. Therefore, their dinnertime discussions often surrounded issues such as women's rights, slavery, and child labor. These liberal discussions reflected Hannah and Samual's attitudes toward child rearing. For example, rather than beating the children for bad behavior, Barbara Blackwell recorded their trespasses in a black book. If the offenses accumulated, the children would be exiled to the attic during dinner. Samual Blackwell was similarly liberal in his attitude towards the education of his children. Samuel Blackwell was a Congregationalist and exerted a strong influence over the religious and academic education of his children. He believed that each child, including his girls, should be given the opportunity for unlimited development of their talents and gifts. This perspective was rare during that time, as most people believed that the women's place was in the home or as a schoolteacher. Blackwell had not only a governess, but private tutors to supplement her intellectual development. As a result, she was rather socially isolated from all but her family as she grew up.  \n\nA few years after the family moved to New York, the family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. When Blackwell was 17 her father passed away, leaving the family with very little money.  \n\nThe Blackwells' financial situation was unfortunate. Pressed by financial need, the sisters Anna, Marian and Elizabeth started a school, \"The Cincinnati English and French Academy for Young Ladies\", which provided instruction in most, if not all, subjects and charged for tuition and room and board. The school was not terribly innovative in its education methods – it was merely a source of income for the Blackwell sisters. Blackwell's abolition work took a back seat during these years, most likely due to the academy.\n\nBlackwell converted to Episcopalianism, probably due to her sister Anna's influence, in December 1838, becoming an active member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church. However, William Henry Channing's arrival in 1839 to Cincinnati changed her mind. Channing, a charismatic Unitarian minister, introduced the ideas of transcendentalism to Blackwell, who started attending the Unitarian Church. A conservative backlash from the Cincinnati community ensued, and as a result, the academy lost many pupils and was abandoned in 1842. Blackwell began teaching private pupils.\n\nChanning's arrival renewed Blackwell's interests in education and reform. She worked at intellectual self-improvement: studying art, attending various lectures, writing short stories and attending various religious services in all denominations (Quaker, Millerite, Jewish). In the early 1840s, she began to articulate thoughts about women's rights in her diaries and letters and participated in the Harrison political campaign of 1840.\n\nIn 1844, with the help of her sister Anna, Blackwell procured a teaching job that paid $1,000 per year in Henderson, Kentucky. Although she was pleased with her class, she found the accommodations and schoolhouse lacking. What disturbed her most was that this was her first real encounter with the realities of slavery. \"Kind as the people were to me personally, the sense of justice was continually outraged; and at the end of the first term of engagement I resigned the situation.\" She returned to Cincinnati only half a year later, resolved to find a more stimulating way to spend her life.\n\nOnce again, through her sister Anna, Blackwell procured a job, this time teaching music at an academy in Asheville, North Carolina, with the goal of saving up the $3,000 necessary for her medical school expenses. In Asheville, Blackwell lodged with the respected Reverend John Dickson, who happened to have been a physician before he became a clergyman. Dickson approved of Blackwell's career aspirations and allowed her to use the medical books in his library to study. During this time, Blackwell soothed her own doubts about her choice and her loneliness with deep religious contemplation. She also renewed her antislavery interests, starting a slave Sunday school that was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nDickson's school closed down soon after, and Blackwell moved to the residence of Reverend Dickson's brother, Samuel Henry Dickson, a prominent Charleston physician. She started teaching in 1846 at a boarding school in Charleston run by a Mrs. Du Pré. With the help of Reverend Dickson's brother, Blackwell inquired into the possibility of medical study via letters, with no favorable responses. In 1847, Blackwell left Charleston for Philadelphia and New York, with the aim of personally investigating the opportunities for medical study. Blackwell's greatest wish was to be accepted into one of the Philadelphia medical schools.\n\nUpon reaching Philadelphia, Blackwell boarded with Dr. William Elder and studied anatomy privately with Dr. Jonathan M. Allen as she attempted to get her foot in the door at any medical school in Philadelphia. She was met with resistance almost everywhere. Most physicians recommended that she either go to Paris to study or that she take up a disguise as a man to study medicine. The main reasons offered for her rejection were that (1) she was a woman and therefore intellectually inferior, and (2) she might actually prove equal to the task, prove to be competition, and that she could not expect them to \"furnish [her] with a stick to break our heads with\". Out of desperation, she applied to twelve \"country schools\".\n\nIn October 1847, Blackwell was accepted as a medical student by Hobart College, then called Geneva Medical College, located in upstate New York. The dean and faculty, usually responsible for evaluating an applicant for matriculation, were not able to make a decision due to the special nature of Blackwell's case. They put the issue up to a vote by the 150 male students of the class with the stipulation that if one student objected, Blackwell would be turned away. The young men voted unanimously to accept her.\n\nWhen Blackwell arrived at the college, she was rather nervous. Nothing was familiar – the surroundings, the students, and the faculty. She did not even know where to get her books. However, she soon found herself at home in medical school. While she was at school, she was looked upon as an oddity by the townspeople of Geneva. She also rejected suitors and friends alike, preferring to isolate herself. In the summer between her two terms at Geneva, she returned to Philadelphia, stayed with Dr. Elder, and applied for medical positions in the area to gain clinical experience. The Guardians of the Poor, the city commission that ran Blockley Almshouse, granted her permission to work there, albeit not without some struggle. Blackwell slowly gained acceptance at Blockley, although some young resident physicians still would walk out and refuse to assist her in diagnosing and treating her patients. During her time there, Blackwell gained valuable clinical experience but was appalled by the syphilitic ward and those afflicted with typhus. Her graduating thesis at Geneva Medical College was on the topic of typhus. The conclusion of this thesis linked physical health with socio-moral stability – a link that foreshadows her later reform work.\n\nOn January 23, 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to achieve a medical degree in the United States. The local press reported her graduation favorably, and when the dean, Dr. Charles Lee, conferred her degree, he stood up and bowed to her.\n\nIn April, 1849, Blackwell made the decision to continue her studies in Europe. She visited a few hospitals in Britain and then headed to Paris. Her experience there was similar to her experience in America; she was rejected by many hospitals because of her gender. In June, Blackwell enrolled at La Maternité; a \"lying-in\" hospital, under the condition that she would be treated as a student midwife, not a physician. She made the acquaintance of Hippolyte Blot, a young resident physician at \"La Maternité\". She gained much medical experience through his mentoring and training. By the end of the year, Paul Dubois, the foremost obstetrician in his day, had voiced his opinion that she would make the best obstetrician in the United States, male or female.\n\nOn 4 November 1849, when Blackwell was treating an infant with ophthalmia neonatorum, she spurted some contaminated solution into her own eye accidentally and contracted the infection. She lost sight in her left eye, causing her to have her eye surgically extracted and thus lost all hope of becoming a surgeon. After a period of recovery, she enrolled at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1850. She regularly attended James Paget's lectures. She made a positive impression there, although she did meet some opposition when she tried to observe the wards.\n\nFeeling that the prejudice against women in medicine was not as strong there, Blackwell returned to New York City in 1851 with the hope of establishing her own practice.\n\nStateside, Blackwell was faced with adversity, but did manage to get some media support from entities such as the \"New-York Tribune\". She had very few patients, a situation she attributed to the stigma of women doctors as abortionists. In 1852, she began delivering lectures and published \"The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls\", her first work, a volume about the physical and mental development of girls that concerned itself with the preparation of young women for motherhood.\n\nIn 1853, Blackwell established a small dispensary near Tompkins Square. She also took Marie Zakrzewska, a Polish woman pursuing a medical education, under her wing, serving as her preceptor in her pre-medical studies. In 1857, Dr. Marie Zakrzewska, along with Blackwell and her sister Emily, who had also obtained a medical degree, expanded Blackwell's original dispensary into the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. Women served on the board of trustees, on the executive committee and as attending physicians. The institution accepted both in- and outpatients and served as a nurse's training facility. The patient load doubled in the second year.\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out, the Blackwell sisters aided in nursing efforts. Blackwell sympathized heavily with the North due to her abolitionist roots, and even went so far as to say she would have left the country if the North had compromised on the subject of slavery. However, Blackwell did meet with some resistance on the part of the male-dominated United States Sanitary Commission. The male physicians refused to help with the nurse education plan if it involved the Blackwells. In response to the USSC, Blackwell organized with the Woman's Central Relief Association. The WCRA worked against the problem of uncoordinated benevolence, but ultimately was absorbed by the USSC. Still, the New York Infirmary managed to work with Dorothea Dix to train nurses for the Union effort.\n\nBlackwell made several trips back to Britain to raise funds and to try to establish a parallel infirmary project there. In 1858, under a clause in the Medical Act of 1858 that recognised doctors with foreign degrees practicing in Britain before 1858, she was able to become the first woman to have her name entered on the General Medical Council's medical register (1 January 1859). She also became a mentor to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson during this time. By 1866, nearly 7,000 patients were being treated per year at the New York Infirmary, and Blackwell was needed back in the United States. The parallel project fell through, but in 1868, a medical college for women adjunct to the infirmary was established. It incorporated Blackwell's innovative ideas about medical education – a four-year training period with much more extensive clinical training than previously required.\n\nAt this point, a rift occurred between Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell. Both were extremely headstrong, and a power struggle over the management of the infirmary and medical college ensued. Elizabeth, feeling slightly alienated by the United States women's medical movement, left for Britain to try to establish medical education for women there. In July 1869, she sailed for Britain.\n\nIn 1874, Blackwell established a women's medical school in London with Sophia Jex-Blake, who had been a student at the New York Infirmary years earlier. Blackwell had doubts about Jex-Blake and thought that she was dangerous, belligerent, and tactless. Nonetheless, Blackwell became deeply involved with the school, and it opened in 1874 as the London School of Medicine for Women, with the primary goal of preparing women for the licensing exam of Apothecaries Hall. Blackwell vehemently opposed the use of vivisections in the laboratory of the school.\n\nAfter the establishment of the school, Blackwell lost much of her authority to Jex-Blake and was elected as a lecturer in midwifery. She resigned this position in 1877, officially retiring from her medical career.\n\nWhile Blackwell viewed medicine as a means for social and moral reform, her student Mary Putnam Jacobi focused on curing disease. At a deeper level of disagreement, Blackwell felt that women would succeed in medicine because of their humane female values, but Jacobi believed that women should participate as the equals of men in all medical specialties.\n\nAfter leaving for Britain in 1869, Blackwell diversified her interests, and was active both in social reform and authorship. She co-founded the National Health Society in 1871. She perceived herself as a wealthy gentlewoman who had the leisure to dabble in reform and in intellectual activities – the income from her American investments supported her. She was rather occupied with her social status, and her friend, Barbara Bodichon helped introduce Blackwell into her circles. She travelled across Europe many times during these years, in England, France, Wales, Switzerland and Italy.\n\nHer greatest period of reform activity was after her retirement from the medical profession, from 1880–1895. Blackwell was interested in a great number of reform movements – mainly moral reform, sexual purity, hygiene and medical education, but also preventative medicine, sanitation, eugenics, family planning, women's rights, associationism, Christian socialism, medical ethics and antivivisection – none of which ever came to real fruition. She switched back and forth between many different reform organisations, trying to maintain a position of power in each. Blackwell had a lofty, elusive and ultimately unattainable goal: evangelical moral perfection. All of her reform work was along this thread. She even contributed heavily to the founding of two utopian communities: Starnthwaite and Hadleigh in the 1880s.\n\nShe believed that the Christian morality ought to play as large a role as scientific inquiry in medicine and that medical schools ought to instruct students in this basic truth. She also was antimaterialist and did not believe in vivisections. She did not see the value of inoculation and thought it dangerous. She believed that bacteria were not the only important cause of disease and felt their importance was being exaggerated.\n\nShe campaigned heavily against licentiousness, prostitution and contraceptives, arguing instead for the rhythm method. She campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Acts, arguing that it was a pseudo-legalisation of prostitution. Her 1878 \"Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of their Children\" was an essay on prostitution and marriage arguing against the Contagious Diseases Acts. She was conservative in all senses except that she believed women to have sexual passions equal to those of men, and that men and women were equally responsible for controlling those passions. Others of her time believed women to have little if any sexual passion, and placed the responsibility of moral policing squarely on the shoulders of the woman. The book was controversial, being rejected by 12 publishers, before being printed by Hatchard and Company. The proofs for the original edition were destroyed by a member of the publisher's board and a change of title was required for a new edition to be printed.\n\nBlackwell was well connected, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. She exchanged letters with Lady Byron about women's rights issues, and became very close friends with Florence Nightingale, with whom she discussed opening and running a hospital together. She remained lifelong friends with Barbara Bodichon, and met Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1883. She was close with her family, and visited her brothers and sisters whenever she could during her travels.\n\nHowever, Blackwell had a very strong personality, and was often quite acerbic in her critique of others, especially of other women. Blackwell had a falling out with Florence Nightingale after Nightingale returned from the Crimean War. Nightingale wanted Blackwell to turn her focus to training nurses, and could not see the legitimacy of training female physicians. After that, Blackwell's comments upon Florence Nightingale's publications were often highly critical. She was also highly critical of many of the women's reform and hospital organisations in which she played no role, calling some of them \"quack auspices\". Blackwell also did not get along well with her more stubborn sisters Anna and Emily, or with the women physicians she mentored after they established themselves (Marie Zakrzewska, Sophia Jex-Blake and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson). Among women at least, Blackwell was very assertive and found it difficult to play a subordinate role.\n\nIn 1856, when Blackwell was establishing the New York Infirmary, she adopted Katherine \"Kitty\" Barry (1848-1936), an Irish orphan from the House of Refuge on Randall's Island. Diary entries at the time show that she adopted Barry half out of loneliness and a feeling of obligation, and half out of a utilitarian need for domestic help. Barry was brought up as a half-servant, half-daughter.\n\nBlackwell did provide for Barry's education. She even instructed Barry in gymnastics as a trial for the theories outlined in her publication, \"The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls\". However, Blackwell never permitted Barry to develop her own interests. She didn't make an effort to introduce Barry to young men or women of her age. Barry herself was rather shy, awkward and self-conscious about her slight deafness. Barry followed Blackwell during her many trans-Atlantic moves, during her furious house hunt between 1874 and 1875, during which they moved six times, and finally to Blackwell's final home, Rock House, a small house off Exmouth Place in Hastings, Sussex, in 1879.\n\nBarry stayed with Blackwell all her life. After Blackwell's death, Barry stayed at Rock House, and then moved to Kilmun in Argyllshire, Scotland, where Blackwell was buried in the churchyard of St Munn's Parish Church. In 1920, she moved in with the Blackwells and took the Blackwell name. On her deathbed, in 1930, Barry called Blackwell her \"true love\", and requested that her ashes be buried with those of Elizabeth.\n\nNone of the five Blackwell sisters ever married. Elizabeth thought courtship games were foolish early in her life, and prized her independence. When commenting on the young men trying to court her during her time in Kentucky, she said: \"...do not imagine I am going to make myself a whole just at present; the fact is I cannot find my other half here, but only about a sixth, which would not do.\" Even during her time at Geneva Medical College, she rejected advances from a few suitors.\n\nThere was one slight controversy, however, in Blackwell's life related to her relationship with Alfred Sachs, a 26-year-old man from Virginia. He was very close with both Kitty Barry and Blackwell, and it was widely believed in 1876 that he was a suitor for Barry, who was 29 at the time. The reality was that Blackwell and Sachs were very close, so much so that Barry felt uncomfortable being around the two of them. Sachs was very interested in Blackwell, then 55 years old. Barry was in love with Sachs, and was mildly jealous of Blackwell. Blackwell thought that Sachs lived a life of dissipation and believed that she could reform him. In fact, the majority of her 1878 publication \"Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of the Children\" was based on her conversations with Sachs. Blackwell stopped correspondence with Alfred Sachs after the publication of her book.\n\nBlackwell, in her later years, was still relatively active. In 1895, she published her autobiography, \"Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women\". It was not very successful, selling fewer than 500 copies. After this publication, Blackwell slowly relinquished her public reform presence, and spent more time traveling. She visited the United States in 1906 and took her first and last car ride. Blackwell's old age was beginning to limit her activities.\n\nIn 1907, while holidaying in Kilmun, Scotland, Blackwell fell down a flight of stairs, and was left almost completely mentally and physically disabled. On 31 May 1910, she died at her home in Hastings, Sussex, after suffering a stroke that paralyzed half her body. Her ashes were buried in the graveyard of St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun, and obituaries honouring her appeared in publications such as \"The Lancet\" and \"The British Medical Journal\".\n\nThe British artist Edith Holden, whose Unitarian family were Blackwell's relatives, was given the middle name \"Blackwell\" in her honor.\n\nAfter Elizabeth Blackwell graduated from University in 1849, her thesis on typhoid fever was published in the \"Buffalo Medical Journal.\" In 1857, Blackwell opened up the New York Infirmary for Women with her younger sister Emily. At the same time, she also gave lectures to women in The United States and England about the importance of educating women and the profession of medicine for women. In the audience at one of her lectures in England, was a woman named Elizabeth Garrett Anderson who later became the first woman doctor in England in 1865. Furthermore, Blackwell played a large role during the civil war in organizing the nurses. In 1874, Blackwell worked together with Florence Nightingale, Sophia Jex-Blake, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Emily Blackwell, and Thomas Henry Huxley in order to create the first medical school for women in England called, London School of Medicine for Women. Blackwell acted as the Chair of Hygiene. Blackwell settled in England in the 1870s and continued with working on expanding the profession of medicine for women. She influenced as much as 476 women to become registered medical women in England alone. Up until her death, Blackwell worked in an active practice in Hastings, England. She still did lectures at the School of Medicine for Women. Throughout her lifetime, she authored, \"The Laws of Life in Relation to the Physical Education of Girls\", \"The Human Element in Sex, The Religion of Health,\" and \"The Moral Education of the Young in Relation.\" \n\nTwo institutions honour Elizabeth Blackwell as an alumna:\n\n\nSince 1949, the American Medical Women's Association has awarded the Elizabeth Blackwell Medal annually to a woman physician. Hobart and William Smith Colleges awards an annual Elizabeth Blackwell Award to women who have demonstrated \"outstanding service to humankind.\"\n\nIn 1973, Elizabeth Blackwell was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nThe artwork \"The Dinner Party\" features a place setting for Elizabeth Blackwell.\n\nIn 2013 the University of Bristol launched the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, Google honoured her as a doodle in recognition of her 197th birth anniversary.\n\nIn May 2018, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the former location of the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, which Elizabeth Blackwell and her sister Emily Blackwell founded.\n\nJill Platner, a jewelry designer, designed a Blackwell Collection of jewelry inspired by Elizabeth Blackwell.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5510317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5510317", "title": "Enactive interfaces", "text": "Enactive interfaces\n\nEnactive interfaces are interactive systems that allow organization and transmission of knowledge obtained through action. Examples are interfaces that couple a human with a machine to do things usually done unaided, such as shaping a three-dimensional object using multiple modality interactions with a data base, or using interactive video to allow a student to visually engage with mathematics concepts. Enactive interface design can be approached through the idea of raising awareness of affordances, that is, optimization of the awareness of possible actions available to someone using the enactive interface. This optimization involves visibility, affordance, and feedback.\n\nThe enactive interface in the figure interprets manual input and provides a response in perceptual terms in the form of images, sounds, and haptic (tactile) feedback. The system is called enactive because of the feedback loop in which the system response is decided by the user input, and the user input is driven by the perceived system responses.\n\nEnactive interfaces are new types of human-computer interface that express and transmit the enactive knowledge by integrating different sensory aspects. The driving concept of enactive interfaces is then the fundamental role of motor action for storing and acquiring knowledge (action driven interfaces). Enactive interfaces are then capable of conveying and understanding gestures of the user, in order to provide an adequate response in perceptual terms. Enactive interfaces can be considered a new step in the development of the human-computer interaction because they are characterized by a closed loop between the natural gestures of the user (efferent component of the system) and the perceptual modalities activated (afferent component). Enactive interfaces can be conceived to exploit this direct loop and the capability of recognizing complex gestures.\n\nThe development of such interfaces requires the creation of a common vision between different research areas like computer vision, haptic and sound processing, giving more attention on the motor action aspect of interaction. An example of prototypical systems that are able to introduce enactive interfaces are reactive robots, robots that are always in contact with the human hand (like current play console controllers, Wii Remote) and are capable of interpreting the human movements and guiding the human for the completion of a manipulation task.\n\nEnactive knowledge is information gained through perception–action interaction in the environment. In many aspects the enactive knowledge is more natural than the other forms both in terms of the learning process and in the way it is applied in the world. Such knowledge is inherently multimodal because it requires the co-ordination of the various senses. Two key characteristics of enactive knowledge are that it is \"experential\": it relates to doing and depends on the user's experience, and it is \"cultural\": the way of doing is itself dependent upon social aspects, attitudes, values, practices, and legacy.\n\nEnactive interfaces are related to a fundamental interaction concept that often is not exploited by existing human-computer interface technologies. As stated by cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner, the traditional interaction with the information mediated by a computer is mostly based on symbolic or iconic knowledge, and not on enactive knowledge. While in the symbolic way of learning knowledge is stored as words, mathematical symbols or other symbol systems, in the iconic stage knowledge is stored in the form of visual images, such as diagrams and illustrations that can accompany verbal information. On the other hand, enactive knowledge is a form of knowledge based on active participation, knowing by doing, by living rather than thinking.\n\nA particular form of knowledge is a \"skill\", juggling being a simple example, and the acquisition of a skill is one area where enactive knowledge is evident. The sensorimotor and cognitive activities involved in acquiring skills are tabulated by the SKILLS FP6 European skills project.\n\nMultimodal interfaces are a good candidate for the creation of \"Enactive interfaces\" because of their coordinated use of haptic, sound and vision. Such research is the main objective of the ENACTIVE Network of Excellence, a European consortium of more than 20 research laboratories that are joining their research effort for the definition, development and exploitation of enactive interfaces.\n\nThe research on enactive knowledge and enactive interfaces is the objective of the ENACTIVE Network of Excellence. A Network of Excellence is a European Community research instrument that provides fundings for the integration of the research activities of different research laboratories and institutions. The ENACTIVE NoE started in 2004 with more than 20 partners with the objective of \"the creation of a multidisciplinary research community with the aim of structuring the research on a new generation of human-computer interfaces called Enactive Interfaces.\". The aim of this NoE is not only the research on enactive interfaces by itself, but also the integration of the partners through a Virtual Laboratory and the spreading of the expertise and knowledge of the Network.\n\nSince 2004, the partners, coordinated by the PERCRO laboratory, have improved both the theoretical aspects of enaction, through seminars and the creation of a lexicon, and the technological aspects necessary for the creation of enactive interfaces. Every year the status of the ENACTIVE NoE is presented through an international conference.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the voice of this movement to relevant international bodies, in particular the European Union, the Council of Europe and UNESCO. It has consultative status with UNESCO and is recognised as an NGO partner.\n\nEuropa Nostra's network covers almost 50 countries across Europe and beyond. It is composed of over 250 member organisations (heritage associations and foundations with a combined membership of more than 5 million people), 150 associated organisations (governmental bodies, local authorities and corporations) and also 1500 individual members who directly support the mission of Europa Nostra.\n\nEuropa Nostra's main goal is to place heritage and its benefits in the mainstream of public consciousness and to make heritage a higher priority for public policy both at European and national levels. Its specific objectives are to promote, at a European level, high standards of quality in the fields of heritage conservation, architecture, urban and rural planning and to advocate a balanced and sustainable development of urban and rural, built and natural environment. Europa Nostra also seeks to highlight the importance of cultural heritage as a building block of European identity and as contributing to a strengthening sense of European citizenship.\n\nIts activities are coordinated by an International Secretariat based in The Hague (Netherlands) headed by Europa Nostra's Secretary General, Sneška Quaedvlieg-Mihailović (Netherlands/Serbia). In several countries, the International Secretariat is assisted in its tasks by country representations.\n\nEuropa Nostra's main activities are: \n\nEuropa Nostra was founded in 1963 on the initiative of Italia Nostra, as a response to the serious threat to the survival of Venice, caused by regular flooding. In 1991 it merged with the \"Internationales Burgen Institut\" (the International Castles Institute), itself created in 1949.\n\nToday, Europa Nostra is presided over by world-renowned opera singer Maestro Plácido Domingo (Spain), and its Executive President is Denis de Kergorlay (France). Previous presidents have been HRH the Infanta Doña Pilar de Borbón from Spain (2007–2009), HRH the Prince Consort of Denmark (1990–2007) and Hans de Koster from the Netherlands (1984–1990).\n\nActing as a European cultural heritage lobby, Europa Nostra seeks to secure adequate support for cultural heritage in various areas of European policy-making and funding. It advocates the need to take cultural heritage into consideration when formulating and implementing all European and national policies which have an impact – direct or indirect – on heritage. Europa Nostra also seeks to highlight the importance and the specific character of cultural heritage within the wider cultural and policy agenda of its international partners, the European Union, Council of Europe, and UNESCO.\n\nDuring its European Heritage Congress held in Amsterdam (June 2011), Europa Nostra and 27 other European and international networks and organisations active in the wider field of cultural heritage decided to set up the European Heritage Alliance 3.3.\n\nIn March 2010, Europa Nostra opened a liaison office in Brussels, whose task is to coordinate Europa Nostra's lobbying of EU institutions and other European and international bodies based in Brussels, Strasbourg and Paris.\n\nThe European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Awards reward excellence in cultural heritage conservation, ranging from the restoration of buildings and their adaptation to new uses, to urban and rural landscape rehabilitation, archaeological site interpretations, and care for art collections. Moreover, it highlights research, dedicated service to heritage conservation by individuals or organisations, and education projects related to cultural heritage. The awards are supported by the Creative Europe programme. It has been organised by Europa Nostra since 2002. \nThis awards scheme aims to promote high standards and high-quality skills in conservation practice and to stimulate trans-frontier exchange in heritage protection. By spreading the \"Power of Example\", the awards also aim to encourage further efforts and projects related to heritage throughout Europe.\n\nEuropa Nostra is the main partner of \"The Best in Heritage\", an annual presentation of awarded museum, heritage, and conservation projects, which takes place in the second part of September in the world heritage town of Dubrovnik (Croatia).\n\nEuropa Nostra supports national and international campaigns for the preservation and rescue of Europe's heritage which is in danger. In January 2013 it launched with the European Investment Bank Group, represented by the EIB Institute, the 7 Most Endangered Programme to identify endangered monuments and sites in Europe and mobilize public and private partners on a local, national and European level to find a future for those sites, working as a catalyst for action. The 7 Most Endangered sites and monuments for 2013 were selected from a shortlist of 14 prepared by an international panel that reviewed 40 nominations from member organizations from 21 countries.\n\nIn recent years, Europa Nostra has raised its voice to save endangered historic monuments, sites or landscapes in Europe such as:\n\n\nEuropa Nostra serves as a platform for exchange for those concerned with heritage conservation, education, research, communication and interpretation. It enables heritage professionals, volunteers and supporters from all over Europe and beyond to meet, debate and inspire each other. It also engages with a wider range of stakeholders, be they policy makers, other European or international networks related to heritage, students and young heritage professionals or the public at large. Europa Nostra is a partner of Wiki Loves Monuments, the Wikipedia photo contest around cultural heritage.\n\nEuropa Nostra organises an annual European Heritage Congress, including a public Forum on various heritage subjects that are of relevance to the whole of Europe. It also holds smaller-scale national, regional and local meetings and debates with heritage NGOs in different parts of Europe. In addition to this, Europa Nostra's Scientific Council organises an annual Colloquium to promote and coordinate the scientific study of ancient structures and fortified buildings in Europe.\n\nEuropa Nostra publishes an annual magazine restyled in 2010 with the name \"Heritage in Motion\" . This magazine contains articles related to cultural heritage actors and initiatives in the country or the city which hosts the annual congress of Europa Nostra. Its previous name was \"European Cultural Heritage Review\" .\n\nEuropa Nostra's Scientific Council has also published a total of 64 volumes of its \"Scientific Bulletin\".\n\nEuropa Nostra is a non-profit organisation, which is financially supported by membership fees and donations, by the European Commission and other public bodies and private supporters and sponsors.\n\nEuropa Nostra's membership is made up of different categories:\n\n\n"}

The Executive Order requires federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those with limited English proficiency (LEP), and develop and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can have meaningful access to them. It is expected that agency plans will provide for such meaningful access consistent with, and without unduly burdening, the fundamental mission of the agency. The Executive Order also requires that the Federal agencies work to ensure that recipients of Federal financial assistance provide meaningful access to their LEP applicants and beneficiaries.\n\nTo assist Federal agencies in carrying out these responsibilities, the U.S. Department of Justice issued LEP Guidance that set forth the compliance standards that recipients of Federal financial assistance must follow to ensure that their programs and activities normally provided in English are accessible to LEP persons and thus do not discriminate on the basis of national origin in violation of Title VI's prohibition against national origin discrimination.\n\n"}

{"id": "55970453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55970453", "title": "Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator", "text": "Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator\n\nFreddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator (often abbreviated to FFPS and otherwise known as Five Nights at Freddy’s 6) is a point-and-click business simulation survival horror video game created by Scott Cawthon. It is the sixth official main installment of the \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" game series. The game was released on December 4, 2017 for free on Steam and Gamejolt.\n\n\"Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator\" begins as an 8-bit game, where the player must control Freddy Fazbear, the titular character of \"Five Nights at Freddy's\", and distribute pizzas to several children. The gameplay of that section of the game eventually ends in a \"glitch\", which was input on purpose.\n\nThe game then switches to a dark room where the player faces a broken animatronic with an appearance similar to Circus Baby from \"\" (referred to as “Scrap Baby”)\".\" A voice from a cassette instructs the player to observe the animatronic and document their responses to various audio stimulations. A checklist must be filled containing the options \"no\", \"yes\", and \"unsure\". If the player feels the animatronic is about to perform a jumpscare, then they are able to subdue it using a taser. However, the animatronic loses value if it is tasered more than three times, lowering the amount of possible profit that could be obtained from it. If the player is successful in this portion of the game, they earn a cash reward. If the player is unsuccessful, no cash reward will be obtained. On the other hand, the player can refuse to salvage the animatronic, and discard it. The player must complete this task with a different animatronic after each of the first four in-game dayshifts.\n\nAn introduction cutscene featuring Tutorial Unit is shown to the player, then the game takes a turn to business simulation, where the player buys decorations for their fictional restaurant and places them around the restaurant. Buying these items can increase the atmosphere, health/safety, and entertainment standards, with the possibility of also giving them extra revenue. However, many of these items can also increase liability and lead to lawsuits which can be fought or settled, both at the cost of money. Sponsorship offers can be accepted for money but can cause audio distractions for the player later in the game. Arcade games placed in the restaurant can also be interacted with to play mini-games.\n\nThe next portion of the game sees the player using a computer to complete various tasks to maintain the restaurant. However, any dysfunctional or hostile animatronics loose in the establishment will try to attack the player. They can be stopped by shining the player's flashlight into the ventilation openings, or by using audio to lure animatronics away. The player can use a network of motion detectors to track the animatronics' movements from one location to another. Unlike the previous games in the series, all four animatronics in the game (Scrap Baby, Molten Freddy, Springtrap and Lefty) share the same behavior, as opposed to having different mechanics.\n\nNoise from the computer and primary ventilation system obscures the sounds of the animatronics' movements. The player may upgrade the office equipment to increase efficiency and reduce the noise level. In addition, the player may switch to a secondary ventilation system that runs more quietly, but is not as effective in controlling the ambient temperature. Any sponsorships accepted will cause loud advertisements to be played randomly on the computer, attracting the animatronics and making the player unable to hear them or do anything for several seconds. The day ends with the daily tasks are done and the computer is logged off.\n\nThe main game ends after six days and nights have been completed. Several different endings are possible, depending on factors such as the degree of improvement made to the pizzeria, the number of lawsuits brought against the pizzeria by customers, and whether or not the player salvaged every animatronic.\n\nThe player character is a new franchisee of the re-branded Fazbear Entertainment Inc, with headquarters in Washington County, Utah. After making an initial investment (a small room, tables & chairs, and electricity), the player is left with $100 to spend on a new restaurant. After the first night, they are encouraged to prepare for their \"ultimate test\", which is a big party on Saturday. After the day is over, the player is instructed to either complete the maintenance checklist on one of four animatronics of different origin (meeting the criteria under paragraph 4 of their contract) or throw the animatronic back in the alley where they were found being the animatronics stated above. On occasion, the animatronics may already be hiding inside the facility, having been hidden in a previously-purchased low-quality object.\n\nAfter Saturday, depending on if the player has salvaged all of the animatronics or not, the animatronic Scrap Baby tells the player that they are here to receive a gift and they will do what they are created to do (that is to lure and kill children), making her father proud of her. Cassette Man interrupts her, calling her Elizabeth and telling her that she and the other haunted animatronics are unknowingly trapped in the labyrinth of vents inside of the pizzeria. A cutscene plays, showing that the pizzeria has been set on fire with the animatronics inside; images are shown of the animatronics attempting to escape as they are destroyed by the fire. As it burns, Cassette Man (implied to be Henry from \"\") explains that the player’s attraction was made to lure the animatronics into a trap, and that the souls trapped within them would finally receive peace, with the exception of one, William Afton/Springtrap, who he tells \"the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the Devil waiting, old friend.\" He tells the player (implied to be Michael Afton) that he had planned a way out for him, but he has a feeling that the player would rather not leave. Cassette Man then talks to his daughter (implied to be Charlie from the books) who haunts the Puppet who is heavily implied to be inside of Lefty, apologizing to her for not saving her. The video feed cuts out. Another cutscene is then played, which tells the player that they have completed the work week and earned the certificate of \"Completion\".\n\nA series of alternate endings may also be achieved. If the player has not salvaged all of the animatronics, receives too many lawsuits, or becomes bankrupt, they will be fired from their job. The player may also obtain an ending where the player is deemed insane after discovering blueprints and secret information in their office following their purchase of the “Egg Baby” animatronic. In the \"insanity\" ending, Cassette Man reveals that he unwillingly helped William Afton to build the animatronics and his daughter was the first victim of Afton's mass murder.\n\nIf the player has discovered the secret endings within the \"Fruity Maze\", \"Midnight Motorist\", and \"Security Puppet\" attractions, a picture of a graveyard will appear at the end of the game, giving the player a certificate of \"Lorekeeper\" which has six gravestones with the names of Gabriel, Fritz, Susie, and Jeremy on four of them.\n\nIn June 2017, Cawthon hinted towards the development of a sixth main game in the series, with a teaser on scottgames.com showing a picture that appeared to be Circus Baby from , but later announced his decision to cancel the game and instead develop a separate installment similar to \"FNaF World\" such as a \"pizzeria tycoon\". Teasers for a new game began appearing on Cawthon's website in late 2017. On December 4, 2017, Cawthon released \"Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator\" on Steam as freeware, which fans presumed to be the game he had referred to previously.\n\nIn February 2018, Cawthon announced on a Steam post that he would think about gaining help from larger publishers in making future games. In an edited version of the same post, he added that he would be developing an \"ultimate custom night” for \"Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator\", which, as revealed on his website, has about 57 animatronics from the game and all other games in the \"Five Nights at Freddy’s\" series attacking the player. The custom night is due for release on June 29, 2018. However, in an article Scott made on Steam on June 22nd, Scott revealed that he was going to release the game early, on the 22nd, but because he had promised YouTuber Lewis Dawkins (AKA \"Dawko\") that he would not release it before he came back from vacation, he would wait until June 27th to release the game, the day that Lewis comes back from vacation.\n\n\"Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator\" received mostly positive reviews. GameCrate called it the \"best value in gaming right now\", with Rock Paper Shotgun calling it \"spooky as hell\". The Ball State Daily News also gave a positive review, calling it \"an interesting evolution of the \"Five Nights\" [\"at Freddy's\"] formula\".\n"}

Hofstede’s research is primarily focused on how values in the workplace are influenced by culture. According to him, all behaviors are determined by culture. In his definition; culture is ‘the collective programming of the mind distinguishing the members of one group or category of people from others.’ To conduct his research, he analyzed a large database of employee value scores collected within IBM between years 1967 and 1973. There is over 70 countries in the data. Hofstede’s primary tenants of culture differentiation are summed up through his research more elaborately, but primarily consist of: In his model, he identified six dimensions of national culture based on his research. Those dimensions are also used to differentiate countries from each other, based on how countries score on the six dimensions. The scale of scores range from 0 – 100. If a score is below 50 it is considered as Low and if it is higher than 50 it is considered as High in that dimension. Here, although countries are represented with a score, the scores are relative and cannot represent unique individuals. In other words, ‘culture can be only used meaningfully by comparison.’ The relevant scores are proven to be stable over time. Forces that cause cultures to shift are global and therefore is there is something effecting the culture in a country, it actually effects many countries at the same time in the world. The model consists of six dimensions; which are Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity vs Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation vs Short Term Normative Orientation and Indulgence vs Restraint. Furthermore, he has published several books and academic articles on the subject in order to light the way for global business leaders as well as academic researchers.\n\n\nThe GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research) project took Hofstede’s original 1980 research findings (Hofstede, 1980) and dedicated an entire academic effort into exploring the differences of cultures (Hofstede, 1980). “Conceived in 1991 by Robert J. House of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and led by Professor House, the GLOBE Project directly involved 170 “country co-investigators” based in 62 of the world’s cultures as well as a 14-member group of coordinators and research associates. This international team collected data from 17,300 middle managers in 951 organizations. They used qualitative methods to assist their development of quantitative instruments.” The research identified nine cultural competencies and grouped the 62 countries into ten convenient societal clusters (Javidan & Dastmalchian, 2009).\n\nThe GLOBE researchers used acquired data to put nations into cultural clusters that are grouped based upon cultural similarities due to shared geography and climate conditions, which all influence perceptions and behavior:\n\nAnglo Cultures\nEngland, Australia, South Africa (white sample), Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, United States\n\nArab Cultures\nAlgeria, Qatar, Morocco, Egypt, Kuwait, Libya, Tunisia, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, Iraq, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman\n\nConfucian Asia\nTaiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam\n\nEastern Europe\nHungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Serbia, Greece, Slovenia, Albania, Russia\n\nGermanic Europe\n\"Dutch-speaking\" (Netherlands, Belgium and Dutch-speaking France)\n\"German-speaking\" (Austria, German-speaking Switzerland, Germany, South Tyrol, Liechtenstein)\n\nLatin America\nCosta Rica, Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina\n\nLatin Europe\nItaly, Portugal, Spain, France, Switzerland (French and Italian speaking)\n\nNordic Europe\nFinland, Sweden, Denmark\n\nSouthern Asia\nPakistan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Iran, Philippines, Turkey\n\nSub-Sahara Africa\nNamibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa (Black Sample), Nigeria\n\nThe nine GLOBE cultural competencies are:\n\nAfter extensive review of the research the GLOBE strategically grouped over 21 primary leadership dimensions into six encompassing dimensions of global leadership and made recommendation about how the dimensions of culture and leadership could distinguish influences of one country from another.\n\nThe six Globe dimensions of culturally endorsed implicit leadership (CLT) are:\n\nAs globalization continues to thrive and change, the concept of global leadership will adapt to serve the best interest of a world being made incrementally smaller.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 2004 as the Institute of Business and Technology. From 2009 to 2011 it was known as IBAT College Swords. As of 2018, the college offers two part-time Bachelor of Arts degrees and an MBA, all of which are validated by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. It also offers English-language courses and its own short courses in various subjects related to business and technology.\n\nThe college was founded in 2004 by Shane Ormsby who was its director and principal shareholder. Originally called the Institute of Business and Technology, its first campus was on Forster Way in the Swords area of north Dublin. In 2006, it received programme validation from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC). By 2011, it was offering the Certificate in Business, Higher Certificate in Business, Bachelor of Business, and Bachelor of Business (Honours). In addition to those HETAC validated programmes, it also offered an MBA validated by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and various accountancy, business, and technology training programmes which at the time were approved by ATI, ACCA, ICS and ICM.\n\nThe College had changed its name from the Institute of Business and Technology to IBAT College Swords in July 2009. It was changed again in July 2011 to its present name, IBAT College Dublin. The 2011 name change reflected IBAT's move to a new purpose-built main campus in the center of Dublin at Temple Bar. In 2014 the college entered into an agreement with Global University Systems (GUS) which involved GUS assisting IBAT with student recruitment and marketing. The GUS subsidiary Interactive would also digitise the learning materials for the college's ACCA accountancy courses. At that time Ormsby said that there had been no discussions about the company taking a financial stake in his business. \n\nFrom the outset, the college has catered mainly to students from outside Ireland, the majority of whom are also from outside the European Economic Area. Concerns about the college's acceptance of students without the requisite level of English for higher education study, poor student progression and retention rates, and lax admissions procedures and record-keeping led to a review by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) which was completed in January 2017. At the conclusion of the review, validation was removed from all of the college's HETAC business programmes. Despite the withdrawal of accreditation for its HETAC business courses, IBAT was still allowed to recruit non-EU students on visas for its English-language courses. Its MBA validated by the University of Wales remained unaffected. \n\nIn November 2016, as the QQI review was taking place, IBAT Dublin was sold to Global University Systems. Shane Ormsby remained the college's director after the takeover.\n\nAs of 2018, IBAT Dublin offers two part-time Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degrees in Sports Management and Development and in International Business. It also offers an MBA which can be studied full- or part-time. All three degrees are validated by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. In addition to the degree programes, IBAT offers English-language courses and its own short courses in various subjects related to business and technology.\n"}

{"id": "526214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526214", "title": "International Chemistry Olympiad", "text": "International Chemistry Olympiad\n\nThe International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) is an annual academic competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads.\n\nThe first IChO was held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former Eastern bloc and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in Austria. Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.\n\nEach delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or \"head mentor\"). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in Bratislava, Slovakia.\n\nCountries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 80 countries are expected to send students.\n\nThe competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant's overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students' preference.\n\nStudents receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.\n\nThe syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of chemistry, including organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and spectroscopy. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.\nAll participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to approximately the top 10% of students, silver medals are awarded to approximately the next 20% of students, and bronze medals are awarded approximately to the next 30% of students. The exact number of medals is decided on the blind review of the results. Honorable mentions are awarded to the next top 10% of the participants that do not win a medal. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall. Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations.\n\nThese events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, \"the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding\".\n\nWhile each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection process usually involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold \"training camps\" for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year's preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.\n\nThe idea of the International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all Warsaw Pact countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.\n\nThe first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.\n\nThere was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance.. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.\n\nThe first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998. Presently, 75 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.\n\n\nPreparatory problems, final results, and the theoretical and practical examinations from particular competition can be found on the respective IChO's website.\n"}

Jensen (August 4, 1931 – February 17, 2007) was a Miami Beach, Florida, drama teacher known as \"The Teacher to the Stars\". Jensen is credited with inspiring the acting talents of such well-known actors as Andy García and Mickey Rourke.\n\nJensen was born in Irvington, New Jersey. He was the only child of John W. and Thelma \"Billie\" Jensen. His father was a musician in a nightclub band, and his mother was a nightclub manager. As a child, he developed a love of film and drama. During his school years, he studied ballroom dancing and acting. In 1950, his family moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he earned an Associate of Arts degree from St. Petersburg College.\n\nJensen moved to Miami, where he graduated from the University of Miami with a BA in Education. In 1953, he left Florida to live and study in Havana, Cuba. While in Cuba, Jensen studied at the University of Havana. Upon his return to Miami in 1954, he began teaching at Little River Junior High School.\n\nAfter teaching for three years, Jensen decided to accomplish his dream of being a motion picture actor and \"go to Hollywood and get discovered.\" Along with his widowed mother, Thelma, and his cat Dracula, he flew to Los Angeles.\n\nIn California, Jensen traveled to Los Angeles for an interview with movie producer Joe Pasternak. Pasternak told Jensen he was leaving the motion picture business, and Jensen's dreams of a movie career were dashed. However, while in Hollywood, Jensen became friends with actress Carroll Baker. He became Baker's dance partner, and appeared as an extra in three of her movies: \"The Big Country\", \"But Not for Me\", and \"The Miracle\". Baker and Jensen performed a dance routine for the troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.\n\nJensen's circle of friends included actors Jim Backus and Hurd Hatfield. After a failed interview with DesiLu Productions, Jensen decided to return to Florida. It was also during the 1950s that he became a close friend of the writer and playwright Tennessee Williams.\n\nIn 1959, Jensen was rehired by Miami-Dade County Public Schools, and began a 32-year career as a drama teacher at Miami Beach Senior High School. However, he didn't give up on his motion picture career. He co-starred in \"Rehearsal For Sin\", an independent film produced in South Florida, and played a few uncredited roles in such movies as \"Racing Fever\" and \"Werewolves on Wheels\". \n\nJensen went on to earn a Master of Education Degree in Administration, Curriculum and Drama Education from the University of Miami. At Miami Beach High, he directed 300 plays and musicals. His productions of the plays \"You Can't Take It With You\", \"The Fantastics\", \"David and Lisa\", \"The Great White Hope\", \"\", \"Hair\", \"The Impossible Years\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"Viet Rock\", were groundbreaking and controversial for the times.\n\nIn 1971, Jensen directed the play \"The Serpent\". \"The Serpent\" was a play of Biblical proportions; performed with a begetting scene. One of the student-actors in the cast was future movie star Mickey Rourke. Among his numerous other students were movie actors Andy García, Neal Gold, actor/voice actor Jerry Gelb.; Annabelle Gurwitch; movie directors Brett Ratner and Sara Sackner; rapper Luther Campbell; sportscaster Roy Firestone;, executive producer Heather Winters, music composer Desmond Child; casting director Debra Zane; and artist Romero Britto. Jensen also worked with supermodel Niki Taylor and coached Jennifer Fox in Gypsy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jensen retired from teaching full-time but continued to work as an instructor for Adult and Community Education for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. His co-faculty members at Fienberg-Fisher Adult and Community Education Center included fellow actors Steven Brack, Lois Brooks, William Conroy, and Carl Starling.\n\nOn November 6, 1999, Jensen was inducted into the Miami Beach Senior High School Hall of Fame by the Miami Beach Senior High School Alumni Association.\n\nJensen was also involved in Mexican cinema and considered Mexico City his second home. He spoke Spanish and worked as an actor and casting director. Jensen acted in five Mexican-produced films from 1965 to 1970, working with directors such as Luis Alcoriza and Albert Zugsmith on the movies \"El Gangster\", \"Los Cuatro Juanes\", \"Paraiso\", \"El Pistolero Fantasma\", and \"La Captura de Gabino Barrera\".\n\nIn 2001, Jensen was the casting director for the Mexican production of \"I Never Saw Another Butterfly\".\n\nJensen also served as drama consultant in Mexico City with the Peterson Schools.\n\nJensen became friends with writer-playwright Tennessee Williams in the 1950s. They met at the old Robert Clay Hotel in South Beach and remained friends until Williams's death.\n\nIn his spare time. Jensen lectured at colleges, book fairs, and festivals about his relationship with Williams. He entitled his lecture, \"The Other Side of Tennessee Williams\". He was a featured speaker at the Tennessee Williams Literary Fest in New Orleans in 1998, and appeared also at the Tennessee Williams Festival in 2003.\n\nJensen was an only child. His father, John W. Jensen, died in the 1950s. His mother, Thelma aka Billie, died in January 1999 at the age of 93.\n\nJensen never married, but in the 1970s, he was engaged to transsexual dancer Jennifer Fox. The two announced their engagement on \"The Joey Carr Show\", a local South Florida television program. Years later, Fox was interviewed in \"Class Act\", a documentary on Jensen's life.\n\nJensen received numerous awards during his life. He served as a regional director for the National Thespian Society, hosted conferences before the Florida State Thespian Festival, and was a Carbonell voter in South Florida.\n\nJensen donated over $4 million to such institutions as the University of Miami's Theater Arts Department, the School of Education, the Lowe Art Museum, the Ring Theater, and the Peterson Schools in Mexico.\n\nHe gave $100,000 to the Actor's Playhouse in Miami. The Mainstage Auditorium Stage was dedicated in honor of Jensen and his parents.\n\nIn 1997, he and his mother Thelma bequeathed $1 million to the Lowe Art Museum in Miami, Florida for a pre-Columbian wing named in honor of his 92-year-old mother. He donated another million dollars to the Jerry Herman Ring Theater.\n\nIn the July 29, 2002, issue of \"Time\", Jensen was profiled along with other retirees regarding a meltdown in the stock market and eroding pension benefits. \"I'm incensed,\" said Jensen of the scandals rocking the stock market. \"Everytime I look I'm getting poorer.\" However, Jensen told the magazine that regardless of his losses, he still had a positive outlook on life: \"My theory is, you die if you don't keep moving.\"\n\nIn July 2006, Jensen discovered he had prostate cancer. Though seriously ill, he continued to work. He appeared numerous times in fundraising appeals for PBS television. However, his illness quickly progressed, and he died on Saturday, February 17, 2007, in Coral Gables, Florida.\n"}

Martin Carnoy received his B.A. in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (1960) and a M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago (1961 and 1964.)\n\nDr. Carnoy is a labor economist with a special interest in the relation between the economy and the educational system. To this end, he studies the US labor market, including the role in that relation of race, ethnicity, and gender, the US educational system, and systems in many other countries. He uses comparative analysis to understand international comparative education, the economics of education and applied econometrics, with a focus on the political economy of education. \n\nThrough his research, Carnoy has argued that educational policy is used by capitalist nations' \"bourgeois elites\" as a form of cultural imperialism in order to perpetuate the conditions allowing for the exploitation of working classes both within and without these nations through e.g. education systems that support inherited advantages (\"Education as Cultural Imperialism,\" 1974). He has chronicled how Marxist views on the role of the state shifted considerably throughout the 20th century, sometimes bearing little loyalty to the original views of Karl Marx (\"The State and Political Theory,\" 1984). Dr. Carnoy also has explored how Cuba leverages small, personalized schools, highly trained teachers, strong principals, a coherent curriculum and long-term relationships between teachers and students to academically outperform most other Latin American countries (\"Cuba's Academic Advantage, 2007)\". Together with Luis Beneviste and Richard Rothstein, Carnoy has weighed in on the debate between private and public education, arguing that many private schools in inner cities face the same problems as their neighboring public schools and thus questioning the extent to which they can be part of the solution. Similarly, Carnoy, Rothstein, Lawrence Mishel and Rebecca Jacobsen have contributed to the debate on charter schools through their book \"The Charter School Dust-Up\", wherein they compare student enrollment and achievement in charter and public schools and explain the finding that students in the later tend on average to academically outperform students in the former.\n\nCarnoy has conducted research on the impact of school accountability on learning, the effectiveness and efficiency of private schools, the impact of globalization on education systems, school vouchers, flexible work, and the impact of structural adjustment on education.

After 9 years on the faculty at the University of California, San Francisco, he was the chair of the Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care and Pain Management at the University of Chicago for 16 years. He then became dean of the School of Medicine and vice president for Biomedical Sciences at SUNY Upstate.\n\nHe co-founded RealAge, a service providing personal health tools to consumers. In 2004 and was named chief wellness officer and chair of the Wellness Institute in 2007.\n\nRoizen still practices anesthesiology and internal medicine. He has served on the boards of five non-profit foundations.\n\nRoizen and his wife, Nancy, a developmental pediatrician, live in Cleveland, Ohio. The Roizens have two children.\n\nHe has appeared on various television shows and featured in various magazines. and biography. He and Dr. Oz coauthor a daily newspaper column in a number of newspapers.\n\nThe idea for RealAge started in 1985 when Roizen convinced a 47-year-old entrepreneur to take his blood-pressure medication by explaining he was living with the body of a 52-year-old by not doing so. The entrepreneur paid for Roizen to assemble a five-person research team and identify controllable factors that affect length and/or quality of life.\n\nThe first RealAge test debuted online in 1998.\n\nMichael Roizen became the Cleveland Clinic's chief wellness officer in mid-2007. The position was new for the clinic and was notable, as it made Roizen one of the top 12 executives within the health system. He is also a professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. Among his initiatives are starting a farmer's market near the clinic's main campus, mentoring children in the public schools, and starting smoking cessation and weight-loss programs. He has also encouraged a walking-focused health program\n\n\n"}

NEED teaches the scientific concepts of energy and provides objective information about conventional and emerging energy sources— their use and impact on the environment, economy, and society. The program also educates students about energy efficiency and conservation while providing tools to help educators, energy managers, and consumers use energy wisely.\n\nThe NEED mission, goals, and governance are described on the program's website and include links to the organization's annual report and financial statement. NEED Project Mission\n\nExperts agree students learn best by doing. NEED materials are inquiry based and incorporate the \"Kids Teaching Kids\" philosophy. NEED makes teaching and learning about energy exciting while developing students' leadership and critical thinking skills.\n\nNEED materials are available for all grade levels from kindergarten through high school. With NEED's extensive curriculum, educators can design classroom programs that spark the interest of their students and meet course objectives. NEED materials are designed to meet and correlate to the National Science Education Content Standards, as well as many state standards. Educators who use NEED materials report that their students score better on end-of-grade testing, are more actively engaged in learning, and develop leadership skills as members of the community.\n\nTo ensure that teachers and students are working with accurate information, NEED materials are updated on a regular basis, using the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well as from a wide range of energy industry partners. NEED works with educators and students to improve existing materials and develop new ones to meet national and state curriculum requirements. In a special partnership with the Energy Information Administration, NEED helps make energy information and data available to students via the EIA Kid's Page website. In 2006, the Kid's Page was one of the most popular EIA products—averaging over 350,000 user sessions per month.\nNEED welcomes partners who vitalize the NEED network with new curriculum materials and new schools. A partnership with Pacific Gas and Electric Company expanded the PG&E Solar Schools program to over 600 teachers in the PG&E service area. Schools receive NEED Solar Kits, Science of Energy Kits, teacher training and the opportunity to apply for photovoltaic (solar) installations and classroom grants.\n\nNEED continues to grow at the national and the local level thanks to the support of committed sponsors and partners. Companies and organizations of all types and sizes work with NEED to invest in the future of energy and energy education. NEED sponsors and partners recognize the value of educating tomorrow's workforce for careers in energy. Each partnership is unique. Each partnership considers an energy literate public a pathway to overcoming the energy challenges of the future.\n\nThe NEED curriculum is divided into eight steps; each builds on the others to form a comprehensive energy unit that encourages even the youngest students to understand how energy is involved in everything that happens in the world.\n\nNEED offers over 130+ curriculum guides available for free PDF download at the NEED Store\n\nTeachers are the key to the success of the NEED program. NEED teachers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories reach more than four million students each year in their local schools, and many more through outreach programs. Providing teachers with innovative training programs and opportunities to increase their own energy knowledge is a major objective of the NEED program.\n\nTraining is offered at local, state, regional and national levels. During the school year, NEED coordinators, lead teachers, and student leaders facilitate workshops for teachers, students, parents, and community members that may range from a few hours to several days. At these workshops, attendees receive an introduction to the NEED curriculum. Additional training for special topics like solar, hydrogen, wind, energy on public lands, or energy management is available in many areas of the NEED network. NEED specializes in creating a first-class training experience, which is consistently scored by participants as one of the best professional development experiences available.\n\nIn the summer, the National Energy Conferences for Educators give teachers and energy professionals the opportunity to meet other educators from across the country, design and develop NEED units for their classrooms, increase their energy knowledge, and earn graduate credit. They participate in NEED activities and field trips to energy sites such as nuclear power plants, coalmines, offshore oil production facilities, solar energy facilities, hydroelectric dams, and energy efficiency projects.\n\nNEED sponsors and partners provide sponsorship for teachers, and they participate as speakers and field trip guides. Some NEED states also sponsor summer energy camps for kids, spring break day camps, and overnight energy weekends. Many NEED schools work with scout troops and community youth groups to help them gain energy-related merit badges and community service hours.\n\nNEED Energy Workshop Opportunities are listed on the NEED Calendar here: NEED Calendar\n\nThe long-term success of NEED depends on the support of its network. The educators, students, directors, coordinators, sponsors, and community partners who support the program say that working with NEED is one of the most rewarding things about their jobs. The board of Directors facilitates the implementation of NEED's strategic plan for expansion and helps support NEED's goal of providing an energy education program to every interested school in America. Board members volunteer their time and talents to make sure that NEED has a strong foundation and that the programs and materials reach the greatest number of people each year. Each member of the Board provides funding for the development of NEED programs.\n\nState programs are a vital component of NEED's mission. State coordinators and NEED lead teachers, partners, and sponsors provide day-to-day guidance to local programs, conduct regional and local training programs, design and distribute materials, support teachers, and help develop new NEED programs and activities. These state programs make NEED work at the local level—helping connect the state education standards to NEED programs and materials.\nNEED stays connected to its network via its newsletters— Energy Exchange and Career Currents—and a variety of resources and opportunities available on NEED's website, www.need.org, and many outreach events each year. Energy Exchange provides teachers, students, and sponsors with information and activities about energy and exciting new technologies and discoveries. NEED's new newsletter, Career Currents, exposes students to the diversity of energy careers. Both newsletters are distributed bimonthly, and all issues are available on www.need.org.\n\nWith a new look this year, www.need.org gives teachers a resource for curriculum publications and activity guides, a place to discuss their NEED programs, and links to a variety of supplemental resources. The website also provides students with methods for choosing science fair experiments, fact sheets for research projects, activities to reinforce knowledge, and resources on the nation's leading energy sources, electricity, and conservation. NEED also partners with the Energy Information Administration on their EIA Kid’s Page, the premier site for kids to find reliable, up-to-date energy information and loads of fun energy activities.\n\nSince its inception in 1980, NEED has grown from a one-day celebration of energy awareness to a national organization dedicated o introducing energy into the curriculum at every grade level. This growth would be impossible without the continued support of NEED's sponsors and partners at the national, state, and local level ho provide funding, time, energy, and technical assistance. NEED sponsors and partners believe in the importance of a comprehensive energy education program that helps teachers and students understand energy and its impacts on their world.\n\nThe Pacific Gas and Electric Company Solar Schools Program:\n\nBegun in 2004, the PG&E Solar Schools Program has installed over 100 solar photovoltaic electrical systems in K-12 public schools throughout its service area.\nThe program also funds free NEED energy education workshops and Bright Ideas grants of up to $10,000 for innovative educational projects.\nPG&E Solar Schools Program homepage\n\nTexas TXU Energy Solar Academy:\n\nTXU Energy brings solar energy education to the classroom in the TXU Energy Solar Academy. TXU Energy provided a contribution to the National Energy Education Development (NEED) Project to launch a solar education program that helps teachers meet the requirements of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), helps students and their families understand basic energy concepts and brings solar demonstration installations to local communities. \nTXU Energy Solar Academy homepage\n\nConocoPhillips Energy Education program:\n\nConocoPhillips sponsors a series of free K-12 workshops held throughout the nation. This workshop series presents a unique opportunity for classroom teachers (K-12) to learn about energy in a fun and exciting way! The seminars will create awareness of today's energy challenges and the importance of using energy wisely. Participation in this workshop provides educators with more than $500 of curriculum and hands-on kits that teach about energy resources and energy transformations through hands-on activities. Participants receive the NEED Science of Energy Kit, a basic NEED curriculum set and a class-set of NEED's Energy Infobooks at grade level. Curriculum and training is aligned with state education standards. \nConocoPhillips/NEED homepage\nConocoPhillips Energy Workshop Videos\n\nEnergizing Student Potential (ESP Program):\n\nThe Exelon Foundation, ComEd, Nicor Gas, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, and BP America, in partnership with the National Energy Education Development (NEED) Project, launched Energizing Student Potential, a STEM-focused energy program for grades 5 - 8 in their respective customer regions in Illinois and Indiana in the 2015-2016 school year. In 2016-2017, Energizing Student Potential launched in Washington, D.C. for District of Columbia Public Schools with support from Exelon Foundation and Pepco. Working with librarians and media specialists, the program welcomed 22 schools in January 2017. This program brings together standards-based curriculum for use in the classroom or in afterschool programs in public and private schools and the resources of the region's largest energy companies. The program will help schools meet Next Generation Science Standards and more. Energizing Student Potential is designed to help educators bring energy into the classroom and to provide all the tools and resources necessary for students and teachers to learn together, explore energy together, and teach their local communities about energy.\nESP Program Homepage\n\n\n"}

This initial group of law professors and lawyers worked with the intention of addressing this problem and came to the conclusion that learning-by-doing trial training was the best approach. This group spent two more years improving their trial material and in 1972 NITA's inaugural National Session was held at the University of Colorado in Boulder. This program brings together participants from all across the country who are taught through a learning by doing approach how to better represent their clients in the courtroom. The national session has been held every year since 1972 and NITA has since expanded its scope, holding public service trial training sessions in a variety of specialties across the country as well as other skills courses including deposition and courtroom technology skills.\n\n"}
{"id": "98652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98652", "title": "Natura Artis Magistra", "text": "Natura Artis Magistra\n\nArtis, short for Natura Artis Magistra (Latin for \"Nature is the teacher of the arts\"), is a zoo in the centre of Amsterdam. It is the oldest zoo in the Netherlands and one of the oldest zoos of mainland Europe. Next to possessing a zoo, Artis also contains an aquarium and a planetarium. Artis also has an arboretum and a fairly large art collection. A part of the art collection is on display in the Aquarium building of the zoo. Artis contains 27 monumental buildings, most of which are used as enclosures for the animals, making Artis a unique cultural heritage of the 19th century.\n\nThe zoo is a member of the Dutch Zoo Federation (NVD), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the International Species Information System (ISIS), and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).\n\nThe zoo was founded in 1838 by Gerard Westerman, J.W.H. Werlemann and J.J. Wijsmuller (also known as the three Ws). It was initially open only to members. Starting in 1851 it was opened to the public during the month of September. In 1920 it was opened year-round to the public, but September remains discount month.\n\nThe core of the current zoo property, then the \"Middenhof\" estate, was purchased by the board of the zoological society \"Natura Artis Magistra\" late in 1838 in the Plantage, which was then a rural area on the outskirts of Amsterdam. From the start it exhibited both live and mounted specimens.\n\nThe zoo is commonly referred to as Artis, because the zoo has three gates with the words 'Natura', 'Artis', and 'Magistra' written above each of them, respectively. More often than not, only the middle gate was open, so that people who walked through it, seeing that 'Artis' was written above it, believed that the zoo was just called Artis. Thanks to this, soon few people knew it by its full name: Natura Artis Magistra.\n\nThe last quagga in captivity died at Artis on 12 August 1883. At the time, because all zebras were referred to as quagga, nobody realized that this was the last quagga alive until years later.\n\nArtis includes 27 historic buildings. The Aquarium was built in 1882 on land leased from the city on condition that only a museum ever be built on it. The library dates back to 1867 and the building the 'Ledenlokalen' on the right side of the main entrance dates back to the 19th century as well.\n\nThe wolf house (formerly an inn), and the Masman Garden House which now houses scarlet ibis were both on the site before the zoo was established.\n\nArtis has a library on the history of zoology and botany. It houses the library of the zoo, as well as the libraries of the Zoological Museum Amsterdam and the Amsterdam Botanical Garden. It also hosts the archives of a number of zoologists and botanists, such as the archive of Hugo de Vries. It contains 20,000 books, 3000 manuscripts and 80,000 animal prints.\n\nThe library is part of the special collections of the University of Amsterdam.\n\n"}

{"id": "25057928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25057928", "title": "QS World University Rankings", "text": "QS World University Rankings\n\nQS World University Rankings is an annual publication of university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Previously known as \"Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings\", the publisher had collaborated with \"Times Higher Education magazine\" (\"THE\") to publish its international league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own versions. QS then chose to continue using the pre-existing methodology while \"Times Higher Education\" adopted a new methodology to create their rankings.\n\nThe QS system now comprises the global overall and subject rankings (which name the world's top universities for the study of 48 different subjects and five composite faculty areas), alongside five independent regional tables (Asia, Latin America, Emerging Europe and Central Asia, the Arab Region, and BRICS).\n\nBeing the only international ranking to have received International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) approval, the QS ranking is viewed as one of the three most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" and \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\". However, it has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over the years. Concern also exists regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate QS ranking results.\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Britain for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK to gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\nThe idea for the rankings was credited in Ben Wildavsky's book, \"The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities are Reshaping the World\", to then-editor of \"Times Higher Education\" (\"THE\"), John O'Leary. \"THE\" chose to partner with educational and careers advice company Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) to supply the data, appointing Martin Ince, formerly deputy editor and later a contractor to \"THE\", to manage the project.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with \"THE\". In 2009, \"THE\" announced they would produce their own rankings, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, in partnership with Thomson Reuters. \"THE\" cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings, as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities, as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.\n\nQS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them and continues to produce rankings based on that methodology, which are now called the QS World University Rankings.\n\n\"THE\" created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first Times Higher Education World University Rankings in September 2010.\n\nQS publishes the rankings results in the world's media and has entered into partnerships with a number of outlets, including The Guardian in the United Kingdom, and Chosun Ilbo in Korea. The first rankings produced by QS independently of THE, and using QS's consistent and original methodology, were released on September 8, 2010, with the second appearing on September 6, 2011.\n\nQS designed its rankings in order to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.\n\nAcademic peer review\n\nThis is the most controversial part of the methodology. Using a combination of purchased mailing lists and applications and suggestions, this survey asks active academicians across the world about the top universities in their specialist fields. QS has published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants.\n\nThe 2017/18 rankings made use of responses from 75,015 people from over 140 nations for its Academic Reputation indicator, including votes from the previous five years rolled forward provided there was no more recent information available from the same individual. Participants can nominate up to 30 universities but are not able to vote for their own. They tend to nominate a median of about 20, which means that this survey includes over 500,000 data points. The average respondent possesses 20.4 years of academic experience, while 81% of respondents have over a decade of experience in the academic world.\n\nIn 2004, when the rankings first appeared, academic peer review accounted for half of a university's possible score. In 2005, its share was cut to 40 per cent because of the introduction of the Employer Reputation Survey.\n\nFaculty student ratio\n\nThis indicator accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as a proxy for teaching commitment, but QS has admitted that it is less than satisfactory.\n\nCitations per faculty\n\nCitations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citations data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the Rankings.\n\nQS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per paper preferred for other systems, because it reduces the effect of biomedical science on the overall picture – bio-medicine has a ferocious \"publish or perish\" culture. Instead QS attempts to measure the density of research-active staff at each institution. But issues still remain about the use of citations in ranking systems, especially the fact that the arts and humanities generate comparatively few citations.\n\nHowever, since 2015, QS have made methodological enhancements designed to remove the advantage institutions specializing in the Natural Sciences or Medicine previously received. This enhancement is termed faculty area normalization, and ensures that an institution's citations count in each of QS's five key Faculty Areas is weighted to account for 20% of the final citations score.\n\nQS has conceded the presence of some data collection errors regarding citations per faculty in previous years' rankings.\n\nOne interesting issue is the difference between the Scopus and Thomson Reuters databases. For major world universities, the two systems capture more or less the same publications and citations. For less mainstream institutions, Scopus has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its database. But as the papers there are less heavily cited, this can also mean fewer citations per paper for the universities that publish in them.\nThis area has been criticized for undermining universities which do not use English as their primary language. Citations and publications in a language different from English are harder to come across. The English language is the most internationalized language and therefore is also the most popular when citing.\n\nEmployer review\n\nThis part of the ranking is obtained by a similar method to the Academic Peer Review, except that it samples recruiters who hire graduates on a global or significant national scale. The numbers are smaller – 40,455 responses from over 130 countries in the 2016 Rankings – and are used to produce 10 per cent of any university's possible score. This survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality, a famously problematic thing to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.\n\nInternational orientation\n\nThe final ten per cent of a university's possible score is derived from measures intended to capture their internationalism: five percent from their percentage of international students, and another five percent from their percentage of international staff.\nThis is of interest partly because it shows whether a university is putting effort into being global, but also because it tells us whether it is taken seriously enough by students and academics around the world for them to want to be there.\n\nIn September 2015, both The Guardian and The Daily Mail referred to the QS World University Rankings as \"the most authoritative of their kind\". In 2016, Ben Sowter, Head of Research at the QS Intelligence Unit, was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 'Higher Education Power List'. The list enumerated what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK higher education.\n\nSeveral universities in the UK and the Asia-Pacific region have commented on the rankings positively. Vice-Chancellor of New Zealand's Massey University, Professor Judith Kinnear, says that the Times Higher Education-QS ranking is a \"wonderful external acknowledgement of several university attributes, including the quality of its research, research training, teaching and employability.\" She said the rankings are a true measure of a university's ability to fly high internationally: \"The Times Higher Education ranking provides a rather more and more sophisticated, robust and well rounded measure of international and national ranking than either New Zealand's Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) measure or the Shanghai rankings.\"\nIn September 2012 the British newspaper \"The Independent\" described the QS World University Rankings as being \"widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables\".\n\nAngel Calderon, Principal Advisor for Planning and Research at RMIT University and member of the QS Advisory Board, spoke positively of the QS University Rankings for Latin America, saying that the \"QS Latin American University Rankings has become the annual international benchmark universities use to ascertain their relative standing in the region\". He further stated that the 2016/17 edition of this ranking demonstrated improved stability.\n\nCertain commentators have expressed concern about the use or misuse of survey data. However, QS's Intelligence Unit, responsible for compiling the rankings, state that the extent of the sample size used for their surveys mean that they are now \"almost impossible to manipulate and very difficult for institutions to ‘game’\". They also state that \"over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable\". Furthermore, since 2013, the number of respondents to QS's Academic Reputation Survey has increased again. Their survey now makes use of nearly 75,000 academic peer reviews, making it \"to date, the world’s largest aggregation of feeling in this [the global academic] community.\"\n\nThe QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too much emphasis on peer review, which receives 40 percent of the overall score. Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the peer review has been carried out. In a report, Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the \"Times Higher Education\"-QS World University Rankings: \n\nHowever, QS state that no survey participant, academic or employer, is offered a financial incentive to respond, while no academic is able to vote for their own institution. This renders this particular criticism invalid, as it is based on two incorrect premises: (1) that academics are currently financially incentivized to participate, and (2) that conflicts of interests are created by academics being able to vote for their own institution.\n\nAcademicians previously criticized of the use of the citation database, arguing that it undervalues institutions which excel in the social sciences. Ian Diamond, former chief executive of the Economic and Social Research Council and now vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen and a member of the THE editorial board, wrote to \"Times Higher Education\" in 2007, saying: \n\nHowever, in 2015, QS's introduction of faculty area normalization ensured that QS's rankings no longer conferred an undue advantage or disadvantage upon any institution based on their particular subject specialisms. Correspondingly, the London School of Economics rose from 71st in 2014 to 35th in 2015 and 37th in 2016.\n\nSince the split from \"Times Higher Education\" in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder and Georg Winckler in the journal \"Scientomentrics\" for the unreliability of QS's methods: \n\nIn an article for the New Statesman entitled \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\", David Blanchflower, a leading labour economist, said: \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\" \n\nHowever, Martin Ince, chair of the Advisory Board for the Rankings, points out that their volatility has been reduced since 2007 by the introduction of the Z-score calculation method and that over time, the quality of QS's data gathering has improved to reduce anomalies. In addition, the academic and employer review are now so big that even modestly ranked universities receive a statistically valid number of votes. QS has published extensive data on who the respondents are, where they are, and the subjects and industries to which the academicians and employers respectively belong.\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes which are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear. However, the University of Pittsburgh was ranked in the number one position for Philosophy in the 2016 QS World University Rankings by Subject, while Rutgers University - another university that Leiter argued was given a strangely low ranking - was ranked number three in the world in the same ranking. An institution's score for each of QS's metrics can be found on the relevant ranking page, allowing those wishing to examine why an institution has finished in its final position to gain access to the scores that contributed to the overall rank.\n\nIn an article titled \"The Globalisation of College and University Rankings\" and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of \"Change\" magazine, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"\n\nSimon Marginson, professor of higher education at University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, in the article \"Improving Latin American universities' global ranking\" for University World News on 10 June 2012, said: \"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science\". QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating that \"Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable\".\n\nThe 2019 QS World University Rankings, published on June 6, 2018, was the fifteenth edition of the overall ranking. It confirmed Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the world's highest-ranked university for a seventh successive year. In doing so, MIT broke the record of consecutive number-one positions.\n\nQS also releases the \"QS Top 50 under 50 Ranking\" annually to rank universities which have been established for under 50 years. These institutions are judged based on their positions on the overall table of the previous year. From 2015, QS's \"'Top 50 Under 50\" ranking was expanded to include the world's top 100 institutions under 50 years of age, while in 2017 it was again expanded to include the world's top 150 universities in this cohort. In 2017, the table was topped by Nanyang Technological University of Singapore for the fourth consecutive year. The table is dominated by universities from the Asia-Pacific region, with the top six places taken by Asian institutions.\n\nQS also ranks universities by academic discipline organized into 5 faculties, namely Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences & Medicine, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences & Management. The methodology is based on surveying expert academics and global employers, and measuring research performance using data sourced from Elsevier's Scopus database. In the \"2018 QS World University Rankings by Subject\" the world's best universities for the study of 48 different subjects are named. The two new subject tables added in the most recent edition are: Classics & Ancient History and Library & Information Management.\n\nThe world's leading institution in 2018's tables in terms of most world-leading positions is Harvard University, which is number one for 14 subjects. Its longtime rankings rival, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is number one for twelve subjects.\n\nIn 2015, in an attempt to meet student demand for comparative data about the employment prospects offered by prospective or current universities, QS launched the \"QS Graduate Employability Rankings\". The most recent instalment, released for the 2017/18 academic year, ranks 500 universities worldwide. It is led by Stanford University, and features five universities from the United States in the top 10. The unique methodology consists of five indicators, with three that do not feature in any other ranking.\n\nIn 2009, QS launched the \"QS Asian University Rankings\" or \"QS University Rankings: Asia\" in partnership with \"The Chosun Ilbo\" newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The Ninth instalment, released for the 2017/18 academic year, ranks the 350 best universities in Asia, and is led by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\n\nThese rankings use some of the same criteria as the world rankings, but there are changed weightings and new criteria. One addition is the criterion of incoming and outgoing exchange students. Accordingly, the performance of Asian institutions in the \"QS World University Rankings\" and the \"QS Asian University Rankings\" released in the same academic year are different from each other.\n\nThe \"QS Latin American University Rankings\" or \"QS University Rankings: Latin America\" were launched in 2011. They use academic opinion (30%), employer opinion (20%), publications per faculty member, citations per paper, academic staff with a PhD, faculty/student ratio and web visibility (10 per cent each) as measures.\n\nThe 2016/17 edition of the QS World University Rankings: Latin America ranks the top 300 universities in the region. The Universidade de São Paulo retained its status as the region's best university.\n\nThe number of universities in Africa increased by 115 percent from 2000 to 2010, and enrollment more than doubled from 2.3 million to 5.2 million students, according to UNESCO. However, only one African university was among the worlds 100 best, to judge the world universities ranking of 2016.\n\nThis set of rankings adopts 8 indicators to select the top 100 higher learning institutions in BRICS countries. Institutions in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are not ranked here.\n\nIn 2012, QS launched the \"QS Best Student Cities\" ranking - a table designed to evaluate which cities were most likely to provide students with a high-quality student experience. Five editions of the ranking have been published thus far, with Paris taking the number-one position in four of them. The 2017 edition was also the first one to see the introduction of student opinion as a contributory indicator. The most recent edition of the ranking was released on May 9, 2018. It saw London take the number-one spot from Montreal.\n\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.\n\nQS Stars ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories. They are:\n\nStars is an evaluation system, not a ranking. About 400 institutions had opted for the Stars evaluation as of early 2018. In 2012, fees to participate in this program were $9850 for the initial audit and an annual license fee of $6850.\n\n"}

{"id": "27860462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27860462", "title": "Social space", "text": "Social space\n\nA social space is physical or virtual space such as a social center, online social media, or other gathering place where people gather and interact. Some social spaces such as town squares or parks are public places; others such as pubs, websites. or shopping malls are privately owned and regulated.\n\nHenri Lefebvre emphasised that in human society all 'space is social: it involves assigning more or less appropriated places to social relations...social space has thus always been a social product'. \nSocial space becomes thereby a metaphor for the very experience of social life - 'society experienced alternatively as a deterministic environment or force (\"milieu\") and as our very element or beneficent shell (\"ambience\")'. In this sense 'social space spans the dichotomy between \"public\" and \"private\" space...is also linked to subjective and phenomenological space'.\n\nAs metaphor, 'social space contributes a relational rather than an abstract dimension...has received a large variety of attributes, interpretations, and metaphors'. Such 'social space...i[s] an intricate space of obligations, duties, entitlements, prohibitions, debts, affections, insults, allies, contracts, enemies, infatuations, compromises, mutual love, legitimate expectations, and collective ideals'.\n\nFor Lefebvre, 'the family, the school, the workplace, the church, and so on - each possesses an \"appropriate\" space...for a use specified within the social division of labor'. Within such social spaces 'a system of \"adapted\" expectations and responses - rarely articulated as such because they seem obvious - acquire a quasi-natural self-evidence in everyday life and common sense': thus everybody consensually 'knows what he is talking about when he refers to the town hall, the post office, the police station, the grocery store, the bus and the train, train stations, and bistros' - all underlying aspects of 'a \"social space\" as such. an (artificial) edifice of hierarchically ordered institutions, of laws and conventions'.\n\nDefining a stratified morphology as a series of 'discrete units embedded within one another in a definite order', one can see that a distinct 'morphology exists in social space - from the \"room\" or hut to the house and the building; from the building to the group of houses, to the village and the neighbourhood; from the neighbourhood to the city, the region, the nation, and the State...continent [&] planet'.\n\nThe interaction of different levels may be symbiotic or it may be conflictual: as a Michigan cabinet member put it to two Southern colleagues shortly before the American Civil War, '\"I see how it is; you are a Virginian and you are a South Carolinian; I am not a Michigander, I am an American\"'.\n\nFor the individual, as well as the social institution, different levels of social space come to the fore at different times. To a Britisher, for example, '\"we\" sometimes narrows to southern England, sometimes broadens to refer to \"Britain and America\" or \"Europe\" or \"the west\"'. In precisely the same way, 'a resident of Rome may define himself with varying degrees of intensity as a Roman, an Italian, a Catholic, a Christian, a European, a Westerner' - a sequence of stratified social spaces.\n\n'In premodern societies, space and place largely coincided...Modernity increasingly tears space away from place'. Whereas in the premodern 'every thing has its assigned place in social space', postmodernists would proudly proclaim that 'we need to substitute for the magisterial space of the past...a less upright, less Euclidean space where no one would ever be \"in his final place\" '.\n\nThe way 'migration, seen as a metaphor, is everywhere' in postmodernity - 'we are migrants and perhaps hybrids, in but not of any situation in which we find ourselves' - is rooted in the postmodern forms of production of social space.\n\nLefebvre considered globalization as the creation, and superimposition on nature, of 'worldwide-social space...with strong points (the centers) and weaker and dominated bases (the peripheries)'.\n\nEducation, formal and informal, might be described as in large part a process whereby the new recruit to the human race 'must learn to represent the many dimensions of the local social space...through the veil of degraded inputs, chronic ambiguity, and the occasional deliberate deception'. Faced with such intricacies, R. D. Laing concluded that 'it is just as well that man is a social animal, since the sheer complexity and contradiction of the social field in which he has to live is so formidable'.\n\nThe madman, by contrast, is not 'someone to be counted on to know his place': in many ways, 'mental symptoms are wilful situational improprieties'. Whereas in 'public and semi-public places - streets, shops, neighbourhoods, public transportation, and the like -...a fine mesh of obligations obtains which ensures the orderly traffic and co-mingling of participants...many classic symptoms of psychosis are precise and pointed violations of these territorial arrangements'.\n\nLacan considered that 'it would be worthwhile mapping the places in social space that our culture has assigned to these [psychotic] subjects', and saw their difficulties as in part 'the effects of the breakdown produced by the symbolic discordances that characterize the complex structures of civilization': what Goffman termed '\"The Insanity of Place\"'.\n\n\n"}
