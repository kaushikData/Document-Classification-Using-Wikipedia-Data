The goal of academic detailing is to improve prescribing of targeted drugs to be consistent with medical evidence from randomized controlled trials, which ultimately improves patient care and can reduce health care costs. A key component of non-commercial or university-based academic detailing programs is that they (academic detailers/clinical educators, management, staff, program developers, etc.) do not have any financial links to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nAcademic detailing has been studied for over 25 years and has been shown to be effective at improving prescribing of targeted medications about 5% from baseline. Though it is primarily used to affect prescribing, it is also used to educate providers regarding other non-drug interventions, such as screening guidelines.\n\nMany academic detailing programs exist around the world. In the United States, university-based state programs exist in Vermont, Oregon and South Carolina. The nonprofit organization Alosa Health runs an academic detailing program in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Washington, DC called the Independent Drug Information Service (IDIS). The National Resource Center for Academic Detailing (NaRCAD), funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 2010, was created to help organizations with limited resources to establish and improve their own programs and to create a network of academic detailing programs. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Pharmacy Benefits Management pilot tested the National Academic Detailing Service in 2010 to enhance veterans' outcomes by empowering clinicians and promoting the use of evidence-based treatments using delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists. After the pilot, in March 2015, the Interim Under Secretary for Health issued a memorandum requiring implementation of AD programs throughout the Veterans Health Administration.\n\nPrograms also exist in Canada through the Canadian Academic Detailing Collaboration (CADC), including the Centre for Effective Practice's (CEP) academic detailing service in Ontario, and Australia through the Drug and Therapeutics Information Service (DATIS) and the National Prescribing Service (NPS). In Belgium academic detailing is provided by Project Farmaka.\n\n"}

{"id": "1162198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1162198", "title": "Albert Gleizes", "text": "Albert Gleizes\n\nAlbert Gleizes (; 8 December 1881 – 23 June 1953) was a French artist, theoretician, philosopher, a self-proclaimed founder of Cubism and an influence on the School of Paris. Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger wrote the first major treatise on Cubism, \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", 1912. Gleizes was a founding member of the Section d'Or group of artists. He was also a member of \"Der Sturm\", and his many theoretical writings were originally most appreciated in Germany, where especially at the Bauhaus his ideas were given thoughtful consideration. Gleizes spent four crucial years in New York, and played an important role in making America aware of modern art. He was a member of the Society of Independent Artists, founder of the Ernest-Renan Association, and both a founder and participant in the Abbaye de Créteil. Gleizes exhibited regularly at Léonce Rosenberg’s \"Galerie de l’Effort Moderne\" in Paris; he was also a founder, organizer and director of Abstraction-Création. From the mid-1920s to the late 1930s much of his energy went into writing, e.g., \"La Peinture et ses lois\" (Paris, 1923), \"Vers une conscience plastique: La Forme et l’histoire\" (Paris, 1932) and \"Homocentrisme\" (Sablons, 1937).\n\nBorn Albert Léon Gleizes and raised in Paris, he was the son of a fabric designer who ran a large industrial design workshop. He was also the nephew of Léon Comerre, a successful portrait painter who won the 1875 Prix de Rome. The young Albert Gleizes did not like school and often skipped classes to idle away the time writing poetry and wandering through the nearby Montmartre cemetery. Finally, after completing his secondary schooling, Gleizes spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army (Abbeville, Picardie) then began pursuing a career as a painter. Gleizes began to paint self-taught around 1901 in the Impressionist tradition. His first landscapes from around Courbevoie appear particularly inspired by Alfred Sisley or Camille Pissarro. Although clearly related to Pissarro in technique, Gleizes' particular view-points as well as the composition and conception of early works represent a clear departure from the style of late Impressionism. The density with which these works are painted and their solid framework suggest affinities with Divisionism which were often noted by early critics.\n\nGleizes was only twenty-one years of age when his work titled \"La Seine à Asnières\" was exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1902. The following year Gleizes exhibited two paintings at the Salon d'Automne. In 1905 Gleizes was among the founders of \"l'Association Ernest-Renan\", a union of students opposed to military propaganda. Gleizes was in charge of the \"Section littéraire et artistique\", organizing theater productions and poetry readings. At the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon (Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, 1906), Gleizes exhibited \"Jour de marché en banlieue\". Tending towards 1907 his work evolved into a Post-Impressionist style with strong Naturalist and Symbolist components.\n\nGleizes and others decide to create an \"association fraternelle d'artistes\" and rent a large house in Créteil. The Abbaye de Créteil was a self-supporting community of artists that aimed to develop their art free of any commercial concerns. For nearly a year, Gleizes along with other painters, poets, musicians and writers, gathered to create. A lack of income forced them to give up their cherished Abbaye de Créteil in early 1908 and Gleizes moved to 7 rue du Delta near Montmartre, Paris, with artists Amedeo Modigliani, , Maurice Drouart and Geo Printemps.\n\nIn 1908 Gleizes exhibited at the \"Toison d'Or\" in Moscow. The same year, showing a great interest in color and reflecting the transient influence of Fauvism, the work of Gleizes became more synthetic with a proto-Cubist component.\nGleizes' Fauve-like period was very brief, lasting several months, and even when his paint was thickest and color brightest, his concern for structural rhythms and simplification was dominant. His geometric simplifications at this time were more akin to Pont-Aven School and Les Nabis principles than to Paul Cézanne. His landscapes of 1909 are characterized by the reducing of forms of nature to primary shapes.\n\nDuring the summer of the same year his style became linear and stripped, broken down into multiple forms and facets with attenuated colors, close to that of the painter Henri Le Fauconnier. In 1910 a group began to form which included Gleizes, Metzinger, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées would often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire, , , Paul Fort, Pierre-Jean Jouve, Alexandre Mercereau, Jules Romains and André Salmon. Together with other young painters, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color. From 1910 onwards, Albert Gleizes was directly involved with Cubism, both as an artist and principle theorist of the movement.\n\nGleizes' evolvement in Cubism saw him exhibit at the twenty-sixth Salon des Indépendants in 1910. He showed his \"Portrait de René Arcos\" and \"L'Arbre\", two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified form had already begun to overwhelm the representational interest of the paintings. The same tendency is evident in Jean Metzinger's \"Portrait of Apollinaire\" in the same Salon. When Louis Vauxcelles wrote his initial review of the Salon he made a passing and imprecise reference to Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and Henri le Fauconnier, as \"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\"\n\nGuillaume Apollinaire, in his account of the same salon at the Grand Palais (in L'Intransigeant, 18 March 1910) remarked \"with joy\" that the general sense of the exhibition signifies \"La déroute de l'impressionnisme,\" in reference to the works of a conspicuous group of artists (Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Metzinger, André Lhote and Marie Laurencin). In Gleizes' paintings of the crucial year 1910, writes Daniel Robbins, \"we see the artist's volumetric approach to Cubism and his successful union of a broad field of vision with a flat picture plane. [...] The effort to grasp the intricate rhythms of a panorama resulted in a comprehensive geometry of intersecting and overlapping forms which created a new and more dynamic quality of movement.\n\nGleizes then exhibited at the 1910 Salon d'Automne with the same artists, followed by the first organized group showing by Cubists, in \"Salle 41\" of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants (\"La Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)\") together with Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism for the first time to the attention of the general public (Picasso and Braque were exhibiting in a private gallery selling to a small circle of connoisseurs). In a review of the 1911 Indépendants published in Le Petit Parisien (23 April 1911), critic Jean Claude writes:\n\nAt the 1911 Salon d'Automne (room 8) Gleizes exhibited his \"Portrait de Jacques Nayral\" and \"La Chasse (The Hunt)\", with, in addition to the group of \"Salle 41\", André Lhote, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye and André Dunoyer de Segonzac. In the fall of that year, though the intermediary of Apollinaire, he met Pablo Picasso for the first time and joined the Puteaux Group which held meetings in the studio of Jacques Villon (Gaston Duchamp) and also included Villon's brothers, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, amongst others. Many of these artists also frequented the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupole in Montparnasse.\n\n\"People crowded into our room, they shouted, they laughed, they got worked up, they protested, they luxuriated in all kinds of utterances\". (Albert Gleizes, on the Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1911)\n\nGleizes exhibited his \"Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)\" at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants; a show marked by Marcel Duchamp's \"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\", which itself caused a scandal even amongst the Cubists (Duchamp removed the painting before the opening of the exhibition). This was followed by a group show at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain, another exhibit in Moscow (Valet de Carreau), the Salon de la Société Normande in Rouen, and the Salon de la Section d'Or, October 1912 at the Galerie de la Boétie in Paris.\n\n1911 through 1912, drawing to some extent on theories of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry and Henri Bergson, Gleizes began to represent \"the object, no longer considered from a specific point of view, but rebuilt following a selection of successive viewpoints\" (i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous viewpoints, and in four-dimensions). This technique of relative motion is pushed to a its highest degree of complexity in the monumental \"Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)\" (1912). This ambitious work, with Delaunay's \"La Ville de Paris\" (\"City of Paris\"), is one of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism.\nAt the Salon d'Automne of 1912 Gleizes exhibited \"L'Homme au Balcon (Man on a Balcony)\", now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d'Automne created a controversy in the Municipal Council of Paris, leading to a debate in the Chambre des Députés about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such barbaric art. The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat. Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, published a major defence of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).\n\nIn \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: \"If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.\" Cubism itself, then, was not based on any geometrical theory, but corresponded better to non-Euclidean geometry than classical or Euclidean geometry. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension. Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid's model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a \"\"normal evolution of an art that was mobile like life itself\".\"\nIn contrast to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent was not to analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can only know our \"sensations\". Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, and how it was possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.\n\nGleizes' intent was to reconstitute and synthesize the real world according to his individual consciousness (\"sensations\"), through the use of volumes to convey the solidity and structure of objects. Their weight, placement and effects upon each other, and the inseparability of form and color, was one of the principal lessons of Cézanne. Forms were simplified and distorted, each shape and color modified by another, rather than splintered. His concern was to establish weight, density and volumetric relationships among sections of a broad subject. Gleizes himself characterized the 1910–11 phase of his work as an \"analysis of volume relationships,\" though it bears little relation to the traditional use of the word \"analytical\" in our understanding of Cubism.\n\n\"We laugh out loud when we think of all the novices who expiate their literal understanding of the remarks of a cubist and their faith in absolute truth by laboriously placing side by side the six faces of a cube and both ears of a model seen in profile.\" (Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger)\nA central theme of \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" was that access to the true essence of the world could be gained by \"sensations\" alone. The sensation offered by classical painting was very limited: to only one point of view, from a single point in space and frozen in time. But the real world is mobile, both spatially and temporally. Classical perspective and the formulations of Euclidean geometry were only \"conventions\" (to use Poincaré's term) that distance us from the truth of our sensations, from the truth of our own human nature. Man sees the world of natural phenomena from a multitude of angles that form a continuum of sensations in perpetual and continuous change. The Cubists' aim was to completely eschew absolute space and time in favor of relative motion, to grasp through sensory appearances and translate onto a flat canvas the dynamical properties of the four-dimensional manifold (the natural world). Only then could one achieve a better representation of the mobile reality of our living experience. If Gleizes and Metzinger write in Du \"Cubisme\" that we can only know our sensations, it is not because they wish to disregard them, but, on the contrary, to understand them more deeply as the primary source for their own work. In reasoning this way, Gleizes and Metzinger demonstrate that they are successors to Cézanne, who insists that everything must be learnt from nature: \"Nature seen and nature felt... both of which must unite in order to endure.\"\n\nIn February 1913, Gleizes and other artists introduced the new style of European modern art to an American audience at the Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to \"Man on a balcony (l'Homme au Balcon)\" no. 196, Gleizes exhibited at the Armory Show his 1910 \"Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)\", Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.\n\nGleizes published an article in Ricciotto Canudo's \"Montjoie!\" entitled \"Cubisme et la tradition\". It was through the intermediary of Canudo that Gleizes would meet the artist Juliette Roche; a childhood friend of Jean Cocteau and daughter of Jules Roche, an influential politician of the 3rd Republic.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Albert Gleizes re-enlisted in the French army. He was put in charge of organizing entertainment for the troops and as a result was approached by Jean Cocteau to design the set and costumes for the William Shakespeare play, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", along with Georges Valmier.\n\nDischarged from the military in the fall of 1915, Gleizes and his new wife, Juliette Roche, moved to New York, where they would meet regularly with Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Crotti (who would eventually marry Suzanne Duchamp). It is at this time that Gleizes witnessed, with a critical eye, the readymades of Marcel Duchamp. After a short stay at the Albemarle Hotel Gleizes and his wife settled at 103 West Street, where Gleizes painted a series of works inspired by jazz music, skyscrapers, luminous signs and the Brooklyn Bridge. Here Gleizes met Stuart Davies, Max Weber, Joseph Stella, and participated in a show at Montross Gallery with Duchamp, Crotti and Metzinger (who remained in Paris)\n\nFrom New York City, the couple sailed to Barcelona where they were joined by Marie Laurencin, Francis Picabia and his wife. The group spent the summer painting at the resort area of Tossa de Mar and in November Gleizes opened his first solo exhibition, at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, 29 November – 12 December 1916. Returning to New York city in 1917, Gleizes began writing poetic sketches in verse and in prose, some of which were published in Picabia's Dada periodical 391. Both Gleizes and his wife traveled from New York to Bermuda in September 1917, where he painted a number of landscapes. When the war in Europe ended they returned to France where his career evolved more towards teaching through writing and he became involved with the committee of the \"Unions Intellectuelles Françaises\".\n\nDuring the winter of 1918 at the Gleizes' rented house in Pelham New York, writes Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes came to his wife and said, \"A terrible thing has happened to me: I believe I am finding God.\" This new religious conviction resulted not from any mystical visions but instead from Gleizes' rational confrontation of three urgent problems: collective order, individual differences and the painter's role. Although Gleizes did not join the Church until 1941, his next twenty-five years were spent in a logical effort not only to find God but also to have faith.\n\nFrom 1914 and extending to the end of the New York period, Gleizes' nonrepresentational paintings and those with an apparent visual basis existed side by side, differing only, writes Daniel Robbins, in \"the degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience.\" Gleizes approached abstraction conceptually rather than visually and in 1924 his intricate dialectic caused him to produce two amusing paintings which departed from his usual subject matter: the Imaginary Still Lifes, Blue and Green. In effect, writes Robbins, \"Gleizes would have inverted Courbet's \"Show me an angel and I will paint you an angel\" to be \"As long as an angel remains an unembodied ideal and cannot be shown to me, I'll paint it.\"\n\nBy 1919 the pre-war sense of the Cubist movement had been virtually shattered. Paris was overshadowed by a strong reaction against those visions of common effort and revolutionary construction which Gleizes continued to embrace, while the avant-garde was characterized by the anarchic and, to him, destructive spirit of Dada. Neither alternative held any appeal for him and, with the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, his old hostility to Paris was constantly nourished. Gleizes' attempt to resuscitate the spirit of the Section d'Or was met with great difficulty, despite support by Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque and Léopold Survage. His own organizational efforts were directed towards the re-establishment of a European-wide movement of abstract artists in the form of a large travelling exhibition, the \"Exposition de la Section d’Or\", in 1920; it was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was passé for younger artists, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.\n\nIt was the revival of the Section d'Or which ensured that Cubism in general and Gleizes in particular would become Dada's preferred target. Similarly, an effort to organize an artists' cooperative received the support of Robert Delaunay, but of no other major artists. The polemic resulted in the publication of \"Du cubisme et des moyens de le comprendre\" by Albert Gleizes, followed in 1922 by \"Painting and its Laws (La Peinture et ses lois)\", within which appear the notion of \"translation\" and \"rotation\" that would ultimately characterize both the pictorial and theoretical aspects of Gleizes' art. His post-Cubist style of the twenties—flat, forthright, uncompromising—is virtually Blaise Pascal's \"Spirit of Geometry.\"\n\nGleizes was in nearly every sense a maverick Cubist, perhaps the most unyielding of them all; both in his paintings and writings (which had a big impact on the image of Cubism in Europe and the United States). He developed a single-minded, thoroughly uncompromising Cubism without the diversion of a classical alternative. During the 1920s Gleizes worked on a highly abstract brand of Cubism. In addition to his shows at Léonce Rosenberg's L'Effort Moderne, the dealer-publisher Povolozky printed his writings. His art was indeed backed by a prodigious theoretical effluence, most notably in \"La Peinture et ses lois\" (first published in \"La Vie des Lettres\", October 1922). Gleizes fused aesthetic, metaphysical, moral and social priorities to describe the status and function of art.\n\nIn \"La Peinture et ses lois\" writes Robbins, \"Gleizes deduced the rules of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the laws of the universe. This theory, later referred to as \"translation-rotation\", ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms.\" Flat planes were set in motion simultaneously to evoke space by shifting across one another, as if rotating and tilting on oblique axes. Diagrams entitled \"Simultaneous movements of rotation and shifting of the plane on its axis\" were published to illustrate the concept. \n\nGleizes undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in \"Painting and its Laws\" (\"La Peinture et ses lois\"), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal \"La Vie des lettres et des arts\", 1922-23, as a book in 1924, and reproduced in Léonce Rosenberg's \"Bulletin de l'Effort moderne\", no. 13, March 1925, no. 14, April 1925.\n\nOne of Gleizes's primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists \"fantaisie\", can it be attained?\n\nThe approach:\nGleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: \"The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation\" (p. 31); \"Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste\" (p. 42); \"The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]\" (p. 43); \"The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact\" (p. 56); \"Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion\" (p. 59); \"The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting\" (p. 22).\n\nContinuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p. 62). 'The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition' (p. 63).\n\nDefining the laws:\nRhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp. 35, 38, 51). This mechanism is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian , the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.\n\nThe problem set out by Gleizes was to replace \"anecdote\" as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.\n\nBeginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various symmetries such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions. (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.\n\nThe choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through \"translation\" and \"rotation\".\n\nSchematic illustrations:\n\nSpace and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.\n\nAnother movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.\n\nWith these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is \"a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states\". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.\n\nFig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a \"plastic spatial and rhythmic system\", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more \"complex\" than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the \"possibilities of the plane\" to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power. [\"L'exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d'un univers matériel en dehors de l'intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la \"possibilité du plan\" de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance\"].\n\nGleizes' painting of 1920–1922, submitted to the same rigor, were not Cubist in any conventional sense; but they \"were\" Cubist in their concern with planimetric space, and in their relationship (synthesis) with subject-matter. Indeed, the abstract appearance of these compositions is misleading. Gleizes had always remained committed to synthesis. He described how artists had freed themselves from the 'subject-image' as a pretext to work from the 'subjectless-image' (nebulous forms) until they came together. The images known from the natural world combined with those nebulous forms were made 'spiritually human'. Though Gleizes considered his works as initially nonrepresentational and only afterwards as denotational.\n\nBefore World War I, Gleizes had always been identified as a Cubist avant-garde. And during the twenties he continued to hold a prominent position, but he was no longer identified with the avant-garde since Cubism had been superseded by Dada and Surrealism. Even after historians began their attempts to analyze the vital role played by Cubism, the name of Albert Gleizes was always mentioned because of his early and important participation in the movement. Gleizes had never ceased to call himself a Cubist and theoretically a Cubist he remained. In many ways his theories were close to those developed by Mondrian, though his paintings never submitted to the discipline of primary colors and the right angle; they were not Neo-Plastic (or De Stijl) in character. In fact, his works from the late 1920s through the 1940s looked like nothing else that was being done, and indeed, they were rarely seen in the art world because Gleizes deliberately distanced himself from extensive participation in the Parisian scene.\n\nGleizes realized that his evolution towards 'purity' carried with it the risk of alienation from the 'mentality of the milieu', but he saw it as the sole means of arriving at a new type of art that could reach a mass audience (just as the French murals of the 11th and 12th centuries). In \"Du Cubisme et les moyens de comprendre\" (1920), Gleizes went so far as to envisage the mass-production of painting; as a means of undermining the market system and thus the status of artworks as commodities. 'The multiplication of pictures,' Gleizes wrote, 'strikes at the heart of the understanding and the economic notions of the bourgeois.'\n\nAfter World War I, with the support given by the dealer Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism returned as a central issue for artists. With the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, Gleizes attempted to resuscitate the spirit of the Section d'Or in 1920 but was met with great difficulty, despite support by Fernand Léger, Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque, Constantin Brâncuși, Henri Laurens, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Louis Marcoussis and Léopold Survage. Gleizes' organizational efforts were directed towards the establishment of a European-wide movement of Cubist and abstract art in the form of a large traveling exhibition; the \"Exposition de la Section d’Or\". The idea was to bring together a collection of works that revealed the complete process of transformation and renewal that had taken place. It was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was seen as passé for emerging artists and other established artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Picabia, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.\n\nIn addition to Cubists works (which already represented a wide variety of styles), the second edition of the Section d'Or held at the Galerie La Boétie from 5 March 1920 included De Stijl, Bauhaus, Constructivism and Futurism. It was the revival of the Section d'Or which ensured that Cubism in general would become Dada's preferred target. The new polemic resulted in the publication of \"Du cubisme et des moyens de le comprendre\" by Gleizes, followed in 1922 by \"La Peinture et ses lois\".\n\nFollowing the death of Jules Roche, the Gleizes' had enough independent income and real estate to pursue their goals without bowing to material considerations, unlike many other artists. The Gleizes' spent more and more time at the family home in Serrières, in Cavalaire, and an even quieter location on the French Riviera, both associating with people more sympathetic to their social ideas. Gleizes became active in the \"Union Intellectuelle\" and lectured extensively in France, Germany, Poland and England, while continuing to write. In 1924–25 the Bauhaus (where certain ideals analogous to his own were practiced) requested a new book on Cubism (as part of a series which included Wassily Kandinsky's \"Point and Line to Plane\", Paul Klee's \"Pedagogical Notebooks\", and Kasimir Malevich's \"The Non-Objective World\"). Gleizes, in response, would write \"Kubismus\" (published in 1928) for the collection of Bauhausbücher 13, Munich. The publication of Kubismus in French the following year would bring Gleizes closer to Delaunay. In 1924 Gleizes, Léger and Amédée Ozenfant opened \"Académie Moderne\".\n\nIn 1927, still dreaming of the communal days at the Abbaye de Créteil, Gleizes founded an artist's colony at a rented house called the \"\" in Sablons near his wife's family home in Serrières in the Ardèche département in the Rhône Valley.\n\nLéonce Rosenberg, in 1929, commissioned Gleizes (replacing Gino Severini) to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence, which would be installed in 1931. The same year Gleizes was part of the committee of Abstraction-Création (founded by Theo van Doesburg, Auguste Herbin, Jean Hélion and Georges Vantongerloo) that acted as a forum for international non-representational art, and counteracted the influence of the Surrealist group led by André Breton. By this time, his work reflected the strengthening of his religious convictions and his 1932 book, \"Vers une conscience plastique, La Forme et l’histoire\" examines Celtic, Romanesque, and Oriental art. On tour in Poland and Germany, he gave lectures titled \"Art et Religion, Art et Production\" and \"Art et Science\" and wrote a book on Robert Delaunay but it was never published.\nIn 1934 Gleizes began a series of paintings that would continue for several years, in which three levels are identified: \"static translation\", corresponding to his researches of the 1920s; \"mobile rotation\", corresponding to his researches into coloured cadences of the late 1920s and early 1930s; and \"simple grey arcs\" which, Gleizes argues, gives the 'form' or unifying 'rhythm' of the painting. The level of 'translation' is generally a geometrical figure evoking a representational image, unlike the work of the early 1930s. These works no longer articulate the strict non-representation of \"Abstraction Création\". Léonce Rosenberg—who had already published Gleizes extensively in his \"Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne\", but had not previously shown much enthusiasm for his painting—was deeply impressed by Gleizes' paintings (which followed from his 1934 research) at the Salon d'Automne. This was the beginning of a close relationship with Gleizes, which continued through the 1930s and is reflected in a stream of correspondence.\n\nIn 1937, Gleizes was commissioned to paint murals for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the Paris World’s Fair. He collaborated with Delaunay in the \"Pavillon de l'Air\" and with Léopold Survage and Fernand Léger for the \"Pavillon de l'Union des Artistes Modernes\". At the end of 1938, Gleizes volunteered to participate in the free seminars and discussion groups for young painters set up by Robert Delaunay at his Paris studio. Then Gleizes, in collaboration with Jacques Villon, conceived the idea of executing a mural for the auditorium of the École des Arts et Métiers; the latter was rejected by the school authorities as too abstract, but immense panels by Gleizes survive as \"Four Legendary Figures of the Sky\" (San Antonio, TX, McNay A. Inst.). Other examples of this ambitious public style include \"The Transfiguration\" (1939–41; Lyon, Mus. B.-A.).\nIn the late 1930s, the wealthy American art connoisseur Peggy Guggenheim purchased a great deal of the new art in Paris including works by Albert Gleizes. She brought these works to the United States which today form part of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.\n\nDuring World War II, Gleizes and his wife remained in France under the German occupation. In 1942 Gleizes began the series of \"Supports de Contemplation\", large scale, entirely non-representational paintings that are both very complex and very serene. Materials being difficult to obtain during the war, Gleizes painted on burlap, sizing the porous material with a mixture of glue and paint. He had used burlap in some of his earliest paintings and now found it favorable to his vigorous touch, for it took the most powerful strokes even while preserving the matte surface he so valued. In 1952, Gleizes realized his last major work, a fresco titled \"Eucharist\" that he painted for a Jesuit chapel in Chantilly.\n\nAlbert Gleizes died in Avignon in the Vaucluse département on 23 June 1953 and was interred in his wife's family mausoleum in the cemetery at Serrières.\n\nIn 2010, \"Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon)\" (1911), oil on canvas, 146.4 x 114.4 cm, sold for 1,833,250 GBP ($2,683,878, or 2,198,983 Euros) at Christie's, London.\n\n\"Gleizes' individual development, his unique struggle to reconcile forces,\" writes Daniel Robbins, \"made him one of the few painters to come out of Cubism with a wholly individual style, undeflected by later artistic movements. Although he occasionally returned to earlier subjects... these later works were treated anew, on the basis of fresh insights. He never repeated his earlier styles, never remained stationary, but always grew more intense, more passionate. [...] His life ended in 1953 but his paintings remain to testify to his willingness to struggle for final answers. His is an abstract art of deep significance and meaning, paradoxically human even in his very search for absolute order and truth.\" (Daniel Robbins, 1964)\n\nIn celebration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, the Musée de La Poste in Paris presented a show entitled \"Gleizes – Metzinger. Du cubisme et après\", from 9 May to 22 September 2012. Over 80 paintings and drawings, along with documents, films and 15 works by other members of the Section d'Or group (Villon, Duchamp-Villon, Kupka, Le Fauconnier, Lhote, La Fresnaye, Survage, Herbin, Marcoussis, Archipenko...) were included in the show. A catalogue in French and English was published for the event. A French postage stamp is issued representing works by Gleizes (\"Le Chant de Guerre\", 1915) and Metzinger (\"L'Oiseau Bleu\", 1913). This is the first time that a museum has organized an exhibit showcasing both Gleizes and Metzinger together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Various library societies grew to prominence in the mid-19th Century, including the Antigua Library Society and the Presbyterian Church Library. The colonial government transformed the Antigua Library Society into the Antigua Public Library in 1854.\n\nOn 8 October 1974, a destructive earthquake hit the island, causing the old wooden building to be damaged and closed. A sign was affixed to the building noting \"This building was damaged in the earthquake of 1974. Repairs are pending\", and the library was relocated to a small area upstairs above a dry good store on Market Street, St Johns. That the sign was still in place a decade and more after the earthquake was a major theme of \"A Small Place\", a 1988 book by Jamaica Kincaid, which suggested that the continued use of the inadequate building, too small to house all the books from the old library, demonstrated the indifference of the post-colonial government to matters of culture and learning.\n\nThe Antigua and Barbuda High Commission noted in 2002 that construction of a new modern library was \"progressing well\". An EC$1 million donation from Allen Stanford was received in December 2004, in order to reduce the time for completion of the library from the 'too long' one year to six months, with a promise from him to match further donations received. The High Commission noted in 2006 that the library would be ready by quarter 1 2007, and in late 2007 that the library 'must be delivered' in the first half of 2008. A $6.45 million contract was signed to complete the library in 2008 by March 2009. The construction was handed over by the Antigua Public Works Department, which had built the incomplete library structure to Gilcon Enterprises, a local firm, which then had its contract withdrawn due to delays in pricing the job, and then passed onto Antigua & Barbuda Contractors Enterprises Limited, a local construction consortium. The new consortium examined the site in September 2008, noting that it had numerous structural defects, delaying scheduled completion from mid-2009 to the end of 2009. Work on the library was again suspended in 2011, but resumed late in January 2013. The building itself was competed and dedicated in September 2014, but it is unclear whether or not the library as such is currently serving the public.\n\n\n"}

The curriculum is developed and reviewed by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, an independent statutory body. Since 2014 all states and territories in Australia have begun implementing aspects of the Foundation to Year 10 part of the curriculum.\n\nCredentialing, and related assessment requirements and processes, remain the responsibility of states and territories.\n\nThe full Australian Curriculum can be accessed at its own website.\n\nThe learning areas in the Australian Curriculum are as follows:\n\nA nationwide curriculum has been on the political agenda in Australia for several decades. In the late 1980s a significant push for a national curriculum in Australia was mounted by the Hawke Federal Labor government. Draft documentation was produced but failure to achieve agreement from the mainly Liberal State governments led to the abandonment of this initiative in 1991.\n\nIn 2006, then Liberal Prime Minister John Howard called for a \"root and branch renewal\" of Australian history teaching at school level, ostensibly in response to building criticism of Australian students' (and Australians more widely) perceived lack of awareness of historical events. The Howard government convened the Australian History Summit in August 2006 to commence the process of drafting a national History curriculum. The Summit recommended that Australian History be a compulsory part of the curriculum in all Australian schools in years 9 and 10. The Australian History External Reference Group was then commissioned by the government to develop a \"Guide to Teaching Australian History in Years 9 and 10\". The Reference Group comprised Geoffrey Blainey, Gerard Henderson, Nicholas Brown and Elizabeth Ward, and was presented with a draft proposal prepared earlier by the historian Tony Taylor. The \"Guide\" was released to the public on 11 October 2007, but little was achieved toward its implementation following the Howard government's defeat at the federal election in November 2007. The current Labor initiated National History Curriculum remains politically contentious.\n\nIn April 2008, the Rudd Government established the independent National Curriculum Board. Tony Taylor, who had written the original draft for the Howard government-appointed Australian History External Reference Group, told \"The Age\" that he expected that the Reference Group's \"Guide to Teaching Australian History\" would be discarded by the new Board. Taylor had expressed public disapproval of the changes made to his original draft, both by the Reference Group and, Taylor suspected, by Howard himself. Taylor was of the opinion that the \"Guide\" had sought to establish a curriculum that was \"too close to a nationalist view of Australia's past\", and hoped that the new Board would produce a curriculum that was more in line with what Taylor saw as Rudd's \"regional and global world view\". In September 2008, the Board appointed four academics to draft \"framing documents\" which would establish a broad direction for the National Curriculum in each of four subject areas: History (Stuart Macintyre), English (Peter Freebody), Science (Denis Goodrum) and Mathematics (Peter Sullivan). In May 2009 the statutory Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) was established to oversee the implementation of the planned nationwide curriculum initiative.\n\nThe Australian Curriculum has experienced implementation issues due to reluctance or slowness by some States in changing state curricula. New South Wales in particular has delayed its roll out of the new curriculum.\n\nIn May 2010, Anna Patty, an education editor for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", criticised the Australian Curriculum on the basis that it \"threatens to water down the content\" for senior students, compared with the existing Higher School Certificate. Under the new curriculum, students would have to learn statistics in mathematics, while the Extension 1 and 2 topics would be replaced with an easier specialist maths course. Patty said that the English courses would focus more on language and literacy, and less on literature, and that the curriculum would disadvantage gifted students.\n\nIn September 2010, the NSW Board of Studies criticised the then draft Australian Curriculum, saying that it was inferior to the NSW curriculum. Among other criticisms, the Board said that the draft K-10 curriculum lacked an overarching framework, was overcrowded with content, diminished the teaching of literature, and that the maths curriculum failed to cater to the full range of students.\n\nIn October 2010, Peter Brown, a mathematics lecturer of the University of New South Wales, criticised the Australian Curriculum for lack of flexibility within the Year 9-10 and the Year 11-12 syllabuses by the removal of extension maths courses. Brown also said that the National Curriculum would \"dumb down\" the year 12 curriculum then offered in NSW.\n\nIn October 2013, conservative economist Judith Sloan criticised the business and economics components of the Australian Curriculum in particular, and offered the general criticism that \"[t]he real rationale for a national school curriculum relates to the pursuit of centralised control by the federal government and the scope to impose fashionable values dressed up as the pursuit of educational excellence\".\n\n\n"}

He was a Senior Lecturer in Development Administration, Public Policy Analysis and Institutions, and Development at University of Malawi's Chancellor College.\n\nThe stand off began when Dr Blessings Chinsinga, who was an associate political science professor, was interrogated by Peter Mukhito, Malawi’s Inspector General of Police. In a political science lecture he had drawn comparisons between Malawi’s fuel crisis and popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring. This comparison was reported to the police and he was eventually fired along with Jessie Kabwira Kapasula, Gaston Kanchedzera and Edge Kanyongoro.\n\nThis move received much criticism from faculty at the university including president of the Chancellor College Academic Staff Union (CCASU), Jessie Kabwila-Kapasula. It also prompted protests from the University of Malawi students, predominantly from the Chancellor College and Polytechnic campuses, who stood in solidarity with Chinsinga and CCASU in support of academic freedom. The protest led to the eventual closing of UNIMA's Chancellor College and Polytechnic.\n\nIt led to the involvement of the then Minister Education, Peter Mutharika and his brother President Bingu wa Mutharika. President Mutharika ordered the lecturers back to class.\n\nAs a condition to return to class, the academics asked for an official apology from the police chief, Peter Mukhito and assurances of respect for academic freedom. The police Inspector General Mukhito declared that academic freedom had to be balanced because this was an issue of national security. This statement was supported by Bingu wa Mutharika who encouraged him not to apologize because of a 'mere lecture'. The failure to resolve this matter and a stand off occurred between lecturers and students on one side, and the President of Malawi, Bingu wa Mutharika. The students stood in solidarity with the fired faculty which resulted in the use of teargas to disperse students and an indefinite closure of the university.\n\nAn Academic Freedom Commission to solve the academic stand off was formed headed by former chancellor Brown Chimphamba.\n\nThe register closed the two colleges of the university under the orders of the then President, who is both the Commander-in-Chief of the Malawi Police Service and Chancellor of the University of Malawi, in defiance of a court order that the lecturers had obtained.\nA court order had also a court order halted the dismissal of the staff and prevented the university council from withholding salaries of the lecturers. Thus a complete lock-out of campuses of the two colleges could not be achieved. Authorities eventually ordered the indefinite closure of the two colleges.\n\nThe Academic Stand off was one of the factors that led to the July 20, 2011 nationwide protests. Civil society was demanding the reinstatement of the professor and the guarantee of academic freedom.\n\n\n"}

She attended Wesley Vale Area School from 1959 to 1963, St Mary's College, Hobart as a boarder from 1964 to 1969, and completed her final year of schooling at Devonport High School in 1970.\n\nShe studied history and political science at the University of Tasmania from 1971 to 1974, where she resided at Ena Waite University College and was elected its President. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours in Australian History, and a Certificate of Education in March 1975.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1984 Milne worked as a secondary school teacher, teaching English, History and Social Science at Parklands High School, Devonport High School and Don College. She first came to public attention for her role in opposing the building of the Wesley Vale pulp mill near Bass Strait in North Western Tasmania on the basis of its environmental impact. She also participated in the ultimately successful campaign opposing the Franklin Dam and was arrested and jailed in 1983. She worked as a research officer with the Australian Bicentennial Historical Records Search from 1987 to 1988.\n\nMilne was first elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1989 as a member of the Tasmanian Greens in the electorate of Lyons, one of five Green politicians elected at that election. She was part of the Labor–Green Accord, a political agreement between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Tasmanian Greens to form government after the 1989 general election had resulted in a hung parliament. When Bob Brown stood down in 1993 to contest the federal election, she became leader of the Greens in the Tasmanian Parliament and the first female leader of a political party in Tasmania.\n\nShe oversaw a loose alliance between the Greens and Liberals after the 1996 general election. During that time, Tasmania saw significant economic and social reform. Measures included gun law reform, liberalisation of gay laws, an apology to the Indigenous stolen generation and support for an Australian republic. \n\nIn 1998, the major parties voted to restructure the House of Assembly from 35 to 25 seats, increasing the quota of votes required to be elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Liberal Premier Tony Rundle immediately called an election, which his party subsequently lost. Due to the changes, Milne lost her seat, leaving the Greens with one remaining seat.\n\nAfter her career in state politics, she was an adviser to Senator Bob Brown from 2000 until she was elected to represent Tasmania in the Federal Senate at the 2004 federal election. Preferences to Family First from the Australian Labor Party almost prevented her from being elected; however, she managed to reach a quota mostly as a result of the high level of below-the-line voting in Tasmania. The other Green elected at that election was Rachel Siewert from Western Australia. Milne was part of Bob Brown's frontbench covering the portfolios of Arts, Climate change, Competition Policy & Small Business, Finance & Administration, Food Security, Regional Australia, Resources & Energy, and Trade.\n\nMilne was Vice-President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union) from 2005 to 2008.

Ing.\") is a postgraduate degree in engineering \"(see Engineer's Degrees in Europe)\" awarded by the French Grandes Écoles in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French Baccalauréat.\n\nEach holder of the diplôme d'ingénieur is also conferred the title of \"Ingénieur diplômé\" (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term \"'ingénieur\"' (engineer) which is non-regulated and can be loosely used as a generic title based on one's professional position or nature of work rather than formal academic qualifications. \n\nDiplôme d'ingénieur graduates from reputable institutions often access the French job market with a significant advantage compared to PhDs. However, this is not always true for all industries, and roles that require high technical expertise (especially research in specific area) will favor a specialized master's or PhD qualification. \n\nThe title \"Ingénieur diplômé\" is a strictly regulated and protected by the French state. Any institution issuing the diplôme d'ingénieur must be accredited by the Commission des titres d'ingénieur (within the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research) which is the official administrative body responsible for evaluating higher education institutions to train professional engineers in France. Anyone found to be misusing the title of \"Ingénieur diplômé\" is liable to a €15,000 fine and a one-year sentence in prison.\n\nSince the signing of the Bologna Process in 1999, the European Master's Degree is also conferred by the state to the holder of a diplôme d'ingénieur, but the converse is not true. This is because the diplôme d'ingénieur is recognised to include, but significantly surpass, a Bologna Process Master's Degree. \n\nThe diplôme d'ingénieur is also recognized in the United States by the AACRAO since 2013 as \"Master of Science in Engineering\".\n\nFrance is particular in that only accredited Grandes Écoles in engineering are certified to issue the diplôme d'ingénieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (Universités).\n\nUniversities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc) with a large student body. By law, admission to a French university is non-competitive and open to anyone with a high school diploma. On the other hand, Grandes Écoles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with very selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide), with the minimum qualification being 2 years of post-baccalureate studies in scientific classes préparatoires, three to four years University studies (Bachelors or Masters), or an otherwise equivalent training for foreign students, in order to be admitted to the engineer training in one of the Grandes Écoles.\n\nThe engineer training leading to the diplôme d'ingénieur may vary significantly among the Grandes Écoles in terms of curriculum structure, despite the same accreditation from CTI. In general, the most prestigious (therefore highly selective) Grandes Écoles tend to offer a multidisciplinary curriculum for their flagship engineer program, exposing students to various fields of study with each courses taught at a graduate level. The multidisciplinary engineer program in the so-called 'generalist' Grandes Écoles is usually considered to be more competitive and intensive than specialized master's degree programs. However, this is not always the case, and there are a number of well-established Grandes Écoles that focus on a specialized curriculum for their engineer program.\n\nStudent engineers in Grandes Écoles are educated in close cooperation with the various industries through academic-industry partnerships, which introduce graduates to professional life while giving them a solid grounding in their discipline. As many graduates will advance to positions leading future projects and teams, courses related to management and professional training are also included in the curriculum.\n\nIn addition to the core curriculum in engineering and science, the French engineer training often includes, and is not limited to:\n\nMore than 90 percent of the French engineer programs require at least one internship (typically in a business setting) at some point in the curriculum.\n\nMost schools arrange three types of internships that train the students with progressive responsibilities, initially as observers and increasingly as actors, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding and perspective of all levels of responsibility and roles within the industry. One can distinguish “worker” (blue-collar) internships, “senior technician” internships, and “graduate” internships where the students perform the same type of work they will do as graduate engineers. Internships are graded and constitute part of the academic degree requirements.\n\n"}

Students are typically 16–17 years of age, depending on the country and the students' birthdays.\n\nIn Australia, Year Eleven is typically the twelfth year of education and fifth (except South Australia, which it is the fourth) year of high school education. Although there are slight variations between the states, most students in Year Eleven are aged around fifteen, sixteen or seventeen. Queensland year-eleven students are the youngest in the country, as they usually enter at age fifteen.\n\nIn New South Wales, Year Eleven is the shortest year as it only lasts three whole terms. Year Twelve begins its first term where Year Eleven would have its fourth.\n\nYear Eleven is followed by Year Twelve, the final year of high school.\n\nGrade eleven is the first year of college in Bangladesh. Students in this grade are sixteen to\nseventeen years old and get the chance to study in this grade after passing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or equivalent exam. In Bangladesh this grade is also referred as 'Class 11' or 'Inter first year' or 'Intermediate first year' or 'HSC first year' etc.\n\nIn Belgium, the 11th grade is called \"5ème secondaire\" in the French speaking part of the country, and \"5de middelbaar\" in the Dutch speaking part.\n\nIn Brazil, the 11th grade is called \"Segundo Ano do Ensino Médio\", which means 2nd year of medium school (not to be confused with middle school). Students tend to be 16 years old.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the 11th grade it's the penultimate year of the high-school (gymnasium) stage. Students tend to be 17-18 years old.\n\nIn all provinces and territories, except Quebec, a student continues to Grade 12 to complete their high school, or secondary, education. In Quebec, Grade 11 (sec. 5) is the final year of secondary education, followed by college, a pre-university level unique to Quebec.\n\nThe eleventh grade is the last year in secondary education. In this year, all students are required to do an internship in any subject field. To differentiate from Universities' internships, the practice is called 'alphabetisation'; most of the time is related to community services, such as teaching in schools, or assisting in hospitals or libraries. Students also do the ICFES National Test and they present to the draft for the Colombian Army. By law, the army cannot recruit under-age students; most of eleventh-graders are aged 16-17, and the draft is almost changed for the payment of a monetary fee. This year is called the senior year.\n\nIn Finland there are three years of high school, which starts in 11th grade at the age of 16. 10th grade is usually skipped. \nThe equivalent is the , which is the penultimate year of Secondary education in France (followed by the ).\n\nIn Hong Kong, 11th grade is called Form 5.\n\nIn India, after appearing for the boards, the percentages determine the streams in which the student can study. \n\nThere are three streams:\nThe combination of streams can vary from Institutions.\n\nBut in abroad places, the streams are determined by the model exam, which is under the school. The stream which the students opt for are the basis of which degree they can study. Generally eleventh grade is known as +1 which originates from the term 10+1. This year is generally the continuation of grade 9 and grade 12 is the continuation of grade 10.\nA student can also change his stream in the middle of the academic year from Science to other streams, but the reverse cannot be done. \nIn Grade 11, students prepare for the entrance tests of various colleges and universities across the country.\n\nIt is Fifth Year or Cúigú Bhliain of Secondary School (for 15- to 17-year-olds as there is an optional year beforehand). In this year, students prepare for the Leaving Certificate.\n\nIn Italy, eleventh grade is called *Terza superiore* \n(3rd class of the Superior/High School, two years left).\n\nIn Malaysia, 11th grade also known as Form 5 in secondary school. The students at this stage are 17 years old, and it is the fifth and last year in the secondary school. (Compare to Form 6 or known as 12th grade).\n\nIn some parts the eleventh grade is the second year of high school. Most students enter this grade as 16 year olds, but some might enter early as 15 and late as 17.\n\nIn Norway, the eleventh year of education is the first year of \"Videregående skole\", equivalent to high school. It is very rarely referred to as the eleventh grade, but rather the first grade of \"Videregående\" or VG1. Although \"Videregående skole\" is not compulsory for Norwegians, approximately 93% of people aged 16-18 enroll. There is no upper age limit for starting or finishing \"Videregående skole\", but students cannot enroll earlier than the year they turn 16.\n\nIn New Zealand, \"Year 12\" is the equivalent of eleventh grade, with students aged 16 or 17 during the years. It is the fourth year of secondary school and the twelfth year of compulsory education. During Year 12, most students complete Level 2 of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), the country's main national qualification for secondary school students. Students in Year 12 typically study English (or Te Reo Māori) and a minimum of five elective subjects with mathematics highly recommended.\n\nGrade eleven is the first of two years in college (grade twelve being the last and final year before postgraduate and university education) and is equivalently referred to as \"first year.\" Students in this year level are fifteen to sixteen years old. Students get to select from the following subjects:\n\nPre-medical (Biology, Physics, Chemistry)\n\nPre-engineering (Math, Physics, Chemistry)\n\nCommerce\n\nHumanities\n\nScience\n\nHome economics \n\nArts\n\nAnd the compulsory subjects are Urdu, Islamic studies(1st year only) and Pakistan studies (2nd year only). The students can select the preferred subject on the basis of SSC result (9th and 10th grade)\n\nIn the Philippines, Grade 11 is the first year of Senior High School. Topics discussed depend on the four tracks and their strands.\n\n\nSince school year 2016-2017. Students are usually 16–17 years old.\n\nThe eleventh grade is final year of secondary education, the end of the high school, and it is an examinational year, when training to USE is being more powerful, than in tenth grade. Priority of education in this year is given to repeat the material learned in high school (Fifth to Tenth years) in Mathematics, Russian language and in exam subjects by pupils' choice.\n\nIn Singapore, 11th grade is equivalent of Secondary 5 level.\n\nOnly people taking N Levels (normal academic levels) will go to secondary 5, those in express streams will take their O levels (ordinary levels) in secondary 4, and then continue to a Junior College for 2 years or Polytechnic for 3 years.\n\nThe closest equivalent to the eleventh grade is the first year of Bachillerato. It is for pupils aged 16 to 17. It is a year of many changes when pupils can start to choose what they would like to study in the future at university.\n\nThis is the second year of Upper Secondary School.\n\nYear 12, or Lower Sixth form, is comparable to the 11th grade in the US. It is the sixth and penultimate year of secondary education. For students who entered secondary school before September 2008, it is not compulsory to attend these last two years. During Year 12, three Advanced Subsidiary units are completed per subject (either written exams, coursework or a mixture, depending on subject). Often students choose four AS-Level subjects in Year 12 (some students may decide to take three or five).\n\nStudents then enter Year 13 (equivalent to 12th grade) and may choose to drop a subject, going on to complete three subjects. Successful completion generally results in the award of A-Level qualifications, though BTECs can be received.\n\nIn Scotland, fifth year (of secondary education) or S5 is optional, where pupils will generally sit Higher qualifications which form the core entry requirements for university. It is followed by an optional final sixth year (also known as S6). The students ages normally range from 16-17 in this year.\n\nThe system is similar to the English one at this age. Lower Sixth Form (Year 13), pupils start on a two-year course, at the end of which they will hopefully have gained three 'A' Levels in their chosen subjects.\n\nIn the US, a student in the eleventh grade is typically referred to as a third year high school student or \"junior \". The vast majority of students who are classified as juniors take the SAT Reasoning Test and/or ACT in the second semester of their third year of high school. Math students usually take Algebra II, but classes like Trigonometry or Precalculus are sometimes offered for students who wish to take Advanced Placement math classes in their fourth year aka senior year of high school. Depending on the location there may be a combination of any of the listed subjects. They may also take easier courses such as Algebra I and Geometry if they do not have the required prerequisites for the more advanced courses that are listed above. Students who are advanced in mathematics often take Calculus or Statistics. \n\nIn science classes, third year students are taught usually Biology, Physics or Chemistry especially Lab Chemistry. Atoms, molecules, and Stoichiometry is taught as well. Some school districts will have these certain subjects as a required science credit while others will begin to have the option of science electives.\n\nIn English class, a college-preparatory curriculum would also include American literature. Often, English literature (also referred to as British literature) is taught in the third year of high school. Books and authors learned include \"The Glass Menagerie\", \"The Scarlet Letter\", \"The Crucible\", \"The Great Gatsby\", \"Of Mice and Men\", \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Jonathan Edwards, Amy Tan, and Lorraine Hansberry.\n\nIn a social studies curriculum, third year students in the United States are usually taught US history or the world from the 1870s to the 21st Century. They may also acquire more advanced world culture and geography knowledge, along with some more-advanced social studies such as psychology, economics, sociology and government.\n\nMany high school third year students in the United States opt to take a foreign language, even though it is not required in many secondary schools curricula.\n\nWhile normally followed by twelfth grade, some colleges will accept excelling students out of this grade as part of an early college entrance program. Alternatively, some students may choose to graduate early through standardized testing or advanced credits.\n\n"}

She taught at a district school in Maine and ran a small private school. She also worked at typesetting for a while but found that the pay for women in that field was not very good. She then began working as a cook in a charity kindergarten and nursery in Boston; she was allowed to take classes which eventually allowed her to teach kindergarten. She began teaching at a charity summer school in Boston and then taught in Waterbury, Connecticut. In 1885, she married George S. Abbott. She continued to teach and later operated a kindergarten out of her home. She served as secretary of the Connecticut Valley Kindergarten Association. Abbott also helped found the Old and New woman's club in Malden, Massachusetts and was the main founder for the Woman's Club of Waterbury.\n\nAbbott and her husband later moved into her family's home in Malden.

From 1995–1999, he was the artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet and from 2002–2008 he was again artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet. He has directed several productions of August Bournonville's ballets. Since 1997, he has been an advisor to the National Ballet of China, visiting the People’s Republic on many occasions. His dancing has been qualified as conveying love of life, humour and charm in roles such as Geert in \"The Kermesse in Bruges\", Gurn in \"La Sylphide\", Frants in \"Coppélia\", and Puck in John Neumeier's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1980).\n\nIn 2010, Andersen, together with his wife Eva Kloborg, also a ballet dancer and choreographer, instructed a group of Vietnamese dancers from the Vietnam National Opera & Ballet in Bournonville's ballet.

A 1963 letter to the \"New York Times\" claimed that it was started by a man named Lothrop Withington Jr., who was a freshman at Harvard University and supposedly did so as part of a bid to become class president. The stunt started a competition between multiple universities such as Penn State, MIT, and Harvard in an attempt to surpass one another. Women also took part in the trend, as in April 1939 Marie Hensen from the University of Missouri was recorded as the first woman to swallow a goldfish. \n\nAlthough once widely practiced, the stunt is rare today, but has made appearances in recent entertainment. In 2000, \"Jackass\" star Steve-O swallowed a live goldfish, only to vomit it moments later.\n\nAnother possibility in the origins of goldfish swallowing comes from Chicago bartenders, most notably Matt Schulien (who performed magic while tending bar at his family's restaurant), who would cut up carrots to look like goldfish tails. When performing the stunt, bartenders would reach into a bowl of goldfish kept behind the bar while palming the carrot piece, placing that in between their pursed lips, using their tongues to lever it up and down to mimic the actions of a live fish, finally swallowing the carrot piece. The trick dates back to the 1920s, and some people believe that the fad could have been started by college students fooled by the trick.\n\nAccording to the National Museum of American History, goldfish swallowing was such a craze at universities during the early 20th century that it made appearances in several news publications, including the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\". \n\nThe stunt became so popular that Massachusetts State Senator George Krapf filed a bill to \"preserve the fish from cruel and wanton consumption.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18012259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18012259", "title": "Henry Charles Taylor", "text": "Henry Charles Taylor\n\nHenry Charles Taylor (April 16, 1873 – April 28, 1969) was an American agricultural economist. As an early pioneer in the field, he has been called the \"father of agricultural economics\" in the United States. Taylor established the first university department dedicated to agricultural economics in the United States in 1909 during his time at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He also had a brief but very influential career in the United States Department of Agriculture from 1919 to 1925, where he helped reorganize its offices and became head of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Coming from a rural farm community himself, Taylor's foremost goal was always to try to improve the living conditions of farmers.\n\nTaylor was born in Iowa on a farm near Stockport. Growing up, he witnessed his father, Tarpley Taylor, expand his farm from about to by buying small farms from early settlers. From an early age he was able to see how proper land and economic management reinforced each other. Additionally, Taylor had been impacted by the depressions of the late 19th century, especially that of the 1890s, and what devastating effects they had on farmers. He entered Drake University to do two years of preparatory work, then went on to Iowa State College, where he received his B.S. in agriculture in 1896, then his M.S. in agriculture in 1898. He then joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison to earn his Ph.D. Taylor's original intention upon going to Wisconsin was to take up a career as a statesman in order to represent farmers. However he soon realized that his economics study offered more than he was expecting. Later in his career, he stated that \"90 per cent of what could be done for the farmers was what they could do for themselves by adjusting production.\" Inspired by economics professor Richard T. Ely, he left in 1899 to travel through Europe, briefly studying economics at the London School of Economics in Britain and at the University of Halle-Wittenberg and the University of Berlin in Germany. His doctoral dissertation was on \"The Decline of Land Owners Farmers in England,\" which had him traveling by bicycle to visit more than a hundred farms. Taylor returned to Wisconsin in 1901 to complete his degree in economics in 1902.\n\nHe stayed on at the faculty of the University of Wisconsin until 1919. Room was made for him in the Department of General Economics and the School of Commerce to teach economic geography and economic history. However, as he later noted there was nothing in the budget to provide for his area of interest, agricultural economics. Ely suggested that he simply teach the given courses and slowly develop work on agricultural economics. Upon approaching the dean with the idea, he was told there would be no place for such courses for the next ten years. Nevertheless, by the winter of 1902-03, Ely had arranged for fourteen lectures to be given to agricultural students on the economics of farm management. The dean was impressed by the prepared syllabus and eventually Taylor set up an agricultural economics course for four-year students. He devoted himself by 1903 to founding a Department of Agricultural Economics at the University for both research and teaching. Taylor wrote the first agricultural economics textbook in the United States in 1905. He also adapted a dot map system with William J. Spillman to show historical shifts in agricultural production.\n\nBy 1909 he was successful in creating the new department, the first devoted to agricultural economics in the United States. By this time he had also broadened the scope of the field to include rural sociology. In 1910 he authored the first Wisconsin Experiment Station bulletin on agricultural economics, on the \"Methods of Renting Farm Lands in Wisconsin\". Taylor also worked with the Wisconsin state government after being spurred on by Charles McCarthy, an advocate of cooperation between the government, farmers, and universities. Wisconsin's new Department of Agriculture was asked to provide leadership in improving the marketing of dairy as the state was seeing a recent shift toward greater milk production. Taylor used this as an opportunity to secure funding from the government to create a new faculty position for marketing. For this, he invited his long-time friend and head of the Department of Economics at Iowa State College Benjamin Horace Hibbard. He joined the department in 1913 to become its second faculty member.\n\nTaylor was also a founding member of the Farm Management Association, which later became the American Farm Economic Association. He served as its president in 1920.\n\nFrom 1909 to 1910 he assisted the Bureau of the Census to plan its schedule for the agricultural census, as well as for a special census of plantations. Taylor chose to join the United States Department of Agriculture for the chance at giving a national role to agricultural economics, even though the new position meant a large reduction in salary. He moved to Washington D.C. in 1919 to take charge of the USDA's Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics. Not long after his arrival in Washington, the wartime prices of farm products collapsed, which proved disastrous for a great number of farmers. In 1920, President Harding appointed Henry C. Wallace, who knew Taylor and was himself a great supporter of farmers, as the new Secretary of Agriculture. Taylor soon became Chief of the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, while also being part of a commission to reorganize the offices of the USDA. For him this was a chance to consolidate the economics work of the department which had been scattered through many offices. In 1922, Wallace appointed him chief of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which subsumed the former Office of Farm Management and Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates (today the Agricultural Research Service and Agricultural Marketing Service). Among Taylor's tasks in the USDA were the expansion of agricultural information services, creating foreign outposts for the USDA to better collect information on world production and consumption, standardizing the grading of exported American crops, especially cotton, and inaugurating the Agricultural Outlook Service. He also brought many talented new people into the USDA. Among them, two of his Ph.D. students he had already sent to work with Spillman, Oscar C. Stine and Oliver Edwin Baker, and Lewis Cecil Gray, who he persuaded to go with him to Washington.\n\nOne of the major issues at the time was the controversy surrounding the first McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill in 1924 and other farmer subsidies proposals, however Taylor later stated his own involvement was only indirect. The bill was not supported by the White House but had support from much of the Department of Agriculture. Wallace died unexpectedly in late 1924, and Taylor had lost one of his greatest supporters. President Coolidge appointed William Marion Jardine as the new Secretary of Agriculture in 1925. Although he knew Taylor and they possibly were friends, Coolidge appointed Jardine on the condition that he get rid of Taylor. Jardine asked him to step down and he would try to find him a government position of equivalent rank. Taylor ignored the request and carried on his work, stating that he himself never actively supported the McNary-Haugen Bill or any other such program. Taylor was dismissed from his post officially on August 15, 1925. Despite his short government career, he was still able to make major contributions to the Department of Agriculture, which had become one of the first great economic research organizations in the United States. Disappointed by his termination, he went on to give speeches to farm groups, especially in Iowa, with the main message that Washington was more interested in providing cheap food to urban workers than the welfare of farmers. Taylor wrote of his experience in government in 1926 in a 317-page manuscript called \"A Farm Economist in Washington, 1919-1925.\" Although intended to be released as a book to the public, it was never published.\n\nTaylor returned to his academic career, briefly rejoining Ely, then going to Northwestern University to work with the Institute for Research in Land Economics until 1928. He then went to New England for three years to serve as Director of the Survey of Rural Vermont. Taylor then left the United States and traveled through Japan, China, Korea, and India as a member of the Commission of Appraisal of the Layman's Foreign Missions Inquiry for one year, in which he reviewed the work done by missionaries on rural problems. He then went to Rome to serve as the United States member of the Permanent Committee of the International Institution of Agriculture between 1933 and 1935.\n\nHe returned to the United States in 1935 on request from Illinois Governor Frank Lowden to serve as Managing Director of the recently created Farm Foundation in Chicago until 1945, where he focused on the broad problems of rural communities and worked to establish a relationship between researchers in the USDA and state agricultural colleges. He also worked closely with Oscar C. Stine on studying the history and development of agricultural economics. In 1936 he also served as president of the Agricultural History Society, of which he was a life member. In 1945 he was transferred to Washington D.C. to serve as Agricultural Economist for the Farm Foundation. This allowed him to devote himself to writing his book, \"The Story of Agricultural Economics\", with his wife Anne Dewees Taylor, and the foundation's sponsorship. With its completion in 1952, Taylor began a study of land scarcity in highly industrialized nations like England, Germany, and Japan, and how their economies were adapting with the loss of their colonies. He stayed active to the end of his life. Taylor regularly attended the meetings of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists until he was 90, and also worked to complete a 100-year history of the original Taylor farm, Tarplewick, started by his parents in Iowa in 1861.\n\nEven before his death he had become known as the \"father of agricultural economics\" in the United States. However Taylor himself noted the pioneer work of five of his contemporaries in the field along with him: Andrew Boss, William J. Spillman, and George F. Warren, from a background in agronomy, and Benjamin H. Hibbard and Thomas Nixon Carver, who along with himself were students of Richard T. Ely in general economics. Taylor nonetheless embraced this role as a sort of elder statesman, and accepted many visitors to his home, including many young agricultural economists. He found teaching to be the most rewarding part of his career. Taylor was eventually hospitalized by bone cancer of the leg, a terminal illness, but even then continued to see visitors. He died in April 1969 at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was survived by his daughter, Esther E. Taylor.\n\n"}

Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) is a partnership between the State of New York and its independent colleges which provides economically and educationally disadvantaged residents the possibility of a college education. The primary objective of HEOP is to help provide a broad range of services to the student, who because of academic and economic circumstances, would otherwise be unable to attend college, yet has the potential and desire to obtain a college degree. HEOP is sponsored jointly by the State Education Department and the College. HEOP is funded jointly by participating colleges and the New York State Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program and programming activities are supported, in part, by a grant from the New York State Education Department.\n\nAll HEOP Scholars must be New York State residents and must meet both financial and academic guidelines. The HEOP program was funded under Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and was approved by Governor Rockefeller of New York. This program is successful due to HEOP providing grants to institutions of higher learning. The program has initially awarded over fifty colleges grants ranging from $40,000-$61,000 to appropriately fund students admitted through HEOP. \n\nWhen the HEOP program was founded in 1969, there were approximately twenty-five institutions that offered the program. Now, forty-three years later, the program has expanded to fifty-seven independent colleges and universities throughout New York State. \n\nIn order to be eligible for the Higher Education Opportunity Program, a student must be a New York State resident for 1 year before starting HEOP at his/her admitted college, have a high school or equivalent state approved diploma (such as the Armed Forces), be academically disadvantaged meaning that he/she would not be able to be accepted according to regular admission standards, be financially disadvantaged (based on specific income cutoffs, varying by college) and have ambition to succeed. \n\nHEOP Professional Organization Website - HEOPWorks.com\n"}

He performed breeding experiments with horses and zebras which disproved earlier theories of heredity.\n\nEwart was born in Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland, the son of John Ewart, a joiner, and his wife, Jean Cossar. He studied medicine from 1871 to 1874 at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated MB ChB. After graduation, he became an anatomy demonstrator under William Turner and then held the position of Curator of the Zoological Museum at University College, London, where he assisted E Ray Lankester (later director of the Natural History Museum) by making zoological preparations for the museum and providing teaching support for Lankester's course in practical zoology. In 1878 he returned to Scotland to take a post of Professor of Natural History at Aberdeen University from where he moved to Edinburgh University in 1882, staying in the post until 1927. In Aberdeen he encountered James Duncan Matthews, a mature student (older than himself) and they became friends until Matthew's premature death in 1890.\n\nIn 1879 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir William Turner, William Rutherford, William Rutherford Sanders and John Chiene. He won the Society's Neill Prize for 1895-98 and served as their Vice-President 1907 to 1912.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June, 1893, having jointly delivered their Croonian Lecture in 1881.\n\nAmong various other studies, he performed breeding experiments with horses and zebras. He carried out these experiments at “The Bungalow”, now the Navaar House in Penicuik, well before the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's works. Ewart crossed a male zebra with a female pony to show that the theory of telegony inherited from the Greeks was unsound. Telegony held that a female with a history of mating with multiple males would pass on genetic qualities of all previous partners to her offspring. Ewart later bred the mare which had produced zebra-horse hybrids with a pony, and the offspring showed no zebra qualities in either markings or temperament. Ewart's goal was also to produce a draught animal for South African conditions, resistant to African diseases and more tractable than a mule.\n\nIn 1883 he commissioned George Washington Browne to design a grand new house in Penicuik, finished in 1885, which is where he died on New Year's Eve 1933/34. It is now the Craigiebield House Hotel.\n\nHe married three times, his first wife being the sister of Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer.\n\n\n"}

It was created by Stephen Mizwa to fund programs that promote Polish-American intellectual and artistic exchange.\n\nThe Polish American Scholarship Committee was established in 1923 by Dr. Stephen Mizwa to bring students to universities in the United States. Mizwa worked with the president of Vassar College, Henry Noble MacCracken, who had visited Poland. The two expanded the Scholarship Committee's mission to promote cultural and educational exchanges between the United States and Poland. In December 1925, the Scholarship Committee changed into the new Kosciuszko Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation is named in honor of Tadeusz Kościuszko, a Polish general and patriot, who after unsuccessful battles in uprising for Polish freedom migrated to North America and fought in American Revolutionary War. The organization was founded in 1925, on the eve of the 150th anniversary of Kosciuszko's enlistment in the American liberation cause.\n\nThe headquarters are in a limestone neo-Renaissance three-story mansion built in 1917. The building was designed by Harry Allan Jacobs for James J. Van Alen, whose in-laws, the Astors, lived down the block. The second-story ballroom functions as a gallery, as well as a lecture and concert hall for chamber-music and solo recitals.\n\nThe foundation provides scholarships and fellowships to Polish students, scholars, and artists who were invited for a research or educational stay by an institution of higher education in the United States. Several programs are also targeted at Polish musicians. Grants for U.S. citizens include research and study opportunities in Poland.\n\nThe foundation organizes cultural events for the Polish community. It is the largest public institution in North America dedicated solely to Polish art. Exhibitions are held that draw from the permanent collection of oils, watercolors, prints, drawings, ceramics, sculpture, tapestries and photographs. An annual Chopin Piano Competition showcases young talent.\n\nThe foundation sponsors and publishes the biggest Polish-American and American-Polish dictionary, known as \"Kosciuszko Foundation Dictionary\" and published in a book and CD-ROM format.

The name Learning Grid was also used to refer collectively to the activities themselves.\n\nMotorsport Development UK (MDUK) was established in November 2003 with funding from four regional development agencies (East Midlands Development Agency, Advantage West Midlands, South East England Development Agency, and East of England Development Agency), and from the DTI, with about £11.5m each year. Martin Fellows was head of MDUK. MDUK was a six-year programme, and came to a close in March 2009. MDUK was headquartered at Silverstone.\n\nThe Learning Grid began in 2005 as a recommendation of the Motorsport Competitiveness Panel, a body set up by the UK Department of Trade and Industry whose final report was announced by the then Secretary of State Patricia Hewitt on 11 July 2003. The name 'Learning Grid' was thought to refer to a motorsport starting grid, since many of the activities had a motorsport theme, although another derivation could be the representation of activities on a map or grid showing the age group on the X axis and level of time commitment required on the Y axis.\n\nIt was officially launched at Goodwood in October 2005, with an event hosted by Greenpower, with Bob Gilbert and a speech given by Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara.\n\nA Motorsport Academy was also established in 2006. Another programme of MDUK was Energy Efficient Motorsport. Learning Grid was headquartered at Savoy Place, home of the IET, in the City of Westminster.\n\nOn 2 February 2007, it became a not-for-profit limited company.

{"id": "7899344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7899344", "title": "List of South Park Elementary staff", "text": "List of South Park Elementary staff\n\nThis page is a list of staff at South Park Elementary from the characters in the American animated television series South Park.\n\nMr. Richard Adler is the puffy cheeked, shop-class teacher at South Park Elementary. During \"Tweek vs. Craig\", he is plagued by memories of his fiancée's death and chews copious amounts of nicotine gum to deal with them. When he runs out of gum, he plans to commit suicide. After writing his suicide note, he lies on a large table saw with a moving feed, but is interrupted by a fight between Tweek and Craig entering his classroom, killing Kenny in the process. Afterwards, he communicates with his fiancée's spirit through Kenny's corpse, and she helps him move on from his mourning. Now it seems he has relaxed a bit and put his past behind him, and has not featured prominently in an episode since \"Tweek vs. Craig\", although he has appeared in the background of many scenes and was one of the teachers supporting the move to teach sex education to the younger students in \"Proper Condom Use\", and also spoke his views on 9/11 in \"Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\". He was featured in the episode, \"Bass to Mouth\", and has a few lines. He also commented on the country's inevitable doom in \"About Last Night\". His teaching method consists primarily of telling the children to \"quit screwing around\", and \"don't screw around, you screw around too much!\" The episode \"Mysterion Rises\" reveals Adler to be a member of the Cult of Cthulhu. Adler always has a visible bandage covering a scar on his forehead after his suicide attempt. Mr. Adler's character was based on an old shop teacher who taught co-creator Matt Stone. His name was referenced in DVD commentary, but was censored because the real teacher did not give South Park permission to reveal his name.\n\nJerome \"Chef\" McElroy (voiced by Isaac Hayes) was one of few African American characters in \"South Park\", and the chef at the South Park Elementary School. In the initial season, his gimmick line, as the four boys come into the cafeteria was, \"Hello there, children!\" They would respond with, \"Hey, Chef.\" This was usually followed by Chef asking \"How's it going?\" and the boys would reply \"Bad.\" A stereotypical character, Chef is obsessed with sex (especially with white women). In \"Chef Aid\", it is revealed that he committed bestiality with a goat. He is a talented singer, and has a tendency to sing wildly inappropriate songs when his muse strikes him. The children often seek him out when in need of guidance or information. Sometimes the advice given by Chef is inappropriate, such as in \"\", Stan asks Chef how he can get Wendy to like him and he replies, \"That's easy. You just gotta find the clitoris.\" He refers to the boys as 'children' even if there is only one of them present. He once almost married a succubus, but the boys saved him. He has not been seen since \"Return of Chef\" because of the departure of Hayes. In this episode, he is \"killed\", but is then seen being remade with a body similar to that of Darth Vader\n\nMs. Diane Choksondik becomes the boys' new teacher after they enter fourth grade and is voiced by Trey Parker. Ms. Choksondik has extremely exaggerated saggy breasts, is overweight, wears glasses, and has a lazy eye. She also does not wear a bra, and when she lifts her arms, the bottom few inches of her breasts show below the bottom of her blouse. One of the early jokes about Ms. Choksondik is that the children do not get the obvious pun in her name, and try to create other names for her (such as \"makesmesick\", \"chokesonbricks\" and \"chokesonrocks\"). She corrects them in full seriousness. In the episode \"Proper Condom Use\", it is strongly implied that her contemptuous attitude towards sexual activity stems from the fact that no man before Mr. Mackey had any sexual interest in her.\n\nThe episode \"Professor Chaos\" ends on a cliffhanger saying someone would die, in a parody of cliffhanger endings, and it was revealed during this gag that Ms. Choksondik has died. In the episode \"Simpsons Already Did It\", the boys reveal they put some of their Sea People in her coffee. When she dies soon after, they became horrified when they thought that their prank had killed her. Later, the news says that large amounts of semen (or, as the boys took it, \"sea men\") had been found in her stomach, and they go to great lengths to hide their apparent role in her death, until Chef explains that Ms. Choksondik must have died from something else. After her death, the boys receive two weeks off school to \"deal with\" her death, and then are taught for a short time by Mr. Mackey before Mr. Garrison is allowed a return to teach them.\n\nMs. Claridge is a South Park Elementary preschool teacher. Her first appearance was in \"Pre-School\". Ms. Claridge was disabled and covered in burns after a fire broke out in the pre-school classroom at South Park Elementary. The fire was started when Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wanted to play \"fireman\" and asked the \"baddest kid in pre-school\", Trent Boyett, to start a fire for them. In spite of the boys' efforts to extinguish the fire (by urinating on it), the fire grew out of control and nearly killed Ms. Claridge. Ms. Claridge survived, but was badly injured and placed in an electric wheelchair which very much resembles that of Captain Christopher Pike in the original \"Star Trek\" episode \"The Menagerie\".\n\nMs. Claridge communicates by 'beeping' once for yes and twice for no. It is not clear how she can function as a teacher if she can only communicate \"yes\" and \"no\", yet her students appear to understand her.\n\nThe boys denied all culpability for the fire and Trent Boyett was sent to Juvenile Hall for five years. While trying to escape the newly released Trent, Cartman fires a taser gun, which accidentally powers Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, sending her crashing into a propane shop, exploding and setting her alight once again. The police arrive and ask if Trent started the fire. She replies \"no\" with two beeps but the police mistake it for \"yes yes\" and arrest Trent.\n\nMs. Claridge appears briefly in two other episodes, \"The Death of Eric Cartman\", where Cartman, in his efforts to atone for his life's misdeeds, gives her a fruit basket, and also again at the talent show in \"Erection Day\".\n\nMr. Connors (Trey Parker) was the wrestling teacher at the school. He appeared in \"W.T.F.\", where he is fired due to some of the wrestling videos on his iPhone being mistaken for gay pornography, and eventually joined the WWE.\n\nMs. Veronica Lee Crabtree, known in the series as Mrs. Crabtree, was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in seasons 1–3 and Eliza Schneider in seasons 4–8, when she was officially \"killed off\" in \"Cartman's Incredible Gift\". She was the bus driver for South Park elementary, and enforced incredibly strict discipline on the bus, constantly yelling at the students to enforce quiet. She does the same to adult staff travelling on the bus, and doesn't seem to understand that she can't report the staff for disorderly conduct like she would with the students. The students often mutter various insults to her, then quickly cover them up with poor excuses when she demanded they repeat themselves. However, Stan Marsh once repeated the insult back word for word. As a result, Ms. Crabtree said \"oh\" and drove off without letting the boys getting on the bus.\n\nIn one episode, a kid from the drug rehabilitation center (across from Cartman's fat camp) is forced to climb into Ms. Crabtree's body vaginally while pretending to be Kenny (who was arrested for prostitution), but was rebirthed stillborn. Moments later, she squeezed out another kid, who resembled Harry Potter.\n\nIn the episode \"Chef Aid\", Chef resorts to prostitution to get needed money, and Ms. Crabtree, over whose head he puts a bag first, is one of his \"customers\".\n\nThe character's biggest role was in the season 2 episode \"City on the Edge of Forever\", where she has the main role in the episode's b-plot. After the bus becomes stranded at the edge of a cliff, Ms Crabtree leaves the children behind to try to find assistance, but ends up getting sidetracked by a stand up comedian agent who draws her into a career in stand-up. She eventually starts a romantic relationship with a truck driver she met while hitchhiking, and the two spends the last few minutes of the show watching the sunset together.\n\nMs. Crabtree – as well as the bird nesting on her head – was murdered by a serial killer in the 2004 episode \"Cartman's Incredible Gift\". Detectives investigating the crime in the episodes noted she was \"an ancillary character the fans wouldn't miss much\". The school janitor Mr. Venezuela is currently the new school bus driver.\n\nMr. Derp is most prominent as Chef's substitute in \"The Succubus\". Voiced by Trey Parker, the character commonly displays slapstick and physical camp humor, much to the chagrin of the boys. He tends to hit himself in the head with a claw hammer in attempts to make the boys laugh. In the season three commentary, Matt and Trey reveal that his namesake, \"Derp\", is the sound commonly made in a klutzy situation when things go horribly wrong, literally and comically, like a joke that can be \"seen from a mile away\". The word \"derp\" has become a popular phrase and Internet meme.\n\nHe has also since appeared in the background in \"Eek! A Penis!\", possibly indicating that he has since replaced Chef. He also appeared before Chef's death briefly in \"Professor Chaos\" and \"Timmy 2000\" (as the lemonade stand clerk at Lalapalalapaza).\n\nMs. Ellen (appeared only in \"Tom's Rhinoplasty\" and voiced by a celebrity guest star, Natasha Henstridge) substituted for Mr. Garrison in South Park Elementary as a third-grade teacher when he was away for a few days undergoing a plastic surgery on his nose. She was promoted to a permanent teaching position after Mr. Garrison, enjoying his new 'David Hasselhoff' look, quit to do what he \"always wanted to do: hang out and screw hot chicks.\" Chef went out on a date with Ms. Ellen and only to find out that she is a lesbian. When the boys found out that she was a lesbian, they tried every effort to become one themselves. Ms. Ellen's attractive looks and kind nature caused the boys in the class to develop deep amorous feelings towards her, which also caused Wendy to become very jealous (oblivious to the fact that Ms. Ellen does not reciprocate their interest). Wendy frames her in a way that causes Iraqi soldiers to send her on a rocket into the sun.\n\nMr. Garrett is the coach of the South Park Elementary basketball team. He appears very briefly in the episode 'Elementary School Musical.'\n\nMr. Garrison has been the children's teacher throughout most of the series. In the beginning, Garrison was in denial of his homosexuality to the point of homophobia, and was always seen with either of his hand puppets that he claimed were gay. Later he went missing, hiding on a mountain, living in isolation. He eventually \"came out of the closet\" and returned with the intention to teach again. In \"4th Grade\", he was denied the job by Principal Victoria, who said, \"Oh, we don't hire gay people.\" He was eventually allowed back as the Kindergarten teacher. In \"The Death Camp of Tolerance\", a change in laws allow Garrison to be promoted to teach the 4th grade, receiving his old 3rd grade students who have now advanced a grade. In the season 9 episode \"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\", Garrison got a sex reassignment operation, after which he came to be known as Janet Garrison. In the season 11 episode \"D-Yikes!\", Garrison becomes a lesbian. Finally, in the season 12 episode \"Eek, a Penis!\", he gets reassigned back to being male again.\n\nNurse Mary Gollum (called Nurse McSchwartz in the original pilot of \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\") is the school nurse at South Park Elementary, notable primarily for the fact that she has a dead fetus attached to the side of her head, which terrifies the children (she lacks this in the original pilot). Nurse Gollum is described in her first appearance on the show as suffering from the (fictional) condition \"conjoined twin myslexia\". Principal Victoria asked her if she could have it removed, Nurse Gollum stated yes but that it would cost her life.\n\nIn Nurse Gollum's first appearance, \"Conjoined Fetus Lady\", Kyle is sent to see her and shocked at her appearance. The rest of the children are soon terrified, leading to Sheila and Mayor McDaniels to arrange a special week for Conjoined Twin Myslexia awareness. However, this leads to Nurse Gollum becoming angered, saying that she just wants to live her life normally (especially since she's the only person in the city to suffer of this condition). She made an additional appearance in \"Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods\" playing the role of Nurse Chapel in a recreation of the Star Trek episode \"Dagger of the Mind\".\n\nDespite having a dead fetus on her head, she is one of the most normal and intelligent adult characters on the show. Despite not wanting to be singled out for being different, she appeared in the episode \"Freak Strike\" where she is one of the freaks in the infomercial that is promoting awareness of 'freaks' through daytime talk shows.\n\nNurse Gollum's last appearance on the show was in Season 9 episode \"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow\" in a very minor cameo, but in the \"\" video game, there are posters scattered around South Park, revealing Nurse Gollum's first name as Mary, and declaring that she has been missing since \"October 19th\", which is a reference to her appearance in the aforementioned episode, which first aired on October 19, 2005.\n\nNurse Gollum is named after Gollum, the deformed creature from \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe Groundskeeper appears very briefly in the episodes \"Damien\" and \"Butters' Bottom Bitch\". She appears to be in charge of watching the students during recess. She is of old age and possesses an unpleasant demeanor, exclaiming to the students \"five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!\"\n\nMr. Mackey, voiced by Trey Parker, is the school guidance counselor. He has a disproportionately large head and mumbles \"M'kay\" into most sentences. He speaks with a Southern accent, and he is believed to be from Louisiana. It is assumed he is at least 40 years old (he once said he had sex at 19 and that it has been about 21 years since). He is based on Trey Parker's junior high school counselor, Stan Lackey. He has occasionally taught classes at the school, and taught sex education with Ms. Choksondik. During this time he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Choksondik until her death. After her death, he took over the fourth grade class until Mr. Garrison returned. In the episode \"Erection Day\" he is shown to be left-handed.\n\nDespite his slightly odd appearance and catchphrase (M'kay), Mr. Mackey is generally portrayed as an able and responsible counselor who actually cares about the children, much unlike Mr. Garrison and other adult authority figures. He sometimes appears with Principal Victoria when punishing a student or announcing an important message. His methods as a counselor often reflect real-life controversies in education. For example, when Kyle talks about seeing Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo, he places Kyle on a heavy dose prescription of Prozac. In an early episode, the children feign having Attention Deficit Disorder, and he prescribes them all Ritalin. During a drug-education class in the episode \"Ike's Wee Wee\", he passes some marijuana around the classroom, and it is stolen (apparently by one of the children, though it is later revealed that the actual thief was Mr. Garrison). For this, Mr. Mackey is fired by the school, evicted by his landlord, and, feeling depressed, he ends up using alcohol, marijuana and LSD. The episode suggests that his large head is caused by the tightness of his tie around his neck, but in \"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\", his parents are shown to have large heads as well. He becomes a hippie and travels to India with a like-minded woman. Mr. Mackey is captured by The A-Team, and his former employers, along with Jimbo, say that they should have helped him with his drug problem rather than firing him. Mr. Mackey protests, saying that he likes his new life and that he actually has not done drugs since his first experimentations back in South Park. Nobody listens and in rehab at the Betty Ford Clinic, he is \"cured\" of his addiction to drugs. Mr. Mackey's social worker then re-ties his tie, which makes his head swell back to its original size.\n\nIn the episode \"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\" he is shown to have a bondage sex scene with Liane Cartman. In \"Cat Orgy\", he's shown to have presumably had sex with her again. In \"Rainforest Shmainforest\", it is revealed that he can speak Spanish fluently. In \"Trapped in the Closet\", Mr. Mackey is seen at the Church of Scientology Org where Stan is having an auditing session. However, it is not known whether or not he continues having sessions with the Org from that point on. From \"Major Boobage\" onward, Mackey's sweater and jeans were re-designed, much like Mr. Garrison's two episodes later in \"Eek, a Penis!\". In \"Insheeption\" he is revealed to be a hoarder with a troubled childhood, having been bullied and later being molested by Woodsy the Owl.\n\nIn the Season 1 DVD, Parker stated that Mr. Mackey was based on his school counselor, who, when he saw Parker in the halls during class, would simply say, \"Okay, Trey, get back to class now, mmm-kay?\"\n\nMr. Meryl is the Audio/Visual Department Teacher and appeared in \"Quest for Ratings\". He tells Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Butters, Jimmy and Token that their show \"Super Action News\" is losing in the ratings to Craig's home video show, \"Animals Close-Up With a Wide-Angle Lens\" and subsequently gives them all a failing grade. This inspires the boys to come up with new ideas to revamp their show.\n\nMs. Pearl is the Home Economics teacher. She speaks with a soft, gentle voice and does her job well, although she appears to believe in old-fashioned gender roles, namely by having all the girls on her course, despite a couple having applied for wood shop class, and by teaching her class ways to find, manipulate and marry rich men. She is good with chat up lines (as seen in \"Tweek vs. Craig\"). She also dates Richard Adler, and mentioned she wanted to sleep with him. He refused because he was still mourning the death of his fiancée.\n\nPC Principal, his real name as revealed in “Super Hard PCness”, is the current principal of South Park Elementary, replacing Principal Victoria in the show's nineteenth season. He graduated from Texas A&M University and is very emphatic on political correctness issues. The character was first introduced in \"Stunning and Brave\". He is a muscular man with dark blonde hair, a very faint mustache, and a goatee. He is often shown wearing Oakley sunglasses. He is very aggressive and violent in enforcing compliance to his ideas of acceptable behavior, for instance in the episode \"Stunning and Brave\" he responds to Cartman's use of politically incorrect language by beating him so severely that he is hospitalized. The episode also showed that Principal lives in a fraternity house with other similar, violent, college-age men that is a few houses down the street from Randy and Sharon Marsh's house. It is later implied that he is part of a larger conspiracy involving online ads. Once he discovers this conspiracy, however, he turns against the ads to defend humanity from their intolerance. His character was central to most episodes of the nineteenth season, and at the end of the season, he announced in the episode \"PC Principal Final Justice\" that he would be remaining as principal of South Park Elementary. He has been the principal ever since. PC Principal got vice principal Strong Woman pregnant, who gave birth to (quintuplets) 5 children known as PC Babies.\n\nMr. Slave, voiced by John Hansen, is the homosexual lover of Mr. Garrison up until the episode \"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\" when he breaks up with Garrison after Mr. Garrison had a sex change. Mr. Slave, as his name suggests, is a masochist and is permanently dressed in a leather bondage outfit. His catchphrase is an excited exclamation of \"Jesus Christ!\" spoken with a lisp. In many episodes, he says little else.\n\nMr. Slave's first major appearance is during the fourteenth episode of season six \"The Death Camp of Tolerance\", although his voice was heard briefly in \"Butters' Very Own Episode\". Despite Mr. Slave's occupation, he is shown to be wise and knowledgeable, offering characters advice. One of his most prominent moments was in \"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset\", when he gave Wendy Testaburger and most of the town advice that Paris Hilton is not to be admired. He explains that he himself is a whore and that it is not a good thing. He then shoves Hilton up his own anus, where she meets the same creatures Lemmiwinks did in \"The Death Camp of Tolerance\".\n\nAfter Garrison's sex change operation, Mr. Slave ended their relationship due to no longer being sexually interested in Garrison and that his own feelings about the operation were not brought up prior. By the events of \"Follow That Egg!\", despite Garrison's attempts to stop him, Mr. Slave moved on and married Big Gay Al.\n\nMs. Stephenson appeared as the kindergarten teacher for South Park Elementary in \"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\". She falls in love and has sex with Ike Broflovski. They run away together after Kyle's strenuous attempts lead to their prosecution. Ms. Stephenson eventually commits suicide because of the ordeal. She drives a blue pickup truck with yellow stripes.\n\nMr. Stkrdknmibalz (pronounced stick-your-dick-in-my-balls) is a Canadian language teacher hired in \"Where My Country Gone?\". He leads various South Park residents, including Mr. Garrison, in singing the Canadian ABCs, which is similar to the American version, but with varied lyrics (for example, G is replaced by \"Guy\", and Mr. Stkrdknmybalz points it out on a wall chart, where it is a G with eyes and a top hat drawn on it).\n\nYvonne Streibel appeared in \"Toilet Paper\". She is the art teacher and gave Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny detention for making a penis sculpture out of clay. They decided to get revenge by toilet papering her house. She is married and has two daughters.\n\nStrong Woman is the vice-principal of South Park Elementary. She has blonde hair and wears a lilac-blue coat and a dark purple shirt. Strong Woman is first introduced in the episode \"Super Hard PCness\", in which she is hired by PC Principal as the vice-principal to address the problem of bullying in the school. Woman is assertive of herself and dislikes those who are assertive for her, seeing it as a way of quietening her. She develops a sexual relationship with PC Principal by the following episode, \"Splatty Tomato\". Strong Women later gives birth to (quintuplets) 5 children referred to as PC Babies, due to being extremely PC. PC Principal is secretly their father.\n\nPrincipal Victoria was the principal of South Park Elementary for the first eighteen seasons. She was always seen with curly hair and glasses, and usually appears with Mr. Mackey. Her name is a play on Victoria Principal. She speaks with a heavy Minnesotan accent.\n\nIn \"Helen Keller! The Musical\", she reveals that she does recreational drugs. In the episode \"Sexual Harassment Panda\", when she was put on the witness stand during Cartman's second trial over the school allowing him to be sexually harassed, Principal Victoria hysterically confessed that she murdered a man, cut up his body, and hid his remains (though the court was only interested in whether or not the school did anything to stop Cartman from being sexually harassed). In \"Breast Cancer Show Ever\", it is revealed that Principal Victoria has been a breast cancer survivor for seven years, which inspires Wendy to fight back against Cartman (who, according to Principal Victoria, is Wendy's \"cancer\").\n\nPrincipal Victoria appears to be very able to run the school, despite its strange crew. In \"Go God Go\", she is shown telling Mrs. Garrison he has to teach evolution in class, which he refuses. When pushed, he makes a complete mess of the subject, so Principal Victoria asks Richard Dawkins to teach it. Her husband is shown for the first time on the episode \"About Last Night...\". In \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", when Garrison asks \"who here hasn't had sex with Mrs. Cartman\", she and Mayor McDaniels exchange uncomfortable glances, implying that she, like almost everyone else in South Park, has at some point slept with Mrs. Cartman.\n\nAt the start of season nineteen, \"Stunning and Brave\", Victoria was said to have been fired as principal and replaced by PC Principal. However, she resurfaces in the episode \"Sponsored Content\" to confide to Garrison the truth of how she actually lost her position as the two return to South Park.\n\nMr. José Venezuela is the janitor. He appeared in \"Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\" and is a stereotypical poor Latin American immigrant. He has three children. He makes six dollars an hour, at best. Also, in the same episode, his first name is revealed to be José. Later, he also replaces the school bus driver.\n\nMr. Wyland was the 3rd grade substitute teacher for Mr. Garrison for two episodes after Mr. Garrison was caught attempting to molest a child (Cartman) in \"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\". Wyland wears a blue top with a red bow tie. He was first shown in \"Cherokee Hair Tampons\" and made the class make a get well card for Kyle, who needed a kidney transplant. As a joke, the children make Butters into a get well card by gluing glitter and a sign that says \"Get Well Kyle\" on him and making him sing a song for Kyle. He was then shown in the next episode, \"Chef Goes Nanners\", and organized a debate on whether or not to change the South Park Flag, which depicted four white men hanging a black man.\n"}

Although rejected as a student at the Paris Conservatoire, Louis became a pupil of Louise de Miramont-Tréogate (whom he subsequently married), and later served on the Paris Conservatoire's Admissions jury panel (1910) and its Concours jury for 1929 and 1933. He attended l'École Niedermeyer (piano, organ, composition) and was also coached by Jean-Baptiste Faure with whom Louise herself had studied.\n\nLouis made his debut at the Opéra-Comique as Daniel in \"Le chalet\" on 16 March 1881.\n\nAt La Monnaie in Brussels, Delaquerrière sang Wagner in \"Méphistophélès\" by Boito in 1883, created a role in \"Le panache blanc\" (by Philippe Flon) and sang L'abbé in \"Le trésor\" (by Charles Lefebvre) in 1884, created David in the local premiere of \"Les maîtres chanteurs de Nuremberg\" (translated by Victor Wilder) and appeared in \"Joli Gilles\" (Ferdinand Poise) in 1885.\n\nHe sang in Geneva for a season then returned to the Opéra-Comique. There he sang in \"Mignon\" (Wilhelm), \"La dame blanche\" (Georges), \"La Traviata\" (Alfredo), \"Carmen\" (Don José), \"L'Ombre\" (by Flotow), \"Le postillon de Lonjumeau\", and created Le comte de Nangis in Chabrier's \"Le roi malgré lui\" (1887). At the 100th performance of \"Le Barbier de Séville\" at the Opéra-Comique on 25 Feb 1887, he sang Almaviva with Mézeray as Rosine and Soulacroix as Figaro; other roles with the company included Mergy in \"Le pré aux clercs\" and Alexis in \"Le déserteur\".\n\nThe singer was on good terms with several contemporary artists and composers; his close friendship with Chabrier resulted in a proposal to mount a concert of the composer's works in Royan in 1888, where Delaquerrière was enjoying success; Chabrier in one of his most bitter letters tore the idea to shreds. Among his papers were letters from composers of his time, as well as manuscripts, including one of Liszt.\n\nDelaquerrière appeared at Monte Carlo in early 1889, singing Vincent in \"Mireille\", Philémon in \"Philémon et Baucis\", Wilhelm Meister in \"Mignon\", Sylvain in \"Les Dragons de Villars\" and Don José in \"Carmen\".\n\nIn January 1893 he sang Pierre in the premiere of Messager's \"Madame Chrysanthème\" at the Salle de la Renaissance du Théâtre-Lyrique, where he also sang in \"Fra Diavolo\", \"Le Barbier de Séville\" and \"Obéron\".\n\nHe left the stage while still young (1899) to devote his time to vocal teaching.\n\nFor 25 years, both the Paris Opéra and Opéra-Comique recruited artists at his School. Among his pupils were well-known opera singers such as Edmond Clément, Lucienne Bréval and Paul Franz. Emma Calvé, although not a pupil, came to rehearse at the Delaquerrière home, particularly while they were all in Brussels at the same time.\n\nHis son was (born Paris 16 September 1886, died Montreal 10 April 1978), also a tenor, known for his leading roles in operetta, whose early musical training in Paris was provided by his parents. In his book \"Savoir chanter\" (first published 1976 (Éd. Mondex), 2nd edition 2008 (Éd. Delaquerrière Richardson, Montréal)), José covers the theoretical and practical aspects of the Delaquerrière School of French singing. Those portions of Louis and José's personal notebooks related to voice topics were transcribed and translated by Sophie Louise Roland in her D. Mus. document.\n"}

His attention was drawn towards one district, where the residents had the lowest median income and lowest level of education in the city. The unemployment rate was also very high. Although this district contained only 3% of the city’s population, 33% of all children who had been labeled \"mentally retarded\" lived there.\n\nHeber selected 40 newborns from this district. All had a mother with an IQ lower than 80. In many cases the father was absent. The newborns were randomly assigned to an experimental and a control group. Mothers of children in the experimental group received education, vocational rehabilitation, and training in homemaking and child care. The children were brought to infant stimulation centers, where they received a high quality educational program designed to develop language and cognitive skills. They also received three balanced meals a day. They stayed there five days a week, seven hours a day. When the children were six the program ended. The children then attended local schools. Both the experimental group and the control group were tested an equal number of times throughout the project.\n\nAccording to Heber and colleagues, by age six all of the children from the experimental group had higher IQs than all of the children from the control group. Mean IQ was 120 in the experimental group and 87 in the control group. After the children left the program their IQs started declining. By the time both groups were ten years old the IQs of the children of the experimental group had decreased to 105. Mean IQ in the control group was 85.\n\nAt age 14, the children in the experimental group had a mean IQ ten points above that of the control group, but the scholastic achievement scores of the experimental group were not better than those of the control group. Both groups performed in school as would be expected from children with a mean IQ of 80. For this reason, Arthur Jensen has suggested that the Milwaukee Project did not produce permanent intelligence gains, but that the IQ gains it showed were due to an indirect form of \"teaching to the test\".\n\nThe Milwaukee Project's claimed success was celebrated in the popular media and by famous psychologists. However, later in the project Rick Heber, the principal investigator, was discharged from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and convicted and imprisoned for large-scale abuse of federal funding for private gain. Two of Heber's colleagues in the project were also convicted for similar abuses. The project's results were not published in any refereed scientific journals, and Heber did not respond to requests from colleagues for raw data and technical details of the study. Consequently, even the existence of the project as described by Heber has been called into question. Nevertheless, many college textbooks in psychology and education have uncritically reported the project's results.\n\n"}

The program would be historic as it was the first television program of its kind in the United States to showcase the pregnancy process and conception to young people, using a combination of animation and live action. The program was a co-production between Dick Clark Productions and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises.\n\nUpon learning that his mother is pregnant with what will be his brother, 10-year-old Petey Evans begins to wonder (through animated fantasies and flashbacks) about how babies are born, only to realize that those theories are not delivered by storks or popping out of a stomach.

It takes place every year in March or April and serves the double purpose of being a regional secondary school level mathematics competition for the Nordic region and a step in the process of selection of the teams of the participating countries for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the regional Baltic Way competition.\n\nAt most twenty participants from each country are appointed by the organisers of the national secondary school level mathematics competitions. They must either be eligible to the IMO or attend a secondary school. (The foreword of ref. renders the eligibility requirements unlike the past and present regulations.)\n\nThe exam consists of four problems to be answered in four hours. Only writing and drawing tools are permitted. For each problem the contestant can get from zero to seven points. The problems are of the IMO type and harder than those of the national secondary school level competitions in mathematics of the Nordic countries but not as hard as those of the IMO. They are chosen by the organising committee of the host country of the year from proposals submitted by the national organising committees.\n\nThe official web site of the NMC provides a complete collection in English with solutions of the problems from all the years. It is compiled by Matti Lehtinen. Selected versions of the problems in other Nordic languages are also available at the site\n\nThe NMC is run in a decentralised manner involving no travel of the contestants nor any other personnel. The contestants write the exam in their own schools on the same day. Thence the papers are sent to a committee in the contestants' country who mark them preliminarily. They are then forwarded with the preliminary marking to a committee in the host country of the year, who coordinate the marking and decide the final result of each contestant. Hosting the NMC rotates among the participating countries in a fixed order. In each country, the NMC is run by the organisers of the country's secondary school level mathematics competition.\n\nThe early history of the NMC is documented in a series of reports in the journal Normat. According to Åke Samuelsson, the NMC was founded at a meeting of the leaders of the Nordic teams at the 27th IMO in Warsaw 1986. As Denmark did not participate in the IMO before 1991, no team leader from Denmark was there. The founding countries were Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The first NMC took place on 30 March 1987 hosted by Sweden with 47 contestants from the four participating countries. It is stressed in the report that the organisation was minimal. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th NMCs took place in 1988-90 hosted by Norway, Iceland and Finland, respectively. This established the hosting order for the future.\n\nRumors of this new mathematics competition reached Denmark, and in 1989 a single Danish student, who was very eager to participate, was allowed to write the exam in a school in Sweden. In 1990 more Danish students participated, so Matti Lehtinen could write in his report: \"For the first time the NMO may now be called a common Nordic competition since all five Nordic countries participated with at least half a dozen pupils.\" (Translated from Swedish; the abbreviation NMO is elucidated in the section Name below.) Denmark was invited to host the NMC in 1991, the year Denmark entered the IMO, but since the Danish organisers were yet unexperienced, the Swedish organisers agreed to host the NMC for a second time. Denmark would then host the NMC in 1992 and again in 1996. In the future, the hosting order would be the present one: Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark.\n\nSlightly diverging views of the aim of the NMC among its founders are indicated in the reports. According to Åke Samuelsson's report from the 1st NMC, the participants in the founding meeting discussed \"the possibility of arranging a Nordic mathematics competition which in difficulty would lie somewhere between the national competitions and the International Mathematical Olympiad\" (translated from Swedish). This suggests that they wanted NMC to be a regional mathematics competition in its own right at a level accessible for Nordic secondary school students. In Matti Lehtinen's report from the 4th NMC the NMC is seen rather as a vehicle for the training for the IMO: \"Most of the participants were candidates for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), and the NMO may be seen at all as a link in the training for the IMO.\" (Translated from Swedish.) The latter view is expressed in the foreword of ref. as well.\n\nThe name of the competition has changed over time. Originally it was called 'The Nordic Mathematics Olympiad' (). The 1991 regulations (see image) display the present name, 'The Nordic Mathematical Contest', and words equivalent in Scandinavian languages to 'competition' or 'contest' are used in the subsequent reports except in 1999, when 'olympiad' returns temporarily. The following remark in ref. seems to reflect some discussion of the name in the early days; the word 'olympiad' may have been felt too pretentious: \"The Fourth Nordic Mathematics Olympiad [Swedish: matematikolympiaden], or maybe more descriptively—Mathematics Competition [Swedish: matematiktävlingen] took place on 5 April 1990.\" (Translated from Swedish.) In ref. the NMC is called 'The Nordic Mathematical Competition'.\n\nThe first documented regulations of the NMC were issued for the 5th NMC in 1991. (See image.) They were applied unaltered in 1992 and apparently with at most minor changes in the following years. According to these regulations students in a 'gymnasium' (10th–12th school year in the educational systems of the Nordic countries, in the regulations referred to as the 'upper school') are eligible to participate without any age limit. The curriculum comprises \"any branch of mathematics suitable for upper school students\", and it is stressed that it is thus broader than that of the IMO. In particular, \"problems from calculus and elementary probability theory\" may occur. The subjects of most of the problems that have been posed at the NMC actually lie within the traditional IMO curriculum. However, problem 4 in 2002 must be deemed outside this curriculum since its formulation involves the concept of probability. No aim of the NMC is specified in the 1991 regulations.\n\nRegulations issued for the 11th NMC in 1997 are very similar to those of 1991, the most conspicuous difference being that the host country is now allowed to propose problems. According to the 1991 regulations, proposals should be collected from the countries other than the host country. It is not known at which of the NMCs 1993–97 this change was first implemented.\n\nThe 1997 regulations seem to have been acknowledged until 1999. In fact, in this year, at a meeting of the leaders of the Nordic teams during the IMO, the leader of the Norwegian team raised the issue that the 1997 regulations prevented the participation of talented students who were too young to be in a 'gymnasium'. As a repair he proposed to change in point 4 of the regulations the words \"enrolled in an upper school (gymnasium)\" to \"enrolled in an upper school (gymnasium) or eligible to the IMO\". The meeting consented to the proposal.\n\nThe decision of the Nordic team leaders at the 40th IMO in 1999 was never implemented in the context of the NMC, but its rule of eligibility was adobted for the Baltic Way competition in 2000 hosted by Norway and except for a minor change of wording it remains the basic rule of eligibility of this competition. In 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006, the hosts of the NMC issued a statement whose version from 2005 is cited below. According to this statement, the eligibility to the IMO is the main criterion for the eligibility to the NMC. It is accepted, however, that this criterion may not be fulfilled in \"some borderline cases\". About the problems it is stated only that they should be \"slightly below the IMO level\". The marking scale is specified according to the tradition. The full text of the statement reads as follows in its version from 2005:\n\n\"We shall not publish a detailed regulation, but just remind everybody of the basic facts:\n\nAfter a mail conference in 2009 among the organisations of the national mathematics competitions, regulations were issued again for the competition in 2010 and have since then been applied essentially unaltered. For the first time an aim of the NMC is stated in these regulations: The participants should experience a mathematical contest at an international level, and the NMC should provide information relevant for the selection of the teams for the IMO. The participants should be eligible to the IMO, and also other secondary school students are allowed to participate. The mathematical content of the problems is that of the IMO and their intended level of difficulty slightly lower than that of IMO problems. An annual meeting of the Nordic leaders during the IMO, which has taken place traditionally throughout the history of the NMC, is mentioned in the regulations for the first time.\n\nThe NMC has an official web site:\n\nMoreover, the web sites of the Nordic secondary school level mathematics competitions provide information on the NMC:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12648945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12648945", "title": "Opificio delle pietre dure", "text": "Opificio delle pietre dure\n\nThe Opificio delle pietre dure, literally meaning \"Workshop of semi-precious stones\", is a public institute of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage based in Florence. It is a global leader in the field of art restoration and provides teaching as one of two Italian state conservation schools (the other being the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro). The institute maintains also a specialist library and archive of conservation and a museum displaying historic examples of pietre dure inlaid semi-precious stones artefacts. A scientific laboratory conducts research and diagnostics and provides a preventive conservation service.\n\nBeing one of the famous artistic workshops of the Italian Renaissance, the Opificio was established in 1588 at the behest of Ferdinando I de' Medici to provide the elaborate, inlaid precious and semi-precious stoneworks. One of the masterpieces of the crafts is the overall decoration of the Cappella dei Principi (Chapel of Princes) in the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze. The technique, which originated from Byzantine inlay work, was perfected by the Opificio masters and the artworks they produced became known as \"opera di commessi medicei\" (\"commesso\" is the old name of the technique, similar to ancient mosaics) and later as \"commesso in pietre dure\" (semi-precious stones mosaic).\n\nThe artisans performed the exceptionally skilled and delicate task of inlaying thin veneers of semi-precious stones especially selected for their colour, opacity, brilliance and grain to create elaborate decorative and pictorial effects. Items of extraordinary refinement were created in this way, from furnishings to all manner of artworks. Today, artisans trained at the Opificio assist many of the world's museums in their restoration programmes.\n\nThe Opificio workshops were originally located in the Casino Mediceo, then in the Uffizi and were finally moved to their present location in Via Alfani in 1796. After the end of the 19th Century the institute's activities moved away from the production of works of art and towards its restoration. At first specialising in hardstone carving, in which the workshops were a world authority, and then later expanding into other related fields (stone and marble sculptures, bronzes, ceramics).\n\nThe second branch of the Institute (baboratori di restauro) had a more modern story. In 1932 Ugo Procacci, the distinghished scholar of Florentine art, in his career as an officer of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage, founded a Laboratory of restoration (original Italian name: \"Gabinetto di restauro\") at the Florence Soprintendenza. It was the first modern restoration laboratory in Italy (pre-dating of 7 years the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro in Rome) and one of the very first ones in all the world.\nThe Gabinetto di Restauro used scientific methods for the preliminary exhaminition of the works of art (as X radiography) and began an outstanding campaign of restoration on Tuscan Early Masters paintings, that was later known as \"restauri di rivelazione\" (literally meaning \"revealing restoration\").\nIn 1966, the fatal tragedy of the flooding of the River Arno, resulted in many priceless works of art requiring restoration. It provided a significant impetus for expansion of the Gabinetto di restauro's research and restorative services. More space was needed because of the sheer number of artworks which required restoration and also, in some cases, the large size of the pieces themselves, such as the immense 4.48 x 3.9m Crucifix by Cimabue from the Basilica di Santa Croce. The expansions provided new laboratories in the Fortezza da Basso. \nThanks to financial aid and an influx of expertise from throughout the world, the Florentine Laboratory became, in a short time one of the vanguard restoration laboratories in the world, combining traditional practices with modern technology.\n\nIn 1975, the Cultural Heritage Ministry merged the Opificio laboratories with the Gabinetto di restauro (plus other minor Florentine restoration laboratories) and created a new Institute, the modern \"Opificio delle pietre dure\".\n\nToday, the institute is organised in departments specific for the various types of artworks it treats. The laboratories are in three principal venues: in Via Alfani 78, in the historic centre of Florence; in the Fortezza da Basso; and in Palazzo Vecchio where restoration treatments on tapestries and textiles are carried out.\nThere are also several research and services offices.\n\nThe actual (updated on march, 26, 2012) Superintendent is Marco Ciatti.\nThe Opificio has a board of directors of the departments, under the supervision of the Supertintendent.\nIt has also a gestional committee and a scientific committee.\n\n\nThe small museum in the Via Alfani displays examples of pietre dure works, including cabinets, table tops and plates, showing an immense repertoire of decoration, usually either flowers, fruits and animals, but also sometimes other picturesque scenes, including a famous view of the Piazza della Signoria. There is also a large baroque fireplace entirely covered in malachite, a dazzling and brilliant green stone as well as copies of painting executed in inlaid stone. Some of the exhibition space is dedicated to particular types of stone, such as the paesina, extracted near Florence, the grain and colour of which can be used to create vivid landscapes.\n\nAn exhibition of the technical processes of pietre dure works through history, can be found on the first floor as well as a large range of finished works dating back to the time of the Medici. There are vases and furnishings decorated with Art Nouveau designs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including a tabletop with a harp and garland by Emilio Zocchi (1849) and another decorated with flowers and birds by Niccolò Betti (1855).\n\n"}

In a study performed by the UCLA National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) it was proven that out-of-school learning increases the interest in education and school itself.\n\nOut-of-school learning is typically not coordinated by the school itself. Out-of-school experiences are organized with community partners such as museums, sport facilities, charity initiatives, and more. Out-of-school experiences can range from service learning to summer school and expeditions or more commonly occur in day to day experiences at after-school with creative ventures such as arts courses and even sports. Some other examples of out-of-school learning are:\n\n\nIt has been found in research by the Wallace Foundation that out-of-school learning can be a great opportunity to discover and develop talents. Especially if a professional organization develops a learning environment that guides groups of pupils/students in their co-operation in creating a professional and publicly visible product, presentation or performance. Companies, cultural institutions and non governmental organizations can offer valuable out-of-school learning experiences.\n\nOrganizations will see results accordingly to the quality of the experience, whether they aim to promote active and healthy lifestyles, increase community involvement and visitors/members, to an interest in a company's corporate responsibility projects and employment opportunities.\n\nIn the United Kingdom alone several local and state bodies run out-of-school learning projects, with additional funding from the National Lottery (£9.1m in 2000).

He organized events to honor the traditional music and dance of ethnicities in the United States and Puerto Rico – most notable being the Latin Dance Spectacular, the National Gospel Choir Competition, and the New York Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration.\n\nPaul McGlothin has attempted to bridge the gap between calorie restriction research and calorie restriction tools available to non-experts. He has attempted to integrate calorie restriction research with calorie restriction application in the following ways: a) \"The CR Way,\" co-authored with his wife, Meredith Averill, and launched on Barbara Walters’ longevity special, \"Living to 150: Can You Do It?\" It presents an approach to CR that recognizes the special challenges and opportunities that human beings experience in applying CR, as compared to the lab animals that thrive on it; b) \"The CR Way to Happy Dieting,\" an online resource that takes advantage of research in neurochemistry to support healthful weight-loss efforts by starting people on a diet that first deals biochemically with their food-related emotions; and c) the Web site, LivingTheCRWay.com, maintained to provide new research results as they develop and are evaluated. The CR Way \"diet\" is based on decades of research.\n\nBefore the UCSF project, McGlothin and Averill helped assemble the CR cohort for human studies by Drs. Luigi Fontana and John Holloszy and their colleagues at the Washington University School of Medicine This work has grown into the first longitudinal study of the effects of human calorie restriction with a focus on optimal nutrition\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s McGlothin collaborated with a variety of labs on several projects, including testing the beneficial effects of maintaining low circulating blood glucose, studying the effect on the lipid profile, produced by various dietary fats, and creating a pilot study on resveratrol that was reported at the 2004 CR Society Intl. Conference in Charleston. McGlothin’s work in testing and reporting CR results and helping create calorie restriction research projects led to his being named Research VP* of the CR Society, where he works with scientists to plan studies. He also serves on the Society’s Board of Directors.*\n\nIn 2009, A. Janet Tomiyama, Ph.D., representing the laboratories of Elizabeth Blackburn (Biophysics and Biochemistry, UCSF) and Elissa Epel (Psychiatry, UCSF), invited McGlothin and Averill to collaborate in developing a human CR research project: Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition and Aging (CRONA), including researchers in several related fields: Anne Brunet (Genetics, Stanford), Pankaj Kapahi (Buck Institute for Age Research), Cynthia Kenyon, (Biophysics and Biochemistry, UCSF), Jue Lin (Biochemistry & Biophysics, UCSF). Eric Verdin (Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology* and UCSF). By early 2011 much of the data gathering had been accomplished.\n\n"}

He is Director of Richard Weston Studio Ltd and Earth Images Ltd.\n\nWeston was born in Leicester in 1953. He attended Wyggeston Boys Grammar School. He went on to study architecture at Manchester University, gaining a BA in 1975 and BArch in 1977. Supported by the Thouron Award, he attended the University of Pennsylvania (USA) to study landscape architecture, gaining an MLA (Penn) in 1979. From 1979–1982 he worked in practice and was appointed as a lecturer at the Welsh School of Architecture (WSA) in Cardiff. He subsequently taught at the Leicester and Portsmouth schools of architecture before returning to Cardiff in 1999 as a professorial research fellow. In 2003 he was appointed to the Chair of Architecture, a position he holds today.\n\nIn addition to his teaching at the WSA, he is editor of arq (\"Architectural Research Quarterly\", Cambridge University Press) and director of Richard Weston Studio Ltd and Earth Images Ltd. Alongside his teaching duties, Weston is an experienced researcher with numerous books and publications to his name. Most notably, he is author of two award winning books, a monograph on the architect Alvar Aalto and a study of the modernist movement titled Modernism. In addition he is the author of the definitive work on the life and achievements of Sydney Opera House architect, Jørn Utzon. Famously reclusive and private, Utzon granted Weston unlimited access to his archives and himself, enabling the publication of a unique study.\n\nIn 1992, Weston designed a glass roof to cover the sunken courtyard of a house built in a redundant water tank in Hampshire. Formed of stainless steel 'gutter trusses' whose profile, like a river, widens and deepens in response to the flow of water, and between them span laminated glass arches, with an interlayer to reduce heat gain from the sun.\n\nWeston’s interest in structural glass found dramatic expression in a house he built for himself as part of FutureWorld (an exhibition designed to provide the public with a glimpse of the way homes might operate in the 21st century) in Milton Keynes. The 5.5 tonne stressed-skin plywood roof of Radiant House is supported only by glass – a feat achieved in collaboration with engineer Mark Lovell.\n\nIn 2002, he entered two architectural competitions, taking the opportunity they posed to explore ideas. The first for the Royal Playhouse in Copenhagen (in collaboration with John Pardey Architects and eventually won by Lundgaard & Tranberg Arkitekter, who went on to build it) and the second for the Great Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Whilst it did not win, the proposal, consisting of a 230m limestone dome, was selected for publication by the judges and Weston’s learning of the Egyptians’ fascination with the stars later became an inspiration for the designs for his own house and studio in Sully, South Wales - although sadly this was to remain on the drawing board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribed by the Independent on Sunday as \"the break out star of \"Britain's Next Big Thing\"\", he appeared in the seven-part BBC2 television series tracing the development of new products for leading retailers.\n\nUsing high-resolution scanners, he has generated designs for a collection of silk scarves from natural materials such as minerals and stones.This idea was presented at the ‘Best of British Open Design Call’ at Liberty in London (the world’s leading retailer of scarves) and, since their debut on the shelves in 2010, have quickly established themselves as amongst Liberty’s best selling lines.\n\nThe images, which can be printed on most natural and man-made fibres, offer a wide range of application in architecture, interior design and fashion. In addition to the scarves, they have appeared in Liza Bruce’s new ranges of swimwear. Architectural applications are also currently being developed, with leading British architects Patel Taylor featuring an ‘agate façade’ in a house in Camden Town. The London Olympic Games in 2012 followed suit, with four 5x3m images greeting athletes in the Olympic Village in Stratford. Weston's most recent public work is a four-storey banner installed in the atrium of the new Health Library at the Heath Hospital in Cardiff.\n\nThe scope of Weston's work has been extended by the purchase, in September 2014, of a sophisticated optical microscope and he is gaining increasing recognition internationally, with publications in the USA (Vincent Mok in \"Maniac Magazine\", May 2013, p58-9), Ukraine (in Russian in \"Salon\" magazine, September 2013, p82-7) and The Netherlands (\"Mark\" magazine, June/July 2014, p160-167), as well as in two books on textile design published in the UK, the first by Melanie Bowles, \"Digital Textile Design\" (Laurence King, 2012), the second, Simon Clarke's \"Print: Fashion, Interiors, Art\" (Laurence King, 2014).\n\n\n"}

Munce (January 24, 1898 – May 23, 2001) was an American romance novelist, mission teacher and founder of Keswick Christian School in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nBorn in Germantown, Pennsylvania, Ruth Glover Hill was the second daughter of Presbyterian minister, Thomas Franklin Hill, who died when she was two. As a widow, her mother, Grace Livingston Hill, author of over 100 Christian-themed romance novels, provided a comfortable lifestyle for Munce and her sibling in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Munce's mother was not the only writer in her family line. Her great-aunt, Isabella Macdonald Alden, was also a well-known author who wrote a series called \"The Pansy Books\" from the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\nAround 1925, she married Gordon Munce, who was an oil executive for Gulf. In subsequent years, the Munces adopted two sons, James and Robert. Her husband, Gordon, died in 1947. Her mother, Grace Livingston Hill, also died in 1947, in the midst of writing the novel, \"Mary Arden\". Lippincott Publishers asked Munce to finish her mother's book, and she took on that challenge. Writing under the pen-name, Ruth Livingston Hill, Munce attempted to continue in her mother's style of writing. She says that J. B. Lippincott could not tell the difference between what content was hers and what was her mother's, and Munce refused to show him any of the written variations. Completion of her mother's novel led to her own career as an author, writing six more Christian romances. She also wrote a book of Bible studies and a textbook on the book of Genesis, published in the mid-1980s.\n\nFollowing the deaths of her mother and husband, Munce moved to Tampa Bay with her two sons. She performed a three-month stint at St. Petersburg High School, teaching Bible history until the School Board decided to do away with this subject because it would open the way for more \"subversive groups.\" At a crossroads in her career, Munce chose to finish her college education that she had begun at Wheaton College, but was interrupted by World War I. She earned a teacher's certificate.\n\nAttempting to fill a void in Christian education—something she wanted for her own children—in Pinellas County, Munce, with the help of friends, started a Christian school in Fall 1952 in a temporary location at the \"Baptist Church on 22nd Avenue South.\" About 30 to 40 elementary students attended, perpetuating her passion to open a permanent school, which she did with her own financial backing in 1953 in unincorporated Pinellas County, naming it Grace Livingston Hill Memorial School, in honor of her mother.\n\nMunce remained principal of the school she founded for at least ten years, teaching Bible and English classes in her tenure. In 1961, she turned the school over to Bill Caldwell, who was operating Keswick radio stations, WKES-FM and WGNB-AM, and the Southern Keswick Bible Conference on the same site as the school. Reflecting the new ownership, the school was renamed Keswick Christian School in 1962.\n\nIn 1968, at age 70, Munce undertook an eight-year stint teaching at Nairobi Bible Institute in Kenya. Her book, \"What Happened?: A Study in Genesis (A Textbook for Christian Schools or Home Bible Study Groups)\" is based on her teachings while in Kenya. Returning home to Pinellas County in the mid-1970s, Munce made her missions local, leading up to 14 interdenominational Bible studies a week, a routine she continued well into her nineties, with participants admiring the \"breadth of her knowledge\".\n\nFor her 102nd and 103rd birthdays, Munce celebrated with Keswick students at her place of residence at Pinecrest Place in Largo, where she lived for approximately five years. Munce was said to have beamed at seeing the students, a testament to her diligence 50 years after the school's founding.\n\nMunce died May 23, 2001, at Mariner Health of Belleair, Florida, where she had been a resident for a week.\n\n"}
