{"id": "9269429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9269429", "title": "Adaptive hypermedia", "text": "Adaptive hypermedia\n\nAdaptive hypermedia (AH) uses hypermedia which is adaptive according to a \"user model\". In contrast to linear media, where all users are offered a standard series of hyperlinks, adaptive hypermedia (AH) tailors what the user is offered based on a model of the user's goals, preferences and knowledge, thus providing links or content most appropriate to the current user.<ref name=\"article6\" /\n\nAdaptive hypermedia is used in educational hypermedia, on-line information and help systems, as well as institutional information systems. Adaptive educational hypermedia tailors what the learner sees to that learner's goals, abilities, needs, interests, and knowledge of the subject, by providing hyperlinks that are most relevant to the user in an effort to shape the user's cognitive load. The teaching tools \"adapt\" to the learner. On-line information systems provide reference access to information for users with a different knowledge level of the subject.\n\nAn adaptive hypermedia system should satisfy three criteria: it should be a hypertext or hypermedia system, it should have a user model and it should be able to adapt the hypermedia using the model.\n\nA semantic distinction is made between \"adaptation\", referring to system-driven changes for personalisation, and \"adaptability\", referring to user-driven changes. One way of looking at this is that adaptation is automatic, whereas adaptability is not. From an epistemic point of view, adaptation can be described as analytic, a-priori, whereas adaptability is synthetic, a-posteriori. In other words, any adaptable system, as it \"contains\" a human, is by default \"intelligent\", whereas an adaptive system that presents \"intelligence\" is more surprising and thus more interesting.\n\nThe system categories in which user modelling and adaptivity have been deployed by various researchers in the field share an underlying architecture. The conceptual structure for adaptive systems generally consists of interdependent components: a user model, a domain model and an interaction model.\n\nThe user model is a representation of the knowledge and preferences which the system 'believes' a user (which may be an individual, a group of people or non-human agents) possesses. It is a knowledge source which is separable by the system from the rest of its knowledge and contains explicit assumptions about the user. Knowledge for the user model can be acquired implicitly by making inferences about users from their interaction with the system, by carrying out some form of test, or from assigning users to generic user categories usually called 'stereotypes'. The student model consists of a personal profile (which includes static data, e.g., name and password), cognitive profile (adaptable data such as preferences), and a student knowledge profile. Systems may adapt, depending on user features such as: \n\nThe domain model defines the aspects of the application which can be adapted or which are otherwise required for the operation of the adaptive system. The domain model contains several concepts that stand as the backbone for the content of the system. Other terms which have been used for this concept include content model, application model, system model, device model and task model. It describes educational content such as information pages, examples, and problems. The simplest content model relates every content item to exactly one domain concept (in this model, this concept is frequently referred to as a domain topic). More advanced content models use multi-concept indexing for each content item and sometimes use roles to express the nature of item-concept relationship.\nA cognitively valid domain model should capture descriptions of the application at three levels, namely:\nEach content concept has a set of topics. Topics represent individual pieces of knowledge for each domain and the size of each topic varies in relation to the particular domain. Additionally, topics are linked to each other forming a semantic network. This network is the structure of the knowledge domain.\n\nThe interaction or adaptation model contains everything which is concerned with the relationships which exist between the representation of the users (the user model) and the representation of the application (the domain model). It displays information to the user based on his or her cognitive preferences. For instance, the module will divide a page's content into chunks with conditions set to only display to certain users or preparing two variants of a single concept page with a similar condition.\nThe two main aspects to the interaction model are capturing the appropriate raw data and representing the inferences, adaptations and evaluations which may occur.\n\nContent-level and link-level adaptation are distinguished as two different classes of hypermedia adaptation; the first is termed \"adaptive presentation\" and the second, \"adaptive navigation support\".\n\nThe idea of various adaptive presentation techniques is to adapt the content of a page accessed by a particular user to current knowledge, goals, and other characteristics of the user. \nFor example, a qualified user can be provided with more detailed and deep information while a novice can receive additional explanations. \nAdaptive text presentation is the most studied technology of hypermedia adaptation. \nThere are a number of different techniques for adaptive text presentation.\n\nThe idea of adaptive navigation support techniques is to help users to find their paths in hyperspace by adapting the way of presenting links to goals, knowledge, and other characteristics of an individual user. \nThis area of research is newer than adaptive presentation, a number of interesting techniques have been already suggested and implemented. \nWe distinguish four kinds of link presentation which are different from the point of what can be altered and adapted:\n\nAdaptation methods are defined as generalizations of existing adaptation techniques. Each method is based on a clear adaptation idea which can be presented at the conceptual level.\n\n\n\nAdaptation techniques refer to methods of providing adaptation in existing AH systems.\n\n\n\nAuthoring adaptive hypermedia uses designing and creation processes for content, usually in the form of a resource collection and domain model, and adaptive behaviour, usually in the form of IF-THEN rules. Recently, adaptation languages have been proposed for increased generality. As adaptive hypermedia adapts at least to the user, authoring of AH comprises at least a user model, and may also include other aspects.\n\nAuthoring of adaptive hypermedia was long considered as secondary to adaptive hypermedia delivery. This was not surprising in the early stages of adaptive hypermedia, when the focus was on research and expansion. Now that adaptive hypermedia itself has reached a certain maturity, the issue is to bring it out to the community and let the various stakeholders reap the benefits. However, authoring and creation of hypermedia is not trivial. Unlike in traditional authoring for hypermedia and the web, a linear storyline is not enough. Instead, various alternatives have to be created for the given material. For example, if a course should be delivered both to visual and verbal learners, there should be created at least two perfectly equivalent versions of the material in visual and in verbal form, respectively. Moreover, an adaptation strategy should be created that states that the visual content should be delivered to visual learners, whereas the verbal content should be delivered to the verbal learners. Thus, authors should not only be able to create different versions of their content, but be able to specify (and in some cases, design from scratch) adaptation strategies of delivery of contents. Issues with which authoring of adaptive hypermedia is confronted are:\n\nThere already exist some approaches to help authors to build adaptive-hypermedia-based systems. However, there is a strong need for high-level approaches, formalisms and tools that support and facilitate the description of reusable adaptive hypermedia and websites. Such models started appearing (see, e.g., the AHAM model of adaptive hypermedia, or the LAOS framework for authoring of adaptive hypermedia). Moreover, recently have we noticed a shift in interest, as it became clearer that the implementation-oriented approach would forever keep adaptive hypermedia away from the 'layman' author. The creator of adaptive hypermedia cannot be expected to know all facets of the process as described above. Still, he/she can be reasonably trusted to be an expert in one of these facets. For instance, it is reasonable to expect that there are content experts (such as, e.g., experts in chemistry, for instance). It is reasonable to expect, for adaptive educational hypermedia that there are experts in pedagogy, who are able to add pedagogical metadata to the content created by content experts. Finally, it is reasonable to expect that adaptation experts will be the one creating the implementation of adaptation strategies, and descriptions (metadata) of such nature that they can be understood and applied by laymen authors. This type of division of work determines the different authoring personas that should be expected to collaborate in the creation process of adaptive hypermedia. Moreover, the contributions of these various personas correspond to the different modules that are to be expected in adaptive hypermedia systems.\n\n\nBy the early 1990s, the two main parent areas – hypertext and user modeling – had achieved a level of maturity that allowed for the research in these areas to be explored together. Many researchers had recognized the problems of static hypertext in different application areas, and explored various ways to adapt the output and behavior of hypertext systems to suit the needs of individual users. Several early papers on adaptive hypermedia were published in the \"User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction\" (UMUAI) journal; the first workshop on adaptive hypermedia was held during a user modeling conference; and a special issue of UMUAI on adaptive hypermedia was published in 1996. Several innovative adaptive hypermedia techniques had been developed, and several research-level adaptive hypermedia systems had been built and evaluated.\n\nAfter 1996, adaptive hypermedia grew rapidly. Research teams commenced projects in adaptive hypermedia, and many students selected the subject area for their PhD theses. A book on adaptive hypermedia, and a special issue of the New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (1998) were published. Two main factors accounted for this growth. Due a diverse audience, the internet boosted research into adaptivity. Almost all the papers published before 1996 describe classic pre-Web hypertext and hypermedia; the majority of papers published since 1996 are devoted to Web-based adaptive hypermedia systems. The second factor was is the accumulation and consolidation of research experience in the field. Early papers provided few references to similar work in adaptive hypermedia, and described original laboratory systems developed to demonstrate and explore innovative ideas. After 1996, papers cite earlier work, and usually suggest either real world systems, or research systems developed for real world settings by elaborating or an extending techniques suggested earlier. This is indicative of the relative maturity of adaptive hypermedia as a research direction.\n\nAdaptive hypermedia and user modeling continue to be actively researched, with results published in several journals and conferences such as:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7451091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7451091", "title": "Australian Rostrum", "text": "Australian Rostrum\n\nRostrum Australia (formerly Australian Rostrum) is an association of Australian public speaking clubs, founded on 21 July 1930. It is the main continuation of the original Rostrum club (\"The Rostrum\") founded in Manchester, United Kingdom on 21 July 1923. This club's other surviving descendants are \"Rochdale Rostrum\", a Rostrum club in the Greater Manchester area founded in 1978; and the presently dormant \"Wellington Rostrum Club\" in New Zealand.\n\nIts early establishment makes Rostrum the longest running public speaking organisation in the world.\n\nRostrum clubs aim to help their members improve their speaking and meeting skills. They do this primarily through regular club meetings and less frequent competitions.\n\nAustralian Rostrum's main national competition for members is the \"Sidney Wicks Speaking Competition\". This is held roughly every six to eight years. In other years, state and territory competitions are dominant.\n\nIts other main national competition is the annual Rostrum Voice of Youth (VOY). This is open to all high school students. It involves a prepared speech and an impromptu speech.\n\nRostrum was founded by Sidney F. Wicks. Wicks was an author, an advertising executive for the Manchester Guardian, public relations practitioner Company Director and Newspaper Chief Editor. He came to believe that people needed to think through their own decision-making processes rather than just accept the promotions of the press and other interested parties. On 21 July 1923, he founded a club in Manchester with the prime purpose to encourage men to listen to many sources before formulating their own opinions, and then to speak their minds to groups of others in a way that would encourage them to listen. The club began as an offshoot of the Manchester YMCA Businessmen's Speaking Class.\n\nAfter the first meeting under a yew tree at Greendale Farm near Manchester, meetings for YMCA members were held on Wednesday evenings in the local YMCA building. In 1924 a young Australian Engineer training in Manchester, Alan Crook (later MBE), joined Rostrum while studying at the Victoria University of Manchester. The following year he returned to Australia.\n\nCrook, with the help of Robert Swainson and Stuart McPhee, formed a Rostrum Club in Sydney. It was founded on 21 July 1930, coincidentally exactly seven years after the original club. It was founded under an Angophora tree on the shores of Middle Harbour in Sydney. Alan Crook was the first President and Robert Swainson the Critic. Like the Manchester Club, this was a dinner club. In November 1931, \"Luncheon Club No.1\" was formed, Alan Crook again being the first President. \"No.2 Luncheon Club\" was formed in July 1932, No.3 in July 1933 and No.4 Club in July 1934. The original club was given the name of \"Foundation Club\".\n\nIn May 1934, Alan Crook went to Melbourne for a holiday and formed a Rostrum Club which a few months later, together with the then five Sydney Clubs, became the first Dais (regional council). Fred Seamons was the first President and held this office for 15 years. A second Rostrum club was formed in Melbourne in July 1935 and the Victorian clubs then formed their own Dais.\n\nOn the evening of 3 December 1935, George McNicholl, Treasurer of the Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works and Chairman of the Australian Institute of Secretaries (AIS), moved a very gracious vote of thanks to a guest speaker from the SA branch of the AIS. Afterwards, some SA residents present asked McNicholl how he became to be such a good speaker. He told them about Rostrum. This discussion lead to the first South Australian meeting. It was held in Adelaide on 18 February 1936 in the inner suburb of North Terrace.\n\nIn 1937, Alan Crook took a business trip to Brisbane and during this trip, he initiated Queensland's first club on 6 May 1937. By November that year Brisbane's second club was launched.\n\nAn Australian Rostrum Council was established on 5 January 1938, bringing together the state Daises. Fred Seamons was the President for the first eight years. Alan Crook served as Secretary for 27 years until his death on 9 August 1965.\n\nBy the end of the 1930s there were many Rostrum clubs throughout NSW, Victoria, SA and Queensland.\n\nRostrum in Australia took a while to spread further west and south, as World War II curtailed expansion. The first club in Tasmania started in 1947 and Western Australia's first club was founded on 21 May 1948.\n\nHowever, there was some growth to the north, with the AHG Rostrum Club running in the Changi POW camp from 1943 to 1944.\n\nThe second Rostrum Club in the UK was started in 1951. By this time, there were nearly 100 Rostrum Clubs in Australia. Speaking clubs were not as popular in the UK as in Australia, the main speaking club group there at the time, Toastmasters had only six clubs before World War II.\n\nThe ACT's first club was founded on 3 March 1953.\n\nIn 1956, the Secretary of the Victorian Dias, Jo Davis, began a speaking competition for Victorian members. This competition later took his name as the \"Jo Davis Cup\" after his death in 1964.\n\nIn the late '50s, a Dais was formed for the ACT. This Dais went on to include clubs from nearby parts of NSW.\n\nA book titled \"Rostrum in Victoria: 1934-1959\" by RE Tonkin was released by the Victorian Dais around this time.\n\nThe 1960s were a time of rapid growth in the organisation in the ACT and surrounds. Five new clubs became established there during this time.\n\n\"Take the Chair\", a book on meeting procedure was written for Rostrum by WA members Cecil Carr and Alan Foyster in 1962. The book sold over 90,000 copies in Australia between its release and 1990, when it was rewritten.\n\nIn 1965 Alan Crook died, shortly after receiving an MBE for his work establishing Australian Rostrum.\n\n\"Have something to say: a text book for public speakers\" was written in 1969 by ACT member Laurie Burgess.\n\n\"Chairmanship and Public Speaking\" was written for Rostrum in the 1960s by NSW member Evan Bowen-Thomas.\n\nVarious levels of Australian Rostrum ran youth competitions in the early 1970s. In 1974, the various NSW local competitions were combined into a statewide \"Voice of Youth\" competition. In 1975, Voice of Youth went national, the first national final being held in Canberra. This competition continues today.\n\n1974 saw the creation of the \"ACT Rostrum Critics Club\", a group devoted to improving critiques in the ACT.\n\nUntil 1978, Rostrum in Australia was restricted to men but in that year, the national constitution was changed to allow the entry of women. However, women could not become a member without the Dais council in their state or territory also changing their rules to allow it. Within a few months there were female members in all states except Western Australia, which remained male only until 1986.\n\nAlso in 1978, a new club was founded in the UK – Rochdale Rostrum.\n\nThe release of \"History of ACT Rostrum\" by Roy Ayrton and Tom Trebilco was another 1978 event. Tom was later awarded an MBE for his Rostrum work.\n\nThe first \"Sidney Wicks Speaking Competition\" was held in Sydney in 1980 to celebrate 50 years of Rostrum in Australia. It was won by David Mead from WA. The competition is also known as the \"National Rostrum Speaking Competition\" and \"Sidney Wicks Trophy\".\n\n1984 saw Victorian member David Shaw write \"Towards Better Meetings\".\n\nIn 1985 Rostrum Victoria celebrated its Golden Jubilee with a dinner at the National Gallery of Victoria and other celebrations.\n\nWestern Australian clubs began to admit women in 1986.\n\nAlso in 1986, NSW member John White and WA President David Julian Price released the first version of Rostrum's current curriculum standard, the \"Personal Development Program\" (then \"Member's Development Program\").\n\n\"Brighter Rostrum meetings: how to make your Rostrum Club meetings more interesting\" (edited by George Shaw) and \"History of ACT Rostrum, Club 8, 1965-1986\" (by Eric Martin and Don Clark) were yet more Rostrum titles released in 1986.\n\n1987 saw Rostrum release the book \"Excellence for Communicators\" by Laurie Burgess. The then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, wrote the foreword.\n\nThis book was followed in 1988 by \"How Do I?\", and the South Australian \"Word master: word a day calendar: a vocabulary expander concept\".\n\nThe second Sidney Wicks competition was held in Canberra in August 1988 during the Australian Bicentenary celebrations, and was won by Bill Smith from WA. It was held in conjunction with a national conference entitled \"Speak up Australia\", held at the Australian Academy of Science's \"Shine Dome\". The conference was joint project of Australian Rostrum and the Penguin Club of Australia, aimed to promote oral communication, especially to children.\nIn 1989, the book \"A Critic's Bag of Remedies\" was produced by WA members.\n\nIn 1990, a new version of popular \"Take the Chair\" (rewritten by Rostrum WA members David Julian Price, Harold Luxton and Bill Smith) was released.\n\n1990 also saw NSW member Alan Milston release the history \"Rostrum in Australia 1930-1965\".\n\nIn 1993, Australian Rostrum declared Robyn Williams \"Speaker of the Year\".\n\nSydney hosted the third Sidney Wicks competition in 1994. The winner was Brian Gillespie of Queensland Rostrum.\n\nAlso in 1994, Bert Crummer wrote the 84 page book \"A brief history of Rostrum Club No. 3 (Brisbane)\".\n\nIn 1997, New Zealand Rostrum declared Peter Biggs \"Speaker of the Decade\". Also in that year, \"Not to be silent: a history of Rostrum in Tasmania\" was written by Malcolm Grant, \"Meetings Made Easy\" (a revised version of \"Towards Better Meetings\") was produced by Arthur Martin for Rostrum Victoria, and South Australian member Ron Johnson released \"Tips on Public Speaking and Meeting Procedure\".\n\nThe fourth Sidney Wicks competition was held in Hobart on 7 August 1999 in conjunction with the first Rostrum National Convention. The winner was Andrew Dickson from the ACT zone.\n\n2000 saw the release of \"The torch of truth and freedom: the South Australian Rostrum history, 1936-1999\" by Colin Chiverton, and \"Tips on Public Speaking and Meeting Procedure: Volume 2\" by Ron Johnson.\n\nIn 2005 the fifth Sidney Wicks competition was held in Perth on 15 October at the National Convention celebrating 75 years of Rostrum in Australia. The winner was Clarrie Pryor from Tasmania.\n\nIn 2005, there were over 140 clubs in Australia, collectively containing nearly 1700 members. There is currently one small club in Manchester, England. The sole remaining club in New Zealand, in Wellington, is at present in recess.\n\nOver 3000 students participate in the Voice of Youth each year, covering over 500 schools.\n\nIn 2011 the sixth Sidney Wicks competition was held in Adelaide South Australia in October in conjunction with the National Convention. The winner was Jenny Blain of Malvern Rostrum Club 45 in Victoria.\n\nThe seventh Sidney Wicks competition was held in Brisbane in conjunction with the annual Australian Rostrum Council conference and the forty third Voice of Youth National finals in late July 2017. The winner was Rob Ellison of Carnegie Rostrum Club 68 in Victoria.\n\nEach year clubs in Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory hold inter club regional competitions which lead into state wide competitions.\n\nThese typically determine the Speaker of the Year for the state or territory. In Victoria the competition is called the state Jo Davis Cup in recognition of a previous active and respected member.\n\nThe national Sydney Wicks competition is held between representatives of the State and Territory Rostrum Zones every 5 to 7 years as part of an annual Australian Rostrum Council conference.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1960 by the four children of Dr Walter Murray Buntine who survived him – Dr R. M. Buntine, Dr M. A. Buntine, Dr R. D. Buntine, and Mrs. D. M. G. Wilson – in his memory. The inaugural oration was given by Peter Karmel (who had, himself, attended Caulfield Grammar School from 1929 to 1939) in 1962 at the third annual ACE conference and the most recent was in 2008.\nDr Walter Buntine (1866–1953) had a significant role in the development of education in the Australian state of Victoria from his position as headmaster of Caulfield Grammar School (1896–1932). His son, Dr M. Arnold Buntine (1898–1975), was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda before studying education and earning a PhD from the University of Edinburgh. Prior to World War II, Arnold was headmaster of Camberwell Grammar School in Victoria and then the Hale School in Western Australia. He served at Tobruk and in Syria as a captain in the 2/28th Battalion. Ultimately rising to Lieutenant-Colonel, he led the 2/11th Battalion. He returned to the Hale School in 1944, returning to Victoria in 1945 as headmaster of Geelong College. Arnold was married to Gladys (Jim) Buntine (1901–1992), who was the Chief Commissioner of the Australian Girl Guides from 1962 until 1968 and an advocate for the importance of education. She was awarded first an OBE and later an MBE for her services to youth. Robert Buntine (1929–2014), their son, had leadership roles at The King's School and Newington College in Sydney. Professor Mark Buntine of Curtin University of Technology is the most current of the Buntine family of educators.\n\nThe Buntine Oration has been delivered by many highly recognised people. Paul Hasluck was the Australian Minister for External Affairs at the time he delivered the 1964 oration, going on to become Governor-General of Australia in 1969. Zelman Cowen was the Governor-General at the time of the 1980 oration. Michael Somare was elected to the first national parliament of Papua New Guinea in 1972, becoming chief minister by the time of the 1974; he became the country's first Prime Minister when independence was granted in 1975. 2006 orator Peter Doherty shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and was the 1997 Australian of the Year.

Grey also posts videos on his secondary channel, \"CGPGrey2\", and livestreams gameplay on another channel, \"CGP Play\".\n\nHis YouTube channel mainly features short explanatory videos on varying subjects, including politics, geography, economics, history, and culture. The channel's most popular video is an explanation of the terminology of the British Isles, which went viral in 2011. Grey's videos have since received increasing attention, and have been reviewed in several publications, including \"Business Insider\" and \"The Washington Post\".\n\nIn addition to video production, Grey is known for creating the audio podcast \"Hello Internet\" in 2014 with fellow educational YouTuber Brady Haran. Since 2015, he has also hosted the audio podcast \"Cortex\" with Myke Hurley of Relay FM. Along with Philipp Dettmer and Dave Wiskus, Grey started the company Standard Broadcast LLC, which provides production and administrative support to digital creators.\n\nGrey grew up in the Long Island suburbs of New York City. He went to college in upstate New York, earning two degrees – one in physics and another in sociology.\n\nHis grandmother was born in Ireland, and when he was a child, his father had applied for Irish citizenship on his behalf; Grey thus has dual American–Irish citizenship. This enabled him to look into opportunities in the European Union, and its largest city, London. He later said that if he did not live abroad while \"still free of life's anchors\", he never would, which made it all the more reason for him to go. He attended a masters in economics program in London, and stayed in the city for more than a decade.\n\nGrey decided to become a physics teacher in the UK; he went through a one-year course to earn a physics PGCE, and graduated being qualified to teach physics in England and Wales. He taught on and off until his career as a YouTube creator became reliable. Since January 2014 he has co-hosted a general discussion podcast, \"Hello Internet\", and began a second podcast, \"Cortex\" with Myke Hurley of Relay FM.\n\nThe YouTube channel \"CGP Grey\" features, among other things, \"Grey Explains\", a series of explanatory videos on a range of subjects, including politics, geography, economics, and British culture. The videos feature Grey narrating over animations, stock footage, and still photographs. While nearly all of Grey's videos feature his voice, his face has never been shown in his videos, and Grey almost always has his face obscured when appearing in other people's videos; he generally uses a stick figure with glasses to represent himself. His videos also often include hidden links, often leading to Monty Python videos. Grey has stated that the presentation style of his videos is influenced by that of Yahtzee Croshaw's \"Zero Punctuation\" series.\n\nGrey records his voice over the music playing in the background on Logic Pro X. The backing music of his early videos is usually credited to Kevin MacLeod. Since 2016, most videos contain music written by David Rees. He used to use Inkscape to make the key frames of his videos and Final Cut Pro X to edit them together from 2010 to early 2016; but now he uses Adobe After Effects to do both. The switch is primarily because he now works with other animators on most of his videos, and they use After Effects. Videos are released on the channel significantly less frequently than other YouTube channels; Grey has said that this is due to thorough research and scriptwriting, with the majority of videos never being finished.\n\nGrey's video that debunks popular misconceptions has been featured on CBS, as has his video about the history of the British Royal Family. Two videos differentiate London, England and the City of London, while explaining certain oddities that arise from the ancient customs of the latter.

Nearly 1,100 educational institutions, more than a third of all higher education providers in the United States, are members.\n\nThe non-profit comprises a national office located in Boston, MA as well as state and regional compact offices to support the work of member colleges. Campus Compact has members mostly throughout the United States, but also has members in many US Territories and countries outside of the US as well. \n\nThe Compact was co-founded in 1985 by the presidents of Brown, Georgetown and Stanford universities, and Frank Newman, the former president of the Education Commission of the States.\n\nInitially, the work of the Compact focused on engaging students in community service. Media coverage at the time portrayed college-age students as part of a 'me generation', more interested in increasing their wealth and status than serving their community. The founding presidents aimed to counteract this prevailing image, by showcasing the good work college students were already and providing support and encouragement for others to participate.\n\nIn 1988, the first two state Compact affiliates were formed to provide greater support to campuses and build regional and local networks.\n\nIn 1991, membership had reached 500 colleges and universities. By this time, national attention had turned to the connection between participation in community service and academic achievement. Campus Compact launched the Integrating Service with Academic Study (ISAS) initiative, which funded grants and workshops to support colleges interested in building service-learning into their institutions.\n\nBy 2000, service-learning had become an increasingly important educational movement. Campus Compact began a series of publications that documented the effects of service learning and provided resources to help faculty and departments build their own programs and curricula.\n\nIn 2002, Campus Compact launched the Raise Your Voice campaign, the Compact's first national effort to work with students themselves. Over the two years of the campaign, the participation of more than 250,000 students was documented.\n\nIn 2005, the 20th year of its existence, Campus Compact had grown to 32 state affiliates and more than 1000 member campuses.\n\nOver time, the Compact has grown from a presidents' organization to one that supports the work of a variety of constituencies - college presidents, faculty, staff, students and community partners.\n\nIn 2009, Campus Compact moved its national office from the campus of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island to the Downtown Crossing district of Boston, Massachusetts. They share an office building with the New England Board of Higher Education.\n\nIn 2016, Campus Compact celebrated their 30th anniversary and circulated an Action Statement. This commitment of more than 400 college and university presidents expressed shared goals and enhanced action throughout the network regarding the public purpose of higher education. \n\n"}

She received a Boston Society of Landscape Architects award in 1988 for her restoration plan for Fredrick Law Olmsted's Buttonwood Park in New Bedford, Massachusetts. She wrote extensively on land art and landscape architecture, and was known for her advocacy for integrating art works and landscape.\n\nBorn in Peoria, Illinois, Kluesing lived in various locations in the Midwest during her formative years. Her parents, Byron and Ginger, had two other later offspring, John and Nancy. The near Kluesing family was composed of siblings John, Alvin, Peter, Olga and Herman. Byron, Cherie's father, was a child of John's first wife along with Alvin and Millie. Cherie often mentioned the childhood influences of her great uncle Herman Kluesing, great aunt Olga Ryan and aunt Marylin Duke (daughter of Peter). Herman, an interior designer, created a sketch of World War I that is reputedly part of the Louvre's collection. Childless, Herman spent time with Marylin Duke, as well as John's other stepchildren Connie Springborn and Lucy Ihrcke. Olga was a milliner (hat designer) and Marylin Duke was a costume designer. Connie Springborn worked briefly for Marylin Duke who influenced her to attend art school at McMurry College. She later completed her studies at the Museum School at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Cherie and her aunt Connie met later (c1983) and formed a familial and artistic bond.\n\nKluesing received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Bradley University in 1969 under the tutelage of Nita Sunderland and others. She continued her studies at Temple University, Tyler School of Art. With the Creative and Performing Arts fellowship, she received her Masters of Landscape Architecture degree from University of Illinois in 1978 along with the Outstanding Graduate Student Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Her thesis focused on Allerton Park in Monticello IL, a 1,517 acre former estate that is now a National Historic Place. Her thesis dealt with issues of art in the landscape and historic preservation, two topics that became central to her practice in later life.\n\nChair Robert Riley and Natalie Alpert recognized the promise Kluesing offered and brought her on as part of the faculty upon her graduation. Kluesing began teaching as an assistant professor at the Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois (1978 to 1982) where she served as Chair of the Lorado Taft Lecture Committee from 1981 to 1982 and received the Outstanding Educator Award from the Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture (CELA) in 1981. She moved on the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) an assistant professor from 1982 - 1985 where she taught with Laurie Olin, Peter Walker, Carl Steinitz and Michael Van Valkenburgh.\n\nKluesing was exposed to landscape architecture while working for Barton-Ashman Associates in Evanston IL from 1973 to 1975 where she contributed primarily as a graphic designer on urban redevelopment planning projects prior to attending the University of Illinois. Kluesing began professional practice with Walker Design Group in Urbana, Illinois in 1979. She became a partner with Walker-Kluesing Design Group as the office moved from Belmont MA to Boston MA in 1985. The work focused on a mix of institutional, commercial, corporate and public work, with the latter focusing primarily on large historic parks.\n\nIndividual Project Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, Design Arts Program Grant, 'New Landscapes: Observing the National Collection', 1984 - 1985\n\nResearch Grant, Harvard University Graduate School of Design, 'Observing the National Landscape: 25 Years of Art on the American Landscape', 1983\n\nMerit Award, American Society of Landscape Architects, \"Reclamation Works: An Aesthetic Approach to Land Reclamation\", 1981\n\nOutstanding Educator Award, Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture, 1981\n\nEntering Professional Designer Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, Design Arts Program, 1980 -1981\n\nMerit Award, Boston Society of Landscape Architects, Visitor Center Park, Lawrence Heritage State Park, 1994\n\nMerit Award, American Society of Landscape Architects, Boston Common Management Plan, 1992\n\nMerit Award, Boston Society of Landscape Architects, Larz Anderson Park, Brookline, 1992\n\nMerit Award, Boston Society of Landscape Architects, The Children's Hospital Gateway Park and Winter Garden, Boston MA 1990\n\nMerit Award, Boston Society of Landscape Architects, Buttonwood Park Master Plan, New Bedford MA, 1988\n\nMerit Award, Boston Society of Landscape Architects, Viewing Courtyard, Boston MA, 1988\n\n\nThe Cherie Kluesing Fellowship is a full tuition fellowship that is awarded to an entering graduate student in the Landscape Architecture (at the University of Illinois) who shows the best promise for integrating art and design.\n"}

Along with other politics and international studies units at King's College London, it ranks amongst the top places for international relations in the world. The department is devoted to the multi-disciplinary study of war and diplomacy within the broad remit of international relations.\n\nThe department's alumni includes senior government officials, military personnel, diplomats, journalists, academics and businesspeople. Amongst them are former Prime Minister of Jordan Marouf al-Bakhit; Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Iraq Nickolay Mladenov and former Commandant General Royal Marines Sir Robert Fry. The department is affiliated with numerous think-tanks and foreign policy institutions. It also houses numerous research institutes and centres, including the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives.\n\nSince 2016, the Head of Department has been Michael Rainsborough, who is also the Professor of Strategic Theory. The Department of War Studies is located on the 6th floor of the King's Building on the Strand Campus of King's College London.\n\nA Department of Military Science existed at King's College London from 1848 to 1859. Military Science was subsequently approved as a subject for the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science general degrees from 1913, and was taught under the Faculty of Arts and also the Faculty of Engineering.\n\nIn 1926 the intervention of William Norton Medlicott prevented the Department of History from ridding itself of the lectureship in Military History. With War Office support the Military Studies Department was established in 1926 and formed part of the Faculty of Arts, with Major General Sir Frederick Barton Maurice holding the Chair. It became known as the War Studies Department in 1943 but was discontinued in 1948, although the subject continued to be taught under the Department of Medieval and Modern History.\n\nFollowing the World War II, there was an initiative by senior members of University of London notably Lionel Robbins, Sir Charles Webster and Keith Hancock, to revive Military Studies at the University. In 1953, Sir Michael Howard was appointed to the Lectureship in Military Studies, and by 1962 Sir Michael was able to reinstate the Department of War Studies to offer postgraduate courses.\n\nA Bachelor of Arts degree in War Studies was offered from 1992 onwards. The department became part of the School of Humanities in 1989 and the School of Social Science and Public Policy in 2001.\n\nIn 2012 the department celebrated its 50th anniversary, with a series of celebratory events to mark the occasion.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Tolstoy Cup is an annual football match played between the students of the Department of War Studies at King's and the Department of Peace Studies at the University of Bradford since 1995.

He was requested to leave his work in Nicaragua due to political tensions that put Miller at risk of being killed but he was frustrated to be sent back to his native home where he remained for some time to teach. He was known for his construction and practical abilities to the point where students at Cretin High School referred to him as \"Brother Fix-It\". Miller was later sent to Guatemala where he taught and he remained there until he was shot dead while on a ladder. His murder was never resolved despite a long investigation into the assassination.\n\nMiller's beatification process opened in Huehuetenango on 2 September 2009 - though the cause's formal introduction came on 15 December 2009 - and Miller became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis approved Miller's beatification in late 2018 and it is expected to be celebrated in his native United States sometime in 2019.\n\nJames Alfred Miller Miller was born premature on 21 September 1944 to farmers in Stevens Point. Miller weighed almost four pounds upon birth but later would stand at six feet two inches and weighed 220 pounds. He grew up in Custer. In his adulthood he was noted for having a boisterous guffaw that could startle people.\n\nMiller first attended grammar school in his area before he entered high school. He later joined the De La Salle Brothers as a freshman at Pacelli High School and received a master's degree in Spanish from S.M.U. in Winona. It was while a freshman that he first met the De La Salle Brothers. In September 1959 he entered the juniorate in Missouri and was then admitted as a postulant into the order in 1962. He commenced his novitiate in August 1962 then assumed the habit and the religious name \"Leo William\". But he would later resume using his baptismal name like some of his confreres.\n\nMiller first worked as a teacher in Cretin High School where he taught Spanish and English in addition to religious education. It was also there that he oversaw maintenance and coached football. Miller made his perpetual vows in August 1960.\n\nIn 1969 he was sent to Bluefields in Nicaragua where he taught in schools until 1974 when he was sent to Puerto Cabezas and helped build an industrial arts and vocational complex. Under his leadership as director the school he taught at managed grew from 300 to 800 students. He also accepted a task of supervising the construction of ten new rural schools. But his superiors later ordered him to leave Nicaragua in July 1979 due to the Sandinistas revolution that had broken out. This was also exacerbated due to Miller's distant collaboration with the Somoza government which placed him in direct risk of being a Sandinistas victim. Miller maintained distant ties to the Somoza government because he saw that as a good chance to have the government expand the schools according to his former classmate and confrere Francis Carr. But some residents took his cordial relations with the government as tacit support which came to concern his superiors. This grew after Miller received threats to the point that the Sandinistas placed his name on a list of people to be \"dealt with\".\n\nBut he became worried that his leaving would be seen as an act of cowardice and so wrote to the people to tell them that he would return. But Miller was never to return to Nicaragua which frustrated him. He was frustrated with his time back in his native home and wrote that \"I'm bored up here\" and that \"I am anxious to return to Latin America\".\n\nHe returned to the United States where he taught once again at Cretin High School in St. Paul in Minnesota before he returned to teach in Central America from 1979 to 1981. In 1980 he participated in the De Cristo renewal program in New Mexico. While teaching he fixed things around the school to the point that the students referred to him as \"Brother Fix-It\" since he dealt with maintenance issues and was often seen with a wrench in his hand. He also assisted students who had forgotten their locker combinations. He was later transferred to Guatemala in January 1981 where he would remain for the remainder of his life teaching in Huehuetenango. Miller devoted himself to providing job and leadership skills to the natives in order to ease the oppression the native Guatemalan Indians suffered.\n\nThree hooded and masked men shot and killed Miller during the afternoon on 13 February 1982 as the latter was on a ladder repairing a wall at the De La Salle Indian School at Huehuetenango. Miller died at the scene and died before he hit the ground. He had sent a student inside to get a tool to aid his work and several children witnessed the murder while watching Miller from a window. Unsuccessful attempts were made to find the assassins and the Guatemalan government expressed regret that the case had dragged on for so long. The government later concluded that \"subversive criminal elements\" were perhaps responsible for the murder and closed the case. His funeral rites were celebrated in both Guatemala and St. Paul before his remains were interred in the Polonia parish in Wisconsin.\n\nThere were some who believed that his murder was in retaliation for the work of the order to prevent native males from being conscripted. Despite students being exempt from armed service four men abducted the native student named Epifanio Camposeco to force him to enter on after seizing him in the Huehuetenango marketplace on 31 January 1982. To that end the religious brother Paul Joslin went to the authorities to obtain the student's release between 31 January and 11 February but failed to do so despite the religious' adamant protests. Joslin later recalled that Miller came to his office hours before his murder (in the morning) to inform him that he would be going on a picnic with his class later that afternoon.\n\nMiller's murder in Guatemala came during a string of priests and religious being assassinated such as Blessed Stanley Francis Rother (five months after Miller).\n\nThe beatification process opened in Huehuetenango on 2 September 2009 in a diocesan process that later concluded in 2010. This diocesan investigation collected available documentation regarding Miller's life as well as a series of witness testimonies from those who knew Miller. But the formal introduction to the cause came on 15 December 2009 under Pope Benedict XVI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared \"nihil obstat\" (nothing against the cause) and titled Miller as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process on 9 July 2010 in Rome while later receiving the Positio dossier for assessment.\n\nNine theologians that consult the C.C.S. issued unanimous approval to Miller's cause on 20 March 2018. Pope Francis confirmed Miller's beatification in a decree issued on 7 November 2018; the beatification is set to take place in his native United States sometime in 2019.\n\nThe current postulator for the cause is the De La Salle brother Rodolfo Cosimo Meoli.\n\nThe La Crosse diocese sponsors an annual Brother James Miller Social Justice Award. The \"Brother James Miller Fund\" was established after Miller's death and aims to continue his work for the poor and oppressed.\n\n"}

From 1911 to 1913, and 1920 to 1923, she and her family joined her father who was working in India. The move to Jamshedpur had a huge impact on the young Kathleen. In particular the rich variety of textiles and brilliant colours made vivid impressions on her. On their return from India, Kathleen attended Arbroath High School. When at school in Arbroath she followed the curriculum derived from the system published by Anne Macbeth and Margaret Swanson published in their book \"Educational Needlecraft\" in 1911. In her final year she embroidered a huge panel of Saint Elizabeth of Bohemia.\n\nOn leaving school Kathleen went to Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen to follow a Diploma Course in General Design from 1928 to 1932. Amongst other things she studied embroidery and was strongly influenced by her teacher Dorothy Angus who inspired her with what she later described as, \"the vast potential of stitchery\". She was a particularly successful student, winning the Founder's Prize as the best student in the second year of the general course, the Alexander Barker Prize as a result of the competition for third year students, and in the fourth year won the Former Students Association Prize for her entry The Fish Wife. In 1932 she was awarded a Diploma in Design and Decorative Art with distinction.\n\nAfter a year at Aberdeen Teacher Training College Kathleen became assistant art teacher at Frederick Street School in the East End of Aberdeen. On leaving Frederick Street in 1940 she taught briefly at the Central Secondary School and then went on the Aberdeen High School for Girls. As well as teaching children she taught adults in evening classes at the Art School. Later, during the war, she taught service men and women to do leather work.\n\nKathleen had been making her own clothes since the mid-1920s and in the early 1940s, because of the wartime restrictions, she began weaving fabric, not only for herself but for her mother, sisters and friends too. Despite the scarcity of material and the clothing coupon limitations she always seemed able to lay her hands on plenty of yarn.\n\nIn 1948, on the advice of Mr. D. M. Southerland, Head of Gray's School of Art, and supported by Dorothy Angus, Kathleen successfully applied for the post of embroidery and weaving lecturer at Glasgow School of Art.\n\nThis was the time of an embroidery revival in Glasgow. As Kathleen was making improvements at Glasgow School of Art, the Needlework Development Scheme was becoming more active and was beginning to make an impact on the wider public. In particular, modern stylish examples of Scandinavian embroidery and weaving were hugely influential. Over some years Kathleen travelled in Scandinavia, visiting weaving and craft centres and developing relationships with leading needle workers and weavers. There were frequent exhibitions of Scandinavian designs throughout Britain, including Glasgow School of Art whose staff and students also visited Denmark. \n\nThe Glasgow School of Art design courses were constantly being improved in response to commercial demands. Kathleen visited several English art schools to assess and evaluate the new Diploma in Art and Design courses they were teaching and was later invited to serve on the Dip AD visiting panel as the embroidery expert. She continued to be extremely influential in the development of higher education courses and became an Art Adviser to the Scottish Education Department, planning new examinations. Three of her former students became heads of the Embroidery Departments at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, Gray's School of Art and Glasgow School of Art. In 1969 she was awarded the MBE for services to Scottish Art Education.\n\nAlthough honoured for her contribution to education, it is her own distinctive work for which she is best known. Throughout her career she has had many prestigious commissions, including her very well known ecclesiastical work. Many of these were pulpit falls and communion cloths undertaken for the Church of Scotland, depicting simple, elegantly stylised religious imagery.\n\nHowever, her commissions were not limited to those for the church. In 1966 she was commissioned, by the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, through the Scottish Craft Centre, to embroider a stole as a gift for Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The stole was to be presented to the Queen Mother to commemorate her opening the Tay Road Bridge. This inspired Kathleen to create a design incorporating pearls from the River Tay. These were supplied by a jeweller in Perth, pierced for sewing, and ranging in size from tiny seeds to 9.5 mm in diameter. The Tay Bridge Stole was worn by Her Majesty and was exhibited at the \"Skill\" exhibition staged by the Institute of Directors, The Craft Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre in 1968. It was shown again in 1987 in a retrospective exhibition of her work, organised by the Scottish Branch of the Embroiders' Guild and held in the Edinburgh College of Art.\n\nKathleen's book \"Design in Embroidery\" was published in 1982 and \"Kathleen Whyte Embroiderer\", her biography written by Liz Arthur, was published in 1989.\n\nThe work of Kathleen Whyte was featured in \"A Scottish Celebration\", a touring exhibition of contemporary textiles to mark the centenary of the foundation of the Embroiderers' Guild, which opened at Aberdeen Art Gallery in October 2006. Examples of her work can be found in the Royal Scottish Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, many churches, and in other public and private collections.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51097", "title": "Kurt Weill", "text": "Kurt Weill\n\nKurt Julian Weill (March 2, 1900April 3, 1950) was a German Jewish composer, active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States. He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with Bertolt Brecht. With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work \"The Threepenny Opera\", which included the ballad \"Mack the Knife\". Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. He also wrote several works for the concert hall. He became a United States citizen on August 27, 1943.\n\nWeill was born on March 2, 1900, the third of four children to Albert Weill (1867–1950) and Emma Weill (née Ackermann; 1872–1955). He grew up in a religious Jewish family in the \"Sandvorstadt\", the Jewish quarter in Dessau in Saxony, where his father was a cantor. At the age of twelve, Weill started taking piano lessons and made his first attempts at writing music; his earliest preserved composition was written in 1913 and is titled \"Mi Addir. Jewish Wedding Song\".\n\nIn 1915, Weill started taking private lessons with Albert Bing, Kapellmeister at the \"Herzogliches Hoftheater zu Dessau\", who taught him piano, composition, music theory, and conducting. Weill performed publicly on piano for the first time in 1915, both as an accompanist and soloist. The following years he composed numerous Lieder to the lyrics of poets such as Joseph von Eichendorff, Arno Holz, and Anna Ritter, as well as a cycle of five songs titled \"Ofrahs Lieder\" to a German translation of a text by Yehuda Halevi.\n\nWeill graduated with an Abitur from the \"Oberrealschule\" of Dessau in 1918, and enrolled at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik at the age of 18, where he studied composition with Engelbert Humperdinck, conducting with Rudolf Krasselt, and counterpoint with Friedrich E. Koch, and also attended philosophy lectures by Max Dessoir and Ernst Cassirer. The same year, he wrote his first string quartet (in B minor).\n\nWeill's family experienced financial hardship in the aftermath of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a répétiteur at the Friedrich-Theater under the direction of the new Kapellmeister, Hans Knappertsbusch. During this time, he composed an orchestral suite in E-flat major, a symphonic poem of Rainer Maria Rilke's \"The Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke\" as well as \"Schilflieder\", a cycle of five songs to poems by Nikolaus Lenau. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in Lüdenscheid, where he directed opera, operetta, and singspiel for five months, and also composed a cello sonata and \"Ninon de Lenclos\", a now lost one-act operatic adaptation of a play by Ernst Hardt. From May to September 1920, Weill spent a couple of months in Leipzig, where his father had become the new director of a Jewish orphanage. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed \"Sulamith\", a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.\n\nBack in Berlin, Weill had an interview with Ferruccio Busoni in December 1920. After examining some of Weill's compositions, Busoni accepted him as one of five master students in composition at the Preußische Akademie der Künste in Berlin.\n\nFrom January 1921 to December 1923, Weill studied music composition with him and also counterpoint with Philipp Jarnach in Berlin. During his first year he composed his first symphony, \"Sinfonie in einem Satz\", as well as the lieder \"Die Bekehrte\" (Goethe) and two \"Rilkelieder\" for voice and piano. To support his family in Leipzig, he also worked as a pianist in a Bierkeller tavern. In 1922, Weill joined the November Group's music faction. That year he composed a psalm, a divertimento for orchestra, and \"Sinfonia Sacra: Fantasia, Passacaglia, and Hymnus for Orchestra\". On November 18, 1922, his children's pantomime \"Die Zaubernacht\" (\"The Magic Night\") premiered at the Theater am Kurfürstendamm; it was the first public performance of any of Weill's works in the field of musical theatre.\n\nOut of financial need, Weill taught music theory and composition to private students from 1923 to 1925. Among his students were Claudio Arrau, Maurice Abravanel, Heinz Jolles (later known as Henry Jolles), and Nikos Skalkottas. Arrau, Abravenel, and Jolles remained members of Weill's circle of friends thereafter, and Jolles's sole surviving composition predating the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933 is a fragment of a work for four pianos he and Weill wrote jointly.\n\nWeill's compositions during his last year of studies included \"Quodlibet\", an orchestral suite version of \"Die Zaubernacht\", \"Frauentanz\", seven medieval poems for soprano, flute, viola, clarinet, French horn, and bassoon, and \"Recordare\" for choir and children's choir to words from the Book of Lamentations. Further premieres that year included a performance of his \"Divertimento for Orchestra\" by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Heinz Unger on April 10, 1923, and the Hindemith-Amar Quartet's rendering of Weill's \"String Quartet\", Op. 8, on June 24, 1923. In December 1923, Weill finished his studies with Busoni.\n\nIn 1922 he joined the \"Novembergruppe\", a group of leftist Berlin artists that included Hanns Eisler and Stefan Wolpe. In February 1924 the conductor Fritz Busch introduced him to the dramatist Georg Kaiser, with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser's house in Grünheide, Weill first met singer/actress Lotte Lenya in the summer of 1924. The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (following their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill's work, and after his death she took it upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the Kurt Weill Foundation. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide \"Der deutsche Rundfunk\". Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief.\n\nAlthough he had some success with his first mature non-stage works (such as the String Quartet, Op. 8, or the Concerto for Violin and Wind Orchestra, Op. 12), which were influenced by Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky, Weill tended more and more to vocal music and musical theatre. His musical theatre work and his songs were extremely popular with the wider public in Germany at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s. Weill's music was admired by composers such as Alban Berg, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Darius Milhaud and Stravinsky, but it was also criticised by others: by Schoenberg, who later revised his opinion, and by Anton Webern.\n\nHis best-known work is \"The Threepenny Opera\" (1928), a reworking of John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" written in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht. Engel directed the original production of \"The Threepenny Opera\" in 1928. It contains Weill's most famous song, \"Mack the Knife\" (\"\"). The stage success was filmed by G. W. Pabst in two language versions: \"Die 3-Groschen-Oper\" and \"L'opéra de quat' sous\". Weill and Brecht tried to stop the film adaptation through a well publicised lawsuit—which Weill won and Brecht lost. Weill's working association with Brecht, although successful, came to an end over politics in 1930. Though Weill associated with socialism, after Brecht tried to push the play even further into a left wing direction, Weill commented, according to his wife Lotte Lenya, that he was unable to \"set the communist party manifesto to music.\"\n\nWeill fled Nazi Germany in March 1933. A prominent and popular Jewish composer, Weill was officially denounced for his populist views and sympathies, and became a target of the Nazi authorities, who criticized and interfered with performances of his later stage works, such as \"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\" (\"Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\", 1930), \"Die Bürgschaft\" (1932), and \"Der Silbersee\" (1933). With no option but to leave Germany, he went first to Paris, where he worked once more with Brecht (after a project with Jean Cocteau failed) on the ballet \"The Seven Deadly Sins\".\n\nOn April 13, 1933 his musical \"The Threepenny Opera\" was given its premiere on Broadway, but closed after 13 performances to mixed reviews. In 1934 he completed his Symphony No. 2, his last purely orchestral work, conducted in Amsterdam and New York by Bruno Walter, and also the music for Jacques Deval's play, \"\". A production of his operetta \"Der Kuhhandel\" (\"A Kingdom for a Cow\") took him to London in 1935, and later that year he went to the United States in connection with \"The Eternal Road\", a \"Biblical Drama\" by Franz Werfel that had been commissioned by members of New York's Jewish community and was premiered in 1937 at the Manhattan Opera House, running for 153 performances.\nHe and his wife moved to New York City on September 10, 1935, living first at the St. Moritz Hotel before moving on to an apartment at 231 East 62nd Street between Third and Second Avenues. Weill and his wife rented an old house with Paul Green during the summer of 1936 near Pine Brook Country Club in Nichols, Connecticut, the summer home of the Group Theatre, while finishing \"Johnny Johnson\". Some of the other artists who summered there in 1936 were; Elia Kazan, Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Lee J. Cobb, Will Geer, Clifford Odets, Howard Da Silva and Irwin Shaw.\n\nRather than continue to write in the same style that had characterized his European compositions, Weill made a study of American popular and stage music. His American output contains individual songs and entire shows that not only became highly respected and admired, but have been seen as seminal works in the development of the American musical. In 1939 he wrote the music for \"Railroads on Parade,\" a musical spectacular put on at the 1939 World's Fair in New York to celebrate the American railroad industry (book by Edward Hungerford). Unique among Broadway composers of the time, Weill insisted on writing his own orchestrations (with some very few exceptions, such as the dance music in \"Street Scene\"). He worked with writers such as Maxwell Anderson and Ira Gershwin, and wrote a film score for Fritz Lang (\"You and Me\", 1938). Weill himself strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful. The most interesting attempt in this direction is \"Street Scene\", based on a play by Elmer Rice, with lyrics by Langston Hughes. For his work on \"Street Scene\" Weill was awarded the inaugural Tony Award for Best Original Score.\n\nIn the 1940s Weill lived in Downstate New York near the New Jersey border and made frequent trips both to New York City and to Hollywood for his work for theatre and film. Weill was active in political movements encouraging American entry into World War II, and after America joined the war in 1941, Weill enthusiastically collaborated in numerous artistic projects supporting the war effort both abroad and on the home front. He and Maxwell Anderson also joined the volunteer civil service by working as air raid wardens on High Tor Mountain between their homes in New City, New York and Haverstraw, New York in Rockland County. Weill became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1943.\n\nWeill had ideals of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. In the US, he wrote \"Down in the Valley\", an opera including the song of the same name and other American folk songs. He also wrote a number of songs in support of the American war effort, including the satirical \"Schickelgruber\" (with lyrics by Howard Dietz), \"Buddy on the Nightshift\" (with Oscar Hammerstein) and – with Brecht again as in his earlier career – the \"Ballad of the Nazi Soldier's Wife\" (\"Und was bekam des Soldaten Weib?\"). Intended for broadcast to Germany, the song chronicled the progress of the Nazi war machine through the gifts sent to the proud wife at home by her man at the front: furs from Oslo, a silk dress from Paris etc., until finally, from Russia, she receives her widow's veil.\n\nApart from \"Mack the Knife\" and \"Pirate Jenny\" from \"The Threepenny Opera\", his most famous songs include \"Alabama Song\" (from \"Mahagonny\"), \"Surabaya Johnny\" (from \"Happy End\"), \"Speak Low\" (from \"One Touch of Venus\"), \"Lost in the Stars\" (from the musical of that name), \"My Ship\" (from \"Lady in the Dark\"), and \"September Song\" (from \"Knickerbocker Holiday\").\n\nWeill suffered a heart attack shortly after his 50th birthday and died on April 3, 1950, in New York City. He was buried in Mount Repose Cemetery in Haverstraw, New York. The text and music on his gravestone come from the song \"A Bird of Passage\" from \"Lost in the Stars\", itself adapted from a quotation from the Venerable Bede:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">This is the life of men on earth:\nOut of darkness we come at birth\nInto a lamplit room, and then –\nGo forward into dark again.\n\nAn excerpt from Maxwell Anderson's eulogy for Weill read:\nI wish, of course, that he had been lucky enough to have had a little more time for his work. I could wish the times in which he lived had been less troubled. But these things were as they were – and Kurt managed to make thousands of beautiful things during the short and troubled time he had...\n\nSixty years after his death, Weill's music continues to be performed both in popular and classical contexts. In Weill's lifetime, his work was most associated with the voice of his wife, Lotte Lenya, but shortly after his death \"Mack the Knife\" was established by Louis Armstrong and Bobby Darin as a jazz standard. His music has since been recorded by many performers, ranging from Nina Simone, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, The Doors, Ella Fitzgerald, David Bowie, Robbie Williams, Judy Collins, John Zorn, Dagmar Krause, Steeleye Span, The Young Gods and PJ Harvey to New York's Metropolitan Opera and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. Singers as varied as Teresa Stratas, Ute Lemper, Gisela May, Anne Sofie von Otter, Max Raabe, Heinz Karl Gruber, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Marianne Faithfull have recorded entire albums of his music.\n\nIn 1985, Hal Willner produced \"\", a tribute album in which Weill's songs were interpreted by a variety of artists, including Todd Rundgren, Tom Waits, Lou Reed and Sting.\n\nAmanda Palmer, singer/pianist of the 'Brechtian Punk Cabaret' duo The Dresden Dolls, has Kurt Weill's name on the front of her keyboard (a pun with the name of the instrument maker Kurzweil) as a tribute to the composer. In 1991, seminal Swiss Industrial music band The Young Gods released their album of Kurt Weill songs, \"The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill\". Weill was also often cited as an influence on Goldfrapp's \"Felt Mountain\". In 2008, Weill's songs were performed by Canadian musicians (including Sarah Slean and Mary Margaret O'Hara) in a tribute concert as part of the first annual Canwest Cabaret Festival in Toronto. In 2009 Duke Special released an EP, \"Huckleberry Finn\", of five songs from an unfinished musical by Kurt Weill based on the novel by Mark Twain.\n\nKurt Weill's grandmother was Jeanette Hochstetter of Liedolsheim in Baden-Württemberg. Weill was one of four members of the same Hochstetter family to lead distinguished careers in the fields of music and literature. His first cousin once removed was Caesar Hochstetter (born January 12, 1863 in Ladenburg, a suburb of Mannheim – his date and place of death are unknown but this was probably during The Holocaust), a composer and arranger who collaborated with Max Reger and who dedicated to him.\n\nCaesar's younger brother was (born May 12, 1873, Mannheim – died 1942, Theresienstadt concentration camp), Professor of Literature at the University of Brussels, writer and poet and friend of Wilhelm Busch. His second cousin was the childhood prodigy pianist, Lisy Fischer (born August 22, 1900, Zürich, Switzerland – died June 6, 1999, Newcastle upon Tyne, England).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Avildsen and starring Morgan Freeman. \"Lean on Me\" is loosely based on the story of Joe Louis Clark, a real life inner city high school principal in Paterson, New Jersey, whose school is at risk of being taken over by the New Jersey state government unless students improve their test scores on the New Jersey Minimum Basic Skills Test. This film's title refers to the 1972 Bill Withers song of the same name.\nParts of the film, including the elementary school scenes, were filmed in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.\n\nBy 1987, the once successful Eastside High School in Paterson, New Jersey, has deteriorated due to drugs and crime. The majority of students cannot pass basic skills testing, and even the teachers are not safe from gang violence. Mayor Bottman (Alan North) learns that the school will be turned over to state administration unless 75% of the students can pass the minimum basic skills test. He consults with school superintendent Dr. Frank Napier (Robert Guillaume), who suggests the school hire elementary school principal Joe Clark, aka \"Crazy Joe\" (Morgan Freeman), a former teacher at Eastside High, as the new principal. Reluctantly, the mayor hires Clark.\n\nClark's immediate radical changes include expelling 300 students identified as drug dealers or abusers and troublemakers, instituting programs to improve school spirit including painting over graffiti-covered walls, and requiring students to learn the school song, and be punished if they cannot sing it on demand. When one of the expelled students is found beating up another student, Clark orders the doors of the school chained shut during school hours since alarmed security doors cannot be purchased. \n\nSome parents react strongly to these measures, including Leonna Barrett (Lynne Thigpen), mother of one of the expelled students, who presses the mayor to oust Clark. Clark's radicalism causes him to come into conflict with members of the faculty, particularly English teacher Mr. Darnell, whom Clark suspends for picking up a piece of trash during a recital of the school song, and choir teacher Mrs. Elliot, whom Clark fires for being insubordinate after he cancels a pre-planned choral event, the school's upcoming annual Lincoln Center concert. Napier sets Clark straight over these incidents and lectures him to start being a team player. Clark reinstates Mr. Darnell, though he is too late to re-hire Mrs. Elliot.\n\nHis actions begin to have a positive effect on his students. Thomas Sams, a student expelled for crack use, pleads to be allowed to return to school and gradually reforms. Clark also reunites one of his old elementary students, Kaneesha Carter, with her estranged mother. Unfortunately, a practice basic skills test fails to garner enough passing students. Clark confronts his staff for their failure to educate their students and to prepare them for the world. He institutes a tutorial program to strengthen academic skills and encourages remedial reading courses on Saturdays which parents may attend alongside their children.\n\nWhen the minimum basic skills test is finally assessed, the students are much better prepared and filled with a sense of self-worth. Before the results can arrive, the fire chief raids the school and discovers the chained doors. Clark is arrested for violating fire safety codes. That evening, the students gather at the meeting of the Paterson Board of Education, where school board member Leona Barrett, is leading for Clark's removal. The students demand that Clark be released from jail and retained as principal. The mayor has Clark released from jail and talk to the students to go home. Clark calls for his students to return to their homes. He is interrupted by assistant principal Ms. Levias who reports that more than 75% of the students have passed the basic skills test. He announces the results over his megaphone. As a result, the school's current administration remains intact, and Clark is allowed to keep his job as principal of Eastside High. The students break into their school song in celebration. The film ends with the senior students graduating high school and Clark handing them their diplomas.\n\n\nSongs included in the film include:\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 69%, based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n1991 NAACP Image Awards\n\n1990 Young Artist Awards\n\nOther honors\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nIn September 2018, it was reported that a television series based on the film was in development at The CW. The project will be written by Wendy Calhoun, who will also serve as an executive producer alongside LeBron James, Maverick Carter, John Legend, Mike Jackson and Ty Stiklorius. The potential hour-long drama series will be about \"when a spirited young black teacher Amarie Baldwin scores the principal job at an Akron, Ohio, public high school, she must dig deep to transform a failing campus into an urban oasis. In a time when education and school safety have life-or-death stakes, Amarie will take on a broken system that tests her mettle, love life and family.

In May 2014 Lingua.ly was selected as one of eight global finalists for the Challenge Cup.\n\nWhile traditional language immersion entails a target language rich environment where the user is exposed to ample linguistic input from various sources, Lingua.ly utilizes digital language immersion, a method of employing a virtual learning environment to simulate the language learning environment. Users are exposed to authentic input in their target language through their computer, tablet, or mobile device as opposed to lesson-based instruction. Duolingo and Bliu Bliu are other examples of language education tech startups that also partially rely on a digital language immersion approach. In classroom learning, language immersion is often used to teach children in bilingual or content and language integrated learning programs. Digital language immersion is the E-learning extension of these trends.\n\nLingua.ly relies on a number of applied linguistics principles, including the Natural Approach and Krashen's Input Hypothesis, which argues that fluent language learners benefit most from language they acquire through exposure rather than direct instruction.\n\nLingua.ly's platform contains an online and mobile dictionary powered by Babylon that learners can use to look up words from the web in their target language. Through a learner's collected words and click-patterns, the technology maps an individual's vocabulary in the target language. It then rates the suitability of online content suggestions in the target language in order to create an environment for language acquisition based on a 90:10 percentage of known to unknown words. Users customize vocabulary flashcards with images, audio, and example sentences and practice them at spaced repetition intervals to enhance acquisition and transfer into long-term memory.\n\nLingua.ly is part of a growing trend of digital language education startups including, Memrise, Busuu, Babbel and Duolingo that are attracting significant investment funding and unseating former industry leader Rosetta Stone.\n\n\n"}

Through the use of experimental and unconventional curricula and offering choice to students as to what and how they will study, such institutions distinguish themselves from traditional faculties. They often attract faculty and students who are interested in such values and are often politically liberal. Additionally, some of them expand on the concept of democratic education to integrate students in various facets of school administration. Methods of evaluation frequently favor detailed written evaluations instead of grades. Some institutions do not require an SAT/ACT, but rather ask for a series of essays. Many of these institutions are private, though most offer scholarships, grants, and other aid.\n\n· LIU Global http://www.liu.edu/Global\n\n\n"}

He is a former Crown Court Recorder, member of the Parole Board of England and Wales and a tutor judge of the Judicial College. In March 2013 he was one of the judges appointed to hear an inquest into the death of Olaseni Lewis.\n\nBeddoe came from a military family. He was born in Abyad, Egypt, where his father, World War II veteran Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Beddoe was serving at the time of his birth. His father had a very distinguished military career and before his posting to Egypt was an infantry battalion commanding officer in Welsh Regiment during the Second World War. Judge Beddoe takes pride in his Welsh heritage.\n\nBeddoe was educated at Tonbridge School and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was called to the bar as a member of Gray's Inn in 1979 and thereafter practised as a barrister at 36 Bedford Row chambers where he practised from 1980 specialising in prosecution work, including prosecution of several cases of fraud, tax evasion, organised crime and murder, until 2005, when he was appointed Standing Counsel to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office. He served in that capacity until December 2007, when he was appointed circuit judge.\n\nBeddoe served as a Standing Counsel to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office for 3 years, until December 2007, dealing with numerous high level drug importations and diversion cases, including some of the largest fraud prosecutions in the country such as the largest diversion fraud ever prosecuted at the time.\n\nBeddoe was a senior prosecutor in Peterborough Crown Court, Cambridgeshire. Throughout his career he successfully prosecuted many criminal cases including prosecution of a fraudster who was found guilty of involvement in a £1.5 million fraud in 2002, and a solicitor who plead guilty to stealing £350,000 in fees from clients in 2005. Solicitor Christopher McChrystal was arrested in October 2004 after the Law Society referred his case to the police. McChrystal was subsequently struck off after Lincoln Crown Court's finding that he used the clients' money to make an investment into his business. In 2003 Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in court cases resulting from Operation Harrier, a clean-up operation which has declared all-out war against Class A drugs in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.\n\nBeddoe has defended at the criminal bar in drug cases, fraud, homicide and other serious crime. He also dealt with Courts Martial, Inquests and Public Enquiries. In 2005 he successfully defended Jason Smith, British soldier who served eight years in the British Army. The court heard that Smith's successful Army career was halted prematurely due to a back injury and he had struggled to come to terms with it. In March 2005, as a result of his post-traumatic stress disorder, Smith had carried out a raid of a petrol station in Northampton at knife-point, but later dropped 45 in cash as the owner and several villagers gave chase. Sentencing Jason Smith to a two-year suspended sentence, Judge Nigel Daly told him: \n\nAs a judge, Beddoe has presided over many high-profile criminal cases, including trial of BAFTA nominated film producers who used Film Tax Credit to claim back inflated cash from the Treasury.\n\nBeddoe was a Recorder of the Crown Court from 2002 until 2007, when he was appointed a Senior Circuit Judge, becoming the Resident Judge on the South Eastern Circuit based at Southwark Crown Court.\n\nIn 2017 Judge Beddoe presided over the case of Ricardo McFarlane, 30-year-old Muslim convert charged with anti-social behaviour after preaching Sharia law in Oxford Street and two other London venues, who declined to stand up in court on religious grounds. McFarlane allegedly breached the terms of an antisocial behaviour order barring him from addressing members of the public to promote sharia law. At the hearing in Southwark Crown Court, Judge Beddoe noticed that McFarlane did not stand when he entered the room. McFarlane's defence barrister commented: \nTo which Judge Beddoe responded:\n\nMcFarlane then proceeded to stand for Judge Beddoe while he was speaking and during the rest of the hearing.\n\nIn May 2017 Judge Beddoe was a lead walker at the London Legal Walk organised by London Legal Support Trust, which was designed to bring together leading criminal practitioners to raises funds for charities that provide life changing legal advice and representation to those in need. It was attended by leading criminal practitioners and professionals working in the criminal justice system, including Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, Nicholas Hilliard QC, Recorder of London, and Lord Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. In June 2006 Beddoe cycled in the London to Brighton British Heart Foundation cycle rally to raise money in memory of a member of his former chambers, Paul Morgan, who died in 2005 of heart disease at the age of 50.\n\nBeddoe is married to philosopher Mary Margaret Anne McCabe. A fitness enthusiast, he cycles a lot\nand is a keen golfer who served as a club captain of Old Tonbridgian Golfing Society.\n"}

{"id": "1446916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1446916", "title": "New World School of the Arts", "text": "New World School of the Arts\n\nNew World School of the Arts (NWSA) is a public magnet high school and college in Downtown Miami, Florida. Its dual-enrollment programs in the visual and performing arts are organized into four strands: visual arts, dance, theatre (comprising programs in theater and musical theatre), and music (comprising programs in instrumental music and vocal music).\n\nThe New World School of the Arts was a pioneer in dual-enrollment education, arising out of an experiment between Miami Northwestern High School and Dade Community College (now Miami Dade College). NWSA was formally created as an outcome of that experiment by the 1986 New World School of the Arts Act of the Florida State Legislature as \"a center of excellence for the performing and visual art\", with the stated intention \"that specific attention be given to the needs of artistically talented high school students who are occupationally oriented to the arts.\"\n\nThe school is jointly administered by Miami-Dade County Public Schools, Miami Dade College, and the University of Florida. The administrative structure includes an executive board with representatives from each of the partners as well as community seats and a foundation board.\n\nThe school awards an Associate of Arts degree from Miami Dade College, Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees from the University of Florida, and a high school degree from the Miami Dade County schools.\n\nAdmissions into the high school are through the Miami Dade Visual and Performing Arts Magnet Program, requiring an audition and/or portfolio (see High School Admissions).\n\nNew World High School is rated #149 in the national rankings for best high schools, #17 in rankings for best Florida high schools and #42 magnet schools in accordance with the 2018 \"U.S. News & World Report\". In 2009, NWSA was 82nd in this ranking. Both the college and the high school are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.\n\nThe vision of PAVAC (Performing and Visual Arts Center) was to integrate Miami Northwestern High School and provide high-quality arts training for students in Dade County. The original PAVAC director (1975) was Jackie (last name unknown), with Dr. Everett Abney serving as principal. At that time, Ms. Samiento served as an art teacher and Charlie Austin as music instructor. Later, Samiento took over as director when Jackie relocated out of state.\n\nIn the early days of PAVAC, Irene Fox was the Modern Dance instructor and Shelley Fox (recommended by Carrie Meek) was hired as the ballet instructor-choreographer. After Irene Fox left the program, Shelley Fox continued to recruit students from Dade County Public Schools. She developed a high quality ballet program and performing company.\n\nThe PAVAC program provided students with busing from their local high school to Miami Northwestern for the afternoon arts classes. The PAVAC Dancers performed at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, at locations on Miami Beach, Florida state conferences and festivals, and on local TV stations. The highlight of the program was the premier of Richard Strauss' original ballet \"Death and Transfiguration\" at Miami Dade Jr. College North. At that time, the PAVAC ballet program was the only department that successfully integrated Miami Northwestern High School.\n\nKendell Bently-Baker, inspired by the academic success of that program, and attempting to take greater advantage of the facilities and faculty of Miami Dade College (MDC), then known as Miami Dade Community College, proposed the creation of a dual-enrollment school of the arts: morning academics were to be at the student's home high school; in the afternoon students were to be bussed to one of the two MDCC campuses for classes in art or the performing arts. Upon high school graduation, the student received a diploma from the home high school and college credits for the art classes, awarded through MDC.\n\nIn summer 1982, county auditions were held for 10th–12th graders. In fall 1982, two dual-enrollment PAVACs opened, one at the North Campus of MDCC, \"PAVAC North\", headed by Kendell Bently-Baker; the other at the South Campus of MDCC (now called the Kendall Campus), \"PAVAC South\", headed by Richard Janaro and Margaret Pelton. Marcy Samiento continued to serve as DCPS coordinator. At that time, many Miami-Dade high schools served only 10th–12th grade.\n\nThe first PAVAC dual-enrollment graduates were in 1983. The Miami Northwestern High School program continued as before the creation of PAVAC, and is currently among the PVA (performing and visual arts) magnet programs in the Miami-Dade County school system.\n\nIn 1984, Marcy Sarmiento, Kandell Bentley-Baker and Richard Janaro were asked to plan a successor school to PAVAC. Knowing they would need approval from the Florida Legislature they enlisted civic leader and lobbyist Seth Gordon to join them. Gordon was later elected to serve as the first chair of the Executive Board of the school and served in that capacity for six years. They studied other arts schools in the country, visiting LaGuardia High School, Juilliard and the North Carolina School of the Arts. A bill creating the \"South Florida School of the Arts\" passed the Florida House of Representatives on May 30, 1984. Soon afterwards, the New World name was chosen as part of larger plans for urban and cultural development which included the eponymous New World Symphony Orchestra, and to avoid confusion with the Florida School of the Arts. The Florida legislature passed the \"New World School of the Arts Act\" in 1986.\n\nThe NWSA opened its doors in fall 1987. The continuing students at PAVAC's North and South transitioned into NWSA, as did many of PAVAC's faculty. NWSA issued its first high school diploma in 1988 to the former PAVAC students. NWSA enrolled its first freshman college students in 1988. In order to award a BFA, it partnered with Florida International University (FIU). On January 12, 1994 University of Florida replaced FIU in this partnership. The first graduating class of the college was in 1992.\n\nLater the high school expanded to include 9th grade.\n\nThe combined administration of the high school and college consists of a provost, under which are four deans and a principal. The Principal oversees the high school and high school academics, and Deans oversee each of the four strands, Dance, Music, Theater and Visual Arts, for both the high school and the college. There is an executive board of directors for the school, as well as a foundation board to direct the NWSA Foundation.\n\nRichard A. Klein was hired away from being the principal of the LaGuardia High School to be the founding provost of NWSA. In April 1994 the executive board reduced Richard Klein's contract to one year and began looking for a replacement. D. Hansen became interim provost for the 1995-96 school year, replaced by Bennett Lentczner, who served until 1999. Several provosts have served since then. Since the 2009 school year, Dr. Jeffrey Hodgson has been provost.\n\nAlan Weiss was the founding principal. Since then, principals have been: Mandy Offerle, 1989–1993; Ellery Brown, 1993 until retirement in 2007; Dr. Frederic Conde, 2007–2010; Lisa S. Noffo, 2010–2012; Evonne Alvarez 2012–2018; Jason Allen, 2018 - Present.\n\nDaniel Lewis was the founding Dean of Dance of NWSA. Daniel Lewis retired for the 2011 school year. The current Dean of Dance is Mary Lisa Burns.\n\nJohn de Lancie was the director of Philadelphia's famed Curtis Institute of Music before becoming the founding Dean at New World. He submitted his resignation in December 1991 but rescinded it that same month, then resigned definitively in September 1992. He was replaced by Willie Anthony Waters, principal conductor of the Greater Miami Opera. Waters was replaced in August 1993 with Balint Vazsonyi, who was asked to resign in September 1994.\n\nSince then the position has been filled by: Tallulah Brown, 1994–95; Karl Kramer, 1995–97; Roby George, 1997–98; Mark Camphouse, 1998–99; Dennis Prime, 1999–2002; Jeffrey Hodgson, 2002-2009; Jim Gasior, 2009-2012; and Milton Ruben Laufer 2012-2014.\n\nThe current Dean of Music is Daniel Andai, an alumnus of NWSA Music Division. He was appointed in summer 2014.\n\nDr. Richard Paul Janaro agreed to serve as acting Dean of Theater at the school's inception. Jorge Guerra Castro became Dean of Theater in 1988, and Dr. Janaro assumed the role of Assistant Dean of Theater. In 2002 Patrice Bailey took over from Castro, and has continued until the present.\n\nThe founding Dean of Visual Arts was Ed Love. Since then, the deans have been: Mel Alexenberg, 1990–2000; Louise Romeo, 2000–2005; Maggy Cuesta, 2005–present.\n\nThe school's main building is located at 25 NE 2nd Street, Miami, and holds other classes on the Miami Dade College Wolfson Campus.\n\nMuch like the school today, all of its classes were held in different buildings in downtown Miami when the school opened, including the main building of MDC Wolfson campus, as well as space at the Christ Fellowship church at 500 N.E. 1st Avenue, where drawing classes were held on the top floor. The school's current main building (a former AT&T communications department building) was first used for the 1990-1991 school year, as an electrical fire destroyed the school's original administration headquarters. The main building (the 5000 Building) houses most of the high school academic classes there, as well as both the high school and college administration units, dance studios, theaters, and art studios. The MDC Wolfson Science building (the 2000 Building, located at 300 NE 2nd Avenue) houses the science facilities. All music classes are held across the street from the MDC Wolfson Building at the aptly named Music Building (the 4000 Building, located at 401 NE 2nd Avenue; also houses MDC's Literary Center).\n\nNWSA is run as a magnet school, and is therefore open to students throughout Miami-Dade county. NWSA continued the PAVAC model of admission based entirely on audition. This differs from other Miami-Dade County Public School (MDCPS) magnets which are not VPA (visual and performing arts) magnets, which have a mixed model of entrance eligibility requirements and lottery. Also unlike the other MDCPS magnets, but like other VPA magnets, it does not have the \"sibling rule\", a policy of giving priority if a student's sibling is already attending the magnet school.\n\nIn 2011, 1,268 students applied for admission to New World, competing for 140 available spots. This gives New World an 11% admissions rate, making it one of Miami's most competitive public high schools.\n\nTotal enrollment for 2009–10 was 828, with 473 in the high school and 355 in the college.\n\nSchool demographics for 2009–10 were 35% male and 65% female; 42% Hispanic (of any race), 36% White non-Hispanic, 19% Black, 3% Asian, and less than 1% other.\n\n\n\n"}

She spearheaded the Māori Renaissance in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nShe was born Te Kumeroa Ngoingoi Ngāwai on 29 December 1921 at Tokomaru Bay, on New Zealand's East Coast, the eldest of five children of Hori Ngāwai, a labourer and minister in the Ringatū faith from the Te Whānau-a-Ruataupare hapū of the Ngāti Porou iwi of Tokomaru Bay, and his wife Wikitoria Karu of Ngāti Tara Tokanui in the Hauraki region. She attended Hukarere Girls’ School from 1938 to 1941.\n\nNgoi was a niece of Tuini Ngāwai, another prominent composer and promoter of the language and culture. In the early 1940s, Ngoi travelled around New Zealand in a fundraising drive for the war effort with the Hokowhitu-ā-Tū Concert Party. Her aunt, who founded the group, trained her in kapa haka performance and groomed her for leadership. She continued her involvement after the war.\n\nIn 1945 she married Rikirangi Ben Pēwhairangi of Tokomaru Bay. The only child of the marriage was a son, Terewai Pēwhairangi, but they fostered many other children.\n\nNgoi taught Māori language and tutored the Māori club at Gisborne Girls' High School for three years from 1973. In 1974 she also began teaching a course of Māori studies in Gisborne for the University of Waikato. In 1977, Kara Puketapu, the new secretary of the Department of Māori Affairs called on her assistance in setting up Tū Tangata, a scheme that targeted at-risk Māori youth in the cities, and attempted to connect them with their iwi. She continued working for the Department as an adviser, and was involved in the preliminary consultations that led to the establishment of the kōhanga reo movement, which saw children receiving their schooling in Māori.\n\nFrom 1978 on, she was an adviser to the National Council of Adult Education. In this capacity she promoted Māori language and culture around the country, especially in rural areas. She was the co-founder, with Katerina Mataira, of the highly acclaimed Te Ataarangi programme of teaching Māori, which was the basis of a TV programme and a series of books, \"Te reo\" (1985).\n\nAmong Pākehā who have heard of her, she is best known as the composer of the poi song \"Poi E\", which topped New Zealand charts in 1984 in a recording by Dalvanius Prime and the Patea Māori Club, and sold 15,000 copies. She also wrote the popular song \"E Ipo\" which was performed by Prince Tui Teka.\n\nShe died in Tokomaru Bay on January 29, 1985. Her \"tangihanga\" (funeral) was held at Pākirikiri Marae. A \"waiata tangi\" (lament) composed for her by Dr. Timoti Karetu was for a number of years the signature piece of the kapa haka group of the Te Tumu School of Māori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies at the University of Otago.\n\nIn 2016 she was presented with the Nostalgia Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand, an award presented to an artist deemed not to have received suitable honours during their career.\n\n"}

President Gerald R. Ford established this right when in 1975 he signed. Parents of children with disabilities and other advocates hailed EAHCA as the “education civil rights act” for their children.\n\nThe Act was reauthorized in 1983, 1990, 1997, and 2004. In 1997 the Act was renamed The Most recently, President George W. Bush signed the Act into law on December 3, 2004 (Public Law 108-446).\n\nPublic Law 108-446, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004, is most commonly called IDEA 2004. Following enactment, the U.S. Department of Education took nearly two years to develop the federal regulations to answer common questions about critical parts of the law. The final draft of the federal regulations were published August 14, 2006, and took effect 60 days later, October 13, 2006. To some extent, the federal regulations clarify how the law should be put into practice. In some areas the final implementation of the law is up to the state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) - the public school districts.\n\nIDEA 2004 continues granting to students with disabilities the right to a public education. IDEA 2004 continues regulating the special education services provided to these students through the SEAs and the public schools. Most notably, IDEA 2004 emphasizes preparing students with disabilities, ages 16 (or younger) through 21, for life beyond high school.\n\nThe intent of the law changed over time in keeping with increasingly improved understandings of the needs of students with disabilities. PL 94-142, ‘stage one,’ purposed to “Get’em in” – opening the doors of public schools to students with disabilities.\n\nIDEA 2004 builds upon the amendments and reauthorizations of 1983, 1990, and 1997, clarifies the concept and position of transition, and strengthens the future-focus of special education services. IDEA 2004 indicates one of its purposes is “…to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment and independent living…” (author emphasis). The key word “further” emphasizes the direction and purpose and expected results of this special education legislation.\n\nNo longer will teachers be permitted to restrict their vision of education to the four walls of the classroom and the four years of high school. The focus is on the future. One constraining influence is the ‘other’ education legislation - the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). NCLB constantly pulls special education services and resources towards standardized testing and improving test scores. IDEA 2004 continuously counteracts by emphasizing individualized education and individualized preparation of individual children with disabilities for their individual lives in their individual communities beyond high school.\nIDEA 2004 and the accompanying regulations most clearly reflect the focus on the future through the many uses of the word “transition” when it comes to directing the high school education and activities of children with disabilities: transition, transition planning, transition assessments, transition services, transition service providers.\nAn effective transition plan, in the eyes of many, drives middle school students’ and high school students’ IEPs Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). IDEA 2004 highlights post secondary goals and putting in place transition services, including courses of study, to facilitate the students’ movement from high school to post high school life.\n\nWithin IDEA 2004, the word “transition” has several different definitions according to its context in the Act.\n\nIn IDEA 2004, transition describes the process of a young child moving from early intervention services (EI) to early childhood education (ECE). In this EI to ECE process, transition indicates moving young children from one environment, set of services, and service personnel to another: “…the steps to be taken to support the transition of the toddler with a disability to preschool or other appropriate services.” It also indicates moving from one set of entitlements to another, “…a child who is transitioning from Part C of the Act to Part B and is no longer eligible for Part C services because the child has turned 3…” (See .)\n\nWhen talking about post secondary transition the context is “…services and activities for older students (e.g., transition services, postsecondary goals).” But unlike the EI services to ECE transition, the high school students only start in the position of receiving entitlements – entitlements to services. The students who leave, whether by graduation, aging out, or dropping out, leave to a condition of possible eligibility for services, with no guarantee by law that they will continue to receive services.\n\nOne of the consequences, then, is an urgency to help students with disabilities make the most of the time they are in high school, while some funding, at least, is available, to prepare for post high school life.\n\nReferences to the Act and the corresponding regulations within this article on post secondary transition are from FR Doc 06-6656 [Federal Register: August 14, 2006 (Volume 71, Number 156)] [Rules and Regulations [Page 46539-46845] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr14au06-14].

Beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, and updated annually, thereafter, the IEP must include--\n\n“(aa) appropriate measurable postsecondary goals based upon age appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment, and where appropriate independent living skills;\n\n“(bb) the transition services (including courses of study) needed to assist the child in reaching those goals…”\n\nSection 300.43 Transition services include:\n\n“(a) Transition services means a coordinated set of activities for a child with a disability that—\n\n“(1) Is designed to be within a results-oriented process, that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child’s movement from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation;\n\n“(2) Is based on the individual child’s needs, taking into account the child’s strengths, preferences, and interests; and includes--\n\n“(i) Instruction;\n\n“(ii) Related services;\n\n“(iii) Community experiences;\n\n“(iv) The development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives; and\n\n“(v) If appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and provision of a functional vocational evaluation.\n\n“(b) Transition services for children with disabilities may be special education, if provided as specially designed instruction, or a related service, if required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.\n\n“(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(34))”\n\n“b) Transition services participants.\n\n“(1) In accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the public agency must invite a child with a disability to attend the child's IEP Team meeting if a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals under Sec. 300.320(b).\n\n“(2) If the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, the public agency must take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.\n\n“(3) To the extent appropriate, with the consent of the parents or a child who has reached the age of majority, in implementing the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the public agency must invite a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services.”\n\n“2) For a child with a disability beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, the notice also must\n\n“(i) Indicate--\n\n“(A) That a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals and transition services for the child, in accordance with Sec. 300.320(b); and\n\n“(B) That the agency will invite the student; and\n\n“(ii) Identify any other agency that will be invited to send a representative.\n\n“(2) Parental consent, or the consent of an eligible child who has reached the age of majority under State law, must be obtained before personally identifiable information is released to officials of participating agencies providing or paying for transition services in accordance with Sec. 300.321(b)(3).”\n\n“(c) Failure to meet transition objectives—\n\n“(1) Participating agency failure. If a participating agency, other than the public agency, fails to provide the transition services described in the IEP in accordance with Sec. 300.320 (b), the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the child set out in the IEP.\n\n“(2) Construction. Nothing in this part relieves any participating agency, including a State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the responsibility to provide or pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise provide to children with disabilities who meet the eligibility criteria of that agency.”\n\n\"Where’s the teeth?\" As of 2005, the federal government will monitor transition plans for students with disabilities. The anticipated results of the monitoring will be improvements in the post school results for students with disabilities, made possible through the improvement of in-school educational programs.\n\nThe monitoring will happen through three related vehicles.\n\n--State Performance Plan (SPP) (and especially Indicators 1, 2, 13 and 14)\n\n--Annual Performance Report (APR)\n\n--Continuous Improvement Focused Monitoring Process (CIFMP)\n\nEarly years of the monitoring focus on establishing a baseline for transition plans, and beyond that the federal and state governments will be using the data collection and analysis results to approve, inform, direct, and assist local school districts in the improvement of their educational programs.\n\nPlanning for the future of the individual student often requires a paradigm shift for everyone involved. With the IEP that is in effect the year the student turns 16, the IEPs often make a subtle change from overcoming deficits and approaching developmental norms to post secondary goals, transition plan activities and transition services that capitalize on the students’ strengths, needs, preferences, and interests.\n\nThe special education professional community is working hard to catch up with this change in emphasis, and certainly many believe that it has a long way to go. At this point, nearly 6½ million children receive special education services. However, few college programs, like those at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater (see ) are preparing the next generation of professional educators to become effective in the transition planning and preparation process.\n\nThe Department of Education is working hard to clarify the content of IDEA 2004 to the state directors of special education, the state transition specialists, and the national secondary transition technical support staff (see ). Meanwhile, LEA directors of special education and special education teachers across the country are working and periodically struggling to get their arms around post secondary transition, what it means, and how it affects the education of their students.\n\nOne of the promising means of guiding students and teachers through the maze of transition involves deploying corporate research-based technologies used for decades in private industry.\nIn 1999, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services provided two grants to fund research into the feasibility of adapting existing technology (see ). The research launched a web-based, commercially available product in use by teachers and parents primarily in Illinois and Minnesota but increasingly around the country (see ).\n\n\n"}

The Science Laureate would spend their term traveling around the country promoting science and research to students and the general public. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\"\n\nThe Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 would establish the position of Science Laureate of the United States. The bill would require the President of the United States to appoint a Science Laureate on the basis of: (1) merit, particularly the ability of such individual to foster and enhance public awareness and interest in science and to provide ongoing significant scientific contributions; and (2) recommendations received by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) based on those factors. The bill would also encourage each Science Laureate to continue his or her scientific work and directs the NAS to facilitate such Science Laureate's duties. Finally, the bill would require each Science Laureate to serve a term of one or two years.\n\nThe Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 was introduced by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D, CA-19) on May 8, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the United States House Science Subcommittee on Research and Technology. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor placed H.R. 1891 on the House calendar for the week of September 9, 2013.\n\nSupporters of the bill argued that it would bring important attention to the importance of science and the benefits of scientific research, hopefully inspiring more Americans to pursue scientific careers.\n\nOne commentator, on learning of the proposed position of \"Science Laureate of the United States,\" immediately nominated Neil deGrasse Tyson for the position, listing several humorous and serious qualifications. Neil deGrasse Tyson was also mentioned on a \"Wired\" magazine list of potential nominees alongside Brian Greene, Jill Tarter, Mike Brown, and Sylvia Earle.\n\nSeveral concerns about the effectiveness of the bill were raised. First, objections were made to the fact that the position lacked a salary, with one commentator pointing out that this would make things very difficult on the scientist who was simultaneously supposed to continue performing their own research (and finding grants for it) and fulfill the role of Science Laureate. A second objection was raised to the decision to make the National Academy of Sciences as the group selecting the official list of candidates since, while they would be well placed to choose an excellent scientist, they might not do a good job of choosing an excellent communicator. A third objection was the possibility for the position to become heavily politicized.\n\nAnother source speculated on what considerations should be used to choose a Science Laureate. These included avoiding unrelated controversy, diversity (to better represent a diverse American public), active research, diversity (in research fields, from one laureate to the next), and finding someone willing to do it, despite the position being unpaid.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58947276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58947276", "title": "Seal of Biliteracy", "text": "Seal of Biliteracy\n\nThe Seal of Biliteracy (SoBL) is an award granted by a school, district, or state in the United States of America, \"In recognition of students who have studied and attained proficiency in two or more languages by high school graduation\". The SoBL is meant to encourage students towards biliteracy in their first language and in English and to prepare for future bilingual teachers, as these candidates will already have proficiency in the four language domains. It originated in California in 2008 and was formally adopted by the state in 2011. \n\nThis SoBL is a seal that can be earned by students who are learning a second language aside from their native English or who are learning English as a second language and will be noted on the recipient's transcript or diploma. Candidates for the SoBl can be bilingual in any two languages, which includes American Sign Language, and have proficiency in all language domains such as listening, speaking, reading and writing. Scholars such as Kristin J. Davin and Amy J. Heineke have stated that the program's benefits are stronger efforts for academic success, bilingualism, and official recognition for their efforts. \n\nIn the United States, biliteracy has not always been the method of teaching English to English Language Learners (ELLs). In the past ELLs learned through the Sink or Swim method of total English immersion education, not having culturally relevant testing questions, or equitable assessment in schools. The intent behind the SoBL is that it will, “offer a promising policy solution to increase biliteracy among K–12 students, both as a means to promote the maintenance of students’ home languages and encourage native English speakers to study additional languages” and make them \"attractive to future employers\".\n\nThe SoBL was first developed in California in 2008 by Californians Together and was implemented in 2010 along with Velázquez Press. In 2011, legislation creating a California State Seal of Biliteracy was passed. Since then, it has been adopted by multiple states, including Colorado and New Jersey. It is only awarded to students in the public school system; students in private schools are not eligible. In order to obtain this Seal students must pass a proficiency exam. In the state of California students have to pass the the California Assessment of English Performance and Progress before they may obtain this Seal. Students must also complete all ELA (English Language Arts) courses with a grade point average of 2.0 or above prior to high-school graduation in order to be eligible to obtain the Seal.\n\nThe SoBL has been adopted into legislature in multiple states and the District of Columbia, however elements defined as barriers to success by students includes a lack of awareness of the Seal and the assessment exams needed to obtain the Seal. Many students expressed a lack of awareness and preparedness until their senior year of high-school and in turn this made them ineligible for the seal. Specific schools that have implemented the SoBL include Norwalk High School in California and Logan-Rogersville High School in Missouri.\n\n"}

(SLRC) is a South Carolina non-profit public law corporation which offers legal support to defend what they see as First Amendment violations, violation of civil rights, or discrimination against advocates of Southern Heritage.\n\nThe SLRC was founded in 1995 by a group of four attorneys: Carl A. Barrington (deceased), Kirk David Lyons, Larry Norman, and Lourie A. Salley, III. Lyons was appointed Chief Trial Counsel, a position he still holds, and Salley became the firm's first Board Chairman. The organization is a registered South Carolina corporation with its executive offices in Black Mountain, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1996, the SLRC successfully defended the \"Blacksburg (SC) 7\" and in 1999 sued a Greenville, South Carolina, private academy on behalf of Dr. Winston McCuen, a teacher at the school who had been fired for refusing to remove a Confederate flag that was part of a classroom historical display, and for refusing to salute the US in protest.\n\nIn 2004 the SLRC hired advertising executive and Southern activist Roger McCredie as its full-time Executive Director. Under McCredie the organization doubled the size of its Board of Directors, increased its advertising program and undertook an ambitious five-year growth and development plan.\n\nThe SLRC, was the first law firm to promote a legal theory developed by Lyons that combined First Amendment protection with an interpretation of the \"National Origin\" provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that would afford federal legal protection for what Lyons termed \"Confederate Southern Americans.\" Using this interpretation of Civil Rights law, the SLRC undertook cases on behalf of Federal Aviation Administration workers in Florida, utility company employees in South Carolina, workers at a DuPont plant in Virginia (the \"DuPont Seven\"), and Cherokee students in Alabama. Federal judges have shown almost universal hostility to legal protection for \"Confederate Southern Americans,\" but Lyons and the SLRC still advocate for clients claiming an increase in the number of job-related persecution of \"Confederate Southern Americans\" and a paucity of legal protection in the workplace save for cases that come under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Lyons has noted that \"Republican judges are adamantly opposed to any extension of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Democratic Judges are hostile to almost all things Confederate.\"\n\nThe SLRC has supported the rights of students to use and display Confederate symbols. Its most significant victory was Castorina v. Madison County Schools, in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 2001 overturned a federal district court's ruling in favor of a Kentucky school board's ban on student displays of Confederate symbols, and remanded the case for further proceedings. In 2006 the Castorina decision led to an out-of-court award of damages for Jacqueline Duty, an SLRC client who had sued her own school board after she was barred from attending her high school prom in a Confederate flag-patterned evening gown.\n\nThe SLRC has drawn fire from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which has frequently attacked the SLRC by citing Lyons' pre-SLRC defense of some controversial right-wing figures such as Aryan Nations members, White Aryan Resistance founder Tom Metzger and Lyons' 1990 marriage to the sister of jailed Order defendant David Tate. The SPLC also criticized Lyons tie to Deborah Davila's FBI espionage case.\n\nIn addition the SPLC has called Southern Legal's fundraising practices \"deceitful\" citing, for example, \"the SLRC Web site detailed two disputes under a headline that read 'Cases Pending,' implying that the SLRC represented the parties involved. In both cases, the plaintiff's families say Lyons actually did very little for them.\"\n\nIn 1997 Kirk Lyons and SLRC Director Neill Payne befriended Asheville NAACP President H. K. Edgerton. In response, the NAACP deprived Edgerton of his presidency. Edgerton became a \"born-again Confederate\" and for a time served as an SLRC Director and Chairman of the SLRC's Board of Advisors.\n\nThe SLRC has called on \"Confederate Southern Americans\" to identify as a separate race on the 2010 United States Census form.\n\n"}
{"id": "37628586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37628586", "title": "Spatial citizenship", "text": "Spatial citizenship\n\nSpatial citizenship describes the ability of individuals and groups to interact and participate in societal spatial decision making through the reflexive production and use of geo-media (geographic media such as maps, virtual globes, GIS, and the Geoweb). Spatial citizens are lay users who are able to use geo-media to question existing perspectives on action in space (e.g. social rules, spatial planning) and to produce, communicate, and negotiate alternative spatial visions.\n\nSpatial citizenship is an educational approach at the intersection of citizenship education and geography education. Its main theoretical reference points are emancipatory forms of citizenship and the \"reflexive appropriation of space\".\n\nSpatial citizenship can be distinguished from traditional citizenship education approaches in many respects: \n\nSpatial citizenship has become a conceptual reference point in theories of action-oriented social geography and new cultural geography. These approaches contend that human beings constantly appropriate spaces, as they attach meanings to geographically located physical matter in order to prepare it for their own actions.\n\nIn these theories, spaces are regarded as being socially constructed. To a large extent, the attachment of meaning works unconsciously, following socially accepted, mainstream categories and discourses. Meanings given to physical objects determine the actions deemed possible. For instance, a field of asphalt in a city centre might have multiple meanings: it may be interpreted as a parking area as well as a place for ball games, with both meanings competing for dominance. As soon as one meaning becomes superior, which is a result of social power relations, the other meaning may decline, become invisible, and eventually is not used anymore. The superiority of a specific meaning over another one might be supported by artifacts representing meanings attached, such as signs on buildings, structural modifications of the physical environment, or symbols and explanations of the socio-cultural significance of places and objects in spatial representations visualized via geo-media.\n\nA mature appropriation of space therefore includes the conscious attachment of meaning as well as awareness of meanings being attached to places by others. It includes a sensibility to the multitude of meanings transported and hidden by a mainstream discourse. Keys to the mature appropriation of space are therefore the deconstruction of socially produced meanings, as well as the ability to communicate one's own, potentially contradictory meanings and negotiate them with others. This process is often mediated through the formation of a collective spatialized identity. Given that space – its uses and symbolic significance – is often the site of social and political struggle, it becomes the container for action while at the same time shaping the group development of a \"us\". In particular, when groups re-imagine public space for political usages, this expression of spatial citizenship is the outcome of a spatially informed collective identity.\n\nGeographic media (geo-media) are especially important for attaching meaning to places as they clearly connect location, information and visualization. In addition to this, geo-media represents mainly single meanings out of the many that are possible. Nowadays, geo-media have become more and more present in everyday life due to mobile computing in combination with Geoweb applications. For instance, maps on smart phones guide people in their everyday actions, but at the same time limit their opportunities for action by limiting the variety of potential meanings.\n\nScholars of spatial citizenship understand geo-media as instruments of reflection and communication.\n\nThe goal of education for spatial citizenship is to enable learners to achieve a reflexive appropriation of space as the basis for mature action in space by reflective geo-media use and active, reflective geo-media production. Using a broad variety of learning environments orientated toward the learners' needs, the educational approach of spatial citizenship is applicable at different levels from primary to tertiary education. Apart from technological proficiency, spatial citizenship education aims at two additional main competencies:\n\nThe European Commission-funded project SPACIT furthers education for spatial citizenship by developing teacher training standards, curricula, and learning modules for teacher education. Another EU-funded project, digital-earth.eu, linked with the SPACIT project by connecting stakeholders using or interested in using geo-media in education. It supported spatial citizenship through the creation of educational standards, the collection of best-practice examples, and the provision of learning environments applicable to teachers in everyday classroom situations. Digital-earth.eu also promoted these concepts related to spatial citizenship in political circles concerned with the development of the Europe2020 goals.\n\n"}
{"id": "969824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=969824", "title": "Student council", "text": "Student council\n\nA student council (also known as a student union or associated student body) is a curricular or extracurricular activity for students within elementary and secondary schools around the world. These councils are present in most public and private K-12 school systems across the United States, Canada, Greece, Australia and Asia. Student councils often serve to engage students in learning about democracy and leadership, as originally espoused by John Dewey in \"\" (1917).\n\nThe student council helps share students’ ideas, interests, and concerns with teachers and school principals. They often also help raise funds for school-wide activities, including social events, community projects, helping people in need and school reform. Most schools participate in food drives, fundraisers and parties. Many members learn skills that were an extension of their formal education.\n\nStudent councils operate in many forms. There are representative-based and modeled loosely after the U.S. Congress, or based on the Executive Branch of the United States, with a President, Vice-President, secretary, treasurer, and reporter. In this form student representatives and officers are usually elected from and by the student body, although there may be prerequisites for candidacy or suffrage. In elementary schools, there are typically one or two student representatives per classroom and one presiding set of officers. However, many secondary schools have one set of officers per grade level.\n\nAn example of the structure of an elementary student council may include a president, a vice president, secretary, treasurer, sergeant of arms, fundraising officer, historian, boys rep, and girls rep. These roles may be assigned or voted on, either within the student council or by the entire student body. They may also reflect descending grade-levels, with the president in the oldest grade, and so forth. Secondary school governments often have more independence and power than younger governments. Often a student government is overseen by a sponsor, which is usually a teacher at that particular school. Most junior or middle school student councils have a constitution of some sort and usually do not have a judicial branch. Compared to elementary school councils, junior high and high school councils generally have fewer people.\n\nIn some schools, a student council representative is assigned to each class. That person passes on requests, ideas and complaints from students in that class to the student council. In other schools, the elected Class Officers are automatically members of the student council.\n\nStudent councils usually do not have funding authority and generally must generate their operating funds through fundraisers such as car washes and bake sales. Some student councils have a budget from the school, along with responsibility for funding a variety of student activities within a school.\n\nStudent councils can join larger associations, and in the United States, the National Association of Student Councils. In Canada, the Canadian Student Leadership Association coordinates the national scene, and in the United Kingdom an organization called involver provides training, support and coordination for the nation's student councils\n\nIn Bulgaria most of the universities have a student council, regulated by law and the regulations of each university.\n\nIn Canada, the student council is used for helping the school with special events and planning other events.\n\nSecondary high schools, \"lukio\", and vocational schools in Finland have student councils. They incorporate all the students of the institution, but their status is marginal, locally and nationally. Legislation demands that they should be heard in all matters pertaining to the education in the institution, but this is often not done.\n\nA student council in Germany is used to plan school events.\n\nIn India, student councils have been introduced in almost all Private and Public Schools.\n\nStudent councils in India may be elected, nominated or selected after interview (or written examination or both).\n\nThe student councils in Indonesia are officially formed by the government and is called OSIS (Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah). OSIS is present in both junior high school and high school. Every year, the committee which usually consists of teachers and former student council members hold a selection process to admit students who meet qualifications to join OSIS, while the president is voted by students of the school. In some practices, the teachers can also vote depending on their own regulation.\n\nIn Iran, each November since 1997, secondary school students at each school in the nation elect between 5-14 Student Council members, which act as the main medium of communication and debate between the student body and school officials. The size of the Council at each school depends largely on the class size and school policies. Student councils in Iran mainly promote interpersonal and leadership skills, constructive debates between school officials and the students, and organization of school activities and field trips.\n\nSince 1998 in Ireland there has been sustained development of student councils in post primary schools. In 2008 the Irish Second Level Students Union was founded as the National Umbrella body to organize and coordinate the national campaign efforts of the student councils. The Union is also a member of OBESSU. Schools and staff are advised to assist the creation of a student council under section 27 of The Education Act 1998\n\nIsrael's national student and youth council (Hebrew: מועצת התלמידים והנוער הארצית) is an elected body representing all youth in Israel since 1993. Representatives are elected democratically from district youth councils. (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Center, Haifa, Arab sector, South, and North).\nThe council comprises youth from the different sectors: religious, secular, Jewish, Arab, Druze and a Bedouin representative.\nThe National Youth Council representatives mediate between Government decision makers and the Youth representatives. They participate in the various \"Knesset\" (the Israeli parliament) committees: Education, internal Affairs, Violence, Drugs and Science. Youth representatives participate in committees dealing with youth-related issues such as: children's rights, violence, delinquency and youngsters at risk - cut off from mainstream youth. Youth representatives also participate in discussions concerning matriculation examinations, discussing a national project on school trips, delegations Youth representatives youth, are invited by high officials, ministers and even the president and officials from foreign countries.\nIsrael's national student and youth council is the first youth council in the world that made student rights legislation. \nIn 2006 graduates of the Israel's national student and youth council founded an association named Bematana. The association's mission is to promote young leaders who are elected as representatives in student and youth councils in Israel.\nin 2012 the Israel's national student and youth council held the International Youth Leadership Conference under the slogan. \"Take The Lead!\"\n\nAll schools in Norway are required by law to have a student council elected by the students. The aim of student council is usually to improve their school through encouraging social, cultural and other extracurricular events in the local community. The student councils in Norway are governed by a Board of Directors which is either elected directly or by the student council.\n\nIn Pakistan, Student Councils are being introduced in many Private and Public Schools. Student council are playing an important role in Pakistani schools.\n\nStudent council in Pakistan maybe elected, nominated or selected after interview or written examination or both but can also be based on academic behaviour or discipline.\nSome times counsel members are elected based on general elections.\n\nStudent governments of different schools throughout the Philippine Republic are often directly elected by student body members of the class or organization which they supposedly govern.In some schools they called the Student Councils as \"Supreme Student Government\" or \"SSG\" for short.\n\nIn Singapore many secondary schools have a student council, which provides a medium for communication between the students and the school administration, a form of student welfare, and an important event-organising body. Some secondary schools name their student council like \"Student Leader Board\" or \"Student Leader Committee\", etc. They are usually nominated by peers and subsequently elected based on the decision of the teachers overseeing the student leader body.\nIn Junior Colleges, student councils serve a greater purpose than their younger counterparts. They are given more autonomy in their planning and execution of school events.\n\nMost Spanish universities have student councils which are regulated by law. Some of the basic points are the 24% of student representation in the board. Each university council is elected by universal suffrage of the students.\n\nStudent Councils (sometimes Student Voice, School Council, Student Parliament, and Student Union) at secondary school level are usually bodies nominated by teachers in state schools (and public and private schools without a house system). There are some regional networks between the representative bodies.\n\nIn Wales, the School Councils (Wales) Regulations 2005 made the establishment of School Councils a statutory requirement on all maintained primary and secondary schools in the country. The regulations also require that Councils meet regularly, that members of the School Council are elected by fellow pupils by means of a secret ballot, and that the School Council can nominate up to two of their number to serve as associate members on the school's Board of Governors.\n\n\n\n"}

The System is headquartered in the Administration Building on the Texas Tech University campus in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nOn February 10, 1923, Texas Technological College (now named Texas Tech University) was founded, and that August, a committee selected to locate the institution in Lubbock. The Board of Directors of Texas Technological College (now named the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System) was established to oversee the institution.\n\nIn 1969, the Texas Tech University School of Medicine (now named Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center), was founded as separate multi-campus institution from Texas Tech University. It was also overseen by same board of regents as Texas Tech University.\n\nIn 1985, then state senator, and future TTU System chancellor, John Montford proposed the creation of the Texas Tech University System.\n\nIn 1999, the Texas Legislature formally established the Texas Tech University System, consisting of the same two institutions, overseen by the board of regents, and the newly created position of chancellor to provide leadership and support for both Texas Tech University, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.\n\nIn 2007, Angelo State University left the Texas State University System and joined the Texas Tech System. On May 18, 2013, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso was established as a separate university in El Paso.\n\nAngelo State University is a public, coeducational university located in San Angelo, Texas. It was founded in 1928 as a two-year college. In 1965, the school began offering four-year degrees and ten years later became part of the Texas State University System.\n\nAngelo State University offers 97 bachelors, 23 masters, and 1 doctoral degree program. The university is divided into five colleges, Business, Education, Liberal and Fine Arts, Nursing and Allied Health, Sciences, and Graduate Studies.\n\nIn March 2007, Rep. Drew Darby and Sen. Robert Duncan co-sponsored House Bill 3564, which aimed to realign Angelo State with the Texas Tech University System. The merger received widespread support in both Lubbock and San Angelo. The bill was approved by the full House on April 24, 2007, and by the Senate in a unanimous vote on May 15, 2007. On May 23, 2007, Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill. A companion amendment to the Texas Constitution went before voters on November 6, 2007 as Proposition 1, which passed 66.28 percent in favor to 33.72 percent against.\nTexas Tech University was founded in 1923, is a public, coeducational, doctoral/research university, and is the system flagship. Current enrollment totals 32,327 students. The main campus is located in Lubbock, Texas, and is bordered by Marsha Sharp Freeway (4th Street), 19th Street, University Avenue, and Quaker Avenue. It operates several satellite campuses and centers outside of Lubbock, listed in the next section. Texas Tech University consists of 11 colleges and offers 150 degree programs.\n\nTexas Tech University Health Sciences Center was created as the Texas Tech University School of Medicine by the 61st Texas Legislature in 1969. In 1979, the charter was expanded to create the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. The university's enrollment was more than 4,000 as of Fall 2011. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center is a seven-school university and operates five satellite campuses and academic sites in addition to the main campus in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nOn May 18, 2013, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso (TTUHSC El Paso) was established as a separate university from TTUHSC. The university is made up of three schools: Gayle Greve Hunt School of Nursing, Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.\n\nThe government, control, and direction of the Texas Tech University System is vested in a nine-member Board of Regents appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislature. Each Regent serves a six-year term, and appointments are staggered so that three members of the Board's terms expire in odd-numbered years. In addition to the nine members, there also is a student regent who is appointed by the governor to serve a one-year term that begins on June 1 of each year.\n\nIn 1923, Governor Pat Neff appointed the first members of the Board of Directors of Texas Technological College (as the council was known until 1969). When the name of Texas Technological College was changed in 1969, so did the council to: Board of Regents of Texas Tech University. The council has been known by its current name, Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System, after the Texas Tech University System was established in 1996.\n\n\n\n\nThe Chancellor is the chief executive officer of the Texas Tech University System appointed by, and responsible to, the Board of Regents. The Chancellor carries out the policies of the System as determined by the Regents and has direct responsibility for all aspects of the operations of the Texas Tech University System's four primary components: Texas Tech University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Angelo State University and the Texas Tech University System Offices.\n\nThe Texas Tech University System has had five Chancellors: John T. Montford, David Smith, Kent Hance, Robert L. Duncan, and Tedd L. Mitchell.\n\nThe presidents of Texas Tech University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and Angelo State University are appointed by the Chancellor and are chief executive officers of their respective institutions and responsible for the strategic operation of each institution.\n\nThe four institutions of the Texas Tech University System are located on multiple campuses and academic sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The project has gathered songs in Yiddish, a language put on the Red List of Threatened Languages by UNESCO. Before World War II the number of native Yiddish speakers amounted to 11 million people. During Holocaust 6 million Jewish people were killed, thus the number of Yiddish speakers halved. The language continued in literature, oral speech, Ashkenazi folklore, and in songs. These songs reflect habits and ways, language and music, the soul of the Jewish people. The attitude to parents, children, neighbours, religion, work, native home, the world around and themselves, to life and death – all this is expressed in the art of singing, and each of the Songs of Jewish Shtetle becomes a little music play. The project is unique as the Jewish songs in Yiddish, which had been persecuted for centuries, the songs that had only been played by small klezmer ensembles before, were for the first time performed with all the vivacity of a big symphony orchestra.\n\nEfim Alexandrov, the author, art director and soloist of the project, Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation, singer and custodian of Yiddish song tradition, was awarded for his cultural activities including this project, with the Russian National Award “Person of the Year” in 2001 and the “Person of the Year – 5764” Award of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia in 2004. At \"The Golden Nine\" annual ceremony, where those who contributed most to all the spheres of Israeli society are rewarded, Efim Alexandrov was awarded by Israel television channel Israel Plus the special prize of \"The Golden Nine\" for his contribution to the world Jewish culture.\n\nIn 2001 the first night of The Songs of Jewish Shtetle was held at the Novaya Opera theatre in Moscow under the patronage of the International Charity Fund of Yuri Bashmet.\n\nThe concert program included not only the songs created in Jewish shtetles in the Yiddish language, but also those that were written by people who left the shtetles after the Pale of Settlement had been abolished. In the 10 years that the project exists several concert programs have been created, and over 150 The Songs of Jewish Shtetle concerts have been played in the USA, Canada, Germany, Israel, Australia, Russia, and CIS countries. Efim Alexandrov is engaged in continuous research to restore the Yiddish musical culture. Together with the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra conducted by Sergey Skripka they recorded several CDs of songs from Jewish shtetles of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Two concerts, one at the Novaya Opera theatre in Moscow, the other at the State Central Concert Hall “Rossiya”, were filmed and later broadcast in many countries.\nThe project presents traditional Jewish folk songs, as well as songs composed by S. Kemelmakher, E.Alexandrov, V.Shainsky, I.Lyublinsky, lyrics by S.Kemelmakher, B.Zitserman, M.Tanich, I.Kerler and others. Since 2001 several concert programs were created.\n\nThe first concert program of The Songs of Jewish Shtetle featured songs that were included in \"The Songs of Jewish Shtetle\" music album:\n\nThe second concert program of The Songs of Jewish Shtetle featured songs that were included in \"The Songs of Jewish Shtetle-2\" music album:\n\nParticipants of the project (in different years):\n\nThe Musical and the Theatrical group:\n\n"}

He is internationally known as Alvaro Siza () and in Portugal as Siza Vieira ().\n\nSiza was born in Matosinhos, a small coastal town near Porto. He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the University of Porto, the current FAUP – \"Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto\". He completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Siza Vieira taught at the school from 1966 to 1969, returning in 1976. In addition to his teaching there, he has been a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University; the University of Pennsylvania; Los Andes University of Bogota; and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.\n\nAlong with Fernando Távora, he is one of the references of the Porto School of Architecture where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is Eduardo Souto de Moura, e.g. on Portugal's flagship pavilions at Expo '98 in Lisbon and Expo 2000 in Hannover, as well as on the Serpentine Pavillon 2005. Siza's work is often described as \"poetic modernism\"; he himself has contributed to publications on Luis Barragán.\n\nAmong Siza's earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named Piscinas de Marés) he created in the 1960s for Leça da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea. In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of Évora commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (\"Serviço de Apoio Ambulatório Local\"), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards. He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988.\n\nMost of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the Faculty of Architecture (1987–93), and the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art (1997). Since the mid-1970s, Siza has been involved in numerous designs for public housing, public pools, and universities. Between 1995 and 2009, Siza has been working on an architecture museum on Hombroich island, completed in collaboration with Rudolf Finsterwalder. Most recently, he started coordinating the rehabilitation of the monuments and architectonic heritage of Cidade Velha (Old Village) in Santiago, an island of Cape Verde.\n\nCommissioned after winning an international competition in 2010, Siza and Granada-based Juan Domingo Santos unveiled designs for a new entrance and visitors center at the Alhambra in 2014.\n\nIn July 2014 Siza announced his decision to donate the large part of his architectural archive to the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in order to make his materials \"accessible alongside the work of other modern and contemporary architects\", while also giving specific project archives to the Fundação Gulbenkian in Lisbon and Fundação de Serralves in Porto, Portugal.\n\nIn 1987, the dean of Harvard Graduate School of Design, the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, organized the first show of Siza's work in the United States. In 1992, he was awarded with the renowned Pritzker Prize for the renovation project that he coordinated in the Chiado area of Lisbon, a historic commercial sector that was all but completely destroyed by fire in August 1988.\n\nOther prizes include: The Golden Medal of The Superior Council of Architecture of the College of Architects of Madrid in 1988; Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture, the Prince of Wales Prize in Urban Design from Harvard University, and the Alvar Aalto Medal in 1988; Portugal's National Prize of Architecture 1993; the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Praemium Imperiale in 1998, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2001, the Urbanism Special Grand Prize of France 2005.\n\nSiza's Iberê Camargo Foundation in Porto Alegre, his first project built in Brazilian territory, was honoured by the Venice Architecture Biennale with the Golden Lion award in 2002. In 2007 the Brazilian Government awarded him the Cultural Merit Order Medal. More recently he was awarded the RIBA's 2009 Royal Gold Medal and the International Union of Architects' 2011 Gold Medal. Siza was awarded by the Venice Architecture Biennale (13th Edition) with the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2012).\n\nSiza was conferred the title of Honoris Causa Doctor by the following universities: Polytechnic University of Valencia; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne; University of Palermo; University Menendez Pelayo, in Santander; Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería in Lima, Peru; University of Coimbra; Lusíada University of Porto; Universidade Federal de Paraíba; the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Polo delle Scienze e delle Tecnologie, in Naples; the University of Architecture and Urbanism of Bucharest \"Ion Mincu\", Romania (2005); and the University of Pavia, Italy (2007). He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the American Institute of Architects, the \"Académie d'Architecture de France\" and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\nWorks by Siza include the Iberê Camargo Foundation, the Serralves, and the New Orleans building.\n\n"}
