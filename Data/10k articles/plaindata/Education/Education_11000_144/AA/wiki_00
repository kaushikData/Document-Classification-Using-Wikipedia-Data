Priestley believed that the chart and \"A New Chart of History\" (1769) would allow students to \"trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner.\" \n\nThe \"Chart of Biography\" covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's \"principle of selection\" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. Machiavelli is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and Cicero is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; \"statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers.\" \n\nBoth \"Charts\" were popular for decades—the \"A New Chart of History\" went through fifteen editions by 1816. The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764.\n\n"}

{"id": "3581883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3581883", "title": "Bachelor of Architecture", "text": "Bachelor of Architecture\n\nThe Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) is a bachelor's degree designed to satisfy the academic requirement of practicing architecture.\n\nArchitectural education in Australia varies depending on the university offering the course. All Australian architecture schools and programs have recently moved to some variation on the 3 + 2 Bologna model, with a three-year undergraduate degree, followed by a two-year course-work based Master of Architecture professional degree. Some universities also require 6–12 months of practice work experience between the two degrees. Registration as an architect is via state-based boards and requires a minimum of two years practice experience under the supervision of a registered architect. In addition there are double degrees offered by many universities, such as those combining architecture with construction or landscape architecture. Some universities also offer masters programs in architecture via coursework or research. Many architecture faculties offer related programs in landscape architecture, urban planning, urban design, property and construction. Entry to Australian architecture programs is highly competitive and the proportion of students at some architecture schools from outside Australia is very high, up to 40%.\n\nUniversities in Australia offering professionally accredited architecture programs:\n\nInstitutions in Australia offering other programs in architecture:\n\n\nSome of the well known private and public universities with departments of architecture include:\n\n\nIn France, architectural education is offered in various independent schools of architecture, both private and public. The first step of architectural education is the \"Diploma of Studies in Architecture\", a three-year degree equivalent to a Bachelor of Architecture. This degree does not allow registration as an architect, awardees must pursue a Master of Architecture in order to obtain vocational qualification.\n\nIn India, Bachelor of Architecture lasts for five years. Specialised institutes founded by the government of India, for excellence in the field of architecture and planning are SPAs (Schools of Planning and Architecture). They are Institutes of National Importance through an act in the Parliament, on the lines of IITs, NITs and IIMs. Currently there are three such SPAs, with the MHRD (Ministry of Human Resource Development) mulling over setting up more such institutes.\n\nSome other institutes offering courses in architecture include the following:\n\n\nArchitectural education is offered in various universities as a four-year program. The language of the program depends on the university.\n\nThe American University of Sharjah is the first university outside of North America to offer a B.Arch. that is officially accredited by the US-based National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).\n\nOther universities where UAE students Enroll are:\n\n\nArchitectural education differs slightly in the United Kingdom. A five-year course used to exist in a similar fashion to the United States, but the 1960s saw the introduction of the sandwich course and a split of the B.Arch. into a 3-year BA (Hons.) degree (or in some cases BSc) followed by a year working in practice, after which a 2-year MA, PG-DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. is completed. A further year of work completes the student's education upon the passing of Part III final examinations (See below). Registration as an architect is then permissible by the Architects Registration Board. Many UK universities offer postgraduate programs by coursework and research in architecture and related fields such as landscape architecture, planning, and urban design.\n\nIn effect, for most students to become an architect in the United Kingdom they must pass or be exempted from parts I,II and III of the RIBA's examinations. Completion of the three-year BA or BSc gives an exemption from Part I. Completion of the two-year DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. gives exemption from Part II and the final two years of supervised practical training, with supplemental examinations and assignments, makes up the requirements for Part III.\n\nAn alternative route to qualification exists by sitting the exams directly - currently this administered by Oxford Brookes University on behalf of the RIBA.\n\nUniversities offering architecture courses validated by the Royal Institute of British Architects in the UK (some offering only some parts of the three parts required):\nSeveral universities outside of the UK offer architecture courses validated by the Royal Institute of British Architects at part I and part II level. For students who want to study outside of the UK, the RIBA recognized courses offer the advantage of internationally recognized degrees, and other benefits, such as the possibility of RIBA membership.\n\nThe Bachelor of Architecture is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) as a professional degree, allowing the recipient to qualify for the Architect Registration Examination (ARE). NAAB-accredited B.Arch. programs must include at least 150 semester credit hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent, of which at least 45 semester hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent are in general studies.\n\nThere are also universities that offer a four-year degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies or a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (B.S.Arch) or a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies (B.A.Arch). These are non-accredited, pre-professional degrees, and so these students must enroll in a Master of Architecture (M.Arch) program to be professionally licensed. However, enrolling in a pre-professional program often gets a student into a shorter M.Arch program. Any architecturally-related curriculum may eventually make licensure possible, depending upon the laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which you wish to be licensed.\n\nThe course of study of the Bachelor of Architecture includes studio courses on design and aesthetic theory, as well as practical courses on structures, building mechanical systems, electrical systems, plumbing and construction. Student work is often in the form of drawings and renderings, either through computer-aided design or drafting by hand. Students also build physical models and create presentation boards for drawings and graphics.\n\nIn nearly all architecture schools in the United States, student life and work revolves around a studio class. Other classes in the architecture curriculum are designed to support the concepts emphasized in studio. One particularly rigorous aspect of studio classes is the \"critique\" or \"review.\" Students \"pin-up\" their models and presentation drawings for instructors (and students) who offer constructive criticism.\n\nColleges and universities in the United States where either an NAAB accredited Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture degree can be obtained are listed below. Many schools offer an M.Arch as the first professional degree, preceded by a nonprofessional B.A./B.S. in Architecture undergraduate degree.\n\n"}

She was a charter member of the Music Supervisors' National Conference. Alexander is credited with laying the foundations of music education in the Dallas public schools.\n\nAlexander was born on March 24, 1870 in Lincoln County, Tennessee. Later, she and her family moved to Texas and she attended school in Forney, Texas and also at Mary Nash College. She returned to Tennessee to study piano and voice at Ward Seminary, graduating in 1891. When she graduated, she and her family moved to Dallas. Alexander became the Dallas Public School's music supervisor and worked there for twelve years during which she established a \"first rate system of music education.\" She organized special concerts for students with conductor Walter Fried. Alexander was a charter member of the Music Supervisors' National Conference, founded in 1907. When officials cut back on music programs, Alexander created her own music textbook, published in 1912, called \"Songs We Like to Sing\". Alexander was also instrumental in bringing a victrola to play music for her students. She was also invited to lecture on music education at the University of Texas.\n\nAlexander moved to El Paso for health reasons in 1913 after contracting tuberculosis. Her brother-in-law, Robert B. Homan, Sr., was a physician and ran a sanatorium in El Paso called Homan's San. Alexander stayed at the sanatorium for four years where she worked in the office and didn't feel that she would be able to go back to teaching music. Eventually, Alexander began to give piano lessons for her niece and word began to spread and soon Alexander had many students. There were times when she had more students than she could teach and in those situations, she would refer them to other teachers.\n\nAlexander was made an honorary life member of the National Music Teachers' Association of Texas in 1941. Formerly, she had served as president of the organization. In addition, she put together the music department for the Texas State Teachers Association.\n\nAlexander died in her home in El Paso on August 2, 1960. She was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in El Paso. An elementary school named after Alexander was dedicated in Dallas in March of 1970.\n\n"}
{"id": "13968777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13968777", "title": "Café philosophique", "text": "Café philosophique\n\nCafé philosophique (\"cafe-philo\") is a grassroots forum for philosophical discussion, founded by philosopher Marc Sautet in Paris, France, on December 13, 1992.\n\nThere were about 100 \"cafés-philo\" operating throughout France and some 150 cafés-philos internationally at the time of Sautet's death in 1998.\n\nThe subjects discussed at the cafes had a range that varied from the Santa Claus myth to truth to beauty to sex to death. They posed such questions as \"What is a fact?\" and \"Is hope a violent thing?\" Sautet made the discussions seem fun and exciting. The concept was to bring people together in a public friendly forum where they could discuss ideas. A cafe tended to have this type of atmosphere where people were relaxed drinking coffee and carrying on conversations. This concept ultimately developed into Café Philosophique that he founded.\n\nThousands of participants in philosophy cafes worldwide have adopted Sautet's idea as a way to enhance their thinking. Ideas are thrown out with concern for accuracy and philosophical rigor. The concepts discussed were in the spirit of tolerance and openness. The idea of Sautet's philosophy cafes have spread around the world. The concept that started in France and subsequently entered England, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Finland and eventually throughout Europe is now in Canada, South America, Greece, Australia, Japan and the United States. Due to this success, the French president Jacques Chirac sent a founding member on a good will mission to Latin America to introduce the concept there.\n\nThe French Institute for Scotland in Edinburgh also runs a café philosophique in Edinburgh - continuing a tradition that dates back to the days of the great Francophile philosopher David Hume. Staff of The French Institute for Scotland are also involved in teaching philosophy in Scottish primary schools, as an example in Clackmannan. In England, a Cafe Philosophique has been meeting in a Cromford (Derbyshire) bookshop cafe since being founded by Wirksworth philosopher-potter Evan Rutherford in 1993, and by 2009 had held around 100 meetings. The public evenings are usually led by members and associates of the ever-changing group rather than by professional philosophers, but prospective speakers are welcome to propose topics; the text of some of the talks can be read online.\n\nThe Ottoman empire expanded throughout Europe in the 17th century. From Vienna came the idea of a place where men could meet and discuss various topics over coffee or tea (Viennese coffee house culture). Adapted to Western culture, the Turkish \"coffee cafes\" became the place where friends met for a drink. The tradition of the Agora was moved from the public square to the center city cafe. Philosophers, poets, writers, and intellectuals of all types made these places their new meeting places.\n\nIn 1686 the Sicilian Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli started \"Café Procope\" in \"rue de l'Ancienne Comédie\", in the Latin Quarter of Paris known as the 6th arrondissement. It was the first café in Paris. Certain intellectuals that have frequented the cafe for philosophical discussions throughout history have been Victor Hugo, Paul Verlaine, Honoré de Balzac Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, François-Marie Arouet, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Georges Danton, Jean-Paul Marat, Honoré de Balzac and Denis Diderot amongst others.\n\nFor about 30 years in Paris, poets, painters, writers and part of the surrealist movement went to cafés of Montparnasse. Also in Paris after World War II the cafes of the Latin quarter saw a form of existentialism. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre conducted philosophical discussions at the Café de Flore. These \"coffee philos\" were the historical beginnings of Sautet's \"cafés-philos\".\n\nSautet started the idea of philosophy cafes in the Place de la Bastille neighborhood of Paris at the Café des Phares on December 13, 1992. He would gather some friends at his \"café philos\" each Sunday at 11 A.M. and opened up philosophical debates (\"conceptual fisticuffs\") for some two hours. His philosophy was a return to the basic principles of reasoning intended for the general public, not aristocrats. The first meetings started with only a dozen or so people. Soon university students showed up, followed by eccentric citizens off the street, off-duty cab drivers, and idle wealthy women. This became a weekly event that grew in popularity to about 200 people at each meeting. Sautet returned philosophy to the general public in Café Philosophique. In so doing, he was rejected by scholars as being unfaithful to the normal philosophy taught in higher education.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24436647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24436647", "title": "College (Canada)", "text": "College (Canada)\n\nIn Canadian English, the term college usually refers to a technical, applied arts, or applied science school. These are post-secondary institutions granting certificates, diplomas, associate's degree, and bachelor's degrees.\n\nIn English Canada, the term \"college\" is usually used to refer to technical schools that offer specialized professional or vocational education in specific employment fields. They include colleges of applied arts and technology, colleges of applied sciences, etc.\n\nIn Ontario and Alberta, and formerly in British Columbia, there are also institutions which are designated university colleges, as they only grant under-graduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both under-graduate and graduate programs and those that do not. There is a distinction between \"college\" and \"university\" in Canada. In conversation, one specifically would say either \"They are going to university\" (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or \"They are going to college\" (suggesting a technical or career college).\n\n\nIn Quebec, mostly with speakers of Quebec English, the term \"college\" is seldom used for post secondary education. Instead the word \"CEGEP\" ( or ) has become the more common term. CEGEP is a loanword from the French acronym Cégep or CÉGEP (\"Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel\"), meaning \"College of General and Vocational Education\". A CEGEP is a public college in the Quebec education system, offering either a two-year diploma, which allows on to continue onto university (unless one applies as a 'mature' student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least two years), or a three-year diploma in a variety of trades and technologies (e.g. nursing, mechanical engineering or computer science).\n\nIn American English, (and in formal British English as well) the word college is especially used for what Canadians would call the undergraduate level of a university, but in popular use it refers to all post secondary studies. Canadians, on the other hand, use the word university for both undergraduate and graduate post-secondary studies.\n\nThese are schools specializing in fine arts and design which have four-year undergraduate programs. Many are universities, meaning they also have the ability to grant postgraduate degrees; in Canada these include the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University (NSCAD), Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and Ontario College of Art and Design University (OCAD). The Alberta College of Art and Design (ACAD) currently grants undergraduate degrees only, and thus does not have the status of university.\n\nThe Royal Military College of Canada, a full-fledged degree-granting university, does not follow the naming convention used by the rest of the country, nor does its sister school Royal Military College Saint-Jean or the now closed Royal Roads Military College.\n\nThe term \"college\" also applies to distinct entities within a university (usually referred to as \"federated colleges\" or \"affiliated colleges\"),to the residential colleges in the United Kingdom. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, Trinity College was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the University of Toronto, and is now one of its residential colleges. Occasionally, \"college\" refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither \"federated\" nor \"affiliated\"—College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science, among others.\n\nIn a number of Canadian cities, high schools are called \"collegiate institutes\" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word \"college\" which avoids the usual \"post-secondary\" connotation. The term \"collegiate institute\" first appeared in Ontario after the 1900s in the name of high schools because at the higher grades it was one of very few forms of education besides a \"formal\" university. Another reason is that going back in history secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational subjects and ability levels, for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses. In Ontario at one time schools that focused on vocational educational were \"officially\" called High school/ secondary school and went up to grade 12, while schools that went up to grade 13, and prepared students for University were called \"Collegiate Institute\"\n\nDue to their early history when education streams were few or non-existent, some early schools (which were mostly private at the time) were composed of levels reaching and including university at times. In Ontario and Quebec these now private secondary schools, such as Upper Canada College) choose to still use the word \"college\" in their names. Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the separate school system, may also use the word \"college\" or \"collegiate\" in their names.\n\nA small number of the oldest professional associations use \"college\" in the name in the British sense, such as the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.\n\nThe registration and accreditation of private career colleges are regulated by Private Career College Acts for each province.\nBritish Columbia, For example, the Private Career Training Institutions Agency (PCTIA) is responsible for the registration and accreditation of private career college in British Columbia under the Private Career Training Institutions Act (SBC 2003, Chapter 79), Regulations (BC Reg.466/2004), an bylaws.\n"}

She published two books on Hawaiian genealogy, was Director of the Hawaiian Language Newspaper Index Project, and taught traditional hula and chant across the United States. In 2004, she was named a Living Treasure of Hawaii for her contributions to Hawaiian culture and heritage.\n\nEdith Kawelohea Kapule was born on October 22, 1925, in Honolulu, Hawaii. She was the eldest of three siblings, with a sister named Alexandra and a brother named Harry Jr. Their father, Harry Kawelo Kapule, was a Hawaiian from Holualoa, and their mother, Caroline \"Carrie\" Costa, was a Portuguese woman living in Pauoa.\n\nKapule graduated from McKinley High School and went on to study at the University of Hawaii, earning an undergraduate degree in Hawaiian Studies, a master's degree in Education, Curriculum and Instruction, and a Professional Diploma (P.D.) in Secondary Education.\n\nIn 1946, she married Clayton McKinzie of St. Louis, Missouri. They had one daughter named Joleen Hokuloa McKinzie, and four step-children from Clayton's earlier life.\n\nMcKinzie lectured at the University of Hawaii's College of Continuing Education, teaching local genealogy and mele hula, and she also taught chanting for the State Council on Hawaiian Heritage. She was the first professor of Hawaiian Studies at the Honolulu Community College, holding the position from 1978 to 1997.\n\nShe was known for her extensive work on Hawaiian genealogy, publishing two volumes of \"Hawaiian Genealogies.\" McKinzie also researched the genealogy of the chiefs of Kahoolawe for the Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission.\n\nMcKinzie served as chairwoman for the University of Hawaii's Committee for the Preservation and Study of Hawaiian Language, Art and Culture.\n\nWorking with the Bishop Museum, McKinzie established the Hawaiian Language Newspaper Index Project, organizing a team of scholars to index and catalogue articles, notices, and advertisements from early 19th– and 20th–century Hawaiian-language newspapers. She served as Director of the project.\n\nMcKinzie first began learning about traditional Hawaiian hula, music and language at home with her family, and was encouraged by her aunt Mary Kapule, who had formerly danced for famed Kumu Hula Anton Ka`ö`ö. At the age of 12, McKinzie began her formal hula and chant training with Joseph `Ïlälä`ole.\n\nAs an adult, McKinzie taught hula across Hawaii, the U.S. mainland, Guam, Midway Island, and Alaska. After she opened a dance school at Guam, McKinzie was invited by dancers Ted Shawn and La Meri to teach Hawaiian dance at Jacob's Pillow in Lee, Massachusetts. She also became a frequent judge in hula competitions. In 2012, McKinzie attended the annual Malia Craver Hula Kahiko Competition as a presenter, awarding the Edith Kawelohea McKinzie Overall Trophy to Kamehameha High School.\n\nMcKinzie joined the Ahahui Ka’ahumanu society in 1949. She was also a member of the Order of the Eastern Star, and received the title Worthy Matron in 1965.\n\nOver the years, McKinzie was recognized for her cultural work with the Pulama Award from the Kalihi-Palama Culture and Arts Society, the Order of Distinction from the State Council on Hawaiian Heritage and the Ke Kukui Malamalama from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. She received the Ambassador of Hawaii Award from Hawaiian Governor John Waihe’e, and the David Malo award from the Rotary Club of West Oahu.\n\nIn 2004, McKinzie was named a Living Treasure of Hawaii by the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii for her efforts in fostering traditional Hawaiian culture.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, McKinzie died just a few hours before her 89th birthday. She was interred in the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park. Abigail K.

With more than 36 percent of the population in Mitrovica being under 19 years old Mitrovica has a large number of primary schools, secondary schools and higher education institutes. These schools are located throughout the municipality, which is compromised by the city of Mitrovica, its 26 southern villages, and the northern part of the city.\n\nA location map with the education institutions of Mitrovica can be accessed here:\nEducation Providers in Mitrovica.\n\nMitrovica features one of the most profound ethnic tensions in south east Europe. It thereby witnessed the highest frequency of ethnic incidents, as well as most sizable. Since its division in 1999, with the river Ibar serving as de facto ethnic border, its educational system is also divided.\n\nMitrovica has four higher education providers, one in north Mitrovica and three in south Mitrovica. Whereas the north Mitrovica based University of Pristina, Mitrovica operates under Serbian higher education law the three south Mitrovica based higher education institutions are operating under Kosovo higher education law and are subject to regular accreditations by the Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA).\n\nWith the end of the Kosovo war, the Serbian members of the University of Pristina moved faculties to north Mitrovica. With the assistance of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UMNIK), they established the University of Pristina, Mitrovica, which started operations in 1999.\nThe university of Pristina, Mitrovica comprises ten faculties, seven of which are located in Mitrovica. The Mitrovica campus hosts the faculties for: economics, medicine, law, mathematics and natural science, technical science, arts and philosophy. The faculty of agriculture is situated in Zubin Potok and Lesak, the faculty for teacher training as well as the faculty for physical education and sports are situated in Leposavic.\n\nIn 2009, the Mitrovica-based faculties of the University of Pristina, Mitrovica had 3889 full-time students, 3216 part-time students, 582 academic staff and 249 technical staff.\n\nThe University of Pristina, Mitrovica is maintaining a multidisciplinary research centre.\nSince the University of Pristina operates under Serbian law, it is subject to the rules, standards and procedures of the commission for accreditation and quality assurance of the republic of Serbia.\nThe University of Pristina, Mitrovica, is regularly evaluated by the IEP (Institutional Evaluation Program).\n\nThe University of Pristina, Mitrovica includes a multidisciplinary research centre. It also maintains several cooperations, such as through the European Commission founded Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the European Science Foundation and Tempus.\n\nThe current rector of the University of Pristina, Mitrovica is Srecko Milacic.\n\nThe foundations of higher education studies in Mitrovica were set with the opening of the Higher Technical School in 1961. In 1970 the Faculty of Engineering opened branches of Mining, Technology and Metallurgy, initially in Mitrovica, school year 1970/71, to continue then in Pristina until the establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy in Mitrovica in 1974. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, at the University of Mitrovica \"Isa Boletini\" (UMIB) operate six faculties: \n- Bachelor of Science:\n- Master of Science:\n- Bachelor of Science:\n\n- Master of Science:\n- Bachelor of Science:\n\n- Master of Science: \n- Bachelor of Arts:\n\nThe founding of the University of Mitrovica was part of a wider Kosovo government initiative to facilitate the access through higher education throughout Kosovo. This initiative included the opening of universities besides the University of Pristina in Prizren, Peja, Mitrovica and Gjilan.\n\nThe programs where all accredited by KAA in 2012.\n\nBefore the opening of the University of Mitrovica, Mitrovica already hosted the Faculty of Applied Technical Sciences of the University of Pristina (FATS).\n\nFATS cooperated with the German TU Bergakademie Freiberg and the Hochschule Ruhr West.\n\nThe Rector of the University of Mitrovica is Mr. Alush Musa.\nIn the academic year 2014/15 the University of Mitrovica had 2700 students enrolled, with who have worked 80 professors and assistants full-time, and 105 part times.\n\nThe corner stone for the new building for the existing faculties in Mitrovica was laid at 26.12.2012. The new building for the existing faculty costed 1.600.000 euro. The new public university of Mitrovica – it’s campuses – are planned to cost about 14.000.000 Euro.\n\nMitrovica hosts some faculties of the private FAMA college.\nAs per decision of the Kosovo Accreditation Agency, the following Mitrovica based FAMA programs are accredited as by 2013:\n\nAn attempt by FAMA to offer bachelor's degree programs in nursing and Bio medical laboratories failed in 2012, since KAA rejected accrediting these programs.\n\nThe International Business College (IBCM) was founded by the Dutch foundation SPARK in 2010. IBCM operates two campusses, one in north Mitrovica and one in south Mitrovica. In October 2012, IBCM had 312 students.\n\nIBCM is financed by the governments of Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Switzerland, the European Union and the United Kingdom.

{"id": "1260570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1260570", "title": "Engineer's degree", "text": "Engineer's degree\n\nAn engineer's degree is an advanced academic degree in engineering that is conferred in Europe, some countries of Latin America, North Africa and a few institutions in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, the engineer's degree is at a more advanced level than a standard US master's degree. It may include a graduate thesis, and dissertation at the level of the doctorates such as the Ph.D.\n\nIn the United States, the engineer's degree normally requires a further year of study beyond a master's degree, or two years from a bachelor's degree, and often includes a requirement for a research thesis. At the Naval Postgraduate School the thesis is required to be \"more extensive and complete in problem scope and solution than a master's thesis\", although \"not necessarily meeting the test of original research and contribution to fundamental knowledge that is applied to Ph.D. dissertations\". In contrast, at UCLA, the engineer degree is explicitly set at the level of the preliminary Ph.D. examination, i.e. not including the research or thesis components.\n\nThe availability of degrees and the specific requirements differ considerably between institutions and between specialties within an institution. In the past, it was not uncommon for a would-be engineer to earn an engineering degree as their first and only college degree. But since World War II this has fallen out of favor, and it becomes continually more difficult to find a school that offers this option.\n\nA degree with some form of the word \"engineer\" or \"engineering\" in the title is not necessarily an engineer's degree. Particularly, a \"Master of Engineering\" (M.Eng.) or \"Bachelor of Engineering\" (B.Eng.) degree is \"not\" an Engineer's degree, nor is any other bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Rather, the engineer's degree is in a category of its own. For example, a student with a B.S. and M.S. in electrical engineering might next earn the degree \"Electrical Engineer\". The person would then have a B.S. in E.E., a M.S. in E.E., and an E.E. degree. The former two are degrees in engineering, and only the latter degree is actually an engineer's degree.\n\nThrough the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), Engineers Canada accredits Canadian undergraduate engineering programs that meet the standards of the profession. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to pursue further training towards becoming a licensed professional engineer in Canada.\n\nThe P.Eng license is the ultimate qualification for the practicing professional engineering in Canada.\n\nIn Canada, A CEAB-accredited engineer degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a P.Eng (professional engineer) anywhere in Canada, and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured.\n\nA graduate of a non-CEAB-accredited program must demonstrate that his or her education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.\n\nIn Latin America, a degree or title of \"Ingeniero\" is awarded after completing five years of college. This may be translated as \"Engineer\", however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country's educational system, and can be compared to a six-year post-master's degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state licence to legally practice in the field, or a professional certification outside the academic environment.\n\nIn Mexico, the educational system follows closely that of the United States. University education is structured in three cycles, as \"Licenciatura\" (bachelor's degree), \"Maestría\" (master's degree), and \"Doctorado\" (doctorate).\n\nThe \"Ingeniero\" (Engineer) degree is awarded depending on the nature of the studies pursued. In order to be called an Engineer, one must have passed certain courses related to engineering and been awarded a professional credential (\"cédula profesional\") that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional credential (\"cédula profesional\") in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities, and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession.\n\nFor engineering, completing all taught courses of a \"Licenciatura\" does not automatically award the graduate the title and licence of \"Ingeniero\"; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix \"Ingeniería\" attached to the name of the degree. It is the case that many people finish all courses in an engineering program, they obtain the diploma and title of Engineer, and the professional credential, after getting their professional credential (\"cédula profesional\").\n\nDegrees in engineering require four to five years to complete. After this, the graduate may enroll in a postgraduate program, such as a master's degree, or in exceptional cases, directly into a doctoral degree.\n\nIn Chile, the educational system does not strictly follow that of the United States. University education is structured in four cycles, as \"Licenciatura\" (bachelor's degree), \"Título Profesional\" (professional title), \"Magíster\" (master's degree) and \"Doctorado\" (doctorate or Ph.D).\n\nIn this case, the \"engineer\" status is a general denomination for a person who has a professional title in engineering (Título Profesional en Ingeniería). The title is obtained after six years of study; in this way including a bachelor's degree in science, which is obtained after four years of study.\n\nAs in other countries, students only need to obtain the bachelor's degree to enter a master's degree or doctoral program, which commonly take two and three years, respectively. Since a professional title will take six years of study, after obtaining this title the graduate can enroll directly into a doctoral degree. In this manner, the international academic equivalence of a professional title in Chile corresponds to a six-year post-master's degree.\n\nprior to the Bologna Process, In most countries of continental Europe, universities specializing in technical fields have traditionally awarded their students an engineer's degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing secondary education, and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a doctorate.\n\nFollowing German custom in higher education, the engineer's degree is called \"Diplom\". In addition to Germany itself, this system was common in states like Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, R. Macedonia, Ukraine and Vietnam.\n\nIn German, the traditional engineer's degree is called \"Diplom-Ingenieur\". This supersedes Ing. (Grad) the old form in Germany. (\"Dipl.-Ing.\", in Austria also \"DI\") . This degree is generally equivalent to a Master's degree, which is not to be confused with the old \"Magister\" degree. Most programs that used to lead to a \"Dipl.-Ing.\" degree lead to master's degrees today, as the \"Diplom-Ingenieur\" as an academic title is phased out because of the Bologna Process. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a \"Dipl.-Ing.\" with the newly introduced M.Sc. Degrees.\n\nThe German \"Universities of Applied Sciences\" (\"Fachhochschule\") award the traditional engineering degree \"Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)\" (\"Dipl.-Ing. (FH)\"). A requirement for the degree is to write a \"Diplom\" thesis. This is also being modified by the Bologna Process, as bachelor's and master's degrees from a University of Applied Sciences are equal to degrees from a \"traditional\" university.\nUniversities of Applied Sciences are phased out and they are changed to universities with own faculties and research institutes. These universities are strongly focused on fields like computer science, engineering or business schools. Subjects like Law or Human Medicine etc. which requires a \"Staatsexamen\" (state exam) can only be studied at \"traditional\" universities. Since 2009, most Universities in Germany offer bachelor's degree programmes (B.Sc., B.Eng., M.Sc., M.Eng, M.C.A. and others) and Master programmes that lead to the academic degree Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others.\n\nIn Austria there also exists the \"Ingenieur\" (respectively \"Ing.\"). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of a so-called \"HTL\" (\"Höhere Technische Lehranstalt\") which is a high school with a very technical background. Graduates of these schools are allowed to start their studies at universities. The title \"Ingenieur (Ing.)\" could only be obtained after proof of at least three years of practice, which requires higher technical knowledge in the field of education.\n\nWith a revision of the Austrian engineer’s law (Ingenieurgesetz 2017) in May 2017, the requirements of the conferment of the degree were tightened. Next to the existing requirements for graduation from a technical high school (HTL) and a verifiable practical experience of three years, the replicant must take an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. As a result, the degree was included in the National Qualifications Framework on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor's degree. The engineering degree does not meet the requirements to enter a master's program in Austria.\n\nIn France, the engineer's degree is called \"Diplôme d'Ingénieur\" (often abbreviated as \"Dipl. Ing.\"), which is a postgraduate engineering degree (recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States) delivered primarily by the French engineering Grandes Ecoles while the academic title is \"Ingénieur Diplômé\" (\"ID\"; Graduate Engineer) but is never used before the holder's name. While the title \"Ingénieur\" is unregulated and can be used even without an academic degree, anyone misusing the title \"Ingénieur Diplomé\" is liable for a fine and prison sentence.\n\nThe engineer's degree in France is obtained after five to six years of engineering studies after the Baccalauréat (high school diploma). The degree deliverance is regulated by the Commission des titres d'ingénieur (CTI) independent organism. The CTI mandates the French engineering schools (mainly Grandes Écoles) to deliver the \"Diplôme d'Ingénieur\". This degree has been officially considered as a European Master's Degree since the Bologna Process.\n\nAfter the French \"Baccalaureat\", about top 10 per cent of the students are accepted in \"Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles\" (intensive preparatory classes), where mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and technology disciplines are taught. After two years of study in preparatory classes, students must take competitive national examinations (written and oral) in order to compete for a place in the engineering Grandes Ecoles.\n\nOtherwise, the \"Diplôme d'Ingénieur\" can be also delivered by engineering faculties affiliated to a French public university, but the curriculum must be accredited by the CTI. Admission to such programs is based on continuous assessments rather than a nationwide competitive examination.\n\nThe highest engineer qualification in the UK and Ireland is the Chartered Engineer (C.Eng) which is a minimum of eight years but usually 12 years of education, training and professional peer reviewed practice process. Chartered Engineer is a terminal qualification. The academic qualification. which is minimum for gaining chartership in engineering is the Master of Engineering (MEng) or BEng plus MSc or MA in addition to four to six years peer-reviewed professional practice including a project report / thesis. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales this is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland), or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng, and may then allow a transfer to the MEng.\n\nThe City and Guilds of London Institute have established a recognized route to higher engineering qualifications with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). CGLI has align the Graduate Diploma (level 6) and Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) with the registration requirements for Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer status. The Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng and its Postgraduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British MEng.\nUK Professional institutions have delegated authority from the engineering council to approve university degrees and also award the Chartered Engineer qualification in a specific discipline. For example, IMechE awards C.Eng, MIMechE, ICE awards CEng, MICE, and IET awards CEng, MIET.\n\nEngineers who have been awarded a BEng(Ordinary) or BEng(Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the workplace are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng), if the qualification has been accepted for this classification, by the engineering council. If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of postgraduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of four to eight years in practice for a total of eight to 12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured postgraduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development programme administered by IMechE enables the engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.[5]\n\nChartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are similar but not equivalent to North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. The UK and North American system of regulating engineering professional qualifications is very different and not equivalent. In the US and Canada engineering is a regulated profession in terms of practice and enforced by law and licensing. It is more than the regulation of engineering titles—like the UK. This means that many UK chartered Engineers who are grandfathered to the title or are non degree holders (HNC/HND) will not be recognized formally as professional engineers in Canada and US. There is strict interpretation of qualifications and education because there are legal implications. There is no back door entry or experiential exemption from the formal academic requirements. This is simply because of the legal legislation on practice. This licensed based engineering governance legal framework does not exist in the UK.\n\nMIET-Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology is recognised as regulated engineering profession by virtue of the Statutory Instruments n.2007/2781-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2007-Directive European Union 2005/36/EC. http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?fuseaction=profession.regProfs&profId=6361&mode=desc&cId=0&quid=3\n\nThis meaning retains the 19th century idea that \"real\" engineers were military personnel, while \"other\" engineers were civilians.\n\nThe situation in Spain is very similar to France but without the \"grandes écoles\" and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the \"Proyecto de Fin de Carrera\" (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is \"Ingeniero\" (Engineer), or other degree called \"Ingeniero Técnico\" (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field. A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.\n\nIn Portugal, Engineer (, feminine: \"engenheira\", abrev.: \"eng.\") is a professional degree reserved for the effective members of the Portuguese Institution of the Engineers (OE, \"Ordem dos Engenheiros\") and Portuguese Institution of Technical Engineers (OET, \"Ordem dos Engenheiros Técnicos\"). There is not an academic degree of \"engenheiro\", despite the title being used informally to refer to anyone who has a degree in engineering, even a nonmember of the OE or OET.\n\nUntil the Bologna Process, having a \"licenciado\" (five-year) degree in engineering was a previous condition to be able to be admitted to the OE. Presently, admission to the OE requires a post-Bologna \"licenciado\" (3 years) degree or a \"mestre\" (five-year) master in engineering. OE members holders of a post-Bologna \"licenciado\" degree are now classified as E1 grade engineers, while holders of a pre-Bologna \"licenciado\" or a \"mestre\" are classified as E2 grade engineers.\n\nIn Italy until 2001 there were two degrees: a three-year \"diploma in ingegneria\" (BEng level, title abbrev. \"dipl. ing.\") and a five-year \"laurea in ingegneria\" (MEng level, title abbrev. \"ing.\"). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor's level is called \"laurea\" (abbrev. \"L\") and master's degree level is called \"laurea specialistica\" or \"laurea magistrale\" (abbrev. \"LS\"). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called \"laurea in ingegneria\" (BEng level) and the title of \"dottore in Ingegneria\" (abbrev. \"dott.\") can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called \"laurea magistrale in ingegneria\" (MEng level) and the title of \"dottore magistrale in Ingegneria\" (abbrev. \"dott.\") can be obtained. After a \"state exam\" you become \"Ingegnere\" (abbrev. Ing).\n\nIn Greece, the title of \"Engineer\" is awarded by two parallel and complementary parts of public higher education.\n\nThe title \"Diplomate (Graduated) Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course (300 ECTS, ISCED 7) at a University or a Technical University. The Diploma is equivalent to an Integrated master's degree. (Institutions have been issuing certificates of equivalence; officially recognized by the Greek legislation since August 2017.\n\nThe title of \"Certified Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies, equivalent to Honours bachelor's degree (240 ECTS, ISCED 6), at a Technological Educational Institute - T.E.I.\n\nThe newly founded University of Western Attica, in 2018, (after merging the former TEI of Athens and Piraeus) is the only University to award degrees, and not diplomas, equivalent to bachelor's degree (240 ECTS, ISCED 6).\n\nIn Belgium, there are three types of engineering degrees :\n\nNames are traditionally prefixed with the ir. and/ or Ing. titles, although this practice is not as widespread as in the Netherlands. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by law.\nBelgium is particularly noteworthy as having a system under which demands made on students of engineering are particularly severe.\n\nIn the Netherlands, somebody holding an engineer's degree is an \"ingenieur\". There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations:\n\nNames are traditionally prefixed with the \"ir.\" or \"ing.\" titles. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by Dutch law. Under the Bologna agreement the titles are increasingly interchanged with the English-language degrees (B.Sc., BBE, M.Sc., etc.).\n\nCompletion of Dutch engineering qualifications have historically demanded a lot of effort. On average the five-year course takes seven years to finish.\n\nIn Finnish, the engineer's degree is called \"diplomi-insinööri\" and abbreviated \"dipl.ins.\", \"DI\" or \"M.Sc.(Tech.)\". It is possible to obtain after five years of studying, or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate \"tekniikan kandidaatti\" (\"B.Sc.(Tech.)\") degree.\n\nThe degree of \"insinööri (AMK)\" is a bachelor's degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (\"ammattikorkeakoulu\"), similar to a German \"Fachhochschule\", but it is not interchangeable with the academic \"tekniikan kandidaatti\".\n\nDue to the Bologna process, a new master's degree called \"insinööri (ylempi AMK)\" or \"engineer (higher amk)\" has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of \"insinööri (AMK)\" and further studies.\n\nIn the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer's degree is called \"inżynier\" (Polish), \"inžinier\" (Slovak) or \"inženýr\" (Czech), and the abbreviation is \"inż.\" in Poland, and \"Ing.\" in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which may be written before the person's name.\n\nIn the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the degree of \"Ing.\" is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a \"Master of Science in Engineering\".\n\nIn Poland, the degree of \"inżynier\" is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the \"licencjat\" in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A \"magister inżynier\" (abbreviated \"mgr inż.\") refers to a \"Master of Science in Engineering\", after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were \"inżynier\" studies that lasted for four years, and afterward one could obtain the \"magister\" title in two years of studies—the total of six years resulted in two degrees, \"magister\" and \"inżynier\". In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the \"magister inżynier\" five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the \"magister inżynier\" (mgr inż. before the name) was the equivalent degree with \"inżynier\" designating the professional level and \"magister\" designating the academic level.\nAfter the Bologna process the first level is \"inżynier,\" obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before, and \"masters\" after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that \"magister inżynier\" be made a basis for professional rights.\n\nIn Belarus and Ukraine, the degree is \"спеціаліст інженер\" (specialist inzhener), a first degree after five years of study.\n\nIn Croatia, the old system included the engineer's degrees \"diplomirani inženjer\" (abbr. \"dipl.ing.\") which was awarded by university faculties, and a lower ranked engineer's degree \"inženjer\" (abbr. \"ing.\") which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the Netherlands. The old \"dipl.ing.\" degree could later be upgraded to a \"magistar\" (abbr. \"mr.\", Magister degree) and then a \"doktor\" (abbr. \"dr.\", Doctorate). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of Yugoslavia. In Serbian, the abbreviation is \"dipl.inž\". Serbian titles of \"magistar\" (abbr. \"mr\", Magister degree) and \"doktor\" (abbr. \"dr\", Doctorate) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end.\n\nRomania followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called \"Diploma de inginer\", and the graduate was called a \"Inginer diplomat\". These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master(M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (\"examen de diploma\"). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called \"Diploma de Sub-inginer\" which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the Bologna process, the graduates obtain the \"Inginer licentiat\" degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the \"Inginer Master\" degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Bologna process, universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year bachelor's degree, a one to two-year master's degree, and a doctoral degree. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the bachelor's degree (\"baccalaureus\", three to four years), and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer's degree or a master's degree (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single 'integrated' degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland). But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor's) and second (master's) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum.\n\nMost traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year \"Civilingenjör\" in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor's and master's degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the \"civilingenjör\" degree.\n\nIn France, engineering is taught in \"écoles d’ingénieurs\", which are part of the French \"grandes écoles\" system. Since the Bologna Process, the \"Diplôme d’Ingénieur\" is officially considered to be at the level of a European master's degree.\n\nAs of 2012 in Russia, following degrees correspond to the \"engineer's degree\" in the sense of this article:\nAnything but \"bachelor\" is considered \"second-level\" higher education and gives access to postgraduate education for \"candidate of sciences\" degree, \"bachelor\" is considered \"first-level\" higher education degree and gives access to study for master's (magister) degree.\n\nPost-graduate scientific degrees in engineering areas include кандидат технических наук - \"candidate of technical sciences\" and доктор технических наук - \"doctor of technical sciences\". Sometimes in English translations \"...of technical sciences\" is exchanged for \"...of engineering\".\n\nIn Pakistan, engineering qualifications include the following:\n\n\n\n\nPakistan Engineering Council (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession. PEC is a full signatory of Washington Accord and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).\n\nIn Turkey typical length of study for bachelor's degree at any engineering program is four years. Owner of a valid degree which is given by an engineering faculty at Turkish universities, can be called \"Mühendis\", meaning \"Engineers\". The \"Mühendis\" title is limited by law to people with a valid engineering degree, and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal. (Law No: 3458 \"Law about Engineers and Architects 28.06.1938\" Publish no:3945) A person may earn a master's degree in the same field as the bachelor's and be called as \"Yüksek Mühendis\" (meaning Higher Engineer).\n\nIn Bangladesh, the engineering degree is referred to as B.Sc. Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) at the undergraduate level. Likewise, a master's degree is referred to as Master of Engineering (M.Eng) and Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Engg). At the undergraduate level, the course takes four years whereas a master's degree usually takes 1.5 years. Graduated engineers who are members of Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh are legally and formally allowed to use 'Engr.' before their names.\n\nThe engineering courses in India are regulated and set up under the aegis of the University Grants Commission of India (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA).\n\nIn India, engineering qualifications include the following:\n\n\n\nIn Vietnam, The degree is \"Bằng kỹ sư\" (specialist kỹ sư), a first degree after five years of study. The Ministry of Education of Vietnam has also issued separate regulation for the naming of degrees not in accordance with international regulation. The Engineer's degree is named \"The Degree of Engineer\" in the degree (e.g. \"The Degree of Engineer in Information Technology\"). The degree of engineer is ranked at the same academic level as a bachelor's degree or master's degree, and is often known literally as an \"engineer diploma\" (abbreviated Dipl.-Ing. or DI).\n\n\n"}

Its goal is to further the study of Generative Grammar by organizing an annual Spring linguistics conference and periodical summer schools, and by publishing a newsletter that discusses current intellectual (and organizational) issues in the study of Generative Grammar.\n\nIt was founded in an attempt to provide an annual meeting for European researchers in Generative Grammar who felt themselves largely excluded from other organizations in the late 1970s. Its founding document, the so-called \"GLOW Manifesto\" authored by Jan Koster, Henk van Riemsdijk and Jean-Roger Vergnaud, declared that \"generative linguistics acquired a new momentum in Europe after Chomsky's [1973 paper] 'Conditions on transformations'\" and sought to reflect that momentum with a new organization. \n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, GLOW had emerged as one of the leading organizations in linguistics internationally, as well as in Europe. \"Sister conferences\" to the annual GLOW meeting in Europe have been organized under the rubric \"GLOW Asia\" in Japan, Korea and India, and the European GLOW conference itself has travelled as far south as Morocco (and as far north as Tromsø).

Egan primarily focuses on the work of Herbert Spencer, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget as the most influential sources of contemporary educational philosophy. Egan identifies this book in its introduction as being a companion to his previous work \"The Educated Mind\".\n\nKieran Egan states in his introduction: \"I want to make the case here that most of the beliefs most of the people hold about education today are wrong in fairly fundamental ways.\" According to Egan, Herbert Spencer was one of the key figures in proliferating the progressive foundations of education. These ideas were further championed by John Dewey and supported with research and writing by Jean Piaget. Egan's assertion is that these foundations are fundamentally flawed. The core tenets of progressivism he questions are: the idea that things (especially learning) always go from simple to complex, the notion that the matters of the mind can be treated like those of the biological body, and that all child-learning should occur as a child learns during play. He also questions the call for utilitarianism in education and the value of educational research. In this book, Egan provides examples and logic based arguments which counter these ideas.\n\nThe book has been criticized for not providing adequate solutions to the problems it identifies in education. Readers looking to hear the author's proposed solutions would be advised to read his other work, most notably \"The Educated Mind: How Cognitive Tools Shape Our Understanding\".\n\n"}

Madrasahs were established in the Andalusian cities of Córdoba, Seville, Toledo, Granada (Madrasah of Granada), Murcia, Almería, Valencia and Cádiz during the Caliphate of Córdoba.\n\nProblems of definition make it difficult to date the origins of universities. The first medieval European universities were simply groups of scholars, the word \"university\" being derived from the Latin \"universitas\", meaning \"corporation\". Nonetheless, the University of Palencia appears to have been the first high education institution in Spain, while the University of Salamanca (Universidad de Salamanca) is the oldest existing Spanish university. Founded in 1218, during a period of expansion that had begun in the 11th century, this University is considered to be one of the oldest in Western Europe. The university was founded as a \"General School of the kingdom\" by King Alfonso IX of León in 1218 so that the Leonese people could study at home without having to leave for Castile.\n\nThe reign of Ferdinand, King of Aragon, and Isabella I, Queen of Castile, saw a professionalisation of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (\"letrados\") who were university graduates (\"licenciados\"), of Salamanca, Valladolid and Alcalá de Henares. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the \"Consejo de Indias\" and \"Casa de Contratacion\", the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the Spanish Empire in the New World.\n\nMany of the medieval universities in Western Europe were born under the aegis of the Catholic Church, usually as cathedral schools or by papal bull as Studia Generali. In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.\n\nIn Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the \"trivium\"–the preparatory arts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic–and the \"quadrivium\": arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. (See degrees of Oxford University for the history of how the \"trivium\" and \"quadrivium\" developed in relation to degrees, especially in anglophone universities).\n\nSeveral of the world's oldest universities are located in Spain or were founded by Spanish scholars across the world at the time of the Spanish Empire.\n\nThe University of Salamanca, founded by King Alfonso IX of Leon in 1218 is the world's 8th oldest university. The oldest existing universities both in Asia (University of Santo Tomas) and the Americas (University of Santo Domingo) were founded by Spanish religious orders in the 16th century.\n\nThe creation of the Spanish Empire brought a significant expansion in royal positions for university-trained lawyer-bureaucrats who were not nobles and were dependent on and loyal to the crown. The multiple royal councils needed university-trained men, as did royal government in the Indies. These were men who had studied Roman Law. \"The law schools of universities were the training ground of the Crown's advisers.\" The first medieval European universities were simply groups of scholars, the word \"university\" being derived from the Latin \"universitas\", meaning \"corporation\". The University of Palencia appears to have been the first high education institution in Spain and the third in the world, after Bologna and Oxford, while the University of Salamanca is the oldest existing Spanish university. Founded in 1218, during a period of expansion that had begun in the 11th century, Salamanca is considered to be the third oldest in Western Europe. The university was founded as a \"General School of the kingdom\" by Alfonso IX in 1218 so that the Leonese people could study at home without having to leave for Castile.\n\nFrom the Imperial School to St. Bartholomew's College or Our Lady of Mount Zion, the Spanish set up a solid educational system as well as one of the first prominent fee-paying schools in Europe. Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, was one of the many English boarding schools founded by Spanish Jesuits under the Empire, and was originally established in the Spanish Netherlands in 1593. The aim of these schools was to provide English boys with a Roman Catholic education during the rule of Elizabeth I.\n\nHigh-ranking army men and senior administrators of the empire usually pursued a rigorous education for their sons in Spain. The aim was to continue producing future leaders to serve the Spanish Empire and its interests, often resulting in a well-developed final product of colonial governors. Most of these schools were established by Catholic orders such as the Jesuits, with the intention of emphasizing catholic values at heart, since the Catholic Church was arguably the greatest promoter of the Spanish Empire.\n\nAdmission to the Spanish university system is determined by the \"nota de corte\" (literally, \"cutoff grade\") that is achieved at the end of the two-year \"Bachillerato\", an optional course that students can take from the age of 16 when the period of obligatory secondary education (\"Educación Secundaria Obligatoria\", or ESO) comes to an end. A number between 1 and 10, the \"nota de corte\" is a combination of the grade achieved from the Bachillerato exams which the students take at school, and the average grade (\"nota de media\") obtained from the university selection exam (commonly known as \"la Selectividad\" but officially named \"Prueba de Acceso a la Universidad\" or PAU) that the students will take at the local university.\n\nThe most popular courses at public universities demand the highest \"nota de corte\", while for private universities cost is normally the factor that determines which course a student will follow (that is, the most popular courses are inevitably the most expensive).\n\nThere are several rankings for Spanish Universities. The best known ones are the Shanghai Jiao Tong, QS and THE Ranking. These are international rankings, however, there are also some national rankings comprising the \"50 carreras\" (50 degrees) from the \"El Mundo\" newspaper, the CSIC or the IAIF ranking of the UCM.\n\nSpain's Higher Educations system has been ranked top-5th by the Spanish CSIC only after the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nIt was published in 2009 and was said to be the best Spanish ranking ever. It was done by the Instituto de Análisis Industrial y Financiero (Industrial and Financial Analysis Institute) of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and ranked the 69 Spanish universities:\n\nIt is a well known ranking in Spain and it is published every year by the national newspaper \"El Mundo\".\n\nPublished annually since 2004, QS World University Rankings® is one of the most complete and trusted university ranking in the world.\n\nThe Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) is first published in June 2003 by the Center for World-Class Universities (CWCU), Graduate School of Education (formerly the Institute of Higher Education) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and updated on an annual basis. Despite its prestige, many people criticize them because they don't take into account the size of the universities for their rankings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17010030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17010030", "title": "History of Stonyhurst College", "text": "History of Stonyhurst College\n\nThe History of Stonyhurst College as a school dates back to 1593 when its antecedent, the Jesuit College at St Omer, was founded in Flanders to educate English Catholics. The history of the present school buildings dates as far back as 1200 AD.\n\nThe earliest Deed concerning the \"Stanihurst\" dates from 1200 AD and can now be found in the Arundell Library in the College, whilst the earliest evidence of a building on the site is from 1372 when John de Bayley was licensed to have an oratory there; the archway in the Bayley Room, within the 'Blind Tower', is believed to date from the fourteenth century, and may well be the only remnant of that earlier building. The oldest portion of the extant buildings however, the Shireburn Mansion (Stonyhurst Hall), was founded by the Roman Catholic, Richard Shireburn, a descendant of the Bayley family, whose son attended the College at St Omers. He built the gatehouse and open cupolas (known as \"the towers\") on top of an older settlement dating from 1592. The design of the gatehouse incorporates four of the Classical orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite). Three similar designs appear on Merton and Wadham Colleges and the Schools building in Oxford, though Stonyhurst's predates them all by more than a decade. In places the exterior walls of this part of the building are as much as six feet deep.\n\nDuring the Civil Wars, Oliver Cromwell's army encamped near the Hall on their way to the Battle of Preston in 1648. Cromwell spent the night at Stonyhurst and slept on a table in the middle of the Great Hall in full armour. He is said to have preferred this option to a bed because of fear of assassination and mistrust of his Catholic, royalist hosts. He was quoted as saying it was \"the best half house\" he had seen (the Hall was at that time still unfinished). \nRichard Shireburn's successor and grandson, Sir Nicholas Shireburn, began a massive building plan to extend the \"half house\", and completed the great hall, gardens and avenue so that it could be a great manor house. Two ponds, each measuring by were constructed in 1696, along with the \"causeway\" between, today known as the Avenue. His son Richard was poisoned in the gardens in 1702, and with no male heir Nicholas ceased building. Upon his death in 1717, the buildings passed to his wife and then to their sole heir, Mary, the Duchess of Norfolk. The Duchess was married to Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk, and lived in Arundel Castle in Sussex. Unoccupied, the buildings began to fall into disrepair. Eventually, the houses were inherited by her cousin, Thomas Weld in 1754. Already living in Lulworth Castle, and not needing an extra house, Thomas, an old boy of St Omers, donated it to the Society of Jesus, with of land, in 1794.\n\nThe original hall has been altered and extended over the years to become one of the largest inhabited buildings in Europe and achieving Grade I listed status from English Heritage.\n\nThe village of Hurst Green, Lancashire developed with the hall. Richard Shireburn built the village school in 1686. He also built an almshouse upon Longridge Fell, the predecessor of the Shireburn Almshouse, which his son Nicholas built c.1707. The latter was dismantled in 1946 and re-erected in the village.\n\nThe story of the school starts at St Omer in what was then the Spanish Low Countries in 1593, where a college was founded by Father Robert Parsons for English boys, unable to receive a Catholic education in Elizabethan England. As such it was one of a number of expatriate English schools operating on the European mainland during the centuries when Catholicism was proscribed in England. \n\nIn 1762, when the French \"Parlement\" turned against the Jesuits, the school, in what was then a part of France, was forced to move. During subsequent decades, when the Jesuit Order was suppressed in most countries, the college was one of the institutions through which it managed to maintain a continuous existence. \n\nAfter St Omer (still known in Stonyhurst parlance by its old English name of St. Omers), the college settled in Bruges where it continued until 1773 when it was again forced to move, reassembling at Liège, under the protection of its bishop. \n\nIn 1794 yet another move was forced upon the school, and a new home was found at Stonyhurst Hall in Lancashire, an ideal county for the school to settle in because it was still a Catholic stronghold and its rural, isolated character provided the hope that the school would be left alone by the authorities. Not taking any chances however, a number of hiding places were created throughout the building should the Jesuits face persecution again, and when Saint Mary's Hall was constructed in the following century, a secret escape tunnel, which still survives, was also built linking the seminary to an exit in the gardens.\n\nThe honour of being last student at Liege and the first at Stonyhurst was claimed by a George Lambert Clifford whose bust is today on display in the Do Room; it is recorded that he and fellow pupil from Liege, Charles Brooke were the first of the migrants to arrive at the Stonyhurst mansion and raced down the Avenue together, but whilst his antagonist was waiting to be let in, Clifford spotted an open window and darted in, to be remembered by posterity as Stonyhurst's first pupil.\n\nWhen Clifford and his fellow pupils of Liège first arrived at Stonyhurst Hall, the buildings were in an extremely bad state of disrepair, and a temporary structure was built next to the east wing to house the boys. This \"temporary\" building still exists, and is known as \"Shirk\". \n\nA number of other buildings were added in the early 19th century, including the new church of St Peter's, in the Gothic style of the chapel at King's College, Cambridge. \n\nBy the 1880s new building works began on the school, including removal of the \"grand stairs\" in the quad and subsequently the west wing. The temporary structures of 'Shirk' and the new west wing served the school well, but by late 19th century it needed to expand again and work was started on the south front, including the building of the Boys Chapel and the Academy Room. The south front took a considerable amount of time to build, because much of the land was swamp, resulting in the need for deeper foundations, which also created extra space. The work began in 1876 to replace the Old Playground front of 1809; the total cost of the construction (minus architect's fees) was £123,205.5s.6d. (less than the cost of refurbishing the dormitories in the same building 130 years later).\n\nStonyhurst was notable for its scientific activities, including the meteorological records of the Observatory (built in 1838). The school also prided itself on producing gentlemen philosophers: \"philosophers\" was the term used for students pursuing a course of education above secondary level at a time when Catholics were forbidden from attending Oxford or Cambridge both by English law and also by a Papal prohibition. Gas lighting was another early technological innovation at the school during this period, and the school had its own power station. \n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, the Stonyhurst went through a number of changes, partly reflecting those in the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council, but also attributable in part to the growing secular tone of British society. The number of Jesuit instructors fell steadily, reflecting the changed priorities of Catholic religious orders and the dwindling numbers of the English Jesuit province. These changes led to the closing of another Jesuit boys' public school, Beaumont College, in 1966; Beaumont and Stonyhurst amalgamated. With the addition of these new pupils, Stonyhurst had to expand again and the New Wing was built beside the wing erected in the 1800s to house the Arundell Library.\n\nThe former preparatory school to Beaumont College, St John's Beaumont continues to send a significant number of its leavers to Stonyhurst.\n\nAfter Fr Michael Bossy's fifteen-year headmastership, in 1986 the college acquired its first lay headmaster, Giles Mercer. Mercer brought in a number of changes during his time, and developed particular areas of the school. By the end of the 1980s, the school opened a new indoor swimming pool, new squash courts, a new gym and various refurbished classrooms and playrooms. Scenes from the film \"Three Men and a Little Lady\" were shot at the College.\n\nIn 1993, the school celebrated 400 years since its foundation at Saint-Omer, and in 1994 200 years since its foundation at Stonyhurst Hall. Mercer set up the Centenaries appeal to raise money for new building works, including the refurbishment of the science laboratories, the Bread rooms (now English department classrooms), the language classrooms, the Ambulacrum (sports hall) and numerous other areas. The appeal also went towards building the new Centenaries Theatre. As part of the celebrations a play written by Fr William Hewett SJ was performed at the new theatre outlining the history of Stonyhurst.\n\nAdrian Aylward succeeded Mercer in 1996, and the school continued to flourish during his ten-year leadership. In 1997, Stonyhurst began its run-up to becoming fully co-educational, and introduced girls to the preparatory school, St Mary's Hall. A building project was undertaken, such that by the time of Aylward's departure as headmaster refurbishment had taken place in the following areas of the school: the Old Infirmary (converted from girls' to Jesuit community accommodation), Lower Grammar, Grammar and Higher Line Playrooms, all dormitories (cubicles replaced by rooms on two storeys), the plunge (converted into dormitories and changing rooms on two storeys), the Sodality Chapel (restored), the Top Refectory, the Do Room, the Long Room, the Bayley Room, the More Library, the Syntax Wing and the shooting range. Five I.T. suites were created, CCTV was installed at all entrances, some disguised as Victorian lamp-posts, the back of the building outside the music basement was tidied up, and new landscaping and redesign of the road layout accompanied the building of the all-weather sports pitch on Harry Meadow. Classrooms were re-decorated and renamed after Saints associated with the school. At the same time, academic standards improved, with Oxbridge entry standing at around 10% in 2003. On a point of principle, Aylward withdrew Stonyhurst from academic league tables, claiming that they were of little relevance and devalued the worth of the individual. The Stonyhurst Access Appeal was set up in 2003 to widen access to the College to those from lower-income families and to generate funds for further redevelopment. Adrian Aylward also steered the school through a difficult investigation into claims of alleged child abuse said to have taken place in the 1970s. In 2005, after ten years, Aylward announced his resignation from June 2006. Andrew Johnson succeeded Aylward in September 2006.\n\nAs headmaster, Andrew Johnson has presided over continued alterations to the building. A new spiritual centre (the Emmaus Centre) has opened adjoining the Do Room, the Sodality Chapel has been re-dedicated, and most recently the Campion Room has been converted into a new study centre. The school has returned to the league tables as Johnson works to improve the school's academic standing. New procedures have been put in place to support and prepare Oxbridge applicants, and a new mentoring system established. Extra-curricular activities have been increased, particularly with a view to community-based work, such as the \"Arrupe Programme\". Johnson also inspired the renaming of Saint Mary's Hall to Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall, and is encouraging the prep school's doubling in size. Johnson is keen to transform Stonyhurst's academic performance as well as its standing, focusing on the quality of teaching, and moving the school towards greater academic selection.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Stonyhurst was a leading Jesuit centre. In 1794, it was the only Jesuit college in the country. From Stonyhurst, the Jesuits would travel to the Catholics in the surrounding towns to say Mass. Over time, churches were built for the Catholics in those places. The Jesuit priests from Stonyhurst built St Mary's Church in Clayton-le-Moors in 1810, St Ignatius Church, Preston in 1833, St Stephen's Church, Skipton in 1836, St Francis Xavier Church, Liverpool in 1840, the St Walburge's Preston in 1854, both Our Lady Immaculate and St Joseph Church, Prescot and Sacred Heart Church, Blackpool in 1857, Holy Cross Church, St Helens in 1860, St Joseph and St Francis Xavier Church, Richmond in 1866, Sacred Heart Church in Accrington in 1869 and Church of St Mary, Lowe House in 1924.\n\nFrom 1810 to 1873, the Jesuits served the Catholics in Clayton-le-Moors from St Mary's Church, until they handed over the administration of the church over to the Diocese of Salford who continue to serve the parish. \n\nThe Jesuits arrived in Accrington in 1852 to start a mission and dedicated the parish to Oswald of Northumbria. In 1869, a church was built on Blackburn Road and was dedicated to the Sacred Heart instead. On 5 August 1869 the church was opened by the first Bishop of Salford, William Turner. In 1931, the parish needed expansion and Our Lady's Chapel was built in Huncoat. In 1958, the Jesuits handed over the administration of the church to the Diocese of Salford. In June 2003, the church was closed. Later that year, it was damaged in a fire and then demolished.\n\n\n"}

Wyckoff is a U.S.-American education economist who currently serves as Curry Memorial Professor of Education and Public Policy at the University of Virginia, where he is also the Director of the Center for Education Policy and Workforce Competitiveness. His research on the impact of teacher compensation on teacher performance (together with Thomas Dee) has been awarded the Raymond Vernon Memorial Award of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management in 2015.\n\nJames Wyckoff earned a B.A. in economics from Denison University in 1974 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1982. After his graduation, he became an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oklahoma, Norman (1982-86) before moving to the University at Albany, SUNY in 1986, where he worked as assistant professor of public administration before being promoted to associate professor and then to full professor. Intermittedly, Wyckoff also served as chair of Albany's Department of Public Administration and Policy (1996-98) and as Acting Dean of its Graduate School of Public Affairs (1998-2000). Since 2008, Wyckoff has been a professor at the University of Virginia's Curry School of Education and Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, where he was honoured with the position of Curry Memorial Professor of Education in 2011. In 2010, he moreover became Director of EdPolicyWorks, also known as the Center on Education Policy and Workforce Competitiveness.\n\nIn terms of professional activities, Wyckoff is affiliated with the Association for Education Finance and Policy, whose president he was in 2004, and a member of the policy council of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management (2006-10), among else. Moreover, he sits on the editorial boards of the \"Journal of Policy Analysis and Management\", \"Educational Researcher\" and \"Education Finance and Policy\" and has done so in the past for the \"Economics of Education Review\".\n\nJames Wyckoff's research focuses on teacher labour markets, in particular on the preparation, recruitment, assessment and retention of teachers, within which he has frequently collaborated with Donald Boyd, Susanna Loeb and Hamilton Lankford. However, in the 1990s, Wyckoff has also performed research on e.g. school choice, finding (with Lankford) parents to trade-off between the relative quality of school offerings, the tuition of religious schools, the characteristics of other students in public and religious schools, and their family's socioeconomic characteristics.\n\nAnalysing the sorting of teachers by qualifications in New York with Lankford and Loeb, Wyckoff found that low-income, low-achieving and non-white students, especially in urban schools, are generally taught by the least skilled teachers, with salaries rarely leaning against and sometimes even contributing to this sorting. In further research with Boyd, they find teacher labour markets' spatial scope to be very small as teachers display strong preferences for proximity, which in turn makes it more difficult for urban schools to recruit new, well-qualified teachers. Overall, they attribute teacher sorting to a combination of more qualified teachers being more likely to leave schools with very low-performing students and schools with such students generally experiencing higher turnover than other schools, though high growth in student achievement can effectively act as a retention mechanism for effective teachers in low-achieving schools. In particular, effective teachers tend to leave low-achieving schools (but not high-achieving schools) within their second and third years at these schools, thereby likely contributing to the widening of the learning outcomes between students; by contrast, less effective teachers tend to leave both low- and high-performing schools within their first year. Importantly, they also find that the main driver behind teachers' turnover decisions in New York City is their (negative) perception of the school administration. The resulting teacher turnover evidently harms students' test scores in math and English language arts, especially in schools with many Black and low-performing students.\n\nHowever, narrowing the gap between the qualifications of teachers in high- and low-performing schools is possible; for example, the NYC Teaching Fellows and Teach for America initiatives were able to substantially reduce such a gap between New York City's low- and high-poverty schools over 2000-2005 by substituting uncertified teachers in high-pverty schools by academically qualified teachers. Further research by Wyckoff and his co-authors on teachers' preparation and recruitment has found that teachers with reduced pre-job coursework often provide smaller initial gains in both math and English language arts when compared to teachers who completed a university-based teacher education programme, though most differences disappear as the cohort matures and that teacher preparation programmes' vary in their impact on teachers' value added to student test score performance, with practice-based preparation being particularly effective for new teachers. However, in the past, Wyckoff has been cautious to call for specific policies regarding teacher certification and preparation, arguing that the verdict on their impact on teacher quality and student achievement was still out. Moreover, teachers who have the highest value-added to student test performance have distinctly different instructional practice profiles, e.g. consistently scoring better on Explicit Strategy Instruction. Finally, together with Thomas Dee, Wyckoff has also evaluated IMPACT, the high-powered teacher-evaluation system introduced by Michelle Rhee in Washington D.C., and found that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improved the performance of remaining teachers, while financial incentives were effective in further improving the performance of high-performing teachers.\n\n"}

KCSE has since been reviewed twice, and the minimum number of subjects is now seven. \n\nFor grading, candidates must take all the three compulsory subjects, at least two sciences, one humanities and at least one practical or technical subject (see table below).\n\nThe examination is taken over October and November, and the results are released in February the following year.\n\nThe KCSE examinations are taken under very strict supervision from invigilators to avoid cheating and run for a period of about one month. Cheating in these examinations attracts severe penalties from the Kenya National Examination Council, and students caught cheating get their grades cancelled. \n\nThe exams usually start on October 22 and end in late November. From December, the exam is graded and the results are released in late December the same year. \n\nExamination results are announced to the public by the Minister for Education, and the top hundred students and schools are released to the media the day of the results announcement. School rankings are divided into the top 100 private schools, public schools and provincial schools. \n\nThe grading of the examination is as thus:\nIn Kenya, this examination is the entrance to public and private universities and the pass mark is grade C+. Students who attain a lower mark than C+ join other tertiary institutions for non-degree courses. Over time, stringent measures have been taken by the government to ensure and sustain the credibility of the KCSE examination. However, there have been instances of breaches of these measures leading to examination vices such as leakage to some selected students who if undetected end up scoring high grades. In detected cases, such students have been punished by having their results cancelled and examination officials who participated in the cheating charged in a court of law.\n\nEach year, hundreds of thousands of students take the examination after four years of the Secondary School Course and this examination is a major determinant of the individual's future career. A good grade guarantees one a place in one of the public or private universities in the country.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "199779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199779", "title": "Konglish", "text": "Konglish\n\nKonglish (; ), more formally- Korean-style English (; ) is a style of English used by Korean speakers.\n\nKonglish has English loanwords that have been appropriated into Korean and are used in ways that are not readily understandable to native English speakers. A common example is the Korean term \"hand phone\" for the English \"mobile phone.\" Konglish also has direct English loanwords, mistranslations from English to Korean, or pseudo-English words coined in Japan that came to Korean usage.\n\nThe use of Konglish is widespread in South Korea as a result of U.S. cultural influence, but it is not familiar to North Koreans.\n\nThis list of Konglish terms generally contains Konglish terms not readily understandable to a native English speaker, similar to \"wasei-eigo\" terms in the Japanese language. Many Konglish terms were invented by Koreans through non-standard abbreviations or combinations of English words or by applying a new meaning or usage to a common English word.\n\nMany loanwords entered into Korean from Japan, especially during the Japanese forced occupation, when the teaching and speaking of Korean was prohibited. Those Konglish words are loanwords from, and thus similar to, Wasei-eigo used in Japan.\n\nA simple example would be how the meaning of the English word \"cunning\" changes when used in a Konglish sentence. In South Korea, \"keonning\" means cheating, as the loanword was adapted from Japanglish \"kanningu\" (), which means \"cheating\". Konglish words may or may not have a similar meaning to the original word when used, and a well-known brand name can become a generalized trademark and replace the general word: older Korean people tend to use the word \"babari\" (\"Burberry\") or \"babari-koteu\" (\"Burberry coat\"), which came from Japanese \"bābari-kōto\" (meaning \"gabardine raincoat\") to refer to all trench coats. Coates made by Burberry are called \"beobeori-koteu\" (), rather than \"babari-koteu\" in Korean (as the brand name, entered to Korean language directly from English, is \"Beobeori\").\n\nSome foreign-origin words such as \"areubaiteu\" (, , \"part-time\"), a loanword from German \"\" (, \"work\"), are sometimes mistakenly considered as Konglish and are corrected into \"accurate\" English loanword forms such as \"pateutaim\" (, ).\n\nA trend in the naming of apartment buildings in Seoul is blending English words together because developers believe this will enhance the luxury brand image of the properties. Some examples of apartment names with blended English words include: Luxtige, Blesstige, Tristige and Forestige, XI; these words are combinations of luxury, bless, prestige, trinity, forest, extra and intelligence.\n\nMisuse or corruption of the English language by Koreans learning English as a foreign language have also been referred to as Konglish. Using English words in daily conversation, advertising, and entertainment is seen as trendy and cool. However this use can often lead to misunderstandings due to problems with pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary. Modern use of Konglish has already created a linguistic divide between North Korea and South Korea. North Korean defectors can have trouble integrating into South Korean society because much of the Konglish used there is not used in North Korea. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings and delay in integration into the society. This is not the sole cause of the linguistic divide between the two nations as some Korean words are also used differently between the two countries. While Konglish problems exist between the North and South they also exist between the metropolitan and rural. Ahn Jung-hyo, a Korean-English translator who is the author of \"A False English Dictionary,\" was noted for saying that improper use of Konglish in other countries is likely to bring shame to Korea. However, John Huer, a columnist for Korea Times, noted Konglish usage as one of his \"10 Most Wonderful Things About Korea\". He felt that it was both inventive and clever. After that article Huer criticized Koreans for their bad English and improper use of loanwords, though. Modern Konglish usage could even be viewed as art, yet there is a difference between a cultural use of a word like \"Fighting!\" and the bad grammar and vocabulary seen on signs, packages, and TV around Korea. Sebastian Harrisan has suggested that calling these kinds of things Konglish masks the problem with English education in Korea. The Korean government has been criticized by civic groups for their use of Konglish in slogans and focusing too much on English education. They feel that the heavy focus on English will damage the Korean language and doesn't benefit international competitiveness. In contrast, Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn't trump getting the message across.\n\nThe spread of Konglish in the Korean language has been cited as a reason to increase Koreans' exposure to native English speakers, especially during their educational time. Koreans instructing others can lead to cementing errors into the language. Poor planning in the education system can result in unqualified Korean teachers being chosen to teach English with little or no time to prepare. These teachers end up using Konglish in the classroom. Even teachers who prepare may end up using official materials that contain numerous errors and Konglish. This can create a feeling of passiveness towards learning structurally and technically correct English. Students look to teachers as the example and if teachers are making mistakes, these are passed on to them. The issue of bad Konglish has been raised in relation to tourism. There is a concern that poor English on signs, brochures, websites, or in other media might cause tourists to find another destination. This is a concern not just in small or remote venues, but even major international locations like Incheon Airport. When the airport was first opened for business more than 49 signs were found to contain English errors. In addition to keeping away tourists, Konglish usage can lead to the breakdown of business deals. Misunderstandings might lead a foreign business partner to lose confidence in a Korean company. In 2010, a poll showed that 44% of local governments in South Korea used an English phrase in their marketing slogan. The slogans at the time included: Lucky Dongjak, Dynamic Busan, Yes Gumi, Colorful Daegu, Ulsan for You, Happy Suwon, New Start! Yesan, Super Pyeongtaek, Hi-Touch Gongju, Nice Jecheon and Just Sangju.\n\n\n"}

The course takes place at the School of Lanceros of Colombia in Tolemaida, Department of Tolima in Colombia.\nThe Colombian Army has been in a military conflict with rebel guerrillas since the 1960s. This has led the Colombian Government and its military forces to develop courses specifically aimed to the training of both soldiers and officers for this kind of warfare. The term Lancero was chosen as a way to honor a specific unit of fighters (Lanceros) that helped the army of Simón Bolívar in his conflict for the independence of Colombia. This unit showed special bravery and strength during the Vargas Swamp Battle.\n\nThe course was created as a result of the reform that took place inside the National Army of Colombia organization during the early 60s as a way to specialize and refocus the national army towards an irregular conflict with armed peasants in the mountains of Colombia. Inexperienced and with little knowledge of guerrilla warfare the Colombian Army sent its own officers to Fort Benning in Georgia, United States so they could take the Ranger Course that takes place there and as a way to apply their acquired knowledge in Colombia's specific situation.\n\nThe techniques learned in the American course were modified and taught to Sergeants, Lieutenants, Ensigns, Corporals and some enlisted and ranking officers of the Naval Infantry. This techniques were later spread across all the Colombian military components.\n\nIn 1959 the army created companies of Lanceros. These newly created companies were more agile and flexible thus, leading to more successful operations. They were added as supportive personnel for units where the enemy was even more aggressive and active.\n\nIn 1966 an outbreak of dispersed bandits called for the creation of even sharper and faster units. This year the Colombian Army's military command put into effect a more extensive training program to combat the rebels; this program would later become a single course called \"Contraguerrillas\"\n\nSince this time the Lancero course has focused on the training of Soldiers, Army Officers and even Police Officers for the needs of a country with an enemy that hides among the civilian population. After more than forty years the course has gained some notoriety among military personnel around the globe largely due to its focusing on guerrilla warfare and not on regular military warfare.\n\nThe term Lancero which can be translated as lancer has subsequently led to the use of the term Lanza (Lance) as a way to refer to a fellow soldier. In fact the course has emphasized on the importance of cooperative work between two soldiers as a way to accomplish goals (one being the Lanza or spear and the other one being the lancero or lance carrier). Thus, the terms Lanza and Lancero are both colloquial and honoring ways to call a fellow soldier or an officer.\n\n"}

It covers an area of 25 dunams and contains 950 varieties of plants, 40% of them wild. \nThe first botanical garden in the Land of Israel, it records all the wild plants of Israel and the Middle East. The garden is located in the northern part of the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem. Around the garden are many burial caves from the Second Temple period. In the western part of the garden is a small amphitheater. The garden is also a Ecological nature reserve and National park. It incorporates a Natural Teaching Center, the largest botanical library in Israel and a meteorological station. On the western side of the garden is trail walk named after the Israeli author Avigdor Hameiri. In the center of the trail, next to the main entrance, is a stone tablet inscribed with his famous song poem \"On the summit of Mount Scopus.\"\n\nThe garden was established in 1931 on the northern side of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus by Otto Warburg, who founded the university's Department of Botany together botanist Alexander Eig. It was the first botanical garden in the Land of Israel. The garden was a highlight of the scientific and educational work of botanist Alexander Eig who continued to teach at the university until his death. He planted the first tree in the garden. He established a program to protect the local flora. He collected plants in Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, brought seedlings from 350 Cedrus.\nThe garden was the first home of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The Mt. Scopus period lasted from 1947 to 1950. In 1948, when there was no food in Jerusalem, zookeepers had to hunt stray dogs near garbage dumps to feed the carnivorous animals, many of which perished. Non-dangerous species had to be released. In 1950, with UN help, the animals were moved down into the city by weekly convoys.\n\nThe garden had been neglected over 19 years, when the Mount Scopus campus was in an enclave under Israeli control surrounded by Jordan. Indeed in 1954 a new botanical garden was opened in western Jerusalem, near the Jewish National and University Library, on the new campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram. In 1958 two Israelis soldiers were killed in the garden by Jordanian ambush, also the \"United States Chairman of the Commission\" that came to mediate was killed in this incident.\n\nIn 1980, it was decided to renew the garden, which was inaugurated in 1988.\n\nThe garden is the first in the world to be recognized as an \"ecological garden,\" designed for nature conservation. Many of the species are very rare or non-existent in the wild. \n\nThe Cave of Nicanor is an ancient burial cave from the Second Temple period discovered in 1902. An inscription marked it as the grave of \"Nicanor\" who built the doors on the First Temple in Jerusalem. In 1934, the remains of Leon Pinsker from Odessa were reburied in the Nicanor cave at the initiative of Menachem Ussishkin, who envisaged a national pantheon on Mt. Scopus. However, the only other person buried there was Ussishkin himself, who died in 1941. A national leaders plot was established on Mount Herzl after the founding of the state in 1948, in part because Mount Scopus became an enclave in Jordanian-ruled territory.\n\n"}

{"id": "33945549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33945549", "title": "Pay-for-Performance (Federal Government)", "text": "Pay-for-Performance (Federal Government)\n\nPay-for-Performance (Federal Government) is a method of employee motivation meant to improve performance in the United States federal government by offering incentives such as salary increases, bonuses, and benefits. It is a similar concept to Merit Pay for public teachers and it follows basic models from Performance-related Pay in the private sector. According to recent studies, however, there are key differences in how pay-for-performance models influence federal employees in public service roles. James Perry is one scholar who has conducted such studies. His research reveals that public servants tend to be more intrinsically motivated, and thus, are prone to have a negative reaction to monetary incentives. There is still debate, however, on what exactly makes the public sector different.\n\nPay-for-performance programs first began in the private sector. As consultants, academic experts, and employee advocate groups analyzed merit pay systems' success in private businesses, they recommended expanding this method into the public sector. One vital omission in the process of implementation, however, is that the policy makers failed to consider that the stakeholders in the private sector differ from those in the public sector.\n\nThe first trial run of a pay-for-performance system came in the late 1970s. In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter introduced the broad outlines of the Civil Service Reform Act in his State of the Union message. It was the first time a U.S. President had ever included civil service reform among his major legislative proposals.\n\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created the Office of Personnel Management, to oversee the human resource management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse. The major provisions in the act included, but were not limited to, performance appraisals for all employees, merit pay on a variety of levels (but focusing on managerial levels), and modifications for dealing with poor performers. This merit pay system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service. Under the new act, employees only got half of their traditional automatic salary increase. The remaining non-automatic portion was divided up according to performance rating. A key part of this system was that it was revenue neutral—this meant that when some employees benefited under the new system, others would of necessity be receive less than in the previous system.\n\nThe greatest benefits of the Act were that it clarified job expectations and defined goals and objectives. The clearest shortcoming was that it failed to establish a “demonstrable relationship between pay and performance.” This failure had a number of causes—most notably a lack of adequate funding. Managers who performed satisfactorily often found themselves receiving less pay than their non-managerial counterparts because the non-managerial employees were still under the previous pay system. Some complained that this merit system seemed arbitrary and many employees did not perceive it as a fair assessment of performance and effort. Furthermore, the public became upset when they saw certain senior executives in the government receiving large paychecks. It became apparent that the Act was not an effective means of civic service reform.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan was elected in 1982, he significantly reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying the need for new legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that at least half of the board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.\n\nAlthough it was considered a significant improvement over its predecessor, PMRS only lasted from 1984 to 1991. The demise of PMRS was caused by poor discrimination among performance levels, inadequate performance findings, and little demonstrable evidence that the system improved performance. Over 50 percent of the employees felt like the size of the rewards was inadequate, and more than 75 percent of the managers stated that their performance evaluations provided little guidance for development purposes, mentioning that “insufficient funds [had] resulted in meaningless performance awards.”\n\nSince the PMRS was abandoned, various proposals have surfaced and even a few agencies have tried variations of pay-for-performance systems. The Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security have both developed systems, but they were annulled when President Barack Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act on October 28, 2009. There has yet to be a new pay-for-performance system implemented on a nationwide scale for the United States Federal Government.\n\nWhen these federal pay for performance systems failed, many were surprised because it had worked so well within the private sector. Much of this failure was attributed to the fact that most of the research on pay for performance had been done in the private rather than public sector. These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms.\n\nA limited and restricted budget is one of the biggest factors that have prevented the public sector from successfully implementing a pay for performance program. As noted by Antoinette Weibel, the private sector simply has more money and will always be more fluid with cash than any public sector organization. Profit motive will always matter in the private sector because a business organization's function is to maximize profits.\n\nSince public organizations operate on tax revenue, they are expected to act responsibly for that stewardship of resources. Public institutions also operate in nonmarket conditions and are subject to unique rules and expectations. This makes budgeting for incentives very difficult because unlike private sector businesses, public organizations cannot arrange their incentives around the company profit. By their very nature of receiving funds instead of generating them, public organizations can never have the same freedom that private organizations have in providing incentives in the work force.\n\nAs important as the budget differences are to the issue of pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, Edward L. Deci and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals. Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an \"interesting\" activity to perform. Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards. Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.\n\nEisenberger designed a study meant to refute Deci's claim. His results reported that “perceived competence partially mediated the positive relationship found between performance-contingent reward and intrinsic motivation.” In other words, the detrimental effects of providing tangible rewards, discussed in the Deci studies, occurred under highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions.\n\nAlthough a push for providing extrinsic motivation is still politically popular, research continues to lean toward the understanding of Deci and Perry—that the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector. Since those who work for government or non-profit organizations are more likely to be in the mindset of serving others, they tend to be motivated more intrinsically. They perform tasks because of loyalty or an internalized sense of duty, and/or enjoyment. Giving employees a performance-contingent monetary incentive to do something they already enjoy can decrease his/her motivation to do it as the person is then likely to view its action as externally driven rather than as internally appealing.\n\nWeibel contributed further to Perry and Deci's findings when she and her team examined the benefits and costs of an extrinsically motivated system, and compared this system in the public and the private sectors. This clearly defined scope allowed the pay-for-performance policies in each sector to be evaluated individually. The authors’ hypothesis was that the public sector has specific characteristics (the same as those diagnosed by Deci and Perry) that would make pay for performance ineffective, calling the proposed adoption for such policies “naïve.” \n\nResearch has continued to support the notion that although incentive systems may be effective and efficient in one organizational context, they can be ineffective or even counterproductive in others. Daniel Pink has been another persuasive voice who has drawn on many of these studies to call for new methods of motivation in the workplace. He cites an MIT study in which the research team repeatedly demonstrated that as long as the tasks being undertaken are purely mechanical, performance-related pay works to improve results. The moment a task required any cognitive skill, the incentives became detrimental to performance.\nOthers, such as Weibel, have also urged caution in implementing the pay-for-performance models of old. In the federal government, this is especially important because intrinsically motivated public service agents are shown to have a “higher incentive to invest in expert knowledge than extrinsically motivated ones and therefore function as the ‘institutional memory’ of public service.”\n\nTo preserve that institutional memory and continue to attract intrinsically motivated employees, the government will likely need alternative models to replace or supplement the popular business model of performance-related pay. Some have suggested an incentive plan that focuses on employees' internal motivation. Instead of cash bonuses or raises, employees may instead be given discretionary time to work on creative projects in which they have a personal interest, as has been implemented by companies such as Google and 3M. Another alternative to a strictly intrinsically based model may be a hybrid in which monetary rewards and intrinsic incentives are offered, giving the employees of both dispositions the motivation to increase performance. It is unclear what the next step of action will be for the federal government, but since the issue of pay for performance is so politically popular it is unlikely that the issue will go away any time soon.\n\nThe President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and Office of Budget and Management asked federal government agencies to maximize performance as well as reevaluate and restructure human capital. These agencies were also required to amend ineffective policies on performance management. The PMA recommended streamlining the system of compensating and rewarding federal employees. One way is move from the present General Schedule approach to a system that emphasizes performance-based wages. In the USA and many countries of Western Europe, pay for performance plans are used collectively. In Hong Kong, the popularity of pay for performance is increasing gradually both in the public and private sectors. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "383540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383540", "title": "Postdoctoral researcher", "text": "Postdoctoral researcher\n\nA postdoctoral researcher or postdoc is a person professionally conducting research after the completion of their doctoral studies (typically a PhD). The ultimate goal of a postdoctoral research position is to pursue additional research, training, or teaching in order to have better skills to pursue a career in academia, research, or any other fields. Postdocs often, but not always, have a temporary academic appointment, sometimes in preparation for an academic faculty position. They continue their studies or carry out research and further increase expertise in a specialist subject, including integrating a team and acquiring novel skills and research methods. Postdoctoral research is often considered essential while advancing the scholarly mission of the host institution; it is expected to produce relevant publications in peer-reviewed academic journals or conferences. In some countries, postdoctoral research may lead to further formal qualifications or certification, while in other countries it does not.\n\nPostdoctoral research may be funded through an appointment with a salary or an appointment with a stipend or sponsorship award. Appointments for such a research position may be called postdoctoral research fellow, postdoctoral research associate or postdoctoral research assistant. Depending on the type of appointment, postdoctoral researchers may work independently or under the supervision of a principal investigator. However, a designated postdoctoral research appointment may also be taken up when other suitable positions are not available, rather than merely pursuing the deepening of scholarly experience. In many English-speaking countries, postdoctoral researchers are colloquially referred to as \"postdocs\".\n\nDue to the nature of their work, and an over-supply of graduating PhD students in many fields, some postdoctoral researchers face an uncertain future in academia, and a large proportion will not gain tenure or a coveted faculty position in their chosen field of research.\n\nIn the United Kingdom in 2003, 25% of PhD graduates in the natural sciences continued to undertake postdoctoral research.\n\nSince the landmark ruling in the employment tribunal (Scotland) Ball vs Aberdeen University 2008 case (S/101486/08), researchers who have held successive fixed-term contracts for four years' service are no longer temporary employees but are entitled to open-ended contracts.\n\nIn the US, a postdoctoral scholar is an individual holding a doctoral degree who is engaged in mentored research or scholarly training for the purpose of acquiring the professional skills needed to pursue a career path of his or her choosing. Postdoctoral researchers play an important role in spearheading postgraduate research activity in the US. The median salary of postdoctoral researchers is $42,000 a year for up to 5 years after receiving their doctoral degrees—44% less than the $75,000 average for tenured positions. The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) is a member-driven organization that provides a voice for postdoctoral scholars in the United States.\n\nPostdoctoral research may be required for obtaining a tenure-track faculty position, especially at research-oriented institutions. Post-doctoral appointments that were traditionally optional have become mandatory in some fields as the degree of competition for tenure-track positions in academia has significantly increased over previous decades. In fact, the small supply of the professional positions in academia compared to the growing number of postdoctoral researchers makes it difficult to find tenure-track positions. In 2008, the proportion of postdoctoral researchers who got a tenure or tenure-track within 5 years after they received a doctoral degree was about 39%; nearly 10% of postdoctoral researchers were still waiting for tenure-track positions over 40 in 2003.\n\nOn the other hand, 85 percent of engineering doctoral degrees holder are likely to initially go into business or industry sector. Under the circumstances, providing doctoral students as well as postdoctoral researchers with necessary skills for nonacademic positions has become one of the important roles for graduate schools and institutions. The America COMPETES Act recognized the importance of graduate student support for obtaining skills needed when they pursue nonacademic careers, and required National Science Foundation (NSF) to increase or decrease funding for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) programs at least at the same rate as it increases or decreases funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship. There are no comprehensive data of international postdoctoral researchers in the US because of the less-organized survey and the difficulty in counting international postdoctoral researchers. The proportion of postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas reached 53.6% in 2010. The life sciences hold the largest percentage of postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas; in 2008, approximately 56% of postdoctoral researchers in the life sciences were temporary residents. Of these postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas, four out of five earned their PhD outside of the United States. There exists fear that foreign PhD's are taking postdoctoral research positions from American researchers. The influx of foreign PhD's has influenced the supply of ready-researchers, and thereby, the wages. One estimate claims that a 10% increase in the supply of foreign postdoctoral researchers lower the position salary by 3–4%.\n\nIn the US, life sciences have a greater share than other fields due to higher federal funding of life and medical science areas since mid 1990 . One survey shows that 54% of postdoctoral researchers major in life sciences, whereas those who majored in physical science, mathematics, and engineering account for 28%.\n\nIn 2010, postdoctoral researchers in California formed a union, UAW Local 5810 in order to secure better working conditions such as the right to file a complaint for alleged discrimination or sexual harassment through a formal grievance procedure. In California, new postdoctoral appointments receive at least the NIH postdoctoral minimum salary ($39,264 in 2011) and many receive annual pay raises of 5–7% or more in accordance with the NIH’s Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA).\n\nIn 2014, postdoctoral researchers in Boston organized the \"Future of Research\" Symposium to respond to a conversation about the state of biomedical research from the perspective of junior scientists. The meeting included panel discussions with academics concerned about the scientific enterprise, a video message from Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, and workshops discussing training, funding, the structure of the biomedical workforce, and metrics and incentives in science which were used to generate recommendations in a white paper. Meetings organized by postdoctoral researchers in 2015 spread to New York University (NYU), Chicago and San Francisco and a second meeting in Boston discussed data collection, labor economics and evidence-based policy to advocate for changes to science, including the future of the PhD.\n\nMost of India's premier engineering, science and management institutes (like Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)) have postdoctoral positions. The salary typically varies from INR 40,000 – 70,000 per month. For example, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, IISER Mohali, IISER Pune, IISER Kolkata, IIM Kolkata offer postdoctoral fellowships.\n\nSalaried appointments at the minimum Level A, Step 6 for academic salaries, for doctoral qualified employees (beginning in 2008) are set at A$75,612 p.a. at the University of Sydney, A$75,404 p.a. at the University of Melbourne, and A$75,612 p.a. at the University of New South Wales.\n\nAlternatively the Australian Research Council (ARC) provides Postdoctoral Fellowships. For example, their Discovery Projects, funds 3 year Fellowships, beginning in 2009, with A$61,399 p.a. Furthermore, a mandatory superannuation payment of 11–17% is paid by Universities.\n\nThe postdoctoral system in China was founded in 1985 upon suggestion by Chinese American physicist and Nobel laureate Tsung-Dao Lee. The Office of the National Administrative Committee of Postdoctoral Researchers () regulates all postdoctoral mobile stations () at universities and postdoctoral work stations () at institutes and enterprises in mainland China. Applicants to postdoctoral positions have to pass a detailed medical check-up in order to enter the stations (). Postdoctoral researchers are required to undergo regular evaluations, and submit a research report for evaluation at the end of the postdoctoral period to obtain approval to leave the stations (). Those who are approved to leave the stations will receive a postdoctoral certificate from the national administration office. In some universities, postdoctoral researchers who fail to leave their stations normally, either due to failing their evaluations or early withdrawal from the stations (), may be asked to pay back the grants or even the salaries that they have received. Because of the way that the postdoctoral system is managed, postdoctoral research is widely mistaken to be an academic degree in China. Also, the government's administration of the postdoctoral system is blasted for hindering innovative research, as too much effort is spent on evaluations, and overemphasis on performance prevents the creation of a relaxing research environment.\n\n"}

{"id": "22773078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22773078", "title": "Russefeiring", "text": "Russefeiring\n\nThe russefeiring () is a traditional celebration for Norwegian upper secondary school (high school/prep school) pupils in their final spring semester. Pupils that take part in the celebrations are known as russ. The russefeiring traditionally starts on around 20 April (With some starting earlier/later depending on the regional county) and ends on 17 May, the Norwegian Constitution day. Participants wear coloured overalls (Usually red, blue, or black). Some make groups, name a bus, car or van (Often making a name or logo). Some also decide to celebrate almost continually during this period. Some of the Russ that buy a bus, van or car party in this bus the entire night until school every day from the start to 17 May. Drunkenness and public disturbances are regularly linked to the celebration.\n\nThe modern Norwegian \"russefeiring\" dates back to 1905, when the red \"russ\" caps (russelue) were introduced to graduation celebrations as a sign of the imminent acceptance into the system of higher education. The caps were initially only used by boys, and were inspired by German students, who in 1904 wore red caps when they visited Norway. In 1916, blue caps were introduced at the Oslo Commerce School, a prestigious high school specializing in economics, in order to separate them from the common graduates. Later, celebrations were gradually extended, similarly coloured overalls (russedress) were added, and the caps were saved for the final day of celebrations.\n\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Nobel Prize laureate in literature, attempted to convey the spirit of the russ-celebration in the poem \"Jeg velger meg April\" (\"I choose April\"). The russ have figured in a number of poems and song lyrics, especially those from the early 20th century.\n\nAs time passed, students graduating from vocational courses were allowed to participate in the celebrations, and additional overall and cap colours were gradually introduced by some of the vocational graduates. The celebrations then became a general celebration of the end of upper secondary school (videregående skole).\n\nIn Norway, most pupils turn 18 just before the russefeiring. The age of 18 is both the age limit for buying alcohol and acquiring a driver's license. Therefore, the growing festivities also led to increased alcohol consumption, and in the '70s the tradition of buying old cars, vans, buses and even lorries and painting them in the same colours as the overalls became common.\n\nThese cars would be extensively decorated, and serve as mobile homes and party venues for the russ during the russefeiring. They would be outfitted with tables, chairs, bunk beds, sound and lighting systems, and melodic horns. These vehicles were named \"russebiler\" (russ cars). Over the '80s it became fairly common to rip the cargo beds off lorries and build log cabins on the frames instead. However, due to safety issues this practice was banned during the early '90s. Also regulations were introduced that required every russ vehicle to have a designated non-russ driver. This, together with the no-tolerance policy on alcohol consumption by drivers introduced in the late 90s, greatly reduced the number of accidents involving russ vehicles.\n\nRuss cars and buses would gather for impromptu partying on school grounds, parking lots, beaches and other suitable places. Sometimes up to several hundreds of cars and buses would gather in one place. Eventually, these events became organized by commercial interests, who then also took over responsibility for the security of the participants. Still russ gather their vehicles for impromptu partying, but in smaller numbers.\n\nBy the early 2000s authorities were once again worried about impact of the partying and alcohol consumption during the russefeiring. In an attempt to reduce the extent of the celebrations, some of the final exams in public schools were moved to early may. Traditionally, these had all been taking place in late May and early June. The idea was that forcing the pupils to prepare for exams instead of partying would reduce the extent of the problem. This had no noticeable effect, however, and resistance from pupils' organizations moved the exams back, with the argument that the only effect was to have pupils sacrifice grades for partying.\n\nThe festivities start anytime between 11 April and May 1 (different dates for each city). On this date, russ are allowed to put on their overalls, board their vehicles, and officially become russ. From then on celebrations continue almost non-stop until 17 May (the national day). On this day the russ are awarded their caps, and participate in the traditional 17 May parades. In the meantime, there are a number of smaller and bigger events for russ to participate in. The dates of the biggest parties are usually the 1st where the students are 'christened' with personalized russ names which are written on their caps, and 16 May, which is the second biggest party night, as these two dates are followed by national holidays (May day and Norwegian Constitution Day).\n\nRussefeiring is a long-standing tradition and a major cultural phenomenon in Norway. Apart from being a celebration of the imminent end of 12 or 13 years of compulsory schooling, it has also become a rite of passage into adulthood, and a farewell to classmates from the videregående skole (upper secondary school) who will now go their separate ways in search for jobs or higher education. It is therefore an important period in the lives of most Norwegian adolescents.\n\nIn the period, there are several russetreff, translated \"russ meeting\". At these events ten thousands of russ meet in an allocated area for one or more days. There are concerts, bus competitions in several circles (bus with the best sound systems, best lighting systems, best design, bus of the year and \"Lord of the Rings\"), and the sale of beer and food.\n\nWhile russefeiring is optional, there are few pupils who do not participate in any way, although the extent of involvement varies individually. However, there are pupils who, due to personal or religious reasons, do not consume alcohol, and therefore object to the nature of many of the celebrations, which contribute to its image as the \"treukersfylla\" (\"the three-week binge\"). These pupils do not partake in common festivities to the same degree that other russ do and sometimes create their own events such as the \"kristenruss\" (\"christian russ\"), do.\n\nThere are several different types of \"russ\" differing in the colour of the caps and traditional uniforms most students carry during the entire \"russ\" period. The colour of the uniforms usually reflects what type of study the person is completing (see below). However, in some regions such as Stavanger, the colour is determined by the school. Typically in these areas, if the headmaster of the school was a blue russ, the students will also be blue regardless of what they are studying (vocational students will still usually be black russ).\n\n\nIt is common to appoint a russpresident, a party coordinator, a newspaper editor, some journalists, a contraceptive responsible person and some other funny titles to some russ.\n\nThe russepresident is responsible for about everything with the russ and to give an interview to a local newspaper and hold a speech on Constitution Day. The party coordinator organizes parties with different themes (for instance \"What are you going to be when you're fully educated?\", \"bad taste\" and \"halloween\"). The newspaper editor and the journalists make a russenewspaper. The contraceptive responsible gets some thousand condoms from the Red Cross to pass out to the russ (The Red Cross decided to give away condoms for free to russ because of the massive increase in Chlamydia, Herpes and Gonorrhea after May one year).\n\nStåkuka translates roughly to 'noisy week'. Ståkuka is the last week in April where there are different themes to dress up to. There is a different theme for each day and the typical themes are:\n\n\nOn army day it is very common for different schools or different coloured russ to \"attack\" each other with water balloons and water guns. Often younger students are taken hostage and dipped in water.\n\nThis is typically frowned upon by teachers and cleaning staff as windows tend to be broken and hallways tend to be soaking wet.\n\nThe russ knots () on the string of the russ' cap are a wide variety of rewards signaling that the student has fulfilled a certain accomplishment during the russ period. They can be simple knots or tokens attached to the string. Lists of assignments and associated knots are publicized each year by russ committees at schools and communities. The knot often consists of an item representing the accomplishment. For instance, passing through the back seat of a car stopping on a red light (inspired by the television advertisement for the sweet \"Mentos\"), earns them a piece of wrapping from the sweet. The \"russ knot list\" was first introduced in the 1940s.\n\nThe knot rules are sometimes criticized because they can involve illegal acts, such as public nudity or public sexual intercourse, outright assault and possibly self-harming actions such as consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short span of time (earning a beer cap or wine cork). Other more benign tasks exist, such as putting a \"for sale\" sign on a police car, or spending the night at a teacher's house and making him/her breakfast in the morning, all without being noticed. Counting both national and local lists, there can be hundreds of different tasks that can be performed to gain knots, with huge varieties between districts and individual schools. Due to criticism in media, many of the russ knots are removed and replaced by other knots every year to decrease its severe impact on the students. Some of the previous knots have been physically dangerous when it involves drinking 24 bottles of beer within 24 hours, or place half a box of snus under ones lip for a certain period of time. This can lead to alcohol poisoning and severe brain damage.\n\nA few russ knot examples:\n\nIt is common for every school to have about 100 knots. If a russ does 50 or 70 of them he or she can choose to do three extra embarrassing or hard knots to become an eliteruss.\n\nA few eliteruss knot examples:\n\n\nIn the older days russ often traveled around in an open lorry, either used as-is or with a self-made log cabin added to the cargo area. Today, groups of russ commonly go together to buy a \"russ\" van. In eastern Norway, such as the capital Oslo, the posh suburb of Bærum, and other surrounding cities and areas, russ often choose to have a full-scale bus. Russ vans are typically 15- to 20-year-old Volkswagen Caravelles or Chevy Vans. The vehicle is painted in their respective \"russ\" colour, either by having it professionally sprayed or with regular wall paint. Decals and other decorations are common.\n\nRuss vehicles bought cheap have a reputation for being in terrible technical condition. Inexperienced and intoxicated drivers, and in some cases even highly flammable alcohol spills, have contributed to fatal traffic accidents and fires in these vehicles. The Norwegian police take part in a concerted effort to improve the situation. Russ who acquire a bus are required by law to hire a professional bus driver for the duration of the celebration, while van drivers might be an older sibling, friend, or a \"russ\" who chooses to abstain from alcohol.\n\nIn the \"russ\" vehicle, modern tradition requires a powerful audio equipment inside the vehicle, and on buses also on the roof (the largest systems allowed have forty speaker boxes which can generate over sixty thousand watts and be among the best sound systems in the world, rivaling those used by famous artists on concert tours). Some buses have had over 60 speaker boxes. Other accessories include sweaters and caps with the group's chosen logo and a bus song or slogan. It is also common to have some sort of theme for the interior and name/concept. Many buses have expensive theme interior, sometimes a bar, and plenty of flat-screens. A party light system is also common in buses.\n\nThese buses can be a large financial burden; contributions of up to $30,000 per member have occurred. In some cases, the teenager's parents invest most of the money needed for the buses. However, the average is between $2000 and $6000 per member. Including sponsors, the cost of a bus can reach over . ()\n\nWhile some are willing to spend very high sums of money during the russ festivities, mostly on the van/bus but also on clothes, effects, parties (there are special happenings for russ all over the country) and alcohol, most aim to buy a cheap van together with a group of friends. An old van can be passed on to the next generation of russ several times before it is discarded.\n\nIt is customary to spend substantial amounts of time working on the vehicle, finding a concept, refurbishing the inside, painting the outside and applying for funding during the weeks (and sometimes years) before the festivities start. Logos of sponsors are written onto the vehicle together with other decorations. Some undertake major rebuilds of the interior, like building a bar counter or beds within the bus. It is not uncommon to start planning the bus several years before the celebration. Everything in the russ celebration is taken care of by the russ themselves, except the bigger events. In these events one will find shops where they sell alcohol and food, international artist performing and the most important, \"russekåringen\" (lit. \"The Russ Awards\"), where they designate the different buses as the winner of either the best theme, interior design, sound system, light system, best live-bus, and the most prestigious; the bus of the year.\n\nMost \"russ\" have personalized calling cards featuring their name, their photograph and a short slogan. These cards are swapped with other \"russ\" and handed out to children and family members. To many children, collecting \"russ\" cards is an important activity during the entire russ period, but especially May, culminating on May 17.\n\nTo finance some of the administrative costs, many high schools create \"russ\" newspapers containing fake news, a column written by the \"russ\" president, official knot rules for the specific school, and other content, mostly humorous. The most important feature of a \"russ\" newspaper, however, is a section that presents every class and every student with a photograph and a personalized biography, typically written by friends in a jocular and satirical style. The class may also write a similar entry on their main teacher; the teacher, in turn, writes about their class.\nThe Russ' newspaper is written and published by Russ' executive board (Russens Hovedstyre).\n\n\n\n"}

The main attractions are frequently large animals from Sub-Saharan Africa such as giraffes, lions, rhinoceros, elephants, hippopotamus, zebras, ostriches, and antelope.\n\nA safari park is larger than a zoo and smaller than a game reserve. For example, African Lion Safari in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada is . For comparison, Lake Nakuru in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya, is , and a typical large game reserve is Tsavo East, also in Kenya, which encompasses .\n\nSafari parks often have other associated tourist attractions: golf courses, carnival rides, cafes/restaurants, ridable miniature railways, and gift shops.\n\nThe predecessor of safari parks is Africa U.S.A. Park (1953–1961) in Florida.\n\nThe first lion drive-through opened in 1963 in Tama Zoological Park in Tokyo. In double-glazed buses, visitors made a tour through a one-hectare enclosure with twelve African lions.\n\nThe first drive-through safari park outside of Africa opened in 1966 at Longleat in Wiltshire, England. Longleat, Windsor, Woburn and arguably the whole concept of safari parks were the brainchild of Jimmy Chipperfield (1912–1990), former co-director of Chipperfield's Circus, although a similar concept is explored as a plot device in Angus Wilson's \"The Old Men at the Zoo\" which was published five years before Chipperfield set up Longleat. Longleat's Marquess of Bath agreed to Chipperfield's proposition to fence off of his vast Wiltshire estate to house 50 lions.\nKnowsley, the Earl of Derby's estate outside Liverpool, and the Duke of Bedford's Woburn estate in Bedfordshire both established their own safari parks with Chiperfield's partnership.\nAnother circus family, the Smart Brothers, joined the safari park business by opening a park at Windsor for visitors from London. The former Windsor Safari Park was in Berkshire, England, but closed in 1992 and has since been made into a Legoland. \nThere is also Chipperfield's \"Scotland Safari Park\" established on Baronet Sir John Muir's estate at Blair Drummond near Stirling, and the American-run \"West Midland Safari and Leisure Park\" near Birmingham.\nOne park along with Jimmy Chipperfield at Lambton Castle in the North East England has closed.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1974, Lion Country Safari, Inc. opened 6 animal parks, one near each of the following American cities: West Palm Beach, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Grand Prairie, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Richmond, Virginia. The first park, in South Florida, is the only Lion Country Safari still in operation.\n\nBurgers' Zoo at Arnhem, Netherlands, opened a \"safari park\" in 1968 within a traditional zoo. In 1995, Burgers' Safari modified this to a walking safari with a board walk. Another safari park in the Netherlands is Safaripark Beekse Bergen.\n\nMost safari parks were established in a short period of ten years, between 1966 and 1975.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His death was a landmark incident in the anti-ragging movement of Sri Lankan universities which provoked many students and academic staff of universities to act against ragging.\n\nOn 7 November 2002, the anti-ragging campaigners sat down for a discussion with the pro-rag JVP controlled student council - \"General Students Union of University of Sri Jayawardanepura\" (Progressive Front), who defended the practice. The meeting took place at the premises of Department of Marketing Management. Midway through the discussion, a mob of around 200 JVP supporters armed with clubs and stones stormed into the room and viciously attacked Vithanage and others in the anti-ragging camp. The attackers stabbed their victims with shards of glass and Vithanage who was struck, fell to the floor.

In the United States, such a building may be called a student union, student commons, union or student center. The term \"student union\" refers most often in the United States to a building, while in other nations a \"students' union\" is the student government. Nevertheless, the Association of College Unions International (largely US-based) has several hundred campus organizational members in the US; there is no sharp dichotomy in interpretation of \"union\" in this context. The US usage in reference to a location is simply a shortened form of student union building.\n\nThe first student union in America was Houston Hall, at the University of Pennsylvania, which opened January 2, 1896 and remains in operation to this day. The first Ohio Union at Ohio State University was Enarson Hall. The building opened in 1911 and was the first student union to be built at a state university and the fourth of its kind in the United States. Oklahoma State University's student center opened in 1950. Subsequent additions, and renovations in 2010, have made the building one of the largest student activity centers in the world at .\n\nSome student centers carry unique origins and historical significance with some on the National Register of Historic Places. The William Pitt Union was originally constructed in 1898 as a hotel and was converted into a student center in 1956. Some student activity centers on the NRHP include O'Hara Student Center (University of Pittsburgh), McKenny Hall (Eastern Michigan University), and the Tivoli Student Union. The Tivoli Student Union was originally home to the Trevoli Brewing Company but since has been converted to serve several institutions in Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn 2007, the University of Vermont's student center became the first LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. \n\nOther examples of student centers include West Virginia University's Mountainlair, the J. Wayne Reitz Union at the University of Florida, the Bronco Student Center at Cal Poly Pomona, the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and the Price Center at UC San Diego.\n\nBroadly speaking, the facility is devoted to student recreation and socialization. A student center or student union is the community center of the college, serving students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests. A student activity center might offer a variety of programs, activities, services, and facilities. \n\nIt may contain lounges, wellness centers, dining facilities or vendors, and entertainment venues. The student center is often the center of student affairs and activities and may house the offices of the student government or other student groups. It may also act as a small conference center, with its meeting rooms rented out to student groups and local organizations holding conferences or competitions. An example of this for instance is the Michigan Union, which hosts the University of Michigan Model United Nations conference. \n\nDepending on the school and its location it might have unique amenities such as a bowling alley, cultural or prayer rooms and unique services. At Eastern Michigan University Student Center the building offers a kiva, a round, 360-degree room patterned after spaces used in Native American cultures. The Kiva Room at EMU is used as a meeting space, for collaboration, or for musical purposes. In the Ohio State University-Ohio Union, the student union offers an interfaith prayer room which has feet washing area for Muslim students. The University of Central Florida has an eyewear and optometric consumer service location.\n\n"}
{"id": "44349584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44349584", "title": "Subgoal labeling", "text": "Subgoal labeling\n\nSubgoal labeling is giving a name to a group of steps, in a step-by-step description of a process, to explain how the group of steps achieve a related subgoal. This concept is used in the fields of cognitive science and educational psychology.\n\nLower-level steps of a worked example are grouped into a meaningful unit and labeled. This labeling helps learners identify the structural information from incidental information. Learning subgoals can reduce cognitive load when problem solving because the learner has fewer possible problem-solving steps to focus. Subgoal-labeled worked examples might provide learners with mental model frameworks. In a recent study, Learners who were given labels for subgoals used those labels when explaining how they solved a problem, suggesting that's how they mentally organized the information.\n\nGenerally problem solving adopts a very procedural approach. Problem solving in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) has been highly procedural. The best approach so far is to teach these procedures through instructional text accompanied by specific worked examples. The role of instructional text is to define and describe the problem solving procedures whereas how to apply these procedures is shown through worked examples. Students can learn from step-by-step approach of worked examples which later can be helpful to them in solving similar problems on their own. Novices, however, often find it difficult to distinguish domain specific information and the information specific to solving that problem, which increases their cognitive load. This cognitive load can be reduced by use of subgoal labeling which is achieved by grouping functionally-similar steps under a label that describes that function. This approach can be helpful to students to form a mental model of the domain related problem which later can guide them to solve different problems in that domain. Understanding the structure of worked example can help students identify the similarities between different problems thus encouraging self-explanation and learning.\n\nSubgoal labels have been used in worked examples to teach learners to solve problems in STEM domains Pairing subgoal labeled instructional text with subgoal labeled worked examples can further improve learners performance in problem solving in a computer-based learning environment (e.g. online learning) without personal interaction with an instructor. Subgoal labels can be used in different important areas such as teaching and learning novel problem solving, in training teachers to teach technical subjects (e.g. teaching computer programming), multi agent programming, professional development, online learning and other types of lifelong learning (e.g. Subgoal labeled instruction material helped novices to program in App Inventor for Android).\n\n"}

It was the third oldest university (after the Cracow Academy and the Albertina) in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the aftermath of the Third Partition of Poland (1795) and the November Uprising (1830–1831), the university was closed down and suspended its operation until 1919. In the aftermath of World War I the university saw failed attempts to restart it by Lithuania (December 1918) and invading Soviet forces (March 1919). It finally resumed operations as Stefan Batory University in Poland (August 1919), a period followed by another Soviet occupation in 1920, and the less than two-years of the Republic of Central Lithuania, incorporated into Poland in 1922.\n\nFollowing Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the university was briefly administered by the Lithuanian authorities (from October 1939), and then after Soviet annexation of Lithuania (June 1940), punctuated by a period of German occupation after German invasion of the Soviet Union (1941–1944), administrated as Vilnius State University by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.

After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it resumed its status as one of the prominent universities in Lithuania.\n\nThe wide-ranging Vilnius University ensemble represents all major architectural styles that predominated in Lithuania: Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism.\n\nThe university has been known by many names during its history. Due to its long history of Jewish, Polish and Russian influence or rule, the city portion of its name is rendered as Vilna (Latin), Wilna (German) or Wilno (Polish), in addition to Lithuanian Vilnius (see History of Vilnius).\n\n\nIn 1568, the Lithuanian nobility asked the Jesuits to create an institution of higher learning either in Vilnius or Kaunas. The following year Walerian Protasewicz, the bishop of Vilnius, purchased several buildings in the city center and established the Vilnian Academy (Almae Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu). Initially, the academy had three divisions: humanities, philosophy, and theology. The curriculum at the college and later at the academy was taught in Latin. At the beginning of the 17th century there are records about special groups that taught Lithuanian-speaking students Latin, most probably using Konstantinas Sirvydas' compiled dictionary. The first students were enrolled into the Academy in 1570. A library at the college was established in the same year, and Sigismund II Augustus donated 2500 books to the new college. In its first year of existence the college enrolled 160 students.\n\nOn April 1, 1579, Stefan Batory King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, upgraded the academy and granted it equal status with the Kraków Academy, creating the Alma Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu. His edict was approved by Pope Gregory XIII's bull of October 30, 1579. The first rector of the Academy was Piotr Skarga. He invited many scientists from various parts of Europe and expanded the library, with the sponsorship of many notable persons: Sigismund II Augustus, Bishop Walerian Protasewicz, and Kazimierz Lew Sapieha. Lithuanians at the time comprised about one third of the students (in 1568 there were circa 700 students), others were Germans, Poles, Swedes, and even Hungarians.\n\nIn 1575, Duke Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł and Elżbieta Ogińska sponsored a printing house for the academy, one of the first in the region. The printing house issued books in Latin and Polish and the first surviving book in Lithuanian printed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was in 1595. It was \"Kathechismas, arba Mokslas kiekvienam krikščioniui privalus\" authored by Mikalojus Daukša.\n\nThe academy's growth continued until the 17th century. The following era, known as The Deluge, led to a dramatic drop in the number of students who matriculated and in the quality of its programs. In the middle of the 18th century, education authorities tried to restore the academy. This led to the foundation of the first observatory in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (the fourth such professional facility in Europe), in 1753, by Tomasz Żebrowski. The Commission of National Education (), the world's first ministry of education, took control of the academy in 1773, and transformed it into a modern University. The language of instruction (as everywhere in the commonwealth's higher education institutions) changed from Latin to Polish. Thanks to the rector of the academy, Marcin Poczobutt-Odlanicki, the academy was granted the status of \"Principal School\" () in 1783. The commission, the secular authority governing the academy after the dissolution of the Jesuit order, drew up a new statute. The school was named Academia et Universitas Vilnensis.\n\nAfter the Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Vilnius was annexed by the Russian Empire. However, the Commission of National Education retained control over the academy until 1803, when Tsar Alexander I of Russia accepted the new statute and renamed it The Imperial University of Vilna (Императорскiй Виленскiй Университетъ). The institution was granted the rights to the administration of all education facilities in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Among the notable personae were the curator (governor) Adam Jerzy Czartoryski and rector Jan Śniadecki.\n\nThe university flourished. It used Polish as the instructional language, although Russian was added to the curriculum. It became known for its studies of Belarusian and Lithuanian culture. By 1823, it was one of the largest in Europe; the student population exceeded that of the Oxford University. A number of students, among them poet Adam Mickiewicz, were arrested in 1823 for conspiracy against the tsar (membership in Filomaci). In 1832, after the November Uprising, the university was closed by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nTwo of the faculties were turned into separate schools: the Medical and Surgical Academy (\"Akademia Medyko-Chirurgiczna\") and the Roman Catholic Academy (\"Rzymsko-Katolicka Akademia Duchowna\"). But soon they were closed as well with Medical and Surgical Academy transformed into Medical faculty of University of Kiev (now Bogomolets National Medical University), and latter one being transformed into Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy (after the October Revolution of 1917 moved to Poland where it became Catholic University of Lublin). The repression that followed the failed uprising included banning the Polish and Lithuanian languages; all education in those languages was halted.\n\nLithuania declared its independence in February 1918. The university, with the rest of Vilnius and Lithuania, was opened three times between 1918 and 1919. The Lithuanian National Council re-established it in December 1918, with classes to start on January 1, 1919. An invasion by the Red Army interrupted this plan. A Lithuanian communist, Vincas Kapsukas-Mickevičius, then sponsored a plan to re-open it as \"Labor University\" in March 1919 in the short-lived Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (later, Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic), but the city was taken by Poland in April 1919. Marshall Józef Piłsudski reopened it as Stefan Batory University (\"Uniwersytet Stefana Batorego\") on August 28, 1919. The city would fall to the Soviets again in 1920, who transferred it to the Lithuanian state after their defeat in the battle of Warsaw. Finally, in the aftermath of the Żeligowski's Mutiny and Republic of Central Lithuania general election, 1922, the Vilnius Region was subsequently annexed by Poland. In response to the dispute over the region, many Lithuanian scholars moved to Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, the interwar capital.\n\nThe university quickly recovered and gained international prestige, largely because of the presence of notable scientists such as Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Marian Zdziechowski, and Henryk Niewodniczański. Among the students of the university at that time was future Nobel prize winner Czesław Miłosz. The university grew quickly, thanks to government grants and private donations. Its library contained 600,000 volumes, including historic and cartographic items which are still in its possession.\n\nIn 1938 the university had:\n\nThe university's international students included 212 Russians, 94 Belarusians, 85 Lithuanians, 28 Ukrainians and 13 Germans. Anti-Semitism increased during the 1930s and a system of ghetto benches, in which Jewish students were required to sit in separate areas, was instituted at the university. Violence erupted; the university was closed for two weeks during January 1937. In February Jewish students were denied entrance to its grounds. The faculty was then authorized to decide on an individual basis whether the segregation should be observed in their classrooms and expel those students who would not comply. 54 Jewish students were expelled but were allowed to return the next day under a compromise in which in addition to Jewish students, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and \"Polish democratic\" students were to be seated separately. Rector of the university, Władysław Marian Jakowicki, resigned his position in protest over the introduction of the ghetto benches.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland the university continued its operations. The city was soon occupied by the Soviet Union. Most of the professors returned after the hostilities ended, and the faculties reopened on October 1, 1939. On October 28, Vilnius was transferred to Lithuania which considered the previous eighteen years as an occupation by Poland of its capital. The university was closed on December 15, 1939 by the authorities of the Republic of Lithuania. All the faculty, staff, and its approximately 3,000 students dismissed. Students were ordered to leave the dormitories; 600 ended in a refugee camp. Professors had to leave their university flats. Following the Lithuanization policies, in its place a new university, named Vilniaus universitetas, was created. Its faculty came from the Kaunas University. The new charter specified that Vilnius University was to be governed according to the statute of the Vytautas Magnus University of Kaunas, and that Lithuanian language programs and faculties would be established. Lithuanian was named as the official language of the university. A new academic term started on 22 January; only 13 of the new students had former Polish citizenship.\n\nPolish Law and Social Sciences, Humanities, Medical, Theological, Mathematical-Life sciences faculties continued to work underground with lectures and exams held in private flats until 1944. Polish professors who took part in the underground courses included Iwo Jaworski, Kazimierz Petrusewicz and Bronisław Wróblewski. The diplomas of the underground universities were accepted by many Polish universities after the war. Soon after the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, while some Polish professors were allowed to resume teaching, many others (along with some Lithuanian professors) who were deemed \"reactionary\" were arrested and sent to prisons and gulags in Russia and Kazakhstan. Between September 1939 and July 1941, the Soviets arrested and deported nineteen Polish faculty and ex-faculty of the University of Stefan Batory, of who nine perished: Professors Stanisław Cywinski, Władysław Marian Jakowicki, Jan Kempisty, Józef Marcinkiewicz, Tadeusz Kolaczyński, Piotr Oficjalski, Włodzimierz Godłowski, Konstanty Pietkiewicz, and Konstanty Sokol-Sokolowski, the last five victims of the Katyn massacre.\n\nThe city was occupied by Germany in 1941, and all institutions of higher education for Poles were closed. From 1940 until September 1944, under Lithuanian professor and activist Mykolas Biržiška, the University of Vilnius was open for Lithuanian students under supervision of the German occupation authorities. In 1944, many of Polish students took part in Operation Ostra Brama. The majority of them were later arrested by the NKVD and suffered repressions from their participation in the Armia Krajowa resistance.\n\nEducated Poles were transferred to People's Republic of Poland after World War II under the guidance of State Repatriation Office. As the result many of former students and professors of Stefan Batory joined universities in Poland. To keep contact with each other, the professors decided to transfer whole faculties. After 1945, most of the mathematicians, humanists and biologists joined the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, while a number of the medical faculty formed the core of the newly founded Medical University of Gdańsk. The Toruń university is often considered to be the successor to the Polish traditions of the Stefan Batory University.\n\nIn 1955 the University was named after Vincas Kapsukas. After it had been awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1971 and the Order of Friendship of Peoples in 1979, its full name until 1990 was Vilnius Order of the Red Banner of Labour and Order of Friendship of Peoples V. Kapsukas State University. Though restrained by the Soviet system, Vilnius University grew and gained significance and developed its own, Lithuanian identity. Vilnius University began to free itself from Soviet ideology in 1988, thanks to the policy of glasnost.\n\nOn March 11, 1990, Lithuania declared independence, and the university regained autonomy. Since 1991, Vilnius University has been a signatory to the Magna Charta of the European Universities. It is a member of the European University Association (EUA) and the Conference of Baltic University Rectors.\n\nIn modern times, the university still offers studies with an internationally recognized content. There are 3 Bachelor and 16 Master study programs in English.\n\nAs of 10 October 2017, there were 19768 students attending Vilnius University.\n\nThe current rector is Professor Artūras Žukauskas.\n\nThe university, specifically the courtyard, was featured in the American TV series \"The Amazing Race 12\".\n\n\n\nThe old campus of Vilnius University consists of 13 buildings and 13 courtyards. At present the Rector's Office, the Library, the Faculties of Philology, Philosophy, and History are situated there. The largest courtyards are: \n\nFaculties of Physics, Economy, Law, and Communication, as well as Business School, Life Sciences Center, and Scholarly Communication and Information Centre are located in Saulėtekis district.\n\nVilnius University is ranked 401-410 among World top universities by 2018 QS World University Rankings. In 2017 QS WU Rankings by Subject, Vilnius University is ranked 201-250 in Linguistics and 251-300 in Physics and Astronomy. In QS rankings of Emerging Europe and Central Asia, Vilnius University is ranked 21.\n\nVilnius University is ranked 601-800 in the world and 291 in Europe by Times Higher Education World University Rankings.\n\nRecent and ongoing projects at Vilnius University include:\n\n\nVilnius University has signed more than 130 bilateral cooperation agreements with universities in 41 countries.\nUnder Erasmus+ programme the university has over 800 agreements with 430 European and 55 agreements with partner country universities for the academic exchanges.\n\nUniversity students actively participate in such exchange programmes as ERASMUS+, ERASMUS MUNDUS, ISEP, AEN-MAUI and CREPUQ\n\nThe University is a signatory of the Magna Charta of European universities and a member of the International Association of Universities, European University Association, the Conference of Baltic University Rectors, the Utrecht Network, UNICA Network, and the Baltic Sea Region University Network. In addition, Vilnius University has been invited to join the Coimbra Group, a network of prestigious European universities, from 1 January 2016.\n\nInstitute of International Relations and Political Science, Vilnius University or IIRPS, VU () () is a branch of the university which prepares political science and international relations specialists and carries out policy research. This is one of the most prominent social science institutions in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic sea region.\n\nIIRPS prepares three degree programs: Bachelor of Political Science, six graduate (master's degree) programs - European Studies, Comparative Politics, International Relations and Diplomacy, Public Policy Analysis, Politics and Media and Eastern European and Russian Studies (the latter is taught in English), and also postgraduate studies. Currently there are more than 750 students studying in IIRPS. As of 2015, 1830 students have defended BA and 1072 masters students have defended their MAs as well, while 51 students defended political science PhD dissertations.\n\nThe director of the Institute since June 10, 2009 has been professor Ramūnas Vilpišauskas.\nThe Institute of International Relations and Political Science (IIRPS) of Vilnius University was established on 7 February 1992 by the agreement between Vilnius University and the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania. It became the first political science research institution in independent Lithuania. Having commenced its activities with a two-year programme in international relations, at present IIRPS VU is a faculty-level core academic unit of Vilnius University, wherein studies in political science on all three levels (bachelor, master and PhD) and scientific research are conducted.\n\nWhile first focusing mostly on educating the future members of the Lithuanian diplomatic corps, the Institute has gradually enlarged its program to include subjects relevant to public administration, non-governmental and private institutions.\n\nThe first director of the Institute was lawyer, former judge of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania, professor Egidijus Kūris. Kūris held this position from 1992 to 1999.\n\nFrom 1999 to June 2009, professor Raimundas Lopata served as the director of the Institute. Lopata is the member of European Humanities University International Relations Master's program advisory council, the Association President of Republic of Lithuania and the Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian Federation, the editor of magazine \"Political Science\", a board member of the journal \"Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review\", Deputy Editor of Lithuanian Political Science Association Board.\n\nCurrent director of the IIRPS is professor Ramūnas Vilpišauskas, who was reelected in 2014. Ramūnas was formerly a President of the Lithuanian Political Science Association (2003-2004), a member of the Board of the Open Society Foundation (2002-2004), a member of the European Union Studies Association (EUSA, USA).

A member of the Lithuanian Progress Council (since 2010) and the „Sunset“ Commission (since 2009).\nUndergraduate studies\n\nInstitute of International Relations and Political Science offers a bachelor's program, which aims to provide general knowledge in political sciences. Political science - broad social science discipline that combines sociology, economics, philosophy and other disciplines elements that deals with society, the state and its domestic and foreign policy. Here the wide variety of methods are applied.\n\nMaster\n\nEastern European and Russian (EERS) Studies\n\nAt the Institute of International Relations and Political Studies six master programs are being taught. The Eastern European and Russian studies are being taught in English. \nEastern and Central Europe (EERS) is one of the most dynamic regions in the world having undergone significant transformation. It is not uncommon for developments in the region to influence behavior of some global actors, such as EU, US and Russia, which on their behalf have a significant role in shaping reality throughout most of the Eastern and Central Europe. EERS Studies include a 1.5-year long programme which provides knowledge and skills enabling to conduct independent analysis and evaluation of developments in EERS countries and in the region as a whole. Students acquire knowledge about domestic policies of the Eastern European states and Russia: their historic development, political and economic systems, and decision making mechanisms. Furthermore, students analyse foreign policies of above-mentioned states: the processes of interstate cooperation and the specifics of foreign policy. They choose the elective courses on the relevant problems in the regions.\n\nDoctoral Studies\nPolitical Science PhD program. This is the highest political science study cycle which prepared doctors in political science, developing the political science in Lithuania. Political Science doctoral include: doctoral studies, baseline studies and preparation of the dissertation. Since 1992, 51 students were awarded the PhD degree at the Institute (June 2015).\n\nThe structure of the institute is composed of 3 departments and 3 centres, namely:\n\nIn cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Military Academy and other partners, IIRPS conducts research in the area of domestic policy, governance, international relations, foreign policy and diplomacy of both Lithuania and other countries.

The essay, giving various pieces of advice on how to live a happier life and avoid common frustrations, spread massively via viral email, often erroneously described as a commencement speech given by author Kurt Vonnegut at MIT.\n\nThe essay became the basis for a successful spoken word song released in 1999 by Baz Luhrmann, \"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\", also known as \"The Sunscreen Song\". The song inspired numerous parodies.\n\nMary Schmich's column \"Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young\" was published in the \"Chicago Tribune\" on June 1, 1997. In the column's introduction Schmich presents the essay as the commencement speech she would give if she were asked to give one.\n\nIn the speech she insistently recommends the wearing of sunscreen, and dispenses other advice and warnings which are intended to help people live a happier life and avoid common frustrations. She later explained that the initial inspiration for what advice to offer came from seeing a young woman sunbathing, and hoping that she was wearing sunscreen, unlike what she herself did at that age.\n\nThe essay soon became the subject of an urban legend which claimed it was an MIT commencement speech given by author Kurt Vonnegut. In reality, MIT's commencement speaker in 1997 was Kofi Annan and Vonnegut had never been a commencement speaker there. Despite a follow-up article by Schmich on August 3, 1997, the story became so widespread that Vonnegut's lawyer began receiving requests to reprint the speech. Vonnegut commented that he would have been proud had the words been his.\n\nSchmich published a short gift book adaptation of the essay, \"Wear Sunscreen: A Primer for Real Life\", in 1998. A tenth anniversary edition was published in 2008.\n\nThe essay was used in its entirety by Australian film director Baz Luhrmann on his 1998 album \"Something for Everybody\", as \"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\". It was released in some territories in 1997, with the speech (including its opening words, \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '97\") completely intact. This version appeared in the Triple J Hottest 100 of that year at number 16 in the countdown, and was released on the subsequent CD in early 1998.\n\nAlso known as \"The Sunscreen Song\", it sampled Luhrmann's remixed version of the song \"Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)\" by Rozalla, and opened with the words, \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '99\" (instead of \"'97\", as in the original column). It was later released as a single in 1999.\n\nLuhrmann explained that Anton Monsted, Josh Abrahams, and he were working on the remix when Monsted received an email with the supposed Vonnegut speech. They decided to use it but were doubtful of getting through to Vonnegut for permission before their deadline, which was only one or two days away. While searching the Internet for contact information they came upon the \"Sunscreen\" authorship controversy and discovered that Schmich was the actual author. They emailed her and, with her permission, recorded the song the next day.\n\nThe song features a spoken-word track set over a mellow backing track. The \"Wear Sunscreen\" speech is narrated by Australian voice actor Lee Perry. The backing is the choral version of \"Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)\", a 1991 song by Rozalla, used in Luhrmann's film \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\". The chorus, also from \"Everybody's Free\", is sung by Quindon Tarver.\n\nThe song was a top ten hit across Europe, but largely obscure in the US until Aaron Scofield, a producer in Phoenix, Arizona, edited the original 12\" version into a segment of a syndicated radio show called \"Modern Mix\". This show played on many stations in the United States. In Portland, Oregon—where \"Modern Mix\" played on KNRK—listeners began requesting the track. KNRK program director Mark Hamilton edited the song for time and began playing it regularly. He distributed the song to other program directors that he networked with and the song exploded in the US.\n\nThe song reached number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay in the United States; by the time it was released as a commercial single in the country, radio airplay had declined significantly, and only managed to peak at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at number one in the United Kingdom and Ireland, partly due to a media campaign by Radio One DJ Chris Moyles.\n\nThere are four versions of the song: the original 7:09 minute mix from the album \"Baz Luhrmann Presents: Something for Everybody\"; a 1999 single release which features a 5:05 minute edit that lacks both choruses; \"Geographic's Factor 15+ Mix\" that runs for 4:42 minutes; and a \"2007 Mix\" of the original 7:09 minute version released on the 10th Anniversary Edition of the \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\" soundtrack on which the opening words are changed to \"Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2007\".\n\nThere are two videos for the song: one which uses the 1999 5:05 minute single edit of the song (the version in which Quindon Tarver is not featured), directed and animated by Bill Barminski; and another using the 7:09 minute edit made by the Brazilian advertising agency DM9DDB.\n\nThe song also appeared in Germany and was soon followed by a German version with the title \"Sonnencreme\". The German translation is narrated by the German actor Dieter Brandecker. A Brazilian version is narrated in Portuguese by Pedro Bial, and a Swedish version is narrated by Rikard Wolff. A Russian adaptation of the song, recorded live by Silver Rain Radio, was performed by Alex Dubas and Yolka.\n\nOn August 10, 2008 the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 72.\n\nCD-Maxi Capitol 8871762 (EMI) / EAN 0724388717625 \n\nThis version was released as a remix to Baz Luhrmann's 1999 version. The remix was written by Mau Kilauea and dubbed as a \"Tropical Remix\" because of the choice of instrumentation. The song was posted to Soundcloud on Mau Kilauea's page and reposted by Spinnin' Records. The song became a first hit for Mau Kilauea.\n\nThe Baz Luhrmann song version inspired numerous parodies. John Safran released a song entitled \"Not the Sunscreen Song\" which peaked at #20 in Australia.\n\nAmerican comedian Chris Rock enjoyed great success with his spoken word song \"No Sex (In the Champagne Room)\" which was in turn parodied on \"Mad TV\" as \"Ain't No Blacks on the TV Screen\" in the style of Rock's stand-up. The song was also parodied in an episode of \"Disney's House of Mouse\" performed by Jiminy Cricket. The comedy group Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie also made a parody entitled \"The Sunscreen Marketing Board\". Jegsy Dodd and the Original Sinners' version, \"Grumpy Old Men\", was voted favourite track of 2005 by BBC Radio 1 listeners in their annual Festive 50 poll.\n\nAngelos Epithemiou's live tour included a parody of the song titled \"Don't Muck About\".\n\nA parody entitled \"Mow Against The Grain\" appears on the \"King of the Hill\" soundtrack album.\n\nAnother parody by comedian Simmi Areff was played on South African radio station East Coast Radio at the conclusion of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAnother parody was created in 1999 by London Capital Radio Breakfast Show host Chris Tarrant, who created a version called \"wear slippers\" which consisted of him reading an alternative version of the sunscreen lyrics and demonstrated his disdain for Baz Luhrmann's version.\n\n"}
