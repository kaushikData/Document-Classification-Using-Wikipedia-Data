Its purpose is to promote the art of film animation in a variety of ways, including its own archive and an annual awards presentation, the Annie Awards. It is also known as the International Animated Film Society.\n\nMany branches of ASIFA exist throughout the world; in the US there are chapters in San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Washington, the Detroit area, and others, while internationally, organizations exist in Annecy, France, in Italy, and Japan. ASIFA also sponsors several animation film festivals throughout the world, including the ASIFA-Hollywood Student Animation Festival.\n\nASIFA-Hollywood has the largest membership internationally of all other chapters, largely because the most popular cartoons ever produced were by studios and animation professionals located in the city of Burbank, which is also the location of the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Center. It includes a virtual archive, museum, library and research facility, containing the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive Project.\n\nASIFA-Hollywood was founded in 1957, by Bill Scott, Stephen Bosustow, Ward Kimball, William T. Hurtz, Les Goldman, and Bill Littlejohn, and later chartered by UNESCO in 1960. June Foray was another early member, and recalled that she joined \"a year or so\" after the organization was chartered.\n\nToday, its board of directors includes Jerry Beck (President), David Derks (Vice-President), Sue Shakespeare (Second Vice-President), Brooke Keesling (Third Vice-President), Jeff Wike (Treasurer), Bill Turner (Secretary), Paul Husband (General Counsel), Jamie Kezlarian Bolio, Jeannette Bonds, Tom Caulfield, Dori Littell-Herrick, Jennifer Klein, Bob Kurtz, Aubry Mintz, Tom Sito, Charles Solomon, Theresa Wiseman, Danny Young and Frank Gladstone (Executive Director), \n\nSince 1972, ASIFA-Hollywood has hosted an annual awards ceremony to honor individuals who have made significant contributions to the art of animation. Originally designed to honor the lifetime achievements of veterans of the field, the Annie Awards now recognizes the year’s best animated productions and individual achievements in the field of animation. Qualified members participate in the nomination process and final voting. \n\nPrior to 1950, motion pictures were printed on unstable, flammable nitrate film stock that decomposed over time, placing many early animated films in danger of being lost forever. Through the Animation Preservation Project, ASIFA-Hollywood seeks out to save endangered cartoons, and raises funds to preserve them on safety film stock and digital film.\n"}

Currently, it is only available for Mathematics and offered by the exam board Edexcel. \n\nThey were introduced in 2002, in response to the UK Government's \"Excellence in Cities\" report, as a successor to the S-level examination – and aimed at the top 10% of students in A Level tests. They are assessed completely by external examinations. \n\nDue to introduction of the A* grade for A Level courses starting September 2008 (first certification 2010), they have since been phased out, with the exception of the Advanced Extension Award in Mathematics which continues to be available to students.\n\nIn 2008, the BBC reported that 32% of entrants in the AEA English gained a Distinction (approximately 776 students), with 34.1% gaining a Merit, and 33.9% not passing. \n\nAccording to EducationGuardian.co.uk, in 2004, 50.4% of the 7246 entrants failed to achieve a grade at all (fail), indicating that the awards are fulfilling their role in separating the elite. Only 18.3% of students attained the top of the two grades available, the Distinction, with the next 31.3% of students receiving the grade of Merit. Given the fact that only the top students in the country sat these examinations, these results indicate that the AEAs were successful at rewarding only the 50-100 students that were most able in a particular subject.\n\nIt was possible to obtain an AEA distinction in more than one subject; however given the rarity of AEA distinctions, this was uncommon.\n\nDue to the small numbers of candidates for each subject, the exam boards divided the subjects offered amongst themselves - so unlike for A-Levels, each AEA was only offered by one board.\n\nThe last AEA examinations across the full range of subjects took place in June 2009 with results issued in August 2009. After this time the Advanced Extension Award was withdrawn for all subjects except Mathematics. This came after the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) decided that the new A* grade being offered at A level will overlap with the purpose of the AEA, thus rendering them unnecessary. However, the AEA in Mathematics was extended until June 2012, as confirmed by Edexcel and the QCA. This was because it met a \"definite need\", meaning the A* grade was still not viewed as being challenging enough. On 2 June 2011 Edexcel announced that the AEA was being extended yet further for Mathematics, until June 2015. It has been extended further up to 2018.\n\n\n"}

In this context, the arts can include Performing arts education (dance, drama, music), literature and poetry, storytelling, Visual arts education in film, craft, design, digital arts, media and photography. It is distinguished from art education by being not so much about teaching art, but focused on:\n\n\nThe European Union has funded the ARTinED (a new approach to education using the arts) project to integrate the arts into every primary school subject ARTinED.\n\nThe European Commission has funded the ART4rom, a project based on the practice of the arts in school and non school environments. The aim of the project is to foster intercultural dialogue, mutual understanding and social inclusion for Roma and non-Roma children aged between 5 and 10.\n\nThe various models of education theory are predicated on Pedagogy while almost entirely ignoring the fact that most art schools are directly involved in the teaching of adults. This blind spot means that the pedagological model of learning is unsuitable for institutions that are intended to focus on androgogy which is term used specifically in relation to the teaching of adult learners.\n\n\"As the repression builds, art comes to be regarded as 'time off for good behaviour' or as 'therapy'\" and how the ease and carefreeness of the arts are supposed to bring joy and a sense of calmness.\" It is used to destroy the monotony of a regular school day, put a dent in the relentlessness of arithmetic and reading. Art should be seen as means of therapy, never something made to cause unrelenting stress and difficulty. If a student becomes less tense and wired up from stress in their learning environments, then they will raise up their grades in other classes, such as maths, English, or science. To give off a relaxed vibe, putting art on the wall tends to provide a calming environment that produces a sense of peace and serenity. Arts-related activities are important for so much more than just keeping your child busy or relaxed. They’ve been proven to boost a child’s self-image. The self esteem, confidence and pride that comes from art in education is truly incredible and each child should be able to experience that. \n\nIn places like the United States, arts education is not as valued. However, some national reforms like the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires that arts education, visual and performing, be considered core subjects as they have been proven by many tests to work. Through these requirements schools gain the funds to implement subjects and supplementary items, like books and calculators, that students may need to be successful. Schools can also gain funds by participating in national and regional standardized tests, these tests however, only test students on their ability to perform high in subjects such as math, literacy, and science. Art courses aid student's ability to perform high in these subjects as they challenge a student's brain. Tests like the Mozart effect, the effect that learning and listening to classical music have on the brain, gives students the ability to learn, reduce stress, and positively change sleeping patterns more easily.\n\nArt programs within education has its importance in not only expanding the mind but keeping kids off the streets and out of the correctional system. Studies show that students with art programs are three times more likely to graduate than those who don't. Art programs give kids somewhere to express themselves if they don't have the support to do that at home, it also gets kid to think creatively and inventively, expanding a kids way of thinking in general. Kids that had access to art programs or afterschool programs had better grades, it allowed them to improve their overall skills in school. All of these things are ways that kids keep from getting \"bored\" in school and getting in with the wrong crowd. Keeping art programs in schools is an important way to keep our kids safe and smart.\nProfessor P Vijayakumar, Chairperson,Centre for Social and Organisational Leadership (C SOL) at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai,India uses art as a teaching tool extensively in the Organisation Development and Change course for masters students states \"Art facilitates reflection. Reflective practice needs to be an integral part of any management education\"\n\n"}

The university provides both undergraduate and graduate education to approximately 7.500 students at a wide range of fields including engineering, basic sciences, literature and theology. The university has got Research Gate's total impact point of 1716.47 from 61 publications, according to the latest statistics.\n\nAzarbaijan University was founded in 1987 in Tabriz as a branch of Tehran's Tarbiat Moallem (teacher education) University. The initial objective of the university was to train teachers in different area for the fulfillment of Iranian government educational development policies and the major concern of the university was focused on training teachers for high schools and technical schools. On 1988 Azarbaijan University became an independent university under the title \"Tabriz University of Tarbiat Moallem\" and later \"Azarbaijan University of Tarbiat Moallem\". In 2012, due to changing of Iranian educational policies, the university turned to a general educational university under the title \"Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University\". The name \"Shahid Madani\" comes from an Iranian cleric from Azarshahr who became a martyr in the early years of Islamic Revolution.\n\nRecently, the university is expanding fast and it is planning to be one of the prominent educational and research centers in Iran.

CGA-Canada established the designation's certification requirements and professional standards, offers professional development, conducts research and advocacy, and represents CGAs nationally and internationally. CGA-Canada is working with the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. CPA Canada is the new national accounting body formed by the merger of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) and the Society of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) in 2013.\n\nIn October 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 CGA-Canada was named one of \"Canada's Top 100 Employers\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., CGA-Canada has also been named one of \"BC's Top Employers\" and one of \"Canada's Greenest Employers\".\n\nThe national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.\n\nAuditing rights are regulated by provincial governments. In Prince Edward Island, only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act. In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.\n\n\nHistorically Quebec and Ontario only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.\n\nIn August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.\n\nOn November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility, allowing CGAs to practice anywhere in Canada.\n\nIn November 2008, Dr. Catherine Boivie was appointed to the Board of Directors as the Public Representative. Based in British Columbia, Dr. Boivie is the chief executive officer of Inventure Solutions and senior vice-president of information technology (IT) and facilities at Vancity, Canada's largest credit union.\n\nIn October 2013, CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation Chartered Professional Accountant. This followed most provincial CGA bodies ratifying the unification of the accounting profession in Canada.\n\nCGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.\n\nThe knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.\n\nThe complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.\n\nA CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experiences, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.\n\nBefore issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.\n\nCGA is recognized in 170+ countries through their partnership with ACCA.\n\nCGA-Canada has been providing online professional accounting education. Via the Internet, students can complete their studies using a system that integrates text material, study guides, video and audio tools, discussion forums, group case study and project work, web research and email.\n\nIntroduced in 2011, Professional Experience Required for Certification (PERC) is the national reporting process for students in the CGA program. With PERC, students can document their experiences online and submit it annually.\n\nIn addition to its own online program of studies, CGA-Canada has also developed online degree partnerships with several Canadian universities.\n\nCGA-Canada develops research and supports positions with a view to influence social policy, regulation and standards-setting.\n\nThis initiative has resulted in the following research items. \n\n\nIn December 2006, CGA-Canada and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) announced a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) to take effect on 1 January 2007. This agreement was renewed in 2011.\n\nIn April 2008, CGA-Canada and CPA Australia entered into a MRA to extend the global reach of both organizations into new continents. \n\nIn June 2009, CGA-Canada and CPA Ireland entered into a mutual recognition agreement. The MRA establishes a strategic partnership between the two leading accounting organizations and gives members the opportunity to qualify for another designation. \n\nIn June 2010, CGA-Canada and the Ordre des Experts-Comptables, France's foremost accounting organization, have entered into a MRA. Under this accord, CGAs and members of the CSOEC can be considered for membership by the other body. \n\nThe association is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).\n\nCGA-Canada is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean and is a member of the International Federation of Francophone Accountants (FIDEF).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43089", "title": "Discovery Institute", "text": "Discovery Institute\n\nThe Discovery Institute (DI) is a politically conservative non-profit think tank based in Seattle, Washington, that advocates the pseudoscientific concept of intelligent design (ID). Its \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign aims to permit teaching of anti-evolution, intelligent-design beliefs in United States public high school science courses in place of accepted scientific theories, positing that a scientific controversy exists over these subjects.\n\nThe Institute was founded in 1990 as a non-profit educational foundation and think tank. It was founded as a branch of the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis-based conservative think tank, and is named after the Royal Navy ship HMS \"Discovery\" in which George Vancouver explored Puget Sound in 1792.\n\nIn December 1993, Bruce Chapman, who had previously held various roles as a Republican politician in Seattle and Washington State government, noticed an essay in \"The Wall Street Journal\" by Stephen C. Meyer about a dispute when biology lecturer Dean H. Kenyon taught intelligent design creationism in introductory classes. Kenyon had co-authored \"Of Pandas and People\", and in 1993 Meyer had contributed to the teacher's notes for the second edition of \"Pandas\". Meyer was an old friend of Gilder, and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to materialism. In the summer of 1995, Chapman and Meyer met a representative of Howard Ahmanson, Jr.; Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson's son in science, recalls being asked \"What could you do if you had some financial backing?\" In 1996, the promise of $750,000 over three years from the Ahmansons and a smaller grant from the conservative Maclellan Foundation was used to fund the Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, which went on to form the motive force behind the intelligent design movement. In 2002, the name was changed to the Center for Science and Culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Center for Science and Culture (CSC), formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC), is a subsidiary of the Discovery Institute. It was established in 1996 with the assistance of Phillip E. Johnson to advance the wedge strategy. Bruce Chapman calls the CRSC \"our No. 1 project.\"\n\nThe CSC offers fellowships of up to $60,000 a year for \"support of significant and original research in the natural sciences, the history and philosophy of science, cognitive science and related fields.\" Since its founding in 1996, the Institute's CSC has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million on research according to Meyer, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can work on intelligent design related scholarship. Over those nine years, $792,585 financed laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology or biophysics, while $93,828 helped graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history and philosophy. The CSC lobbies aggressively to policymakers for wider acceptance of intelligent design and against the theory of evolution and what it terms \"scientific materialism.\" To that end, the CSC works to advance a policy it terms the Wedge strategy, of which the \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign is a major component. The \"Teach the Controversy\" strategy was announced by Meyer in 2002. It seeks to portray evolution as a \"theory in crisis\" and leave the scientific community looking closed-minded, opening the public school science curriculum to creation-based alternatives to evolution such as intelligent design, and thereby undermining \"scientific materialism.\"\n\nIn 2005, the Discovery Institute provided the funding to set up the Biologic Institute in Redmond and the Fremont district of Seattle, Washington, headed by Douglas Axe. The Biologic Institute claims to conduct research into intelligent design in response to one of the primary criticisms of intelligent design that there is no valid research conducted by the scientific community on the topic. According to Axe, the lab's main objective \"is to show that the design perspective can lead to better science,\" and will \"contribute substantially to the scientific case for intelligent design.\" Biologic's staff consists of at least three researchers: Axe, the senior researcher; zoologist Ann Gauger, who like Axe is a signatory to the Discovery Institute's petition expressing skepticism towards \"Darwinian theory\" entitled \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\"; and Brendan Dixon, a software developer. In keeping with the Discovery Institute's October 2006 statement that intelligent design research is being conducted by the Institute in secret to avoid the scrutiny of the scientific community, both Axe and Discovery Institute spokesperson Rob Crowther portray it as a \"separate entity\" despite being funded by the Discovery Institute.\n\nPreviously serving as a director of the Biologic Institute was George Weber, who is also a member of the local chapter of the creationist group Reasons To Believe. In an interview he stated that the lab is a wing of the Discovery Institute and that their goal is to \"challenge the scientific community on naturalism\" and \"What we are doing is necessary to move ID along\" which led to his dismissal from the board of the Institute.\n\nPZ Myers likens the Biologic Institute's design research program to cargo cults, with \"Intelligent Design creationists pretend[ing] that they're doing science.\"\n\nThe Discovery Institute through the Center for Science and Culture has been involved in the intelligent design movement; transportation in the American and Canadian northwest (Cascadia); a bioethics program opposed to assisted suicide, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, human genetic manipulation, human cloning, and the animal rights movement. Its economics and legal programs advocate tort reform, lower taxation, and reduced economic regulation of individuals and groups as the best economic policy. The Discovery Institute also maintains a foreign policy program currently focused on Russia and East Asia.\n\nThe Institute's primary thrust in terms of funding and resources dedicated are those political and cultural campaigns centering on intelligent design. These include the:\n\nThe Discovery Institute's main thrust has been to promote intelligent design politically to the public, education officials and public policymakers, and to portray evolution as a \"theory in crisis\" and advocating teachers to \"Teach the Controversy\" through the CSC. It has employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in the furtherance of its goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents. The Discovery Institute has been a significant player in many of these cases, through the CSC providing a range of support from material assistance to federal, state and regional elected representatives in the drafting of bills to supporting and advising individual parents confronting their school boards.\n\nSome of the political battles which have involved the Discovery Institute include:\n\nIn 2004, the Institute opened an office in Washington, D.C., and in 2005 the Discovery Institute hired Creative Response Concepts, the same public relations firm to promote its intelligent design campaign that promoted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, the Republican National Committee, the Christian Coalition, and the Contract with America. Creative Response Concepts scored an early victory for the Institute in getting \"The New York Times\" to publish an essay by Roman Catholic Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, archbishop of Vienna, condemning neo-Darwinism and positivism. The essay, \"Finding Design in Nature,\" submitted directly to \"The New York Times\" by Creative Response Concepts, was prompted by the Institute's vice president Mark Ryland.\n\nIn \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" (2005), the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania found:\n\nThe proper application of both the endorsement and Lemon tests to the facts of this case makes it abundantly clear that the Board's ID Policy violates the Establishment Clause. In making this determination, we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.\n\nThis federal court—along with the majority of scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science—say that the Institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a false perception that evolution is \"a theory in crisis\" through incorrectly claiming that it is the subject of wide controversy and debate within the scientific community. The court ruled that the Discovery Institute pursues \"demonstrably religious, cultural, and legal missions,\" and the Institute's manifesto, the Wedge Document, describes a religious goal: to \"reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.\" It was the court's opinion that intelligent design was merely a redressing of creationism and that, as such, it was not a scientific proposition.\n\nDiscovery Institute's Cascadia Center for Regional Development (formerly the Cascadia Project) focuses on regional transportation. The Cascadia Project started in 1992 with Bruce Agnew, former Chief of Staff for U.S. Representative John Miller, serving as the director. In 2003, Thomas Till was brought in as Managing Director, after leaving his post as Executive Director of the Amtrak Reform Council.\n\nCascadia attempts to forge alliances between local governments to ease traffic congestion in the Pacific Northwest, utilizing focus groups as well as forming citizen panels and public forums. In conjunction with Microsoft, Cascadia sponsored a session involving elected officials, entrepreneurs and public policy experts including Washington State Representative Dave Reichert and former CIA director R. James Woolsey, Jr. to discuss varying proposals for securing U.S. ports and diversifying America's energy portfolio.\n\nThe Cascadia project is funded in part by a large grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe Technology and Democracy Project (TDP) has been a part of the Discovery Institute since the beginning, founded by Senior Fellow George Gilder. The project supports technology as a force for economic growth and advocates freeing technological advancement from government regulation. It utilizes national publications, speeches, conferences and public testimony to lobby for pro-technology and pro-free enterprise policies. The Technology and Democracy Project supports pushing deregulation to the forefront of the national debate and maintains a blog, disco-tech.org, where senior fellows comment on a wide range of issues.\n\nThe Real Russia Project provides analysis and commentary on the future of democracy in Russia through its internet portal, Russia Blog. In addition to maintaining the weblog, the program organizes conferences and events to address current events and daily public life in Russia.\n\nThe C. S. Lewis & Public Life program is part of the Discovery Institute's Religion, Liberty & Public Life program, which seeks to define and promote the role of religion in society.\n\nThe program provides analysis and commentary on the writings and thinking of C. S. Lewis and how they can influence public policy. The program publishes a quarterly online journal, \"The Lewis Legacy\", and an online archive, C. S. Lewis Writings in the Public Domain.\n\nAlthough it often describes itself as a secular organization, critics describe the Discovery Institute as a Christian organization, and point to the Institute's own publications and the statements of its members that endorse a religious ideology. Americans United for Separation of Church and State wrote, \"Though the Discovery Institute describes itself as a think tank 'specializing in national and international affairs,' the group's real purpose is to undercut church-state separation and turn public schools into religious indoctrination centers.\" U.S. District Court Judge John E. Jones III concluded in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", \"The CSRC expressly announces, in the Wedge Document, a program of Christian apologetics to promote ID. A careful review of the Wedge Document's goals and language throughout the document reveals cultural and religious goals, as opposed to scientific ones.\"\n\nSome critics have contended the Institute has run an organized campaign to mask or downplay its religious origins and agenda. They point to the Discovery Institute's renaming of its \"Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture\" to \"Center for Science and Culture\" in 2002 to avoid religious overtones implied with trying to \"renew\" society. They claim the name change \"followed hard on the heels of accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians.\" Observers of the Institute also point to the fact that the Discovery Institute's members are largely outspoken Christians, who are promoting an explicitly Christian agenda, funded largely by Christian conservatives, catering to an almost exclusively Christian constituency. Nevertheless, the Discovery Institute also has Jewish and agnostic members.\n\nA 2001 \"Seattle Weekly\" article concluded that behind all Discovery Institute programs there was an underlying hidden religious agenda:\nSeveral Discovery Institute fellows have left the Institute over its religious positions and campaigns.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Chapman advised a breakaway faction of Episcopalians opposed to the ordination of gays on how to fund their desired schism from the mainline denomination and suggested that funds from multi-millionaire and Institute board member Howard Ahmanson, Jr., who was also a fellow Episcopalian, might be available for this task. In a memo Chapman sent to fellow dissident Episcopalians, he stated that for their campaign to succeed fund-raising was critical, but \"is going to be affected directly by whether we have a clear, compelling forward strategy\" and \"the Ahmansons are only going to be available to us if we have such a strategy and I think it would be wise to involve them directly in settling on it...\" In 2000 and 2001, Chapman was successful in securing more than $1 million from Ahmanson for the American Anglican Council, but is no longer personally involved in the schism in the American Episcopal community; Chapman converted to Catholicism in 2002.\n\nThe public relations catastrophe for the Discovery Institute that was the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" concerned in large part revised editions the \"Of Pandas and People\" that was promoted at trial by various DI-sponsored experts, particularly CSC Senior Fellow Michael Behe. The issue began when some proponents of intelligent design associated with \"Pandas\" found a need to distinguish it from creation science, whose teaching in public science class had been negated as a violation of the Establishment Clause by the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" (1987).\n\nAn early contributor to \"Pandas\", CSC Fellow Charles Thaxton proposed a term to replace \"creation science\", which he \"picked up from a NASA scientist\"—intelligent design. In a new draft of \"Pandas\", approximately 150 uses of the root word \"creation,\" such as \"creationism\" and \"creationist,\" were systematically changed to refer to \"intelligent design.\" Panda editors also deleted more than 250 references to \"creationism\" and the \"creator\" and replaced them in the final version with \"intelligent design\" and \"intelligent designer.\"\n\nFollowing pattern, the term \"creationists\" was quietly changed to \"design proponents,\" but in one telling case, the beginning and end of the original word \"creationists\" were accidentally retained, so that \"creationists\" became \"cdesign proponentsists.\"\n\nThe proof that intelligent design was creationism re-labeled played a significant part in the Kitzmiller trial, and \"cdesign proponentsists\" has been described by Nick Matzke as \"the 'missing link' between creationism and intelligent design.\"\n\nThe Discovery Institute maintains a list of what it claims are peer-reviewed publications supporting intelligent design. Mark Isaak of TalkOrigins Archive responded to the list by saying, \"Even by the most generous criteria, the peer-reviewed scientific output from the intelligent design (ID) movement is very low, especially considering the long history and generous funding of the movement...One week's worth of peer-reviewed papers on evolutionary biology exceeds the entire history of ID peer-review.\"\n\nAt the foundation of most criticism of the Discovery Institute is the charge that the Institute and its Center for Science and Culture intentionally misrepresent or omit many important facts in promoting their agenda. Intellectual dishonesty, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence, form the foundation of most of the criticisms of the Institute. It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Its critics, such as Eugenie Scott, Robert T. Pennock, Richard Dawkins and Barbara Forrest, claim that the Discovery Institute knowingly misquotes scientists and other experts, deceptively omits contextual text through ellipsis, and makes unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials, and are often said to claim support from scientists when no such support exists. A wide spectrum of critics level this charge; from educators, scientists, and the Smithsonian Institution, to individuals who oppose the teaching of creationism alongside science on ideological grounds.\n\nThis criticism is not limited to those in the scientific community that oppose the teaching of intelligent design and the suppression of evolution, but also includes former Discovery Institute donors. The Bullitt Foundation, which gave $10,000 in 2001 for transportation causes, withdrew all funding of the Institute; its director, Denis Hayes, called the Institute \"the institutional love child of Ayn Rand and Jerry Falwell,\" and said, \"I can think of no circumstances in which the Bullitt Foundation would fund anything at Discovery today.\"\n\nThe Wedge Document, a widely circulated 1998 fund-raising document, laid out Discovery's original, ambitious plan to \"drive a wedge\" into the heart of \"scientific materialism,\" \"thereby divorcing science from its purely observational and naturalistic methodology and reversing the deleterious effects of evolution on Western culture.\" The Wedge Document states two \"Governing Goals\":\n\nMeyer says that the Wedge Document \"was stolen from our offices and placed on the Web without permission.\" The central item of this agenda — establishing intelligent design as legitimate science through conducting actual scientific research — has not been achieved.\n\nMichelle Goldberg has said:\nAccording to an article in \"The New York Times\", the John Templeton Foundation, who provided grants for conferences and courses to debate intelligent design, later asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research. Charles L. Harper Jr., senior vice president at the Templeton Foundation, was quoted as saying \"They never came in.\" He also said that while he was skeptical from the beginning, other foundation officials were initially intrigued and later grew disillusioned. \"From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review,\" he said. The Templeton Foundation has since rejected the Discovery Institute's entreaties for more funding, Harper states. \"They're political - that for us is problematic,\" and that while Discovery has \"always claimed to be focused on the science,\" \"what I see is much more focused on public policy, on public persuasion, on educational advocacy and so forth.\"\n\nIn 2007, in a letter to the editor of the \"Los Angeles Times\", Pamela Thompson, Vice President for Communications of the Templeton Foundation, wrote \"We do not believe that the science underpinning the intelligent-design movement is sound, we do not support research or programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge, and the foundation is a nonpolitical entity and does not engage in or support political movements.\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" also published a letter from Thompson making much the same point: \"The foundation doesn't support the political movement known as 'Intelligent Design.' This is for three reasons: We don't believe the science underpinning the 'Intelligent Design' movement is sound, we don't support research or programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge and the foundation is a non-political entity and does not engage in, or support, political movements.\"\n\nIn February 2007, the Discovery Institute began to counter the unfavorable statements of Harper and Thompson citing a \"report\" published on the intelligent design wiki ResearchID.org. This report by Joseph C. Campana quoted clarifications from Charles Harper of the Templeton Foundation denouncing intelligent design and distancing the Templeton Foundation from the intelligent design movement, notably a clarification by Harper that \"The Wall Street Journal\" article published \"false information\" that \"mention[ed] the John Templeton Foundation in a way suggesting that the Foundation has been a concerted patron and sponsor of the so-called Intelligent Design (\"ID\") position.\" Campana claimed that this was indicative of larger errors and bias: \"The media has misrepresented the record of the intelligent design research community.\" Critics of intelligent design responded by noting that though Harper appears to have \"confirmed that while the first statement about a formal call for applications was false, the real point of the article, that ID advocates don't do very well in terms of actual research and scientific review, remains true and valid\" a point the Discovery Institute glosses over. The Templeton Foundation posted a response to the Discovery Institute's campaign, saying:\n\nIn December 2006 the Discovery Institute and its fellows published several articles describing a study performed by the Discovery Institute criticizing the judge in the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" trial. It claims that \"90.9% (or 5,458 words) of Judge Jones' 6,004-word section on intelligent design as science was taken verbatim or virtually verbatim from the proposed 'Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law' submitted to Judge Jones by ACLU attorneys nearly a month before his ruling.\"\n\nWithin a day, the president of the York County Bar Association, Sara Austin, wrote that parties are required by the courts to submit findings of fact and \"a judge can adopt some, all or none of the proposed findings.\" She added that in the final ruling, a judge's decision \"is the judge's findings and it doesn't matter who submitted them.\" A partner in a York, Pennsylvania, law firm, James D. Greenberg, said that \"Any attempt to make a stink out of it is absurd.\"\n\nSeveral commentators described a number of critical flaws in the study from both a numerical and legal standpoint. Witold Walczak, legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the ACLU's lead attorney on the case called the Institute's report a stunt: \"They're getting no traction in the scientific world so they're trying to do something ... as a PR stunt to get attention, ... That's not how scientists work, ... Discovery Institute is trying to litigate a year-old case in the media.\" He also said the Discovery Institute staff is not, as it claims, interested in finding scientific truths; it is more interested in a \"cultural war,\" pushing for intelligent design and publicly criticizing a judge.\n\nA subsequent review of the study performed by Wesley R. Elsberry, author of the text comparison program that was partly responsible for the decision in the case, indicated that only 38% of the complete ruling by Judge Jones actually incorporated the findings of fact and conclusions of law that the plaintiffs proposed that he incorporate, and only 66% of the section (on whether intelligent design was science) incorporated the proposals, not the 90.9% the Discovery Institute claimed was copied in that section. Significantly, Judge Jones adopted only 48% of the plaintiffs's proposed findings of fact for that section, and rejected 52%, clearly showing that he did not accept the section verbatim.\n\nThe Institute is a non-profit educational foundation funded by philanthropic foundation grants, corporate and individual contributions and the dues of Institute members. Contributions made to it are tax deductible, as provided by law.\n\nThe Institute does not provide details about its backers, out of harassment fears according to Bruce Chapman.\n\nIn 2001, the Baptist Press reported, \"Discovery Institute ... with its $4 million annual budget ($1.2 million of which is for the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture) is heavily funded by evangelical Christians. Maclellan Foundation of Chattanooga, Tenn., for example, awarded $350,000 to the institute with the hope researchers would be able to prove evolution to be a false theory. Fieldstead & Co., owned by Howard and Robert Ahmanson of Irvine, Calif., pledged $2.8 million through 2003 to support the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture.\"\n\nIn 2003, a review of tax documents on GuideStar showed grants and gifts totalling $1.4 million in 1997. Included in the supporters were 22 foundations. At least two-thirds of these foundations stated explicitly religious missions.\n\nMost Discovery Institute donors have also contributed significantly to the Bush campaign.\n\nIn 2005, the \"Washington Post\" reported, \"Meyer said the institute accepts money from such wealthy conservatives as Howard Ahmanson Jr., who once said his goal is 'the total integration of biblical law into our lives,' and the Maclellan Foundation, which commits itself to 'the infallibility of the Scripture.'\"\n\nAccording to Charity Navigator, in FYE December 2005, the Discovery Institute had $2,989,608 in total revenue and $3,878,186 in total functional expenses.\n\nThe Discovery Institute denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer, when ABC News asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors, the Institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying \"I don't think we want to go down that path.\"\n\nThough in the minority, funding also comes from non-conservative sources: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $1 million in 2000 and pledged $9.35 million over 10 years in 2003, including $50,000 of Bruce Chapman's $141,000 annual salary. The money of the Gates Foundation grant is \"exclusive to the Cascadia project\" on regional transportation, according to a Gates Foundation grant maker.\n\nPublished reports state that the Institute has awarded $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since the CSC's founding in 1996. \"I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess,\" says William A. Dembski, who, during the three years after completing graduate school in 1996 could not secure a university position, received what he calls \"a standard academic salary\" of $40,000 per year through the Institute.\n</div>\nDiscovery Institute Press is the Institute's publishing arm and has published intelligent design books by its fellows including David Berlinski's \"Deniable Darwin & Other Essays\" (2010), Jonathan Wells' \"The Myth of Junk DNA\" (2011) and an edited volume titled \"Signature Of Controversy\", which contains apologetic works in defense of the Institute's Center for Science and Culture director Stephen C. Meyer.\n\nThe Physicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity (PSSI), formally registered as PSSI International Inc, is a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit anti-evolution organization promoting the pseudoscience of intelligent design associated with the Discovery Institute, based in Clearwater, Florida. While in the past, the organization sponsored events promoting intelligent design and fundamentalist Christianity, it is currently largely inactive. The PSSI was established in early 2006 by Rich Akin. Geoffrey Simmons, M.D., Discovery Institute fellow, is one of the Directors of the PSSI.\n\nThe PSSI created a public list of medical professionals who dissent from Darwinism. This list is used by the Discovery Institute in its anti-evolution campaigns. The list is used in support of the Discovery Institute claims that intelligent design is scientifically valid while asserting that evolution lacks broad scientific support.\n\nThe PSSI, which was active between 2006 - 2008, held a \"Doctors Doubting Darwin\" rally at the University of South Florida's Sun Dome in September 2006. Attendance was estimated at 3,500 to 4,000 people by a local reporter. Apologetic organizations promoting the event had hoped to fill all 7,700 seats in the Sun Dome. This meeting featured the Discovery Institute's Jonathan Wells and fellow Michael Behe, and received local radio coverage. This rally was opposed by the \"Florida Citizens for Science\" organization.\n\n"}

It was founded and opened in 1992 along with the \"Educational Options\" program by the LAUSD and closed down in 2004. It was the first public high school designed for LGBT youth from grade 7 onwards in the United States.\n\nEAGLES Academy Central High School was a public high school run by the department of \"Educational Options\" of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), also known as EAGLES Academy Hollywood and EAGLLES Center. EAGLES is an acronym from \"Empasizing Adolescent Gay Lesbian Education Services.\" The target group of this school was gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students, as well as those questioning their sexuality and educational dropouts, but being a high school run by the state, it was also open for straight students. The mission statement was \"A safe place for youth to receive their education.\"\n\nThe school was supervised by Ruben Zacarias, in that time period LAUSD's superintendent of schools in charge, Elizabeth Newman, the options administrator, and Sunshine S. Sepulveda, an educational advisor to LAUSD. Founder and principal of the school was Jerry B. Battey, an English teacher, from 1992 to 2004.\n\nIn 1996, the school had two campusses: Hollywood and a branch located in South Bay, Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1999, eleven teachers worked at EAGLES.\n\nIn the same year, there were also one full-time and four part-time volunteer school counselors.\n\nThe school was closed in the Summer of 2004 due to financial shortages by the LAUSD. Although there was a tax-exempt organization called \"Friends of EAGLES Center – Los Angeles, Inc.\" for raising money and commodity contributions, it was impossible to keep the school alive based only on donations.\n\nEAGLES Center started in 1992 with twelve students. Later in 1992, 35 students were enrolled at EAGLES.\n\nEAGLES Center initiated the first prom for LGBT students for the school, open for students from other high schools in the school district. It was advertised in the media as an open invitation for the first prom of its kind in the nation. On May 20, 1994, it took place in the Los Angeles Hilton hotel. A group of protesters can be seen in the documentary film that was made on it.\n\nAt the first graduation ceremony held in Plummer Park in West Hollywood in 1994, six seniors received their diplomas.\n\nThe curriculum followed the Carnegie Unit and Student Hour system with 45-minute units in core subjects like English, science, social studies, and mathematics plus German and Spanish as second languages.\n\nA long-term collaboration between EAGLES and the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) patronized several graduates to develop their talents like Marc Imme to become an actor, later known for the role of \"Luke\" in \"Ryan's Life\" (2004), and Miguel Lopez, the playwright of \"Mariposas\" (2001), a play for children.\n\nIn statewide comparisions, the students of EAGLE reached in the Junior to Senior ratings of 1998 (known as the \"Stanford 9 Assessment tests\") six stars.\n\nIn 2001, some students graduated from EAGLES Academy without fulfilling all requirements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "413740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413740", "title": "Ear training", "text": "Ear training\n\nEar training or aural skills is a skill by which musicians learn to identify, solely by hearing, pitches, intervals, melody, chords, rhythms, and other basic elements of music. The application of this skill is analogous to taking dictation in written/spoken language. As a process, ear training is in essence the inverse of sight-singing, the latter being analogous to reading a written text aloud without prior opportunity to review the material. Ear training is typically a component of formal musical training.\n\nFunctional pitch recognition involves identifying the function or role of a single pitch in the context of an established tonic. Once a tonic has been established, each subsequent pitch may be classified without direct reference to accompanying pitches. For example, once the tonic G has been established, listeners may recognize that the pitch D plays the role of the dominant in the key of G. No reference to any other pitch is required to establish this fact.\n\nMany musicians use functional pitch recognition in order to identify, understand, and appreciate the roles and meanings of pitches within a key. To this end, scale-degree numbers or movable-\"do\" solmization (\"do, re, mi,\" etc.) can be quite helpful. Using such systems, pitches with identical functions (the key note or tonic, for example) are associated with identical labels (\"1\" or \"do,\" for example).\n\nFunctional pitch recognition is not the same as fixed-\"do\" solfège, e.g. \"do, re, mi\", etc. Functional pitch recognition emphasizes the role of a pitch with respect to the tonic, while fixed-\"do\" solfège symbols are labels for absolute pitch values (\"do\"=C, \"re\"=D, etc., in any key). In the fixed-\"do\" system (used in the conservatories of the Romance language nations, e.g. Paris, Madrid, Rome, as well as the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute in the USA), solfège symbols do not describe the role of pitches relative to a tonic, but rather actual pitches. In the movable-do system, there happens to be a correspondence between the solfège symbol and a pitch's role. However, there is no requirement that musicians associate the solfège symbols with the scale degrees. In fact, musicians may utilize the movable-\"do\" system to label pitches while mentally tracking intervals to determine the sequence of solfège symbols.\n\nFunctional pitch recognition has several strengths. Since a large body of music is tonal, the technique is widely applicable. Since reference pitches are not required, music may be broken up by complex and difficult to analyze pitch clusters, for example, a percussion sequence, and pitch analysis may resume immediately once an easier to identify pitch is played, for example, by a trumpet—no need to keep track of the last note of the previous line or solo nor any need to keep track of a series of intervals going back all the way to the start of a piece. Since the function of pitch classes is a key element, the problem of compound intervals with interval recognition is not an issue—whether the notes in a melody are played within a single octave or over many octaves is irrelevant.\n\nFunctional pitch recognition has some weaknesses. Music with no tonic or ambiguous tonality does not provide the frame of reference necessary for this type of analysis. When dealing with key changes, a student must know how to account for pitch function recognition after the key changes: retain the original tonic or change the frame of reference to the new tonic. This last aspect in particular, requires an ongoing real-time (even anticipatory) analysis of the music that is complicated by modulations and is the chief detriment to the movable-do system.\n\nInterval recognition is also a useful skill for musicians: in order to determine the notes in a melody, a musician must have some ability to recognize intervals. Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. However, others have shown that such familiar-melody associations are quite limited in scope, applicable only to the specific scale-degrees found in each melody.\n\nIn addition, there are various systems (including solfeggio, sargam, and numerical sight-singing) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the scale. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.\n\nComplementary to recognizing the melody of a song is hearing the harmonic structures that support it. Musicians often practise hearing different types of chords and their inversions out of context, just to hear the characteristic sound of the chord. They also learn chord progressions to hear how chords relate to one another in the context of a piece of music.\n\nThe process is similar to twelve-tone ear training, but with many more intervals to distinguish. Aspects of microtonal ear training are covered in \"Harmonic Experience\", by W. A. Mathieu, with sight-singing exercises, such as singing over a drone, to learn to recognize just intonation intervals. There are also software projects underway or completed geared to ear training or to assist in microtonal performance.\n\nGro Shetelig at The Norwegian Academy of Music is working on the development of a Microtonal Ear Training method for singers and has developed the software Micropalette, a tool for listening to microtonal tones, chords and intervals. Aaron Hunt at Hi Pi instruments has developed Xentone, another tool for microtonal ear training.\n\nOne way musicians practise rhythms is by breaking them up into smaller, more easily identifiable sub-patterns. For example, one might start by learning the sound of all the combinations of four eighth notes and eighth rests, and then proceed to string different four-note patterns together.\n\nAnother way to practise rhythms is by muscle memory, or teaching rhythm to different muscles in the body. One may start by tapping a rhythm with the hands and feet individually, or singing a rhythm on a syllable (e.g. \"ta\"). Later stages may combine keeping time with the hand, foot, or voice and simultaneously tapping out the rhythm, and beating out multiple overlapping rhythms.\n\nA metronome may be used to assist in maintaining accurate tempo.\n\nEach type of musical instrument has a characteristic sound quality that is largely independent of pitch or loudness. Some instruments have more than one timbre, e.g. the sound of a plucked violin is different from the sound of a bowed violin. Some instruments employ multiple manual or embouchure techniques to achieve the same pitch through a variety of timbres. If these timbres are essential to the melody or function, as in shakuhachi music, then pitch training alone will not be enough to fully recognize the music. Learning to identify and differentiate various timbres is an important musical skill that can be acquired and improved by training.\n\nMusic teachers often recommend transcribing recorded music as a way to practise all of the above, including recognizing rhythm, melody and harmony. The teacher may also perform (‘dictate’) short compositions, with the pupil listening and transcribing them on to paper.\n\nFor accurate identification and reproduction of musical intervals, scales, chords, rhythms, and other audible parameters a great deal of practice is often necessary. Exercises involving identification often require a knowledgeable partner to play the passages in question and to assess the answers given. Specialised music theory software can remove the need for a partner, customise the training to the user’s needs and accurately track progress. Conservatories and university music departments often license commercial software for their students, such as Meludia, EarMaster, Auralia. and MacGAMUT, so that they can track and manage student scores on a computer network. A variety of free software also exists, either as browser-based applications or as downloadable executables. For example, free and open source software under the GPL, such as GNU Solfege, often provides many features comparable with those of popular proprietary products. Most ear-training software is MIDI-based, permitting the user to customise the instruments used and even to receive input from MIDI-compatible devices such as electronic keyboards. Interactive ear-training applications are also available for smartphones.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2001088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001088", "title": "Education in Hungary", "text": "Education in Hungary\n\nEducation in Hungary is predominantly public, run by the Ministry of Human Resources. Preschool kindergarten education is compulsory and provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is also compulsory until age of sixteen. Primary education usually lasts for eight years. Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the secondary vocational schools for intermediate students lasts four years and the technical school prepares pupils for vocational education and the world of work. The system is partly flexible and bridges exist, graduates from a vocational school can achieve a two years program to have access to vocational higher education for instance. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in Hungary among the bests in the world for maths and science.\n\nMost of the Hungarian universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the Matura. The Hungarian public higher education system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German language is important in Hungarian higher education, there are a number of degree programs that are taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of exchange students every year. Hungary's higher education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global competitiveness Report 2014.\n\nToday there are 67 higher education institutions in Hungary, ranging from small colleges to top research universities. These universities and colleges are maintained either by the state, private organizations or a church. In accordance with the objectives of the Bologna process the degree structure of tertiary education is based on three cycles. Nearly all study fields lead first to a Bachelor’s degree (usually 3 years), and after a further study period to a Master’s degree (2 years). However, there are some exceptions: medicine, pharmacy, dental and veterinary studies, architecture, law, teacher training, and certain arts-, crafts- and design-related study programmes, which retain a long single-cycle structure of 5 or 6 years of study. The first-cycle programmes last 6–8 semesters (3–4 years, 180–240 credit points) and lead to a bachelor's degree (in Hungarian: alapfokozat). The second cycle, leading to a master's degree (in Hungarian: mesterfokozat), lasts 2–4 semesters (1–2 years, 60–120 credit points). Two-year-long vocational higher education programmes (in Hungarian: felsőoktatási szakképzés) are also available on an optional basis prior to first-cycle programmes and lead to advanced vocational qualifications. The 120 credit points gained in vocational higher education programmes are compatible for recognition in the first (Bachelor) cycle. Any Bachelor’s or master's degree can be followed by specialised higher education courses (in Hungarian: szakirányú továbbképzés). These do not lead to another degree but offer the option of specialisation in a particular field of study. Courses can be studied full-time, part-time or through distance learning. A four-year doctoral programme is a post-graduate course to follow any Master’s or equivalent qualification.\n\nHungary has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the existence of established knowledge economy. The established universities in Hungary include some of the oldest in the world, the first was the University of Pécs founded in 1367 which is still functioning, although in the year 1276, the university of Veszprém was destroyed by the troops of Peter Csák, but it was never rebuilt. Sigismund established Óbuda University in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in Pozsony by Mattias Corvinus.\nNagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called Eötvös Loránd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary in 1735, its legal successor is the University of Miskolc. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II.\n\nThe decline of Hungary's population that started in 1981 has also continued in recent years. According to the 2001 census, the population of Hungary was 10,198,000, about half a million less than the figure of twenty years earlier. By 2005 the population dropped to 10,077,000. The age pyramid of the Hungarian population is among the most irregular ones in Europe. On 1 January 2005, due to the extremely low number of live births in the preceding years the size of the 0-4-year-old population was smaller than the next age groups of five-year increments up to the age group 60-64. There are major differences in the size of the various generations.\n\nThe official language of instruction is Hungarian, but a number of ethnic and\nnational minorities (e.g. German, Romanian, Slovene, Serb and Croatian) have minority educational institutions with their own languages as first or second language of instruction at primary and secondary level of teaching. According to the 2003 survey, the rate of Romani children in the population entering school education in 2008-2009 is expected to be around 15%.\n\nA special feature of the Hungarian education system is that institutional structures and the structure of educational programmes are not aligned with each other. The system's institutional structure and the presence of programmes allowing early selection show similarities with Central European and ex-socialist countries. The system's content structure, the uniform and general phase of education has extended, and secondary level education may be characterised by increased opportunities for transition. The general phase of education lasts until the age of 16 in Hungary's education system. Participation in secondary education, offering a wide variety of programmes, is fairly high. Within secondary education, the proportion of students studying in programmes leading to a secondary school-leaving certificate and offering transition to tertiary education is around the international average.\n\nThis educational level is considered as a crucially important integrated part of the school\nsystem. It caters for children from 3 to 7 years of age. Since 2015, participation in pre-primary education at this level (kindergarten) is compulsory from age 3 (before 2015 only the final year - beyond age 5 - was compulsory), although exceptions are made for developmental reasons \n\nPublic-sector institutions may only charge for services additional to their basic tasks, including for example extracurricular activities, meals, excursions, etc. Currently, the attendance rate with regard to the age groups 3-5, is just above 86%. The average duration of participation of children aged 3–7 in pre-primary education is just over 3 years (3.3), which is the highest average value in Europe.\nIn Hungary a kindergarten is called an \"óvoda\" ('place for caring'). Children attend kindergarten between the ages of 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons. Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school.\n\nMost kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.\n\nChildren start primary school when they reach school-maturity, usually in the year in which they have their 6th birthday (7th if they were born after May 31).\n\nPrimary education can last for 4, 6 or 8 years. 8-year education is the most widespread; the other two options were introduced in the early 1990s.\n\nSubjects include literature, grammar, mathematics, music, art, Physical education, environmental studies (from 1st to 5th grade), biology (from 6th grade), geography (from 6th grade), history (from 5th grade), history of art, physics (from 6th grade), chemistry (from 7th grade), one or two foreign languages (usually English, German or French). Before 1990, Russian was compulsory.\n\nSecondary education usually lasts for 4 years. In \"gimnázium\"s it can also last for 5, 6 or 8 years depending on how many years the student spent in primary school. Since 1997 the numbering of years in secondary school are following that of primary school (i. e. after the 8th grade of primary school the student goes to 9th grade, which is actually the 1st year of secondary school.)\n\nThere are three kinds of high schools:\n\nAfter finishing high school, students take a school-leaving exam (Matura or final exam, \"érettségi\" in Hungarian). From 2005 this consists of exams on five subjects: written exam in mathematics, verbal and written exams in \"Hungarian literature and grammar\", a \"foreign language\", \"history\", and written and/or verbal exam in a subject of the \"student's choice\". These exams also serve as an entry exam to universities and colleges.\n\nMany of the \"gimnázium\"s have begun to teach a foreign language intensively (usually 12-14 lessons a week) and IT (usually 3-4 lessons a week) in the first year. This is called \"nyelvi előkészítő évfolyam\", literally \"Language training class\", or simply \"nulladik évfolyam\" (literally \"0th grade\"). After 2005, students will have less foreign language lessons and IT.\n\nAt schools where there is no \"nulladik évfolyam\" (beginners classes), they may be required to introduce them because the majority of Hungarians do not speak more than one language, or only speak their parents' language or dialect. Most students will finish High School at the age of 18 or 19, or when they complete Year 13.\n\nThose who had at least an intermediate level language exam weren't required to pass a language exam at Matura, but has become compulsory since 2006. In language training classes, a student must pass an intermediate level language exam in the second year, and the same level Matura in the third year.\n\nHigher education in Hungary dates back to 1367 when Louis the Great founded the first Hungarian university in the city of Pécs.\n\nHigher education is divided between colleges and universities. College education generally lasts for 4 years, while university education lasts for 4 to 6 years depending on the course undertaken. Vocational curriculum usually last 2 years: they are opened to secondary vocational school's graduates, and eventually vocational school students (after 5 years of work in the desired field or after a two-year program leading to a \"secondary school leaving certificate\"). University PhD courses usually take 3 years to complete.\n\nBefore students get their degree, they must pass an intermediate level language exam in the foreign language of their choice. English and German are the most popular. The number of Spanish-learners has been growing in the last few years. Recently a high number of students chose Esperanto and Romani languages. Both are said to have a relatively small vocabulary and easy grammar.\n\nThis school type (in Hungarian: szakiskola) typically provides general and pre-vocational education in grades 9 and 10, normally followed by three or two years of VET. At the end of their studies, students will acquire a qualification (ISCED 2C or mostly 3C).\n\nHungary attracts foreign students from both EU and non-EU countries. Three quarters of the students arriving in Hungary arrive from just ten countries, while one quarter of the students arrives from another 100 countries. Among the countries sending most students are Germany, Iran, Norway, Israel and Sweden, while the majority of guest students are citizens of the neighbouring countries. In the 2008/2009 academic year, the total number of foreign students studying in Hungary was 16 916, while this number was only 14 491 in 2005/2006. The figures are increasing owing to the following advantages:\n\nStudents interested in continuing their studies in Hungary will find preparatory courses in numerous universities from Debrecen to Budapest, from Budapest to Szeged, from Szeged to Pécs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46234009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46234009", "title": "Educator effectiveness", "text": "Educator effectiveness\n\nEducator effectiveness is a K-12 school system education policy initiative that measures the quality of an educator performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.\n\nThe drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from Race to the top where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.\n\nEducator effectiveness programs vary from state to state. Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.\n\nEducator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as Charlotte Danielson's \"Framework for Teaching\", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.\n\nTeacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by The New Teacher Project has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.\n\nToday, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.\n\nOverall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.\n\nAs of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.\n\nMany countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.\n\nThere is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States. However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a National Board Certification using National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools \n\nThe connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.\n\nMost educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:\n\nThe new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective. Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.\n\nMany argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.\n\nOthers argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status. There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it. It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers. Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content \n\nSome have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.\n\n\n"}

She has been called the \"Ralph Nader of Harlem\" and is also known as the mother of the Harlem Consumer Movement.\n\nFlorence M. Rice was born in Buffalo, New York, on March 22, 1919. Florence's family emigrated to the United States from the West Indies before she was born. She spent many years in the Colored Orphan Asylum, one of the first charitable institutions dedicated to the needs of African-American children. \nFlorence M. Rice was the founder in the 1960s of the Harlem Consumer Education Council, Inc. It is a private, non-profit, consumer advocacy organization, established to address issues of poverty, neglect, and exploitation confronting poor and low-income citizens in New York City's Harlem community.\n\nRice was an early champion for abortion rights for women. She spoke out openly about her life in the 1930s, as a young woman working at a laundry in Harlem, and having an illegal abortion. In 1969, she joined other outspoken women in talking openly about their illegal abortion experiences.\n\nAfter completing the eight grade, Florence Rice went to work as a domestic seamstress. She became a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. In 1962, she participated in a congressional hearing held by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., which probed discriminatory union policies and practices towards African Americans and Latinos; she testified regarding the situation in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. It is noted that after the congressional hearings Rice was blacklisted and marginalized by the garment industry, which prompted her to start the Harlem Consumer Education Council in the 1960s. \nRice was a member of ILGWU Local 155, and it is documented in the book \"Race Traitor\", by Noel Ignatiev and John Garvey, that she said she was told that if she testified at the Congressional Committee Hearings before the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on the Investigation of the Garment Industry, she would \"never work again in the garment industry\".\nThe Harlem Consumer Education Council waged boycotts and picket lines against many Harlem grocery stories that would not hire African Americans. Rice also challenged corporations that discriminated against African Americans. One of her biggest victories was against the New York State Public Service Commission, which was forced to stop charging low-income residents pre-installation fees.\n\nRice organized Harlem housewives to check store prices and products. They picketed supermarkets, once closed a paint store in Harlem for false advertising that they would give free cans of paint. Her early experiences documented in an article by Caroline Bird in \"New York Magazine\", titled \"Black Womanpower\", on March 10, 1969.\n\nFlorence M.

Ms. Rice states that her apartment was gutted under the guise of renovating it, and trying to force her out of her apartment. Her apartment was destroyed.\n\nOn November 26, 2004, in New York, a Bill was put in place, and a Proclamation given to Ms. Florence Rice. The bill was named in her honor. Her battle with landlords set off many demonstrations and brought awareness to unwarranted evictions of elderly citizens. \"With this bill, landlords will no longer be allowed to evict our senior citizens without recourse,\" Barron told a group of supporters gathered at the steps of City Hall. \"Landlords now must go through the Housing Preservation and Development Department before any action can be taken.\" \"This law is named in tribute to Florence Rice who has been unfazed by the most daunting challenges from Con-Ed and New York Telephone,\" reads the proclamation given to Rice, said Paul Washington, Barron’s chief of staff.\n\nIn 2014 she launched the War on Seniors Campaign.

The original high priestess of Coven Celeste, she is a founding elder of the Canadian Aquarian Tabernacle Church and was the first recognized Wiccan chaplain in a public university.\n\nHeather Harden was born in Newmarket, Ontario of mixed Assiniboine-Sioux and English-Canadian heritage; her paternal grandmother was a Quaker. She was brought up a Jehovah's Witness, living on a small farm on the outskirts of Newmarket, where her parents raised chickens, pigs and ponies. She was heavily involved in 4-H projects and showed the neighbor's Ayrshire cattle. At 14 she was involved in a near-fatal car accident, an experience which was to shape her future university research interests. At 15, she met her future husband, Gary Botting, at a cousin's wedding. Conforming to the instructions of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, the controlling corporation of Jehovah's Witnesses, at high school she opted for the \"special commercial\" (as opposed to academic) program. Since their potential union suffered the disapprobation of their respective parents, Heather and Gary eloped in October, 1966—only to discover that nobody had noticed, and it became inconvenient to tell anyone. As a result, they got married a second time, this time publicly, on 1 April 1967 when they realized that \"April Fool's Day\" fell on a Saturday, thereby generating a self-perpetuating April Fool's joke. Only then did Heather return to high school, intent on eventually enrolling in university.\n\nHeather Botting attended Memorial University of Newfoundland and Trent University, majoring in anthropology. At the University of Alberta, she received the highest marks in the entire university, guaranteeing her a prestigious Killam Scholarship for graduate studies.

Her dissertation \"The Power and the Glory: The Symbolic Vision and Social Dynamic of Jehovah's Witnesses\" is an analysis of the power relations operative within Jehovah's Witnesses, focusing on a specific microsociety of individuals within the movement, \"showing the levels of involvement, commitment, and status achieved within the sect by each person in the microsociety.\" The raw research data for her dissertation was collected over a nine-year period from 1973 to 1982, and continued to be collected until she and Gary published \"The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses\" through University of Toronto Press in 1984. The book is an exposé of \"Witness history, beliefs, and social imperatives,\" but more importantly focuses on the shifting doctrines and \"mental regulating\" of Witnesses through isolationism and dogma, comparing the Watch Tower Society's closed social paradigms with the thought control depicted by George Orwell in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Debbie Morgan of the \"United Church Observer\" called it a \"warning against the way religious doctrine can be created and used to enslave rather than to free.\" Carl Rapkins of the \"New York Tribune\" described it as \"excellent and sophisticated—a rare treat.\" The book sold out its first edition of 5000 copies within weeks of its release. Shunned by her many Jehovah's Witness relatives, Botting focused her attention on developing a spiritual religion based on the paganism that her relatives so abhorred.\n\nBotting received a second Master of Arts Degree in Religious Studies with a thesis on near death experiences from the University of Calgary before moving with her lawyer husband, Gary Botting, to Victoria, where she joined the faculty of University of Victoria as an anthropology professor, teaching folklore, anthropology of religion and social justice. Shortly after joining the faculty of University of Victoria, she was appointed as chaplain—the first recognized Wiccan university chaplain in North America.\n\nIn the summer of 1966, Heather Harden met her fiance's maternal grandmother, Lysbeth Turner (née Rendle), the younger sister of Thomas Edward Rendle VC the first infantryman to receive the Victoria Cross in the First World War. After answering the \"call to arms\" of Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) in 1940—when witches from across the south of England met in the New Forest for the purpose of casting a protective charm over England and a spell on Hitler's nefarious designs—Lysbeth Turner had become Gardner's London-based High Priestess. She had introduced Gary Botting to Gardner in 1953. Realizing that most of her Canadian family had become committed Jehovah's Witnesses, in 1966 Lysbeth expressed concern to Heather that her tradition of the \"Old Religion\" (i.e. Wicca) would be lost forever. Heather had empathy for this situation, since she had grown up in Ontario in the 1950s, when it was not fashionable to admit one's First Nations heritage (in her case, Assiniboine-Sioux). Despite her being a Jehovah's Witness, Heather rose to the challenge, abandoned the faith of her youth and was initiated into Witchcraft. Once they were married later that year, Gary and Heather Botting established Coven Celeste in Peterborough, Ontario - the first Wiccan coven in Canada. However, because of the severe social strictures placed upon them by Jehovah's Witnesses, including fear of being disfellowshipped, they stayed in the \"broom closet\" for years—the \"gestation period\" of Coven Celeste—discussing their new faith only with fellow pagans.\n\nThe coven came to full development in Sylvan Lake, Alberta, from where it \"hived,\" with different members of the coven moving away, taking its traditions with them. Over the next 40 years it went through several permutations, spreading from Ontario east to Newfoundland and west to British Columbia, north to the Northwest Territories, and south as far as Corpus Christi, Texas. In keeping with the matrilineal tradition explained to Heather by Lysbeth Turner, Coven Celeste has been passed on to Heather's granddaughters, Phaydra and Ariadne.\n\nMichele Favarger attended Coven Celeste rituals in Alberta in 1982 and subsequently formed the Canadian Aquarian Tabernacle Church (\"ATC\") on Vancouver Island, inviting Heather Botting (as \"Lady Aurora\") and Gary Botting (as \"Lord Pan\") to become founding elders. The Bottings and Favarger, along with Favarger's partner and high priest Erik Lindblad, successfully campaigned the Province of British Columbia to recognize Wiccan weddings. By 1995 Coven Celeste had become one of the mainstay covens of Temple of the Lady in Victoria, BC, and the ATC was conducting a prison ministry and most pagan weddings in the province—mostly led by Arch-Priestess Michele Favarger and High Priestess Lady Aurora. Heather Botting then became High Priestess of Circle of the Wolfsong, the Victoria branch of the ATC, and her husband, Denis O'Brien, became the coven's high priest.\n\nHeather and Gary Botting have four children, Tanya (born 1970), Trent (born 1975), Thomas (born 1979) and Tharian (born 1983). They were divorced in 1999. In 2000, Heather married social worker Denis O'Brien, a Wiccan of mixed Mohawk and Irish ancestry.\n"}
{"id": "308234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308234", "title": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "text": "Humboldt University of Berlin\n\nThe Humboldt University of Berlin (, abbreviated HU Berlin) is a university in the central borough of Mitte in Berlin, Germany. It was established by Frederick William III on the initiative of Wilhelm von Humboldt, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Ernst Daniel Schleiermacher as the University of Berlin (\"Universität zu Berlin\") in 1809, and opened in 1810, making it the oldest of Berlin's four universities. From 1810 until its closure in 1945, it was named Friedrich Wilhelm University (). In 1949, under Eastern Bloc rule, it was reopened and for this occasion received its present-day name.\n\nThe university is divided into nine faculties, including its medical school shared with the Free University of Berlin, has a student enrollment of around 32,000 students, and offers degree programmes in some 189 disciplines from undergraduate to postdoctorate level. Its main campus is located on the Unter den Linden boulevard in central Berlin. The university is known worldwide for pioneering the Humboldtian model of higher education, which has strongly influenced other European and Western universities, and the university has been widely called \"the mother of all modern universities.\"\n\nAs of 2017, the Humboldt University of Berlin has been associated with 55 Nobel Prize winners (including former students, faculty and researchers), and is considered one of the best universities in Europe as well as one of the most prestigious universities in the world for arts and humanities. It was widely regarded as the world's preeminent university for the natural sciences during the 19th and early 20th century, and is linked to major breakthroughs in physics and other sciences by its professors such as Albert Einstein. Former faculty and notable alumni include eminent philosophers, sociologists, artists, lawyers, politicians, mathematicians, scientists, and Heads of State.\n\nThe University of Berlin was established on 16 August 1809, on the initiative of the liberal Prussian educational politician Wilhelm von Humboldt by King Friedrich Wilhelm III, during the period of the Prussian Reform Movement. The university was located in a palace constructed from 1748-1766 for the late Prince Henry, the younger brother of Frederick the Great. After his widow and her ninety-member staff moved out, the first unofficial lectures were given in the building in the winter of 1809. Humboldt faced great resistance to his ideas as he set up the university. He submitted his resignation to the King in April 1810, and was not present when the school opened that fall. The first students were admitted on 6 October 1810, and the first semester started on 10 October 1810, with 256 students and 52 lecturers in faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy under rector Theodor Schmalz. The university celebrates 15 October 1810 as the date of its opening. From 1828 to 1945, the school was named the Friedrich Wilhelm University, in honor of its founder. Ludwig Feuerbach, then one of the students, made a comment on the university in 1826: \"There is no question here of drinking, duelling and plesant communal outings; in no other university can you find such a passion for work, such an interest for things that are not petty student intrigues, such an inclination for the sciences, such calm and such silence. Compared to this temple of work, the other universities appear like public houses.\"\n\nThe university has been home to many of Germany's greatest thinkers of the past two centuries, among them the subjective idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, the absolute idealist philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, the Romantic legal theorist Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the pessimist philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, the objective idealist philosopher Friedrich Schelling, cultural critic Walter Benjamin, and famous physicists Albert Einstein and Max Planck.\n\nThe founders of Marxist theory Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels attended the university, as did poet Heinrich Heine, novelist Alfred Döblin, founder of structuralism Ferdinand de Saussure, German unifier Otto von Bismarck, Communist Party of Germany founder Karl Liebknecht, African American Pan Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois and European unifier Robert Schuman, as well as the influential surgeon Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach in the early half of the 1800s.\n\nThe structure of German research-intensive universities served as a model for institutions like Johns Hopkins University. Further, it has been claimed that \"the 'Humboldtian' university became a model for the rest of Europe [...] with its central principle being the union of teaching and research in the work of the individual scholar or scientist.\"\n\nIn addition to the strong anchoring of traditional subjects, such as science, law, philosophy, history, theology and medicine, the university developed to encompass numerous new scientific disciplines. Alexander von Humboldt, brother of the founder William, promoted the new learning. With the construction of modern research facilities in the second half of the 19th Century teaching of the natural sciences began. Famous researchers, such as the chemist August Wilhelm Hofmann, the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, the mathematicians Ernst Eduard Kummer, Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass, the physicians Johannes Peter Müller, Albrecht von Graefe, Rudolf Virchow and Robert Koch, contributed to Berlin University's scientific fame.\n\nDuring this period of enlargement, the university gradually expanded to incorporate other previously separate colleges in Berlin. An example would be the Charité, the Pépinière and the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum. In 1717, King Friedrich I had built a quarantine house for Plague at the city gates, which in 1727 was rechristened by the \"soldier king\" Friedrich Wilhelm: \"Es soll das Haus die Charité heißen\" (It will be called Charité [French for \"charity\"]). By 1829 the site became the Friedrich Wilhelm University's medical campus and remained so until 1927 when the more modern University Hospital was constructed.\n\nThe university started a natural history collection in 1810, which, by 1889 required a separate building and became the \"Museum für Naturkunde\". The preexisting Tierarznei School, founded in 1790 and absorbed by the university, in 1934 formed the basis of the Veterinary Medicine Facility (Grundstock der Veterinärmedizinischen Fakultät). Also the Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Berlin (Agricultural University of Berlin), founded in 1881 was affiliated with the Agricultural Faculties of the University.\n\nAfter 1933, like all German universities, Friedrich Wilhelm University was affected by the Nazi regime. The rector during this period was Eugen Fischer. It was from the university's library that some 20,000 books by \"degenerates\" and opponents of the regime were taken to be burned on May 10 of that year in the Opernplatz (now the Bebelplatz) for a demonstration protected by the SA that also featured a speech by Joseph Goebbels. A monument to this can now be found in the center of the square, consisting of a glass panel opening onto an underground white room with empty shelf space for 20,000 volumes and a plaque, bearing an epigraph from an 1820 work by Heinrich Heine: \"Das war ein Vorspiel nur, dort wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man am Ende auch Menschen\" (\"This was but a prelude; where they burn books, they ultimately burn people\").\n\nThe Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (German \"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\") resulted in 250 Jewish professors and employees being fired from Friedrich Wilhelm University during 1933/1934 and numerous doctorates being withdrawn. Students and scholars and political opponents of Nazis were ejected from the university and often deported. During this time nearly one third of all of the staff were fired by the Nazis.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the university was located in East Berlin. It reopened in 1946 as the University of Berlin, but due to communist repression, including the Soviet persecution of liberal and social democrat students, the Free University of Berlin was established as a de facto western successor in West Berlin in 1948, with support from the United States, and retaining traditions and faculty members of the old Friedrich Wilhelm University. The name of the Free University refers to West Berlin's perceived status as part of the Western \"free world,\" in contrast to the \"unfree\" Communist world in general and the \"unfree\" communist-controlled university in East Berlin in particular.\nAlmost immediately, the Soviet occupiers started persecuting non-communists and suppressing academic freedom at the university. This led to strong protests within the student body and faculty. Soviet NKVD secret police arrested a number of students in March 1947 as a response. The Soviet Military Tribunal in Berlin-Lichtenberg ruled the students were involved in the formation of a \"resistance movement at the University of Berlin\", as well as espionage, and were sentenced to 25 years of forced labor. From 1945 to 1948, 18 other students and teachers were arrested or abducted, many gone for weeks, and some taken to the Soviet Union and executed. Many of the students targeted by Soviet persecution were active in the liberal or social democratic resistance against the Soviet-imposed communist dictatorship; the German communist party had regarded the social democrats as their main enemies since the early days of the Weimar Republic.\n\nSince the historical name, Friedrich Wilhelm University, had monarchic origins, the school was officially renamed in 1949. Although the Soviet occupational authorities preferred to name the school after a communist leader, university leaders were able to name it Humboldt University of Berlin, after the two Humboldt brothers, a name that was uncontroversial also in the west and capitalized on the fame of the Humboldt name, which is associated with the Humboldtian model of higher education. After 1990 the name was retained due to its uncontroversial and non-communist nature, and because it had been chosen by the university itself as an act of resistance against naming the university after a communist leader.\n\nAfter the German reunification, the university was radically restructured and all employees were terminated and their positions readvertized. The reasons for the termination were both that the activities at the university under the communist regime had been highly politicized and that membership in the communist party had been the main criterion for employment under the communist regime, while non-communists were systematically discriminated against. The professors were almost entirely replaced with West German professors, several of them from the Free University of Berlin, with no links to communism. Many of the departments, which were considered particularly politicized and tainted by communism, e.g. law, history, philosophy and economics, were entirely dissolved, and new departments with no continuity from the communist-era departments were established. As a result of this purge, the university essentially became a new institution in the West German tradition with little continuity from the institution that existed in East Germany. The decommunization was carried out more vigorously at the Humboldt University than any other university in the former GDR, and the university has continued to take disciplinary action against employees discovered to have links to the East German communist regime in the 25 years that followed; in 2017 a research assistant was dismissed over his past as a Stasi cadet, although the disciplinary action was later reduced to a warning and suspension. The Humboldt University has become a leading institution in the research on the crimes of communism in the GDR and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, with prominent academics such as Jörg Baberowski, an expert on Stalinist violence, genocide and terror against the peoples of Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nToday, Humboldt University is a state university with a large number of students (36,986 in 2014, among them more than 4,662 foreign students) after the model of West German universities, and like its counterpart the Free University of Berlin.\n\nThe university consists of three different campuses, namely Campus Mitte, Campus Nord and Campus Adlershof. Its main building is located in the centre of Berlin at the boulevard Unter den Linden and is the heart of Campus Mitte. The building was erected on order by King Frederick II for his younger brother Prince Henry of Prussia. All the institutes of humanities are located around the main building together with the Department of Law and the Department of Business and Economics. Campus Nord is located north of the main building close to Berlin Hauptbahnhof and is the home of the life science departments including the university medical center Charité. The natural science together with computer science and mathematics are located at Campus Adlershof in the south-east of Berlin. Furthermore, the university continues its tradition of a book sale at the university gates facing Bebelplatz.\n\nThese are the nine faculties into which the university is divided:\n\nFurthermore, there are two independent institutes (\"Zentralinstitute\") that are part of the university:\n\nWhen the Royal Library proved insufficient, a new library was founded in 1831, first located in several temporary sites. In 1871–1874 a library building was constructed, following the design of architect Paul Emanuel Spieker. In 1910 the collection was relocated to the building of the Berlin State Library.\n\nDuring the Weimar Period the library contained 831,934 volumes (1930) and was thus one of the leading university libraries in Germany at that time.\n\nDuring the Nazi book burnings in 1933, no volumes from the university library were destroyed. Also, the loss through World War II was comparatively small. In 2003, natural science related books were outhoused to the newly founded library at the Adlershof campus, which is dedicated solely to the natural sciences.\n\nSince the premises of the State Library had to be cleared in 2005, a new library building is about to be erected close to the main building in the center of Berlin. The \"Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm-Zentrum\" (Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Centre, Grimm Zentrum or GZ as it is can be referred to by students) opened in 2009.\n\nIn total, the university library contains about 6.5 million volumes and 9000 held magazines and journals and is one of the biggest university libraries in Germany.\n\nThe books of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft were destroyed during the Nazi book burnings and the institute destroyed. Under the terms of the Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation, the government had undertaken to continue the work of the institute at the university after its founder's death. However these terms were ignored. In 2001 however the university acquired the Archive for Sexology from the Robert Koch Institute, which was founded on a large private library donated by Erwin J. Haeberle. This has now been housed at the new Magnus Hirschfeld Center.\n\nIn 2018 the British QS World University Rankings ranked Humboldt University 121st overall in the world. Its subject rankings were: 8th in Classics & Ancient History, 24th in Arts & Humanities and 14th in Philosophy.\n\nThe British \"Times Higher Education World University Ranking\" 2018 listed Humboldt-University as the 67th best university in the world and 4th best in Germany.\n\n\nThere are 55 Nobel Prize winners affiliated with the Humboldt University:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4271629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4271629", "title": "Kyōiku mama", "text": "Kyōiku mama\n\nThe \"kyōiku mama\" is one of the best-known and least-liked pop-culture figures in contemporary Japan. The \"kyōiku mama\" is analogous to American stereotypes such as the stage mother who forces her child to achieve show-business success in Hollywood, the stereotypical Chinese tiger mother who takes an enormous amount of effort to direct much of her maternal influence towards developing their children's educational and intellectual achievement, and the Jewish mother's drive for her children to succeed academically and professionally, resulting in a push for perfection and a continual dissatisfaction with anything less or the critical, self-sacrificing mother who coerces her child into medical school or law school.\n\nThe stereotype is that a \"kyōiku mama\" is feared by her children, blamed by the press for school phobias and youth suicides, and envied and resented by the mothers of children who study less and fare less well on exams.\n\nIn the early 1960s, part-time women's labor began at a few major corporations in Japan and was adopted by other companies within a decade. It became popular among married women in the 1970s and even more so in 1985.\n\nWomen's return to the workplace is often explained in a two-fold way: by financial demands to complement the family budget, and by psychological demands to relate themselves to society.\n\nChild-rearing women in the 1960s inspired the media to produce the idiom kyōiku mama, which referred to \"the domestic counterpart of sararii-man\" (salaryman). This encompassed a major responsibility to \"rear children, especially the males, to successfully pass the competitive tests needed to enter high school and college\". No such idiom emerged that deemed men \"education papas\"; it was \"mamas\" who became a social phenomenon.\n\nThe education system and larger political economy it serves influence why mothers become obsessed with children's education. Social prejudices influence media stereotypes of \"kyōiku mamas\" that blame women rather than political conditions. Getting a good, steady job in the future very much depends on getting into a good university, which depends on attaining high scores on the national university exams in a student's last year of high school. Ordinary people, including mothers, feel powerless to change this system.\n\nAs a result, there is a clear map pointing students to the right nursery school that leads to the right kindergarten, the best elementary school, junior high school, and high school, all of which may be associated with prestigious universities. To ensure these results, some parents have been known to commit unethical or illegal acts to promote their child's success.\n\nIn one case, a restaurant owner paid a $95,000 bribe in an attempt to get his child enrolled in Aoyama Gakuin, a prestigious kindergarten for children who are three or four years old. Because of the kindergarten's affiliation with an elite university, parents are willing to go to extreme lengths to get their children enrolled. Aoyama Gakuin has room for 40 new students a year. Every year, it receives more than 2000 hopeful applicants. The tests the potential students take are known to be extremely difficult.\n\nThe issue is compounded by the notion that most important job positions in business and government are held by graduates of the University of Tokyo. In addition, which university a student attends is believed to affect one's choices for a future spouse. Because a child's life appears to be determined by what schools he or she attends, many mothers take extraordinary measures to get children into good schools.\n\nThe older generation of Japanese grew up in larger households than those normally found in Japan today. Back then, \"ikuji\" (, \"child-raising\") included a larger surrounding environment, made up of more relatives and extended family, and more children: siblings and cousins. Children who grew up in that time learned responsibilities through the care of younger siblings. These children relied on themselves in the outside world through much of their childhood lives. In those days, child-raising was more of a private matter, handled only by the child's surrounding family.\n\nIn the 1970s, men's wages decreased and women left home earlier to find jobs. These women \"considered themselves free\" after the child's junior high education. The previous generation did not feel this until after the child had finished high school.\n\nIn contemporary Japan, couples are having fewer children and teaching the children self-reliance. This involves consulting child-raising professionals. This new need in professional advice is commonly termed \"child-raising neurosis\" by professionals. Reliance on professionals has largely created a new generation of young mothers with low self-confidence in their child-raising abilities. Indeed, most Japanese mothers today grew up in smaller families with only one or two children. Their mothers provided them with everything they needed and gave them little to no responsibilities involving their siblings. Thus, that generation of children has grown up to become mothers who have no idea how to raise their children.\n\nIn addition, in contemporary Japan there are mothers who completely devote themselves to child-raising. Another subtype, described by Nishioka Rice, is the \"kosodate mama\" (), who adds psychosociological elements into child-raising. In addition to providing for her a good education, she develops an emotional and psychological relationship with her children. One way to do this is through \"skinship\"—being in constant close physical contact with her children. This could, for example, involve carrying her child on her back wherever she goes or bathing with her children every night. Through skinship, \"ittaikan\" () is achieved, a \"one-ness and balanced, positively valenced dependency\" between mother and child.\n\nIn Japan, a mother who works is commonly seen as selfish in a society where child-raising is linked directly with the physical closeness between mother and child. This emphasis can be a cause of the development of a \"kyōiku mama\" who always worries about her children's education success. This produces children that society views as lacking self-reliance, antisocial, and selfish.\n\nWhen compared to American mothers, Japanese mothers have a stronger belief in effort as opposed to innate ability. Japanese children see their efforts as necessary to fulfill a social obligation to family, peers, and community. Children are forced to focus on their effort, seeing it as the cause of success. According to society, if a child does not succeed, they were not trying hard enough. This is unrelated to the child's grades; children always need to put forth more effort. Mothers pressure children because they are held strongly accountable for their children's actions.\n\nIt is very hard to find daycare in some parts of Japan, and it is socially looked down upon if a mother sends her child to one. The mother is seen as insufficient, not having the skills to raise a child on her own, or selfish, giving her child over to a caretaker while she pursues her own separate goals.\n\nThe term \"kyōiku mama\" became used in other similar contexts. For example, the former Ministry of International Trade and Industry was dubbed \"kyōiku mama\" for its approach and initiatives in guiding industrial growth.\n\nHousewives are surrounded by popular media that encourages their actions. Daytime television, magazines, products, and services for mothers are largely focused on improving the home and raising the children. Thus, the job of motherhood is taken very seriously by mothers in Japan. A common description of a mother’s free time is “three meals and a nap.”\n\nKyōiku mamas, preparatory preschools, and heavily academic curricula exist in Japan, yet they are relatively rare and concentrated in urban, wealthy areas. Kyōiku mamas are prominent in the middle classes. Middle-class women train the children, the next generation of the middle class. In a speech at the 1909 Mitsukoshi children's exhibition, First Higher School principal Nitobe Inazō asserted, \"The education of a citizenry begins not with the infant but with the education of a country's mothers.\"\n\nIn the post-World War II era in Japan, the mother was the creator of a new child-centered world stamped with middle-class values. The mother was linked with the success of the child's education. A woman was expected to be a \"good wife, wise mother\" and became the single most important figure in raising the child to become a successful future adult. Mothers needed to put their efforts into raising and teaching their children. Through self-cultivation and rearing of the children, the woman was crucial to a family's ability to claim a place in the so-called middle stratum.\n\nAs education credentials became the recognized prerequisite to social advancement in the early 20th century, \"kyōiku mama\" actively looked to the education system, especially admission into middle school for boys and higher school for girls, to help improve the family's social position. The competition to pass the entrance examination to middle school and girls' higher school became intense, creating the social phenomenon known as \"shiken jigoku\" (): examination hell. While \"risshin shusse\" (), or rising in the world, was the clarion call of the mass of the middle class, there was no \"risshin shusse\" without a \"kyōiku mama\". For the education mother, making the child into a superior student was a concern that began with the child's entrance into elementary school at age six and extended to all aspects of the child's education.\n\nWorking-class mothers are not as intensely active in their children's education as middle-class mothers. An ethnographic study by Shimizu Tokuda (1991) portrayed one middle school that faced persistent academic problems in a working-class neighborhood of Osaka. The study illustrated efforts by teachers to improve the student’s academic performance: providing tests, promoting monthly teacher discussions, painting walls to enhance the study environment, and restricting hours spent in extracurricular activities. While students' enrollment in high school slightly improved, academic achievement level remained lower than the national average. This study revealed that students' academic problems were deeply related to their home environments. Most students had parents who were uneducated and not involved in their children's education.\n\nIn contrast to Japan's mostly negative images of \"kyōiku mamas\", American leaders who put forth the image of \"superhuman Japan\" to boost American education performance extolled Japan's education-minded mothers. Both of Ronald Reagan's education secretaries focused attention on Japanese mothers as mirrors to improve American families and schools. Reagan's first Secretary of Education, Terrel Bell (credited for the wording of \"A Nation at Risk\") wrote an enthusiastic foreword to Guy Odom's \"Mothers, Leadership and Success\"—a book whose basic point was that only vigorous, aggressive and intelligent Super Moms exemplified by Japanese mothers could reinvigorate America. William J. Bennett, head of the Department of Education in Reagan's second term, praised Japan's \"one parent on the scene\" who \"stays in touch with the teachers, supervises the homework, arranges extra instructional help if needed, and buttresses the child's motivation to do well in school and beyond\".\n\nMany Japanese mothers dedicate much time to get their children from one entrance exam to another. At the national university entrance exams, held in Tokyo, most mothers travel with their children to the examination hall. They arrive and stay at a nearby hotel, grilling their children on last-minute statistics and making sure that they are not late to the exam.\n\nSome mothers are beginning their children's education at even younger ages. A 30-year-old mother in Japan says, \"This is my first baby, and I didn't know how to play with her or help her develop\". She sends her 6-month-old daughter to a pre-pre-school in Tokyo. A headmaster at another pre-pre-school claims that the school, for children one year or older, helps to nurture and develop the children's curiosity through \"tangerine-peeling or collecting and coloring snow\".\n\nMothers are essentially in heavy competition with other mothers who want their children to get into the elite universities. In some cases, to make it seem like her own child is not studying as much, mothers will let their child use the parents' bedroom to study while the mothers watch television in the living room. Other mothers who pass by the house will see the child's bedroom light off, assuming that the child has shirked his or her studies to watch television. The next morning, the mother will report what happened on the shows to her child, who will go to school and talk about it to his or her classmates, who will also assume that their friend is a slacker, lowering their expectations of their friend and for themselves. However, when examination time rolls around, the \"slacker\" will be admitted into an elite school while his or her friends will drop behind.\n\n\"Kyōiku mamas\" often give their children a big first appearance in the neighborhood through a \"kōen debyū\" (), where the mothers \"parade their offspring around the neighborhood parks for approval\".\n\nMothers send their children to cram schools (juku), where children may stay until 10 or 11pm. Japan has over 35,000 cram schools for college examinations. In addition to cram schools, children are sent to calligraphy, keyboard, abacus, or kendo classes. As revealed by Marie Thorsten, moral panics about juku and education mamas occurred at the same time, in the 1970s. \"As 'second schools', the juku, as consumer services, appealed to mothers’ anxieties about their children, shaping the image of the 'normal' mother as one who sends her children to juku and stays up to date with commercialized trends in examination preparation.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, full-time mothers devoted themselves to a smaller number of children. Parental stress resulted in the commonality of new childhood problems; these include bronchial asthma, stammering, poor appetite, proneness to bone fractures, and school phobia. Children were aware they were their mother's purpose in life. Mothers played the role of their children's school teachers while they were at home.\n\nSometimes, a child who grows up with a \"kyōiku mama\" turns into a \"tenuki okusan\" (, \"hands-off housewife\"). This stereotype describes women who typically have jobs and are not around the children as much, essentially becoming the female version of the stereotypical absent Japanese father, a \"leisure-time parent\" or \"Sunday friend\". These mothers are said to not do a lot of homemaking, commonly making large, freezable meals that are easy to reheat in case they are not home or too busy to do the cooking. They do not attempt to represent their families in the community through participation in their children's school PTA and other community functions.\n\nCompared to modern American children, Japanese youths have less drug use, depression, violence, and teenage pregnancy, although these may be caused due to harsher laws and intrinsic social values in the Japanese culture.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Education has admitted that the education system and parental pressure are taking their toll on children. Education reforms that the Ministry of Education has enacted beginning in the 1970s have challenged Japan’s egalitarian school system. To decrease academic pressure among students from examination competition, the Ministry of Education cut school hours and increased non-academic activities such as recess and clubs in elementary and junior high schools.\n\nIn 2002, the central government reduced school hours again, decreased content, and introduced a new curriculum at all public elementary schools to encourage individual students' learning interests and motivation. The Japanese Ministry of Education published a white paper stating that children do not have opportunities such as \"coming into contact with nature, feeling awe and respect for life, and experiencing the importance of hard work learning from difficulties\".\n\nPost-war Japan in the 1950s made it a \"national mission to accelerate its education program. Children of this era had to distinguish themselves from peers at an early age if they hoped to get into a top university. Entrance exams for these children began in kindergarten.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, pressure to achieve in children created the need for specialty schools. Seventy percent of students continued their long school day at juku or \"cram schools\".\n\nIn the 1980s, a series of suicides linked to school pressures began. Elementary and middle school students took their lives after failing entrance exams.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the economic collapse in Japan (after its global economic dominance in the previous decade) led to a loss of motivation by students. The once highly touted academic ratings of Japan in math and science fell behind those of American levels. The stress began to lead to classroom disruption.\n\nIn 2001, the National Education Research Institute found that 33 percent of teachers and principals polled said that they had witnessed a complete breakdown of class \"over a continuous period\" due to defiant children \"engaging in arbitrary activity\". In 2002, the Japanese Education Ministry — pressured by the need to reform — eliminated 30 percent of its core curriculum. This freed up time for students to learn in groups according to the students' chosen path.\n\nThe use of the term \"mukatsuku\", meaning \"irritating and troublesome\", has been rising in use among students as a description of the feelings they experience of being fed up with teachers, parents, and life.\n\n"}

The United States was where Model United Nations originated and was popularized, and is also where many of the world's most respected conferences are held. The U.S. has several regional centers of Model UN, each with its own distinct style.\n\nTraditionally, Model UN has been associated with affluent schools and communities, but in recent years, the activity has expanded to reach more students.\n\nModel United Nations is popular across the United States, with MUN clubs and conferences being found in every region. However, because of the fact that Model UN is decentralized and has grown autonomously, there are significant differences in how MUN is done between regions.\n\nCentered on the New York and Washington metropolitan areas, both of which play host to a multitude of prestigious, largely university-hosted conferences, including those of Georgetown University (Georgetown International Relations Association) and George Washington University. Other conferences in the region include HMUN, hosted by Harvard, JHUMUNC hosted at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and NMUN, hosted in New York City. The Northeast has established a reputation for approaching Model United Nations with an idealistic philosophy, while still emphasizing the academic competition aspect of Model UN and giving awards for delegates. Conferences also evaluate delegates holistically when deciding on the distribution of awards. Crisis committees are especially popular in the Northeast, and lead to this region's conferences having more of a focus on creativity.\n\nThe West Coast is known for their Model United Nations programs. Naturally stressing the academic side of Model UN, conferences greatly value well-written position papers, not just factoring them into awards decisions, but also giving dedicated awards for them. The popularity of Model United Nations, as well as for the high quality of delegates. West Coast conferences are run by universities, high schools, and interscholastic organizations. BMUN (Berkeley MUN), McKennaMUN, and SCMUN are popular college conferences for high school delegates. For example, SCMUN (hosted by the University of Southern California), offers advanced debate for high school delegates who are hoping to glean substantive and academic value from Model United Nations conferences. Additionally, high school-run conferences such as Huntington Beach High School's Surf City and Novice Conferences, CHSMUN, and Mira Costa's LAIMUN are all nationally-recognized conferences.\n\nDespite the fact that the Midwest has fewer conferences than the more established East and West Coast circuits, it still has a very developed and distinct Model UN culture that is dominated by small regional conferences (such as Midwest Model UN (MMUN), Model UN at the University of Illinois (MUNI), and large international-level conferences centered around Chicago). While some major conferences are located in Michigan and Missouri, most are located in Illinois, specifically in Chicago.\n\nChicago is a major hub of the Model UN community at large, but maintains a strong sense of independence, and is known to have a characteristic focus on realism and innovative crisis simulations. MUN is mostly seen as an educational political exercise, where the students understanding of the world and power is emphasized, and where awards and resolution writing tend to be de-emphasized. As a result, the Midwest's crisis conferences are well-regarded, with ChoMUN and CIMUN being particularly well known for this style.\n\nModel United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC) is the largest high school conference in the Midwest, featuring 27 different committees, with several thousand delegates in attendance. The Model United Nations Development Organization (MUNDO) runs the Chicago International Model United Nations (CIMUN), which featured 24 committees, and welcomed 1300 high school delegates in 2014, its 11th annual conference. CIMUN is known to be among the most innovative and fastest growing Model UN's in the US and features some of the most realistic simulations available for high school students.\n\nThe Chicago Model United Nations (ChoMUN), also organized by the University of Chicago, is a prestigious college-level Model UN conference in the region, being well known for its unique simulations, and is known to be one of the best college-level crisis conferences in the US. The American Model United Nations (AMUN), an independent organization, is the largest college-level conference in the Midwest and featured 15 committees. In 2014, AMUN welcomed 1400 delegates from around the US and the globe, and also celebrated its 25th anniversary.\n\nIn recent years, more Midwestern teams have also traveled to conferences on the East Coast, raising their profile nationally. High schools, such as the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, St. Ignatius College Prep, Lyons Township High School, Glenbrook South High School, and Carl Sandburg High School have performed well at large East Coast conferences and have become particularly well-known. University teams have also been successful, such as UChicago's team which in both 2013 and 2014 was ranked the best college Model UN team in North America, the first team to twice achieve this feat. Other teams like Alma College, UW Oshkosh and University of Illinois - Chicago have made a name for themselves at larger conferences like National Model UN (NMUN) and American Model UN (AMUN), and at regional conferences like Midwest Model UN (MMUN).\n\nIn addition to the city of Chicago, several Minnesota teams have become major players in conferences around the country. In the 2010-2011 season, Cambridge-Isanti finished the year ranked 14th in the best delegate national rankings after finishing the equivalent of second at MUNUC and winning awards at UMMUC. Edina High School hosts the only student run conference in Minnesota, often attracting up to four hundred high school delegates from over twelve metropolitan schools. Edina High School and Cambridge-Isanti High School are still ranked in the top 150 high school programs in the country by Best Delegate. Other notable Minnesota teams include Minnetonka High School and the Blake School.\n\nMiddle school Model UN is fairly popular in the South. The vibrant South region of Model UN in the U.S. can be easily divided into three sub-regions, San Antonio, Texas, Southwest Florida, and Virginia. All excel at Model UN and have distinct styles.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, students are bilingual and speeches in committee are therefore allowed to be made in either English or Spanish. It should be noted however that Spanish is used slightly more often.\n\nThe speaking style of Puerto Rican Model UN delegates tends to be more animated than that of other delegates. Students often speak louder and faster, and when delivering speeches, they may pace in front of their committee instead of standing still.\n\nAfter a speech, if a delegate wishes to ask a question of the speaker they must ask “Delegates, will you accept my question?” before being able to address the speaker. This is a practice isolated to Puerto Rico, and delegates may be penalized by their chairs if they fail to adhere to it.\n\nChairs in Puerto Rico adopt a more activist approach, directing the flow of debate and banging their gavels often. This is in comparison to the facilitator style of chairing more common in the rest of the United States which allows delegates to direct more of the flow of debate.\n\nParents in Puerto Rico are highly supportive of Model UN and some are even alumni. It is not uncommon for parents to volunteer to help at conferences, and many are present at closing ceremonies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56223", "title": "Piltdown Man", "text": "Piltdown Man\n\nThe Piltdown Man was a paleoanthropological hoax in which bone fragments were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human. In 2016, the results of an extensive scientific review established that amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson had very likely perpetrated the hoax. \n\nIn 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that he had discovered the \"missing link\" between ape and man. In February 1912, Dawson contacted Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum, stating he had found a section of a human-like skull in Pleistocene gravel beds near Piltdown, East Sussex. That summer, Dawson and Smith Woodward purportedly discovered more bones and artifacts at the site, which they connected to the same individual. These finds included a jawbone, more skull fragments, a set of teeth, and primitive tools.\n\nSmith Woodward reconstructed the skull fragments and hypothesised that they belonged to a human ancestor from 500,000 years ago. The discovery was announced at a Geological Society meeting and was given the Latin name \"Eoanthropus dawsoni\" (\"Dawson's dawn-man\"). The questionable significance of the assemblage remained the subject of considerable controversy until it was conclusively exposed in 1953 as a forgery. It was found to have consisted of the altered mandible and some teeth of an orangutan deliberately combined with the cranium of a fully developed, though small-brained, modern human.\n\nThe Piltdown hoax is prominent for two reasons: the attention it generated around the subject of human evolution, and the length of time, 41 years, that elapsed from its alleged initial discovery to its definitive exposure as a composite forgery.\n\nAt a meeting of the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a fragment of the skull four years earlier. According to Dawson, workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised coconut. Revisiting the site on several occasions, Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to Arthur Smith Woodward, keeper of the geological department at the British Museum. Greatly interested by the finds, Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site. Though the two worked together between June and September 1912, Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw bone. The skull unearthed in 1908 was the only find discovered in situ, with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit's spoil heaps.\n\nAt the same meeting, Woodward announced that a reconstruction of the fragments indicated that the skull was in many ways similar to that of a modern human, except for the occiput (the part of the skull that sits on the spinal column), and brain size, which was about two-thirds that of a modern human. He went on to indicate that, save for two human-like molar teeth, the jaw bone was indistinguishable from that of a modern, young chimpanzee. From the British Museum's reconstruction of the skull, Woodward proposed that Piltdown Man represented an evolutionary missing link between apes and humans, since the combination of a human-like cranium with an ape-like jaw tended to support the notion then prevailing in England that human evolution began with the brain.\n\nAlmost from the outset, Woodward's reconstruction of the Piltdown fragments was strongly challenged by some researchers. At the Royal College of Surgeons, copies of the same fragments used by the British Museum in their reconstruction were used to produce an entirely different model, one that in brain size and other features resembled a modern human. This reconstruction, by Prof. (later Sir) Arthur Keith, was called \"Homo piltdownensis\" in reflection of its more human appearance. The find was also considered legitimate by Otto Schoetensack who had discovered the Heidelberg fossils just a few years earlier; he described it as being the best evidence for an ape-like ancestor of modern humans. French Jesuit paleontologist and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin participated in the uncovering of the Piltdown skull with Woodward.\n\nWoodward's reconstruction included ape-like canine teeth, which was itself controversial. In August 1913, Woodward, Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin began a systematic search of the spoil heaps specifically to find the missing canines. Teilhard de Chardin soon found a canine that, according to Woodward, fitted the jaw perfectly. A few days later, Teilhard de Chardin moved to France and took no further part in the discoveries. Noting that the tooth \"corresponds exactly with that of an ape\", Woodward expected the find to end any dispute over his reconstruction of the skull. However, Keith attacked the find. Keith pointed out that human molars are the result of side to side movement when chewing. The canine in the Piltdown jaw was impossible as it prevented side to side movement. To explain the wear on the molar teeth, the canine could not have been any higher than the molars. Grafton Elliot Smith, a fellow anthropologist, sided with Woodward, and at the next Royal Society meeting claimed that Keith's opposition was motivated entirely by ambition. Keith later recalled, \"Such was the end of our long friendship.\"\n\nAs early as 1913, David Waterston of King's College London published in \"Nature\" his conclusion that the sample consisted of an ape mandible and human skull. Likewise, French paleontologist Marcellin Boule concluded the same thing in 1915. A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller concluded that Piltdown's jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed-down teeth.\n\nIn 1915, Dawson claimed to have found three fragments of a second skull (Piltdown II) at a new site about two miles away from the original finds. Woodward attempted several times to elicit the location from Dawson, but was unsuccessful. So far as is known, the site was never identified and the finds appear largely undocumented. Woodward did not present the new finds to the Society until five months after Dawson's death in August 1916 and deliberately implied that he knew where they had been found. In 1921, Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of the American Museum of Natural History, examined the Piltdown and Sheffield Park finds and declared that the jaw and skull belonged together \"without question\" and that the Sheffield Park fragments \"...were exactly those which we should have selected to confirm the comparison with the original type.\"\n\nThe Sheffield Park finds were taken as proof of the authenticity of the Piltdown Man; it may have been chance that brought an ape's jaw and a human skull together, but the odds of its happening twice were slim. Even Keith conceded to this new evidence, though he still harbored personal doubts.\n\nOn 23 July 1938, at Barkham Manor, Piltdown, Sir Arthur Keith unveiled a memorial to mark the site where Piltdown Man was discovered by Charles Dawson. Sir Arthur finished his speech saying:\n\nThe inscription on the memorial stone reads:\n\nFrom the outset, some scientists expressed scepticism about the Piltdown find (see above). G.S. Miller, for example, observed in 1915 that \"deliberate malice could hardly have been more successful than the hazards of deposition in so breaking the fossils as to give free scope to individual judgment in fitting the parts together\". In the decades prior to its exposure as a forgery in 1953, scientists increasingly regarded Piltdown as an enigmatic aberration inconsistent with the path of hominid evolution as demonstrated by fossils found elsewhere.\n\nIn November 1953, \"Time\" magazine published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner proving that the Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was a composite of three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year-old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and chromic acid. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet.\n\nThe Piltdown Man hoax succeeded so well because, at the time of its discovery, the scientific establishment believed that the large modern brain preceded the modern omnivorous diet, and the forgery provided exactly that evidence. It has also been thought that nationalism and cultural prejudice played a role in the less-than-critical acceptance of the fossil as genuine by some British scientists. It satisfied European expectations that the earliest humans would be found in Eurasia, and the British, it has been claimed, also wanted a \"first Briton\" to set against fossil hominids found elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe identity of the Piltdown forger remains unknown, but suspects have included Dawson, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Arthur Keith, Martin A. C. Hinton, Horace de Vere Cole and Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nThe focus on Charles Dawson as the main forger is supported by the accumulation of evidence regarding other archaeological hoaxes he perpetrated in the decade or two before the Piltdown discovery. The archaeologist Miles Russell of Bournemouth University analysed Dawson's antiquarian collection, and determined that at least 38 of his specimens were fakes. Among these were the teeth of a reptile/mammal hybrid, \"Plagiaulax dawsoni\", \"found\" in 1891 (and whose teeth had been filed down in the same way that the teeth of Piltdown Man were to be some 20 years later); the so-called \"shadow figures\" on the walls of Hastings Castle; a unique hafted stone axe; the Bexhill boat (a hybrid seafaring vessel); the Pevensey bricks (allegedly the latest datable \"finds\" from Roman Britain); the contents of the Lavant Caves (a fraudulent \"flint mine\"); the Beauport Park \"Roman\" statuette (a hybrid iron object); the Bulverhythe Hammer (shaped with an iron knife in the same way as the Piltdown elephant bone implement would later be); a fraudulent \"Chinese\" bronze vase; the Brighton \"Toad in the Hole\" (a toad entombed within a flint nodule); the English Channel sea serpent; the Uckfield Horseshoe (another hybrid iron object) and the Lewes Prick Spur. Of his antiquarian publications, most demonstrate evidence of plagiarism or at least naive referencing, Russell wrote: \"Piltdown was not a 'one-off' hoax, more the culmination of a life's work.\" In addition, Harry Morris, an acquaintance of Dawson, had come into possession of one of the flints obtained by Dawson at the Piltdown gravel pit. He suspected that it had been artificially aged – \"stained by C. Dawson with intent to defraud\". He remained deeply suspicious of Dawson for many years to come, though he never sought to discredit him publicly, possibly because it would have been an argument against the eolith theory, which Morris strongly supported.\n\nProfessor Adrian Lister of the UK's Natural History Museum has said that \"some people have suggested\" that there may also have been a second 'fraudster' seeking to use outrageous fraud in the hope of anonymously exposing the original frauds. This was a theory first proposed by Miles Russell. He has explained that the piece nicknamed the 'cricket bat' (a fossilised elephant bone) was such a crudely forged 'early tool' that it may have been planted to cast doubt upon the other finds, the 'Earliest Englishman' in effect being recovered with the earliest evidence for the game of cricket. This seems to have been part of a wider attempt, by disaffected members of the Sussex archaeological community, to expose Dawson's activities, other examples being the obviously fraudulent 'Maresfield Map', the 'Ashburnham Dial', and the 'Piltdown Palaeolith'. Nevertheless, the 'cricket bat' was accepted at the time, even though it aroused the suspicions of some and ultimately helped lead to the eventual recognition of the fraud decades later.\n\nIn 2016, the results of an eight-year review of the forgery were released, identifying Dawson's modus operandi. Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of the stain, packing of crevices with local gravel, and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist's putty. Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan. The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not rule out the possibility that someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson, but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time.\n\nStephen Jay Gould judges that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was the main culprit of the Piltdown forgery. Teilhard de Chardin had travelled to regions of Africa where one of the anomalous finds originated, and resided in the Wealden area from the date of the earliest finds. Hinton left a trunk in storage at the Natural History Museum in London that in 1970 was found to contain animal bones and teeth carved and stained in a manner similar to the carving and staining on the Piltdown finds. Phillip Tobias implicated Arthur Keith in helping Dawson by detailing the history of the investigation of the hoax, dismissing other theories, and listing inconsistencies in Keith's statements and actions. Other investigations suggest that the hoax involved accomplices rather than a single forger.\n\nIn 1912, the majority of the scientific community believed the Piltdown Man was the “missing link” between apes and humans. However, over time the Piltdown Man lost its validity, as other discoveries such as Taung Child and Peking Man were found. R. W. Ehrich and G. M. Henderson note, “To those who are not completely disillusioned by the work of their predecessors, the disqualification of the Piltdown skull changes little in the broad evolutionary pattern. The validity of the specimen has always been questioned.” Eventually, during the 1940s and 1950s, more advanced dating technologies, such as the fluorine absorption test, proved scientifically that this skull was actually a fraud.\n\nThe Piltdown Man fraud significantly affected early research on human evolution. Notably, it led scientists down a blind alley in the belief that the human brain expanded in size before the jaw adapted to new types of food. Discoveries of Australopithecine fossils such as the Taung child found by Raymond Dart during the 1920s in South Africa were ignored due to the support for Piltdown Man as \"the missing link,\" and the reconstruction of human evolution was confused for decades. The examination and debate over Piltdown Man caused a vast expenditure of time and effort on the fossil, with an estimated 250+ papers written on the topic.\n\nThe fossil was introduced as evidence by Clarence Darrow in defense of John Scopes during the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. Darrow died in 1938, fifteen years before Piltdown Man was exposed as a fraud.\n\nCreationists often cite the hoax (along with Nebraska Man) as evidence of an alleged dishonesty of paleontologists who study human evolution, despite the fact that scientists themselves had exposed the Piltdown hoax (and the Nebraska Man incident was not a deliberate fraud).\n\nIn November 2003, the Natural History Museum in London held an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the exposure of the fraud.\n\nThe Piltdown case is an example of how racial and nationalist factors shaped some science at the time. Piltdown's semi-human features were explained by reference to non-white ethnicities whom some Europeans of that time considered a lower form of human. The influence of nationalism is clear in the differing interpretations of the find: whilst the majority of British scientists accepted the discovery as \"the earliest Englishman\", European and American scientists were considerably more sceptical, and several suggested at the time that the skull and jaw were from two different creatures and had been accidentally mixed up. Regarding the sex of the find, it was discussed as a male, although Woodward suggested that the specimen discovered might be female. The only exception to this was in coverage by the \"Daily Express\" newspaper, which referred to the discovery as a woman, but only to use it to mock the Suffragette movement of the time, of which the \"Express\" was highly critical.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It ran in parallel to the university admissions system, UCCA, as well as the Central Register and Clearing House, which dealt with teacher-training applications to both polytechnics and specialist teacher training colleges, and ADAR which originally handled art and design course admissions to both polytechnics and specialist art and design colleges. All these admissions systems are now united within the UCAS admissions system.\n\nThe establishment of the teacher training admission system, the Central Register and Clearing House, in 1933, and the central admissions system for British universities, called UCCA, in 1961 had shown the benefits of a single admission system for higher education applicants. Although the polytechnics were degree-teaching institutions, through the CNAA awards system, they were not eligible for admission to UCCA as it was reserved only for universities with degree awarding powers. Despite this the Polytechnics (see Polytechnic (United Kingdom) were involved as early as 1972 in discussions with UCCA and the Central Register and Clearing House about the possible future shape of one or more admissions systems. At this stage applicants dealt directly with each polytechnic and the polytechnics themselves were strongly regional or local in their appeal. A study in 1977 found that between sixty and seventy per cent of those admitted to a polytechnic had applied to that institution only, and that forty per cent of admissions to polytechnics resulted from applications made in August or September of the year of entry.\n\nIn 1983 the Committee of Directors of Polytechnics began negotiations with UCCA to share its computing, technical and office facilities in Cheltenham to establish a course entrance system, based on the existing model used by UCCA. A grant of £210,000, from the British Department for Education and Science, was awarded to set up a new unified admissions system, provisionally called PUCCA. However, instead of a unified system for both the universities and polytechnics a separate system for polytechnics emerged from the negotiations, modelled on UCCA, but known as PCAS. \nThe PCAS name was chosen as the Department for Education and Science grant was conditional upon the new scheme being made available for applications to Colleges of Higher Education later on. It was thought that the PCAS acronym could remain if the organization's name needed to be changed to Polytechnics' & Colleges' Admissions Service.\n\nApplicants to courses were given the option to apply separately for universities or polytechnics, or for both.\n\nThe PCAS system came into effect in 1985. It was led by its first Chief Executive, Tony Higgins, and in the first year it handled around 140,000 applications to polytechnic courses, of whom 40,000 a year went on to study at polytechnics.\n\nAlthough many polytechnics offered art and design programmes, and some also offered teacher training courses, these admissions systems remained outside PCAS.\n\nAlthough the aim to create a unified application system for universities and polytechnics was not achieved in 1985, the Chief Executive of PCAS, Tony Higgins, continued to push for the merger of PCAS with UCCA. In 1992, following the change of status and name of most polytechnics to universities, the two bodied did combine under Higgins's leadership. Initially the application form was branded jointly UCCA/PCAS, but in 1994 the new merged body was renamed UCAS.\n"}

The seeming paradox is explained by noting that lack of support for affirmative action comes from conservative ideology, such that opponents of government policies intended to realize racial equality are not necessarily hypocrites. Individuals may also agree with the principle but feel that the policies do not actually help to achieve the stated principle.\n\nA more global example is the strong international desire for a clean and health environment compared to the lack of enthusiasm for the type of regulations and taxes that would be needed to achieve this.\n\nThe principle-policy puzzle was described in \"Reasoning and Choice\" (1991) by Paul M.

{"id": "1256923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1256923", "title": "Stratovision", "text": "Stratovision\n\nStratovision was an airborne television transmission relay system from aircraft flying at high altitudes. In 1945 the Glenn L. Martin Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corporation advocated television coverage of small towns and rural areas as well as the large metropolitan centers by fourteen aircraft that would provide coverage for approximately 78% of the people in the United States. This system has been used for domestic broadcasting in the United States, and used by the U.S. military in South Vietnam and other countries.\n\nBecause the broadcasting antenna for Stratovision is usually hung beneath the aircraft in flight, it naturally has a great command of Line-of-sight propagation. Although transmission distances are dependent upon atmospheric conditions, a transmitting antenna above the Earth's surface has a line of sight distance of approximately .\n\nA Stratovision 25 kW transmitter operating from at 600 MHz will achieve a field intensity of 2 millivolts per meter for a high receiving antenna up to away from the aircraft.\n\nStratovision tests were undertaken between June 1948 to February 1949. The first phase was undertaken by the Glenn L. Martin Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corporation using a twin-engine PV-2 aircraft flying at that transmitted with 250 watts on 107.5 MHz and 5 kW on 514 MHz at Baltimore, Maryland so that recordings could be made at various locations ranging from Norfolk, Virginia to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe second phase of testing was undertaken by these companies using a stripped-down B-29 Superfortress flying at . The plane was equipped to receive a relay transmission from WMAR-TV in Baltimore, which was then relayed over a 5 kW video transmitter and a 1 kW audio transmitter for reception on 82-88 MHz with a television set tuned to Channel 6.\n\nThe aircraft received its originating signals from circular dipoles attached to a streamlined eight-foot (2.5 m) mast on top of the aircraft's vertical tail fin. The retractable long broadcasting antenna hung vertically beneath the aircraft. It was composed of a two-element turnstile array for video and a single-element circular dipole for sound transmissions.\n\nThe receivers, transmitters and necessary air-conditioning were all powered by the plane's engines using three 15 kVA, 500 Hz alternators. Without air conditioning the transmitters in the interior of the aircraft would have generated a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) with an outside air temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 degrees Celsius).\n\nOn 23 June 1948 the system's airborne transmitter rebroadcast the Republican National Convention, being held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the surrounding nine-state area during the 9 to 10 pm EDT time period. As part of the activity, a receiver was set up in a hall in Zanesville, Ohio, a small city on the outskirts of the broadcast area (to demonstrate to the invited newspaper reporters that the system was capable of reaching \"small town and farm homes\").\n\nThe tests were watched by many television viewers who sent in reception reports. From these reports it was calculated that Stratovision would require only eight relay planes to provide a transcontinental network and six additional planes to provide coverage to 78 percent of the United States. Mr. Charles Edward Nobles who was the head of Stratovision for Westinghouse said in his report:\n\nIn 1961 a nonprofit organization, Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction, commenced a Stratovision service from the airfield of Purdue University. The effort began as a three-year experiment funded by the Ford Foundation. The program organized, produced and transmitted educational television programs four days a week from a DC-6AB aircraft flying at over the community of Montpelier in north central Indiana.\n\nMPATI delivered its programs to television channels 72 (call sign KS2XGA) and 76 (KS2XGD) in the UHF band, by transmitting videotaped lectures from the aircraft to an estimated potential 5,000,000 students in 13,000 schools and colleges. The aircraft were equipped with two videotape machines and two UHF transmitters.\n\nWhen MPATI signed on it used an \"Indian head\" test pattern card which was shown for five minutes before and between programs. The service ended in 1968 when it became embroiled in legal action over their application of Stratovision in a controversy with the Westinghouse company.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the United States Navy also used Stratovision television technology when it flew \"Operation Blue Eagle\" from 1966 to 1972 over the Saigon area of South Vietnam. The television programs were aimed at two audiences on two channels. One was aimed at the general public and the other was intended for the information and entertainment of US troops who were stationed in South Vietnam.\n\nOn January 3, 1966, \"Broadcasting magazine\" reported:\nVietnam to get airborne TV<br>\nTwo-channel service - one for Vietnamese, other for U.S. servicemen - starts this month\n\"Television broadcasting in South Vietnam ... begins January 21 and it's going to be done from the air. Two airplanes, circling above the ground, will broadcast on two TV channels—one transmitting Saigon government programs; the other U.S. programs. The project is being handled by the U.S. Navy. Also involved are the U.S. Information Agency and the Agency for International Development. Work on modifying two Lockheed Super Constellations has been underway by Navy electronics experts at Andrews Air Force Base ... The project is an outgrowth of a broadcasting plane used by the Navy during the Cuban and Dominican Republic crises when both radio and television were beamed to home in those countries.\"\n\nThe same article went on to report that during the Baseball World Series of October 1965 Stratovision had also been used to bring the games to the troops. The aircraft had picked up Voice of America radio broadcasts from California and relayed the signal to a ground broadcasting station. The Agency for International Development (AID) had purchased through the military Post Exchange Service, 1,000 monochrome, 23-inch television sets modified to operate on a variety of domestic power sources, and which had been airlifted to South Vietnam on December 28, 1965. They were to be put into community facilities around Saigon. AID was also spending $2.4 million to supply a total of 2,500 TV sets to South Vietnam.\n\nThe entire project was under the control of Captain George C. Dixon, USN. He claimed to be installing AM, FM, shortwave and TV transmitters on the aircraft which would get their power from an onboard 100 kW diesel-fueled generator. The planes would not only relay programs from film chain kinescopes and video recorders, but they would also have live cameras to create their own live programs.\n\nGround transmissions would be received from the aircraft on TV sets tuned to channel 11 for Armed Forces Television, and channel 9 for programs in Vietnamese. On radio the broadcasts would be tuned to 1000 kHz for AM and 99.9 MHz for FM.\n\nOn 7 February 1966, Broadcasting magazine reported that after working out a number of technical problems that the first show on channel 9 would begin at 7:30 p.m. and feature South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky and U.S. Ambassador Cabot Lodge in a videotaped production, followed by channel 11 at 8 p.m. with General Westmoreland introducing a two-hour program which incorporated one hour of the Grand Ole Opry filmed in Nashville, Tennessee. After that the Vietnamese channel would be seen for one and half hours a day and the U.S. channel for three hours daily.\n\nOn 8 February 1966 The New York Times reported:\nSouth Vietnamese Watch First TV Show\nThe story reported that the South Vietnamese viewers had to strain their ears because the speakers on the TV sets would need to be amplified if they were going to be heard by a room full of people watching THVN-TV channel 9. The U.S. programming on NWB-TV channel 11 was Bob Hope in a two-hour special called \"Hollywood Salute to Vietnam\", followed by half-an-hour of the \"Grand Ole Opry\" and another half-hour of the quiz show \"I've Got a Secret\". The regular line-up of shows included Bonanza, \"Perry Mason, The Ed Sullivan Show\", and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\".\n\nEC-130 Commando Solo was used in propaganda warfare during 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with questionable success. Production was very cheap, below local TV standards in Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with slide show and narration based news. Quality of reception was very poor and area of coverage was rather small.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the EC-130 Commando Solo has been used to broadcast information and propaganda for the United States over a variety of television and radio frequencies. It has been used in several areas of operation, including Bosnia and Iraq.\n\nIn 1969 news stories began to appear in the United Kingdom that Ronan O'Rahilly, the founder of the pirate radio ship based service called Radio Caroline, which at that time was not on the air, was about to launch Caroline Television instead. His plans called for two aircraft, one in service and one as a relief, which would transmit commercial television programs to Britain by Stratovision. Although these stories continued for some time nothing became of the project. To date no pirate radio or television service has ever operated by means of Stratovision.\n\nToday the Stratovision concept is used as a stop-gap measure where land based transmitters are not possible and where large areas of territory need to be served with a television program. Due to the advent of fibre optic cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite services, Stratovision has become unnecessary as a permanent means of television delivery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "463876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=463876", "title": "Transport Tycoon", "text": "Transport Tycoon\n\nTransport Tycoon is a video game designed and programmed by Chris Sawyer, and published by MicroProse in 1994. It is a business simulation game, presented in an isometric view in 2D with graphics by Simon Foster, in which the player acts as an entrepreneur in control of a transport company, and can compete against rival companies to make as much profit as possible by transporting passengers and various goods by road, rail, sea and air.\n\nTransport Tycoon Deluxe is an expanded and improved version of the original game, released in 1995. A version for Android and iOS was released on 3 October 2013 using assets from the sequel, \"Chris Sawyer's Locomotion\". A fan-made game engine recreation \"OpenTTD\" is also available.\n\nTo start building a transport empire, the player must construct transport routes, consisting of stations near industries or towns, and in the case of trains or road vehicles, near physical routes. One transport route can utilize several different forms of transport, e.g. truck→ship→train. The player's company and the individual stations each have ratings that depend largely on their efficiency at moving goods from one stations to the other. A station with high ratings may attract more goods.\n\nThe game begins in 1930, and ends in 2030. The player starts out by borrowing money to finance construction of transport facilities, and is charged interest until the loan is repaid. As the user plays the game and earns revenues, they have the choice of expanding service along existing routes, or expanding their transportation network. The game features a progression of technology: in any particular year of the game generally only contemporary types of technology are available. For example, railroad signals which allow more than one train to use a section of track are initially semaphores. Later, they are replaced by red and green traffic-light signals. Similarly, in the beginning there are only steam engines, but later diesel and electric engines are introduced. In the game year 1999, monorails become available. These require a separate track system from railroads. If the player remains in business until 2030, the game announces that they have won, allows them to post their name on the \"hall of fame\" and then continues. At this point, the year stays 2030 and never goes any higher, although the game can continue indefinitely. Playing the entire 100-year campaign takes about 40 hours. The game allows the player to save at any time, and multiple saves of a particular game at any point are possible.\n\nVehicles in the game must be constructed at corresponding depots, which must be connected to the road or rail networks. Towns and cities have their own road networks, but extra roads may be needed to connect them to other towns, or to various resources.\n\nThe player earns revenue by picking up resources or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station where there is a demand for them. Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers. The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and quantity delivered. The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast. On the other hand, coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable.\n\nAt times, subsidies are offered to the first company to move a particular resource from one place to another. This encourages the player to create a larger more complex transport network, rather than focusing on previously profitable routes.\n\nThe game features a system of Local Authority. Each city has a rating for every transport company based on the impact of their transport network. When the rating falls too low, the player will no longer be able to demolish buildings or construct new stations. The rating depends on, among others, the level of service and the deforestation caused by the company.\n\nIn the course of a game cities develop and expand according to various economic factors, and new industries (demand) or other resource sites (supply) may appear. Some natural resources may also eventually be exhausted and industries without adequate transport service may shut down. Also, new models of vehicles are introduced and eventually come to replace older models. At introduction such a new model will likely have improved characteristics, but may suffer from reliability issues.\n\nThe music in \"Transport Tycoon\" are original compositions by John Broomhall. It features old-style blues and jazz tunes including parts of Herbie Hancock's Cantaloupe Island.\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" gave the DOS version four out of five stars, commenting, \"The best economic sim since \"Civilization\", Microprose's new \"Transport Tycoon\" has all the features of Sid Meier's \"Railroad Tycoon\" mixed with the look and ease of Maxis' \"SimCity 2000\" and a host of new features ... that give the game a feel that is all its own.\" He further lauded the game for its graphics, \"pleasant\" music, sound effects, addictive play, and realistic simulation of the growth of cities and towns.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the \"Transport Tycoon Scenario\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"A solid upgrade for a great game.\"\n\nA \"World Editor\" expansion pack was also released for the original \"Transport Tycoon\", but was overshadowed by the Deluxe version released shortly afterward. It featured an alternative, Martian set of graphics, which did \"not\" appear in TTD.\n\n\"Transport Tycoon Deluxe\" is an expanded and improved version of the original game.\n\nThe primary difference between the games is how signals operate. The original \"Transport Tycoon\" allows only \"bi-directional signals\", which allow trains to pass in either direction. The deluxe version introduced \"uni-directional signals\", that only allow a train to pass in a single direction. The change in gameplay from this alteration to signals is significant, as the old bi-directional signals would allow a train to travel in both directions. This is similar in concept to having a single lane street that would allow traffic from either end. Unsurprisingly, it was possible for two trains to try to travel in opposing directions towards each other on the same run of track. While this would not result in crashes on a properly signaled route, it required either the building of extra track to allow the trains to pass each other, or the building of a great many tracks in parallel to avoid the problem in the first place.\n\nThe new uni-directional signals allowed one-way tracks to be built, which gives the player much greater control over how the railway network could be run. This allowed for efficient routes to be built, and prevented trains from trying to travel the \"wrong way\" down a section of track. By incorporating both uni-directional and bi-directional signals, effective switching yards, junctions, and other useful designs could be built. It also unlocked the ability to build continental-length railroad systems by incorporating one-way rails in both directions and the ability to merge other rails with the main one. This is a highly used strategy because it allows for intercontinental transport of goods which results in high return rates for the player.\n\nThe deluxe version also expanded the game to provide tropical, Arctic, and toy-town environments, as well as the classic temperate environment. The new environments came with different industries and challenges. For example, towns in the Arctic environment would not grow without regular deliveries of food, and those in the tropical environment also need access to fresh water. The main game runs over the course of a century, from 1950 to 2050.\n\nDue to trademark issues with using names of real vehicles in the original \"Transport Tycoon\", the default names were replaced with fictional ones in \"Transport Tycoon Deluxe\". Players however are allowed to rename their vehicles and stations as they please, which can be useful for identifying individual services in a network. Players are also able to rename towns, which provides for a more personalized game play.\n\nAfter the success of \"Transport Tycoon Deluxe\", Chris Sawyer turned his attention towards a sequel, but during development he changed his mind and produced \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\", which turned out to be a runaway hit. After \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 2\" was done, work on the third version was left to another development team, and Sawyer returned to work on a \"Transport Tycoon\" sequel, \"Chris Sawyer's Locomotion\". It was released in September 2004 and was described by Sawyer as the \"spiritual successor to \"Transport Tycoon\"\".\n\nIt received poor reviews and was deemed a commercial failure on release, but sales through the digital rereleases are unknown. Regardless, there is an active \"Locomotion\" community that continues to produce modifications.\n\nOn 15 July 2013, Sawyer's 31X Ltd and Origin8 Technologies announced that they were working on a mobile version of Transport Tycoon. Sawyer was originally focusing on funding for the game but ended up overseeing the design and helped with the debugging. The game was released for iOS and Android on 3 October 2013. The game is single player and uses graphics from \"Chris Sawyer's Locomotion\".\n\nSeveral development teams are currently working to improve \"Transport Tycoon\". \"TTDPatch\" provides gameplay enhancements and numerous bugfixes to \"TTD\" by patching the original binary.\n\n\"OpenTTD\" is an open source complete recreation of \"Transport Tycoon Deluxe\", achieved by reverse engineering the original game. It delivers many bug fixes and general enhancements to the game, like making it possible to run \"TTD\" on multiple platforms, including Mac, Linux, PSP, and Android. While both games allow new graphic sets for vehicles and terrain to be used, at present, \"TTDPatch\" still requires the original \"TTD\" graphics, sounds, binary and music files to run. While \"OpenTTD\" can still use the original \"TTD\" graphics and sounds, it does not need any of the \"TTD\" files to run as it has free graphics and sounds.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25771552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25771552", "title": "Virginia Literacy Foundation", "text": "Virginia Literacy Foundation\n\nThe Virginia Literacy Foundation (VLF), is an organization whose mission is to reduce adult illiteracy in Virginia by providing funding and technical support to private, volunteer adult literacy organizations that teach low level literacy adults to read and write with one-on-one instruction and tutoring. The VLF was founded by Jeannie Baliles, Virginia's First Lady from 1986 to 1990, and founding director Mark Emblidge, and was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization in 1987. The VLF supports grass roots organizations via challenge grants, direct consultation, and program development training with public partners like The Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center. The VLF also works in partnership with public institutions, corporations, and private literacy organizations in Virginia to address adult illiteracy in the workplace and to provide family literacy training to teachers and parents. The VLF is governed by the founding Executive Director, Mark E. Emblidge, and a Board of Directors chaired by Jeannie Baliles.\n\nDespite a 25-year effort by the VLF and the organizations it supports to teach literacy skills to adults, Virginia still has 853,786 adults who never completed high school (2006 US Census American Community Survey). One out of five adults is considered functionally illiterate, and 662,715 lack basic prose literacy skills. These adults learn to read and write best through the customized one-on-one tutoring provided by the private community-based literacy organizations that the VLF supports through grants and training. The VLF's mission also supports developing workforce skills, at first through the Workforce Improvement Network in partnership with James Madison University, and with PluggedIn Virginia through its partnership with The Literacy Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2001, 34.1% of job applicants lacked the literacy skills needed to do the job they sought. Functionally illiterate adults have a profound impact on Virginia’s economy. Regions where adult illiteracy rates soar above 25-30% are unable to attract and retain businesses. Coincidentally, these regions also have the highest poverty rates in Virginia. Plugged In, which relies heavily on local business and community support is designed to help adults acquire literacy and workforce skills as they work towards a GED credential or community college credits.\n\nKnowing that children are 5 times more likely to drop out of high school if their parents are unemployed and lack a high school diploma, thereby perpetuating the cycle of intergenerational illiteracy, the VLF has concentrated its efforts on family literacy and working with parents, starting with Toyota Family Literacy Grants in the 1990s. Excell, one of the VLF's projects that resulted from a 2008 community partnership in Richmond's northside, helps pre-K children to get ready to learn to read through the development of early language and literacy skills.\n\nSince it was established, the Foundation has funded grass roots literacy programs that have helped 200,000 adult Virginians learn to read. When the VLF was started, the organization supported 34 community- and faith-based literacy organizations across Virginia who served a total of 1,400 adults. In 2008, the number of adult students served per year by VLF supported organizations has jumped to 14,000 adult learners. The VLF has disbursed over $3.4 million in challenge grants since 1987 to fund data collections systems, program expansion and improvement, operating costs, staff salaries, and the purchase of equipment and supplies. The VLF has collaborated with important public/private partners such as the Virginia Department of Education and the Verizon Foundation, who have consistently awarded funds to help the VLF achieve its mission.\n\nIn addition to the grants, the VLF provides technical support and advice and direct assistance with tutor training, board development, and strategic planning through its public partner, the Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center (VALRC). With a yearly grant budget of $200,000, the VLF funds from 26-32 non-profit adult literacy organizations per year. In order to qualify for VLF funds and workshops through the VALRC, these organizations must serve a minimum of 30 clients per year within their communities, follow promising practices in non-profit management, and demonstrate a willingness to strengthen and improve their programs through active collaborations and partnerships with community groups.\n\nEach year, the VLF has sponsored an annual 2-day conference for all literacy programs in Virginia, including those that are too small to qualify for VLF grants. This conference, held in Richmond, provides workshops in program management, tutor training, EL/Civics, and learning disabilities and basic literacy teaching techniques.\n\nThe VLF's public/private partnerships have increased the organization's ability to address illiteracy in Virginia. While the VLF's mission primarily addressed the adult learner, the organization recognizes that the parent is the child's first teacher and that illiteracy must be addressed across an individual's lifespan from pre-K to adulthood. By partnering with other agencies with similar missions, the VLF has been able to work with a larger number of individuals through partner programs and their staff.\n\nThe initiative, which brought the public and private sectors together, was one of the first public-private partnerships of its kind in the nation. Founded in 1987 by the VLF and the Virginia Council for Adult Education and Literacy, the partnership increased the number of Virginians participating in literacy instruction from 24,309 in 1987 to over 55,000 in 1992.\n\nThe VLF also partnered with the Centers for Professional Development (now the Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center (VALRC) at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Virginia Office of Adult Education at the Virginia Department of Education to establish the Literacy Training Office. Training consisted of free professional development and program development workshops and technical assistance training for private volunteer groups. In 2000, four literacy support coordinators representing four regions in Virginia, offered regional technical advice and support to over eighty non-profit literacy organizations through the Literacy Support Center, a unique collaborative public/private project that helped to strengthen literacy programs through training and mentoring. These four positions were consolidated into one, and today a literacy specialist, who works with both the VLF and the VALRC, ensures that training and technical services for nonprofit organizations are coordinated.\n\nThe VLF, along with the Office of Adult Education at the Virginia Department of Education, was also instrumental in organizing and facilitating cooperation among the many private and public adult literacy agencies and social services through fourteen Regional Literacy Coordinating Committees, which still serve the state.\n\nIn 2002, the VLF partnered with Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Education and Center for Public Policy to form The Literacy Institute. The Institute ensures that Virginia’s public policy makers are kept aware of the problem of illiteracy in the Commonwealth and to directly combat that problem through research and development projects.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the VLF received a Toyota Family Literacy Grant, which allowed the organization to partner with Richmond Public Schools, Richmond Public Libraries, the Department of Social Services and other public entities in order to provide family literacy services for at-risk families. Since that time, the VLF has actively promoted family literacy, encouraging literacy programs to teach parents the literacy skills they need to obtain jobs or seek promotions and help their children with school work. Through its partnership with The Literacy Institute, the VLF has benefited from the expertise gained from three Early Reading First grants that totaled $12 million. In collaboration with the Robins Foundation and Richmond Public Schools, the VLF founded NoRF, now named Excell, a project that addressed the literacy needs of at-risk pre-K children who live in Richmond's north side. This research-based program has continued and expanded in Richmond, and is now named Excell.\n\n"}
