Some viewers who received AdapTV's low power signal are no longer able to receive the channel as their cable company does not carry it leading to a large volume of requests for a relaunch of LPTV stations in those markets or internet streaming of the channel. Officials for the network stated that the latter is in the works.\n\nPrior to AdapTV, the Silent Network and Kaleidescope TV both served all or part of this audience. The Silent Network featured programming with open captioning and sign-language for the hearing impaired and deaf starting in 1980. The network was later purchased by a private group in San Antonio, TX who eventually transformed the channel into Kaleidescope TV which was envisioned as a channel for viewers of visual, hearing, mobility and other impairments but later became a general health network before ceasing to broadcast several years later.\n\nProgramming on AdapTV is as diverse as general entertainment networks and broadcast channels for the general viewing community.\n\nSports\n\nDeaflympics\n\nThe network covers live or tape delayed coverage of most sporting events, open and closing ceremonies for the Deaflympics, the Olympics sanctioned sporting event held every four years. The next Deaflympics starts June 23, 2013 in Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nParalympics\n\nThe Paralympics is a major international sporting event for athletes with physical and mobility difficulties andcarried live and in repeats on AdapTV.\n\nWheelchair racing\n\nAdapTV carries Wheelchair Racing every Sunday afternoon as part of its sports block.\n\nNews\n\nAdapTV has the US's only open-captioned news broadcasts and also includes sign-language intrepretation and audio description for the visually impaired. All major news stories are covered as well as stories of special interest to AdapTV viewers. Sign-language intrepretation has been available on news broadcasts internationally for years including a special programming block on the BBC which AdapTV also carries.\n\nFilms and Series\n\nKids TV\n\nAdapTV provides a wide variety of children's programming including films, cartoons, educational series and more for children who are hard of hearing or deaf, visually impaired or blind or physically or mobility challenged. As well the network seeks to reach the friends of these children and help create an inclusive environment. Much of the programming is produced by AdapTV, colleges for the hearing and visually impaired and the BBC\n\nEvents\n\nMiss Deaf America\n\nMiss Deaf America is the precursor to the Miss Deaf International event. The pageant is broadcast live on AdapTV.\n\nMiss Deaf International\n\nThe next Miss Deaf International will be broadcast live from Sophia on AdapTV from July 23–27 as it is a multi-day event.\nDue to the time difference the pageant will be carried live and with tape delay during US primetime hours.\n\nOpen Captioning\n\nMost programming on AdapTV features open-captioning. This means that viewers do not need to turn on captioning when watching the channel. AdapTV uses enhanced open captioning which uses larger letters and a white background making text much easier to read.\n\nSign Language Interpretation\n\nMost programming on AdapTV features sign-language intrepretation if it is not featuring sign language as the main content of the programming. Sign-language interpretation\n\nAudio description\nWhile as of 2013 a contested Federal mandate in the US requires audio description on certain programming AdapTV has chosen to provide audio description of most of its television programming. Unlike other networks the audio description does not require that viewers activate the service and rather it plays during the main audio feed.\n\n"}

Cranston (2012) was a case where the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ruled that a \"School Prayer\" banner posted in Cranston High School West was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution and ordered its removal. The suit was brought by Mark Ahlquist on behalf of his minor daughter Jessica Ahlquist, a student at the school, with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nWhen Cranston High School West was opened in 1959, its student council was charged with selection of a school prayer along with its school creed, colors, and mascot. The prayer, adopted in 1960, replaced the Lord's Prayer in daily recitation until 1962, following the United States Supreme Court ruling in \"Engel v. Vitale\". Banners bearing both the school creed and prayer were gifts from the school's first graduating class (1963), and were affixed in the school auditorium. The text of the prayer reads:\n\nJessica Ahlquist was born in 1995, and lives in Cranston, Rhode Island. Her father, Mark Ahlquist, was co-plaintiff as parent, guardian, and next friend.\n\nIn July 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter to Cranston School District superintendent on behalf of an unnamed parent who complained about the banner. Initially, school officials thought the banner could be modified, avoiding the prohibitive expense of a lawsuit. Ahlquist had noticed the banner in her first year in high school. After reading about the complaint, she decided to sit in on the school board meetings. She also created a Facebook page to raise support for the cause. At an August 2010 meeting of the Cranston School Committee, a subcommittee was asked to make recommendations about the disposition of the banner; Ahlquist attended the public meetings of the subcommittee in November 2010 and February 2011. At the end of the November meeting, out of safety concerns, a police escort was provided for Ahlquist and one other person who spoke in favor of the banner's removal. At a contentious meeting of the full committee, she argued the case for the removal of the banner and a similar display at Bain Middle School. The committee voted 4-3 in favor of keeping the banner in place, despite a budget deficit and the threat of an ACLU lawsuit.\n\nThe Rhode Island chapter of the ACLU asked Ahlquist if she would serve as a plaintiff in a lawsuit. The suit was filed in April 2011. The Cranston School Committee had made defense arrangements with Joseph V. Cavanagh, Jr. and The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which represented them without charge.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Ronald R. Lagueux issued a decision in favor of Ahlquist on January 11, 2012. The decision was in part based on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court's earlier rulings in \"Lemon v. Kurtzman\" (1971), \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" (1984), and \"Lee v. Weisman\" (1992), all three of which had a local Rhode Island component: the \"Lee\" case was from nearby Providence, the \"Lynch\" case was from Pawtucket bordering Providence on the opposite side from Cranston, and the \"Lemon\" case was consolidated at the appeals level from both Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the hearing, Lagueux remarked that Ahlquist \"is clearly an articulate and courageous young woman, who took a brave stand, particularly in light of the hostile response she has received from her community\". Following the ruling on the case, police involvement has increased, both escorting Ahlquist to classes and investigating threats, mostly originating in Cranston. An unnamed student was disciplined by the school because of threats. Local florists also refused a delivery to Ahlquist. Two high school students from other states have described their objections to school prayer as inspired by her activism.\n\nReligious leaders from the Rhode Island State Council of Churches rallied to defend Ahlquist and condemn the language used to describe her. The organization's executive minister, Rev. Dr. Donald Anderson attended Cranston West when the banner went up; he supported Lagueux's decision.\n\nOn the day following the ruling, Rhode Island State Representative Peter G. Palumbo spoke on a local radio show and referred to Ahlquist as \"an evil little thing\". While the supporters of the banner raised funds for the preservation of the banner in the event of its ordered removal by selling T-shirts with the banner's full text, Ahlquist's supporters raised funds with \"Evil little thing\" T-shirts, the proceeds going to a college education fund established for her.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the Cranston School Committee decided not to appeal by a 5-2 vote. The banner was removed, intact, during the first weekend in March, and the school and city agreed to pay the ACLU $150,000 in legal fees. On the day of the agreement, a group consisting of three students, three alumni, and a North Providence resident filed a motion to stay. The motion was dismissed on the basis of being untimely and that they lacked standing. The group filed a notice of appeal over the ruling barring their intervention. Of the seven appellants, four had not signed the notice of appeal, and mail sent by the First Circuit Court of Appeals to a fifth appellant's address was returned as undeliverable with no forwarding address. While various parties remained interested in acquiring the banner a year after the case had been decided, the banner remained in storage.\nIn September 2013, an alumni group presented a new mural to the school containing the school's creed.\n\n"}

Effective schools research has been widely adopted by school districts worldwide.\n\nEarly research into the essential qualities of successful schools emerged in North America as a response to the controversial 1966 Coleman Report, which concluded that family background and socio-economics were the major determinants of student achievement. Research published by Christopher Jencks in 1972 contributed to Coleman's findings, suggesting that \"school quality has little effect on achievement.\"\n\nThe Coleman Report prompted U.S. policymakers to focus on \"compensatory programs\" which focused on changing the behavior of less advantaged students. The report also stimulated vigorous reaction from educational researchers who believed, to the contrary, that schools \"could\" make a significant difference on student achievement. Their research formed the foundation of the 'Effective Schools Movement', and enabled them to assert that \"all children can learn and that the school controls the factors necessary to assure student mastery of the core curriculum.\"\n\nEarly effective schools researchers attempted to locate schools that were successful in educating students of all backgrounds, regardless of socio-economic status or family background. Such schools were found in varying locations and communities, and researchers tried to isolate which philosophies, policies, and practices those schools had in common.\n\nLarry Lezotte and Wilbur B. Brookover conducted studies at eight Michigan elementary schools in the mid-1970s, identifying characteristics of schools that were improving or declining. A notable finding was that \"staff in the declining schools had low opinions of their students' abilities, while the staff in the improving schools had high opinions of student abilities\".\n\nGeorge Weber, and later Ronald Edmonds, conducted research in inner-city U.S. schools where students of low socio-economic background were able to equal or surpass the national average. Edmonds' 1979 article \"Effective Schools for the Urban Poor\" is noted for drawing professional attention to the effective schools movement. Edmonds outlined six characteristics essential to effective schools, including:\n\nEducational researchers soon dropped \"capacity to divert energy and resources\" from the list, and Edmonds' “five-factor model” was widely proclaimed as a framework for reforming low-performing schools.\n\nIn 1979, \"Fifteen Thousand Hours\" documented effective schools research in high schools in the United Kingdom, and found that school characteristics could positively alter student achievement.\n\nEdmonds published \"Programs of School Improvement: An Overview\" in 1982, describing the \"correlates of effective schools\", a now widely used phrase commonly associated with the later work of Lezotte. Edmonds' correlates described effective schools as the following:\n\nIn 1991, Lezotte published \"Correlates of Effective Schools: The First and Second Generation\", describing the \"Seven Correlates of Effective Schools\":\n\nThe correlates of effective schools have remained a cornerstone for many school districts.\n\nThe Council of Ontario Directors of Education describes Lezotte's seven correlates as \"being necessary for ensuring high levels of student achievement\", adding that educators should also consider the importance of home and an empathic community.\n\nThe District of Columbia Public Schools has broadened its description of effective schools to include:\n\nA key finding regarding the implementation of effective schools reforms is that the positive support the school principal is fundamental to success. Also, teacher support for, belief in, and commitment to a particular reform tended to follow months or years of successful practice.\n"}

Such examinations have also been used in a variety of countries; this article focuses on their use within the United States. These are usually criterion-referenced tests which were implemented as part of a comprehensive standards-based education reform program which sets into place new standards intended to increase the learning of all students.\n\nWhen any test is directly tied to significant consequences, such as determining whether the student may receive a high school diploma, it is called a high-stakes test. Many organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) oppose high-stakes tests in general, with the NCTM saying that \"placing too much emphasis on a single test or on testing can undermine the quality of education and jeopardize equality of opportunity.\" At the same time, almost all states that hold an exit exam for graduation allow students to take the test multiple times and further allow routes to graduation for students that fail.\n\nIn 2011, 24 states required passing a high school exit examination for graduation, and three additional states had legislation instituting such exams in the future.\n\nGraduation examinations first appeared in the U.S. after the Civil War, when the Regents Board of the State of New York imposed its first exams.\nOutlined a model that a new educational performance standard should be set for all students, to be met by 16. Students passing a series of performance-based assessments that incorporate the standard would be awarded a Certificate of Initial Mastery. This certificate would qualify the student to choose among going to work, entering a college preparatory program, or studying for a Technical and Professional e, which would be explicitly tied to advanced job requirements. These standards would not be intended as sorting mechanisms, but would allow multiple opportunities for success; the goal would simply be to ensure achievement of high performance standards for the great majority of the nation's workforce. The states would ensure that virtually all students achieve the Certificate of Initial Mastery. Most of the current high school examinations are also given for the first time in the 10th grade even if US students are usually not expected to have completed high school until grade 12.\n\nIn the United States comprehensive high school model, all students are expected to complete 12 years of public education, with some students taking primarily vocational based courses, while college-bound students taking primarily academic courses, but education reform seeks to graduate all students with some work experience and enough academic skills to succeed in college.\n\nIn states that require students to pass a high school graduation test, the students are typically given multiple opportunities to take the test each year, over several years. For example, in the State of California, students may take the California High School Exit Exam up to eight times over three years.\n\nOver time, there has been debate about the use of exit exams. Opponents of the use of test-based accountability, as typified by the report of the National Research Council on the subject, argue that the exams lead to more high school dropouts without increasing student performance. Others including Eric Hanushek have argued that scientific evidence on this is lacking and that the use of these examinations is consistent with the standards movement for educational reform.\n\nStudents who are unable to pass the exit examinations given by their local public school may be able to use an alternative assessment to demonstrate mastery of the material.\n\nThey may also be able to graduate from a private school or a school in another state by transferring their accumulated credits at the end of the last year of school. This is typically not free, but is not considered very expensive relative to the cost of hiring an attorney to contest the statewide exams, or to the cost of hiring a private tutor.\n\n\n"}

It was acquired by Thomson Scientific & Healthcare in 1992, and became known as Thomson ISI. It was a part of the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters until 2016, when the IP & Science business was sold, becoming Clarivate Analytics. In February 2018, Clarivate announced it will re-establish ISI as part of its Scientific and Academic Research group.\n\nISI offered bibliographic database services. Its specialty: citation indexing and analysis, a field pioneered by Garfield. It maintains citation databases covering thousands of academic journals, including a continuation of its longtime print-based indexing service the Science Citation Index (SCI), as well as the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). All of these are available via ISI's Web of Knowledge database service. This database allows a researcher to identify which articles have been cited most frequently, and who has cited them. The database provides some measure of the academic impact of the papers indexed in it, and may increase their impact by making them more visible and providing them with a quality label. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that appearing in this database can double the number of citations received by a given paper.\n\nThe ISI also publishes the annual \"Journal Citation Reports\" which list an impact factor for each of the journals that it tracks. Within the scientific community, journal impact factors play a large but controversial role in determining the kudos attached to a scientist's published research record.\n\nA list of over 14,000 journals is maintained by the ISI. The list includes some 1,100 arts and humanities journals as well as scientific journals. Listing is based on published selection criteria and is an indicator of journal quality and impact.\n\nISI publishes \"Science Watch\", a newsletter which identifies every two months one paper published in the previous two years as a \"fast breaking paper\" in each of 22 broad fields of science, such as Mathematics (including Statistics), Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The designations are based on the number of citations and the largest increase from one bimonthly update to the next. Articles about the papers often include comments by the authors.\n\nThe ISI also publishes a list of \"ISI highly cited researchers\", one of the factors included in the Academic Ranking of World Universities published by Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\n\n\"ISI Highly Cited\" is a database of \"highly cited researchers\"—scientific researchers whose publications are most often cited in academic journals over the past decade, published by the Institute for Scientific Information. Inclusion in this list is taken as a measure of the esteem of these academics and is used, for example, by the Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n\nThe methodology for inclusion is to consider papers in the upper first percentile based on citation counts of all articles indexed in the Scientific Citation Databases and published in a single, fixed year. Papers in the upper first percentile with respect of their year of publication are called highly cited papers. Each paper in the data is assigned to one or more of 21 categories, based on the ISI classification of the journal in which the article was published. The Highly Cited Researchers list is compiled by selecting, in every field, those researchers with the highest number of highly cited papers in a 10-year, rolling time period. The number of highly cited researchers varies from field to field and is determined accordingly to the total number of researchers contributing to the single field.\n\nThe categories are as follows:\nThe publication list and biographical details supplied by the researchers are freely available online, although general access to the ISI citation database is by subscription.\n\n\n"}

This unconscious is another name for the diversity of social, economic, cultural and other unspoken elements that an educator interacts with in an institutional setting; and 2. the role of the institution in the process of intervening in both those psycho-social factors and in what is known by a student.\n\nBut even more than this, as conceived by its founder, Fernand Oury, Institutional Pedagogy is a constant calling into question of the institutional context itself. Thus the classroom is never a presupposed and static setting. The movement of Institutional Pedagody is thus in direct opposition to the prevailing trends of education prior to the late 1960s, almost all of which tended to homogenize socio-cultural differences amongst learners, psycho-social factors in learning and most important the presence of the \"unconscious\" in the classroom itself.\n\nThus the use of 'institution' in Institutional Pedagogy is broader than in its more colloquial sense. To Oury the institution could be defined as:\n\n\"the places, moments, status of each according to his/her level of performance, that is to say according to his/her potentialities, the functions (services, posts, responsibilities), roles (president, secretary), diverse meetings (team captains, different levels of classes, etc.), and the rituals that maintain their efficacy.\"\n\ninstitutionnelle.

Courses at the elementary and secondary levels were established several years later; two schools began offering Japanese classes in 1996, followed by another three in 1998 and an additional four schools after 2000. However, by 2003, four of the primary and secondary programmes were terminated due to lack of teaching staff, while an additional two universities and one non-school institution began to offer Japanese language courses. For students in primary and secondary schools, Japanese language classes might begin as early as the fifth year of compulsory education, proceeding until the eighth or the eleventh year. As of 2007, Kazakhstan had 43 teachers of Japanese, among whom eight were native speakers. Students majoring in Japanese faced problems such as low wages and lack of opportunities to use their skills in professional contexts, leading to limits on the growth of interest in the language.\n\nMuch language study is funded not indigenously, but rather through a portion of the US$95 million in official development assistance provided by Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as additional private aid. There is no unified national curriculum for Japanese studies at either the primary, secondary, or tertiary levels; rather, institutions design their own curricula, typically with the aid of, and using textbooks published by, the Japan Center, which is also funded by the Japanese government.\n\nThe Japanese Language Proficiency Test has been offered in Kazakhstan since 2003, solely in the former capital of Almaty. The number of examinees fell every year for the first two years after the test's introduction, but in 2006, their count more than doubled; the number of people taking the introductory 4th-level examination nearly quadrupled.

It was also part of the design planned in 1928 for this area by the “Davila Holguin & Lievano” firm. It was declared as a National Monument by Decree 1265 in 1948, and has been managed by the Universidad Nacional de Colombia since the year 2005\n\nThis two-story museum has an area of 218 square meters. Each space gives information on how life was in a 1930s home located in one of Bogota’s most developed neighborhoods. Each of the objects that belong to its collection tell the story of he who was called “The People’s Tribune” (Tribuno del pueblo), due to his everlasting struggle to help the poor classes within the Colombian society.\nFrom this museum, it is possible to approach the country’s main historical events during the mid-Twentieth Century.

{"id": "18541399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541399", "title": "Kevin P. Chavous", "text": "Kevin P. Chavous\n\nKevin P. Chavous (born May 17, 1956) is an attorney, author, education reform activist, and former Democratic Party politician in Washington, D.C., in the United States. He served as a member of the Council of the District of Columbia from January 1993 to January 2005, and was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of the District of Columbia in 1998.\n\nChavous was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of Bettie J. and Harold P. Chavous. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a civil rights activist. Chavous was the oldest of four children. His first job was working at Chavous Drugs, his father's drug store, sweeping and mopping floors and stocking shelves.\n\nChavous was educated at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis and Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. While at Wabash, he was NCAA Division III District All-American in basketball. Chavous also earned a JD degree from the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C., where he was president of his law school class. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Chavous became a personal injury lawyer for the D.C. law firm of Cadeaux & Tagliere. The Chavouses and their children lived in Hillcrest, an affluent neighborhood in Southeast Washington on the District-Maryland border.\n\nIn May 1988, Chavous was elected to the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee, representing Ward 7. The following year, Pepco, an electric power public utility, proposed a significant expansion of its coal-fired power generating plant on the edge of the River Terrace neighborhood in Ward 7. The River Terrace Community Organization, a group representing citizens living in the neighborhood, opposed the plant, and Chavous agreed to represent the group in court \"pro bono\". Pepco cancelled the expansion in 1991, and Chavous gained significant visibility for his work.\n\nChavous also joined the national board of directors of Handgun Control, Inc., a group working for strong federal gun control legislation.\n\nThe Pepco fight launched Chavous' political career. Chavous, who by now was hosting a once-a-week program on legal issues on radio station WDCU-FM, announced in May 1992 that he would challenge incumbent Ward 7 Councilmember H. R. Crawford. Crawford, \"The Washington Post\" reported, was facing strong criticism from voters from his legislative achievements and three Democratic primary election challengers. Chavous waged an intensive grassroots campaign to unseat Crawford. According to \"The Washington Post\", Chavous visited every single-family residence in Ward 7 personally, either speaking with members of the household or leaving behind campaign literature. On September 15, 1992, Chavous unseated Crawford, 4,866 votes (41.7 percent) to 4,266 (37 percent). In the general election on November 3, 1992, Chavous easily defeated Republican candidate Johnnie Scott Rice, 96 percent to 4 percent.\n\nChavous was sworn in on January 2, 1993.\n\nDuring his first term on the council, Chavous aligned with Ward 2 council member Jack Evans (elected in 1991), At-Large council member William Lightfoot (elected in 1988), and Ward 6 council member Harold Brazil (elected in 1991) to form a caucus known as the \"Young Turks\". Together, they successfully opposed tax increases sought for the city by Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly. On June 22, 1993, an unidentified gunman sprayed the public swimming pool at the Benning Park Recreation Center with fire from a semiautomatic weapon. Panic-stricken children and adults fled the pool, and six children were wounded by gunfire. The incident highlighted the high level of gun violence in Ward 7, and \"The Washington Post\" said Chavous was thrust into the citywide spotlight by it. Chavous personally brought his two young children to the pool (which had seen almost no visitors since the attack) on June 29 to demonstrate the pool's safety and send a message of defiance to drug dealers and violent criminals. On September 26, 1993, four-year-old Launice Smith was shot in the head and head (and survived) while her family watched a pick-up football game at Weatherless Elementary School in the Fort Dupont neighborhood in Ward 7. Smith was injured when four gunmen emerged from a nearby woods and then hunted down and executed 20-year-old Kervin Brown in what D.C. police said was part of an ongoing battle between rival drug gangs. Once more, Chavous was seen as one of the most important political leaders responding to violence in the city. On September 29, he announced for the formation of a 20-member task force on public safety and began pushing for Ward 7 residents to police their own neighborhoods and report drug dealing, crime, and violence. Chavous later called the task force one of the most important developments of his first term.\n\nAmong other key legislative accomplishments in his first term was a 1993 act allowing the city to seize abandoned vehicles and 1994 legislation that enacted a temporary ban on new liquor licenses for stores selling beer by the can (so-called \"takeout beer\"). He and the other Young Turks also successfully enacted in 1995 a $70 million cut in the wages earned by trade union members under the city's version of the Davis–Bacon Act. (The cut was temporary, and expired in 1996.)\n\nChavous' legislative activism declined significantly over his first term. Chavous told \"The Washington Post\" in February 1996 that \"it has proved easier to wait for someone else, be it the mayor or the control board, to propose hard solutions,\" according to journalists Howard Schneider and David A. Vise. He unsuccessfully supported in 1995 a package of conservative Republican Party proposals to significantly change the way the city provided welfare benefits, and a plan to create an independent school board to approve and oversee charter schools. One significant (and eventually successful) change he advocated was the creation of a District of Columbia Financial Control Board to save the city from bankruptcy. He was one of the first council members to call for federal oversight (in early 1995), although later in the year he refused to vote to cut big-ticket items such as unemployment benefits or the city's summer youth jobs program. Congress created a financial control board in April 1995.\n\nChavous sought reelection in 1996. He faced a challenger in the Democratic primary election, District of Columbia Board of Education member Terry Hairston. In July 1996, Hairston challenged Chavous' right to be on the ballot. D.C. election law required a candidate to obtain signatures from at least 250 voters in a ward in order to run for a district council seat in that ward. Chavous submitted signatures from 574 voters. But D.C. law also required that all individuals gathering such signatures be residents of the District of Columbia, and Hairston alleged that Chavous campaign worker Calvin S. Hawkins did not meet that condition. The District of Columbia Board of Elections ruled in Chavous' favor on July 30, 1996. In the Democratic primary held on September 10, 1996, Chavous easily defeated Hairston and another challenger, Eddie Rhodes, winning 68 percent of the vote. Chavous won 90 percent of the vote in the general election on November 5, easily beating D.C. Statehood Party candidate Durand A. Ford (6 percent) and Republican Party candidate James Bernard Miles (3 percent).\n\nOn December 30, 1996, Chavous was elected chairman of the Council's Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Ward 3 council member Kathy Patterson, a veteran education activist, also fought for the chairmanship. Patterson strongly criticized Chavous' commitment to educational reform, but Council Chairman David A. Clarke awarded the post to Chavous after he publicly declared education reform to be the biggest issue facing the sity. Patterson, however, won an agreement that stripped jurisdiction over labor issues from Chavous' committee and gave it to the Committee on Government Operations (chaired by Patterson). During his first year in office, the District of Columbia Public Schools undertook an emergency $50 million project to repair leaking and structurally unsound roofs at several public schools. The project was significantly mismanaged, and forced a delay in the opening of the school year. Chavous ordered a hearing on the issue in September 1997, but a significant number of parents of schoolchildren complained he had not provided enough oversight and acted too late. In March 1997, Chavous sponsored another significant piece of legislation, a resolution disapproving a construction contract for the highly controversial Barney Circle Freeway.\n\nChavous also opposed construction of a new convention center in the city. As late as May 27, 1998, Chavous said he had not decided whether to support the project. But he voted to oppose it during the council's vote on June 2, arguing that plans to build a convention center smaller than many then under construction was \"a plan to build a second-tier convention center\".\n\nAfter his losing mayoral campaign, Chavous became what \"The Washington Post\" called a \"frequent critic\" of the new mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and had \"the chilliest relationship with the mayor\" of any Council member. Chavous was an early supporter of Councilmember Carol Schwartz's tax cut package in March 1999, which became law in May. Chavous also led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the D.C. Board of Education. After a long battle with Mayor Williams and other Council members, the Council approved a plan to reduce the size of the board, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with Council confirmation). Voters were asked to approve the \"hybrid\" board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000. According to \"The Washington Post\", the bruising school board battle helped and hindered Chavous politically. While his allies said it showed he could tackle tough problems, dissenters argued that Chavous avoided the real issues (lack of money for schools and crumbling infrastructure). Chavous blamed the lengthy legislative process on unnamed individuals who he said did not engage in good faith in the process, but critics argued that Chavous never engaged in the kind of political hardball that was needed to move the reform bill along faster. Larry Gray, legislative chairman of the D.C. Congress of PTAs, blamed Chavous for deep cuts in the school budget during the past four years, failures in the teacher certification program, and significant delays in getting technology into the classroom.\n\nIn late 1998, after his campaign for mayor, Chavous left Cadeaux & Tagliere and joined the law firm of Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn.\n\nChavous left Arent Fox and was appointed Vice President of Communications for Covad Communications Group, a broadband provider, in December 1999. But he left that position after just a year. Citing his somehwat difficult reelection campaign, Chavous said he wanted to devote more time to his Council position.\n\nAs early as January 1997, \"The Washington Post\" said, Chavous was running an all-but-announced campaign for mayor to unseat incumbent Marion Barry. As part of a staff shakeup to improve his election chances, Chavous fired Jim Ford, the veteran staff director of the Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Valerie Strauss of \"The Washington Post\" said Ford's dismissal \"robbed the committee of its institutional memory and one of its most vocal advocates for school reform.\" But although Chavous had worked diligently to improve his name recognition and standing with the public, he garnered just 7 percent of those likely voters polled by \"The Washington Post\" in May 1997.\n\nChavous formally announced his campaign for mayor on February 10, 1998, and raised $117,000 in the first month of his campaign. Chavous trailed the other leading candidate in the race, Jack Evans, who raised more than $307,000 since early December 1997, as well as restaurateur Jeffrey Gildenhorn, who doanted $400,000 of his own money to his own campaign. More than a third of the campaign contributions to the Chavous campaign came from individuals living outside the District of Columbia. Chavous said in April 1998 that, if elected, he would focus heavily on education reform. He rejected school vouchers, but promised to fire principals and teachers who did not meet performance standards and create a boarding school for troubled youth. He also said he would disband the police oversight group established by the Financial Control Board, and work to revive commercial areas throughout the city. He later said he would cut a number of taxes levied by the city, including the corporate income tax, and seek passage of a federal law that would replace the current progressive federal income tax on city residents with a flat federal income tax of 15 percent. He also proposed universal early childhood education, and significantly improved city services for Latino residents. By mid-May, a \"Post\" poll showed 29 percent of voters favoring a sixth Barry term. Harold Brazil had 16 percent, Kevin Chavous had 15 percent, and Jack Evans had 10 percent. On May 21, Barry said he would not seek reelection. The announcement was a boost for Chavous, as polling showed that Barry's supporters were most likely to support him over other mayoral candidates.\n\nHowever, on May 30, 1998, Anthony A. Williams entered the race for mayor. Williams was the city's Chief Financial Officer, a position created by the same federal legislation which created the Financial Control Board. Williams had helped steer the city toward financial solvency, and had proven immensely popular among residents. By early June, the Chavous campaign had raised more than $260,000 in campaign donations in an attempt to reach its $750,000 goal; about 25 percent of the contributions came from non-District residents. On June 20, Chavous barely won a straw poll of Democrats in Ward 8. Anthony Williams came in a close second, in what \"The Washington Post\" called a sign of weakening support for Chavous. But nine days later, he won the endorsement of the Metropolitan Washington AFL–CIO, a broad coalition of trade unions.\n\nOn July 1, Vickey Wilcher, the manager of Chavous' mayoral campaign, quit amid rumors of infighting among Chavous' top aides. \"The Washington Post\" reported that several top campaign staff were angered by Chavous' \"indecisiveness\" over the convention center issue. They were also alarmed that Chavous had failed to win the Ward 8 endorsement, and they fought with other campaign managers over the direction of the Chavous effort. The campaign received another blow a few days later when the influential Washington Teachers Union broke with the AFL-CIO and endorsed Williams for mayor. In July, Chavous raised another $100,000 toward his campaign goal. But Anthony Williams raised more than $400,000—most of it in small donations from voters throughout the city. Chavous also loaned his campaign $25,000.\n\nAs the primary season wound down, a \"Post\" poll released on September 3, 1998, showed Williams with 37 percent of the vote and Chavous with 20 percent. A few days later, the Washington Teachers Union, D.C. Construction and Building Trades Council, Washington Social Workers Association, D.C. Nurses' Association, and National Hispanic Law Enforcement Association accused Chavous of missing 37 percent of all Council sessions during his first term in office, an accusation Chavous strongly denied. In the last month of the mayoral race, Williams raised $303,000 compared with just over $77,000 for Chavous. Chavous concluded the race having raised just $450,000 toward his goal of $750,000, and he had only $66,000 for the final week of the campaign compared to Williams' $97,500.\n\nAnthony Williams won the Democratic primary election held on September 15, 1998. Williams received 50 percent of the vote, with Chavous a distant second at 35 percent. Williams easily defeated Republican Carol Schwartz in the general election on November 4, 66 percent to 30 percent. He carried all eight wards by a solid margin.\n\nChavous announced he would run for a third four-year term on the Council of the District of Columbia in June 2000.\n\nHis primary campaign faced significant problems. In June, the Far Northeast/Southeast Council, a coalition of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANC) and neighborhood civic associations, voted \"no-confidence\" in Chavous, saying he had been absent from too many community meetings and events and had failed to keep resident informed about major changes in their ward (such as the relocation of the D.C. Department of Employment Services and the opening of a new charter school). In late July, the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO declined to make an endorsement in the Ward 7 Council primary race, after the Washington Federation of Teachers accused Chavous of ignoring their input on education policy. (The teachers union also declined an endorsement in August.) By August 4, Chavous had only raised $2,100 in contributions, but spent more than $46,500. (He used funds left over from his 1998 mayoral race to reduce that deficit to just $7,100.) Four individuals also challenged Chavous in the Democratic primary: Rev. Robert B. Hunter of Atonement Episcopal Church; Mary D. Jackson, a United States Senate archivist and an ANC member; Durand A. Ford, a financial management consultant; and Gary R. Feenster, a computing analyst. By the end of August, Chavous had raised $6,000 in new contributions, and said he hoped to raise $20,000 more before the general election.\n\nDespite these problems, Chavous won the Democratic primary on September 12. He garnered 53 percent of the vote. His closest challenger was Rev. Robert B. Hunter, who received 33 percent of the vote.\n\nChavous' campaign problems eased during the general election. By October 10, he had raised $66,800, and had $14,000 in cash on hand for the remaining three weeks of the general election campaign. Chavous blamed his reduced electoral margin in the primary on \"lingering anger\" over the school board reform battle. Chavous won the general election on November 7 with 87 percent of the vote. Write-in Republican candidate Johnnie Scott Rice won 12 percent.\n\nChavous continued to have a contentious relationship with Mayor Williams in his third term. \"The Washington Post\" claimed that Chavous was considering a mayoral run in 2002, and that his battles with Williams were motivated by the search for a campaign issue. His relationship with Harold Brazil also broke down over Brazil's support for Williams. \"Harold's just become a lapdog,\" Chavous said. \"Harold just defends the mayor even when the mayor doesn't ask for support. Frankly, it's more than frustrating.\"\n\nChavous was vocal on a number of issues in his third council term. He opposed repeal of council members' term limits (approved by voters in 1994), and supported a redistricting plan which expanded Ward 7 west of the Anacostia River (angering residents of Kingman Park, who wished to remain part of Ward 6). But Peggy Cooper Cafritz, the highly influential president of the new school board, strongly criticized Chavous for failing to secure more funding for public schools, and residents of Ward 7 were so upset with his failure to push for cleanup of abandoned lots that 20 of them dumped trash on Chavous' front lawn in January 2003.\n\nChavous publicly stated he was considering another mayoral run in December 2001. When Mayor Williams apologized publicly for ethical lapses in January 2002, local news media reported that this only boosted Chavous' interest in a campaign. Lingering anger among residents on the east side of the city at the closing of D.C. General Hospital and those who lived in areas unaffected by the city's business resurgence led Chavous to publicly announce he was considering a run. In April 2002, as the filing deadline neared, Chavous admitted he had a growing interest in challenging Williams for the mayor's office Chavous announced in May that he would make a decision by the end of the month, noting that his own poll showed he was \"very well known and very well respected\" and that the public held a much less negative view about him than Williams. A damper was put on expectations for a Chavous run in late May when a \"Post\" poll showed Chavous losing to Williams, 51 percent to 31 percent. On June 6, Chavous announced he would not run for mayor. When a local court ruled that Williams had not submitted enough valid signatures to put himself on the ballot, Williams announced he would run as a write-in candidate in the Democratic Party primary. There was brief speculation by a number of political observers, \"The Washington Post\" said, that Chavous would enter the race. But he did not.\n\nThe biggest issue of Chavous' third term was school vouchers. Chavous had opposed vouchers in the past, but by February 2003, \"The Washington Post\" reported, Chavous was much more interested in providing ways to given parents a choice in whether to send their child to public school, private school, or charter school. Chavous and Mayor Williams met with Secretary of Education Rod Paige on February 6, 2003, to discuss vouchers and other \"choice\" programs, during which time Paige pledged a voucher program would not be forced on the city. After the meeting, Chavous said he had not yet decided if he would support vouchers or not. Chavous then began to significantly moderate his criticism of Williams. By March 31, Chavous said that he had come to support vouchers, but only if the program were not forced on the city and only if federal (not city) funds were used to finance the program. On February 8, 2003, President George W. Bush announced that he would seek federal legislation to impose a school voucher program on the city. As Bush's proposal was considered by the House of Representatives, Chavous and D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (a strong opponent of vouchers), blamed one another for a series of snubs, missed meetings, and attacks. By the time the measure moved to the Senate in September, Chavous (along with Mayor Williams and Board President Cafritz) was opposed on the voucher issue by a significant majority of elected officials in the city. The Senate passed the school voucher bill on January 23, 2004, and President Bush signed it into law. The legislation provided for a temporary, five-year experiment under which 1,700 low-income students would received up to $7,500 a year so that they could attend a private school in the city or nearby jurisdictions. Congress provided $14 million for the project.\n\nA second major educational issue which arose during Chavous' third term was another round of reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would be given to the mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.\n\nThe last major issue of Chavous' third term on the council was funding for Nationals Park. Major League Baseball was willing to move the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., which had long sought a major-league baseball franchise, but only if the city built a modern, baseball-only stadium for the team. By early June 2003, most of the District Council opposed the initial financing plan submitted by Williams. Chavous was the lone undecided councilmember. (Harold Brazil was the only supporter.) Chavous supported the stadium plan only after he had lost the September 14 Democratic primary. But he remained largely quiet during council debates, and was still considered a swing vote by November. On November 3, he provided the critical third vote on the council's Economic Development Committee, which approved the stadium deal. Twenty-seven days later, he joined with a narrow majority on the council to win final approval for the project. Chavous twice more voted to approve the stadium financing arrangement in December, when the financing mechanism was amended.\n\nHis term in office ended on January 2, 2005, when Gray was sworn in.\n\nChavous rejoined Arent Fox in March 2001 as counsel, a part-time position in which he specialized in business law, government relations, and general litigation. Chavous also took a job in 2002 as a partner at the law firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, practicing education and government law.\n\nChavous also won an appointment as an adjunct faculty member at the Washington College of Law at American University. He taught education law during the spring 2001 term.\n\nIn October 2017, Chavous was named K12 inc.'s President of Academics, Policy and Schools. Prior to being named president, Chavous served on K12's board of directors.\n\nRumors that Chavous would face significant primary opposition should he run for reelection in 2004 emerged in March 2003. Vincent C. Gray, former director of the D.C. Department of Human Services and the founding director of the D.C. chapter of Covenant House, challenged incumbent Jeri Washington for the chairmanship of the Ward 7 Democrats. Gray easily won, 256 to 134. \"The Washington Post\" concluded that the loss reflected discontent with Chavous' tenure in office, and that there was widespread speculation that Gray would challenge Chavous for the Ward 7 council seat the following year. Several of the activists and donors who had backed Anthony Williams in his first race for mayor urged Gray to run against Chavous. Gray launched his campaign to unseat Chavous on May 19, 2004, and began waging what the \"Post\" called an \"aggressive campaign\". Gray was not Chavous' only challenger. Five other individuals had also filed for the seat (although none of them were expected to impact the race significantly).\n\nBy the end of June, Gray had raised $1,235 in contributions. By the end of July, Chavous had raised $88,514 (all but $16,259 in May 2004) and had $42,295 on hand. Gray's campaign theme was that Chavous was out of touch with the ward, rarely attending neighborhood events and traveling out of town too frequently. Sam Bost, president of the influential Far Northeast/Southeast Council, announced in mid August that he would no longer support Chavous, and Gray won endorsements from several key organizations and individuals. Chavous argued that working on legislation consumed most of his time, and pointed to the school voucher program and the extensive charter school network in the city as major accomplishments. By August 22, Gray had raised $38,531 for a total of $52,389, while Chavous had raised $110,199 (and had $42,296 on hand).\n\nThe Chavous campaign received a blow on August 31 when the D.C. Democratic State Committee voted 35-to-3 to endorse Gray in the Ward 7 Democratic primary race. The vote, which \"The Washington Post\" called \"an embarrassment\" for Chavous, was the first time committee had endorsed a candidate in a primary election. Chavous dismissed the outcome, calling the vote \"a sham\". As the primary approached on September 14, the \"Post\" called the election the closest since Chavous defeated Crawford in 1992. Voter sentiment seemed to focus on the 2003–2004 Board of Education reform debate, with voters blaming Chavous for the long debate—which, many said, discouraged the two leading candidates for superintendent to drop out. Gray also hammered Chavous on his support for the federal voucher program, which he claimed took money away from public schools. Chavous argued that he had helped improve the delivery and amount of city services, was critical in winning construction of two new public schools in Ward 7, and that he had brought economic development to the area by shepherding the redevelopment of the Skyland shopping mall. By the end of the primary, Chavous had raised $138,849 in contributions.\n\nChavous lost his bid for reelection after losing the September 14, 2004, Democratic primary to Gray, 50 percent to 34 percent. David Nakamura, reporter for \"The Washington Post\", said that voters were unhappy with city schools, which had not improved despite the reforms Chavous took credit for.\n\nThe D.C. Office of Campaign Finance began an investigation into the 2004 Chavous Democratic primary campaign. \"The Washington Post\" reported that the Chavous campaign failed to file financial reports for October and November and paid three invoices totaling $9,000 when the campaign did not have funds to cover the checks. A creditor then filed a complaint with the D.C. police. The Office of Campaign Finance scheduled a hearing on the alleged campaign violations in November 2004, but Chavous did not appear. In an interview with the \"Post\", Chavous blamed a bank error and his campaign treasurer for the problems. Chavous personally gave one creditor a $5,000 cashier's check to cover a radio ad purchase, and his campaign's field coordinator was paid using $2,000 of Chavous' personal funds and $1,000 of the campaign's funds.\n\nIn 2004, Chavous authored the book \"Serving Our Children: Charter Schools and the Reform of American Public Education\". The following year, he was named a Distinguished Fellow with the Center for Education Reform.\n\nChavous served on the education policy committee of Barack Obama's 2008 reelection campaign. The same year, he co-founded and was named chairman of the board of directors of Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a political action committee which supports Democratic candidates for office who support school vouchers, and with DFER founded the Education Equality Project. He also co-founded in 2008 the nonprofit organization Serving Our Children, which provides grants to teachers for the purchase of classroom supplies. He was also named that year to the board of directors of the Black Alliance for Educational Options, an educational reform group promoting school vouchers and charter schools. He became the group's chairman in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, Chavous was part of the team formed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, to develop a school voucher program for New Orleans. The group successfully lobbied the Louisiana State Legislature for passage of the program.\n\nChavous joined the board of directors of the American Federation for Children and the Alliance for School Choice about 2011, organizations co-founded by Republican politician Betsy DeVos. In 2012, he served as executive counsel for the American Federation for Children. Also in 2012, Chavous served as a lobbyist for Intralot, the contractor which provided lottery services to the D.C. Lottery.\n\nIn 1982, Chavous married attorney and law school classmate Beverly Bass. The couple divorced in 2009. They have two sons, Kevin (born 1984) and Eric (born 1990).\n\n"}

The Board, in turn, appoints an Executive Director to serve as the chief administrative officer of the Board.\n\nThe current board chairman is David House, president of Jireh Resources, LLC in Tulsa, OK.\n\nOERB was created by the Oklahoma Legislature and energy industry leaders in 1993 during the term of Governor of Oklahoma David Walters.\n\nThe stated missions of the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board are:\n\nOERB is under the leadership of the Secretary of Energy, the Chair of the Board, and the Executive Director of OERB. Under Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin, C. Michael Ming serves as Secretary, David House serves as the Chairman and Mindy Stitt serves as the Executive Director.\n\nSince its creation in 1993, the OERB has committed $69 million to restore more than 11,800 abandoned and orphaned well sites as part of its environmental restoration program. It has made restoration progress in 67 of Oklahoma's 77 counties and has a restoration budget of $6 million for the current fiscal year.\n\nUnique is OERB's funding process – though it is funded by a 0.1% assessment on oil and gas sales (not uncommon among similar agencies), it is a voluntary assessment. Any producer or royalty owner may opt out of the program by requesting OERB (between January 1 and March 31 of each year) for a refund of previously paid assessments. OERB states that over 95% of participants remain in the program.\n\nThroughout its history, the OERB has reached more than 1 million Oklahoma students with energy curricula, classroom supplies, field trips, college scholarships and presentations. OERB reaches all academic grade levels – from kindergarten through college with its energy education programs, including:\n\n\nThrough its Conservation Education Program, the OERB has contributed $1.75 million to help more than 800 Oklahoma families weatherize their homes and save up to 30 percent on their utility bills. In addition to providing weatherization assistance, the OERB provides tips on saving energy and money through advertisements, community events and a website, which includes a “Weatherize Your Home” video demonstration, conservation tips and information on how to apply for home heating assistance.\n\n"}

Since 2004, it has provided free online courses for continuing professional development in a wide range of health and science related disciplines. These include self-directed, blended learning, instructor-led and hybrid courses.\n\nThe platform runs on a free and open-source software learning management system. POLHN works with several universities institutions and Ministries of Health to develop online health related courses guided by WHO publications and accepted standard operating procedure. Since 2013, the platform has resembled a typical massive open online course (MOOC) platform.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and Pacific Ministries of Health established POLHN in 2003 through funding provided by the Government of Japan. POLHN was established to address the need of health professionals in the Pacific to access continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities and up-to-date health information. POLHN fulfills these needs through an e-learning network across fourteen Pacific Island Countries, areas and territories.\n\nPOLHN provides access to sponsored and self-paced courses, news, application forms, and links to resources. The website is the main gateway to accessing courses, online resources, and health information. The website also contains information about POLHN, information on learning centres, contact details for POLHN country coordinators, information on the availability of scholarships, and application forms for courses.\n\nIt has partnerships with many organisations, allowing members to complete certification programs. There are also general courses unrelated to any certification program, such as Patient Safety, Risk Communications, Diabetes, and Psycho-social Response in Humanitarian Disasters. These take between 20 and 60 hours to complete, with automatic assessment of activities and exams.\n\nSince its inception, POLHN has undergone various steps to expand and improve. These have included external reviews, for instance by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the University of Technology Sydney and Hezel Associates.\n\nPOLHN has three main goals: \n\nThe POLHN platform facilitates learning through an interactive environment, where students can access information, communicate with students and teachers, and complete course modules and assessments. Over 30,000 health workers have accessed POLHN across various cadres.\n\nA key component of the POLHN community is its learning centres. These are physical locations where health workers in Pacific island countries can have easy access to courses. To date, POLHN has 54 internet connected learning and development centres in 15 Pacific island countries.\n\nLearning centres are located in 14 countries: \n\nPacific Ministries of Health have appointed 40+ country coordinators and focal points to manage POLHN in-country activities.\n\nPOLHN also has a strong community across social media. It regularly and actively engages through platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn. These are managed in-house at the WHO Division of Technical Support in Suva, Fiji.\n\nIn 2017, POLHN launched its online blog. Since then, several pieces have been published under the general theme of health education. This has included success stories on POLHN students across the Pacific, as well as the latest news on POLHN.\n\nIn addition to this, POLHN has a popular newsletter, which is sent out regularly to students and staff regarding all the current events related to POLHN, such as scholarship opportunities, new blog articles, and the latest courses. The blog also offers the opportunity for members of the POLHN community to write their own articles and post comments.\n\nPOLHN is a partnership between WHO and Pacific Ministries of Health. POLHN works with regional academic institutions; course providers; academic institutions and development partners to develops and provides continuing education opportunities to health professionals in the Pacific. POLHN hosts different course categories:\n\nEach semester, POLHN sponsors approximately 100 staff from Pacific ministries of health to take instructor-led postgraduate courses. Postgraduate certificates, diplomas and masters programmes are all available. These can be completed without students leaving their communities.\n\nPrimarily, POLHN's partnership approach involves POLHN's partners offering sponsorship are: \n\nPOLHN's self-paced courses are also put together with the assistance of its partners. Some courses are created in-house at the WHO Secretariat in Suva, Fiji. Others are made in cooperation with partner institutions, including the University of Queensland.\n\nPOLHN sponsors registered nurses in the Pacific to undertake a Bachelor of Nursing Bridging programme at the University of Fiji (also known as UniFiji). This allows nurses with a Diploma in Nursing to upgrade their qualification to a bachelor's degree. This new initiative has been widely praised in the media in Fiji, where POLHN sponsorship for nursing at UniFiji is seen as a real opportunity to take the skills of nurses in the Pacific to a whole new level.\n\nPOLHN annually sponsors over 100 health professionals across the Pacific to take postgraduate courses in public health and health services management through FNU. Programs are available at postgraduate certificate, diploma and masters levels and can be completed by health workers without leaving their communities.\n\nPOLHN sponsors certificates in applied epidemiology, health research, health service management, and public health. The Master's in Public Health is particularly popular.\n\nThe PPTC provides technical training and development assistance to clinical laboratories and blood transfusion services of the Pacific region. Mostly runs training courses in Wellington but retains flexibility to run in-country courses, short-term attachments to NZ medical labs and offers on-line courses through POLHN. They also have a quality management component (Regional External Quality Assurance Programme). POLHN sponsors around 40 laboratory technicians to take PPTC's Diploma in Medical Laboratory Science. POLHN and PPTC work is benefiting laboratory assistants across the Pacific in completion of their Diplomas in Medical Laboratory Science. These diplomas include generally involve up to 8 courses over 2 years, include ones in laboratory technology, biochemistry, blood bank technology, hematology, immunology, microbiology, and laboratory diagnosis of STIs.\n\nCertification awarded by Penn Foster Career School in collaboration with Pacific Basin Dental Association (PBDA) and WHO/POLHN. This involves 9 modules in 9 months (self-paced), with face-to-face validation of skills via PBDA.\n\nAs of 2016, the countries involved are American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Republic of Marshall Islands\n\nLippincott provides over 1000 continuing education resources developed by nurses for nurses, POLHN assists by providing free access to fee-based courses.\n\nMedscape education provides CPD courses in over 30 health specialities. The courses are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education.\n\nPOLHN links with GHeL in order for health professionals in the Pacific to access over 50 short courses in public health, developed by USAID specifically for health professionals working in low-resource settings. In the Pacific region, through endorsement from the Pacific Open Learning Health Net (POLHN), GHeL courses are accepted CPD requirements for 30,000 health workers from 15 Pacific island countries.\n\nPOLHN has developed a conventional relationship with fourteen of the twenty two Pacific countries and areas and has established forty POLHN centres in 14 of those countries. The POLHN centres are usually located in or near hospitals or nursing schools. Most of the learning centres are equipped with internet connected computers, printers, scanners and video projection equipment.\n\n"}

Published in 1798, it is a comprehensive theory of education that combines the ideas of philosophers John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau as well as of educational writers such as Thomas Day, William Godwin, Joseph Priestley, and Catharine Macaulay. The Edgeworths' theory of education was based on the premise that a child's early experiences are formative and that the associations they form early in life are long-lasting. They also encourage hands-on learning and include suggestions of \"experiments\" that children can perform and learn fun. Following Locke's emphasis on the importance of concrete language over abstract, the Edgeworth's argued that words should clearly indicate \"distinct ideas\". This contributed to what Romanticist Alan Richardson calls \"their controversial positions\", including their resistance to reading fairy tales to children or discussing religion with them.\n\n\nFirst edition;\nThird edition;\n"}

Opposed to desegregation busing of Boston's public school students, the group protested the federally-mandated order to integrate Boston Public Schools by staging formal, sometimes violent protests. It remained active from 1974 until 1976.\n\nMany citizens felt the racial imbalance in Boston needed to be improved. The African-Americans of Boston had been fighting for equality in black and white public schools for decades before the creation of the Racial Imbalance Act or the formation of ROAR. Due to the inherent segregation within Boston, many schools were composed of either majority white or majority black students. This led to the white schools receiving more funding per student and having newer educational resources while black schools were receiving statistically much less funding and were typically of inferior quality than schools in primarily white districts. There was apparent segregation which occurred by chance legally. This form of segregation, known as \"de facto\" segregation was not intentional. Rather, it occurred by circumstance.\n\nOne of the members of the Boston School Committee, Louise Day Hicks, was to become the founder of ROAR. The committee itself denied any accusations of inequity amongst white and black students. Hicks spoke outwardly against the desegregation of schools. The NAACP was not willing to let this segregation continue and filed a lawsuit against the Boston School Committee; this was the beginning of the Tallulah Morgan v. James Hennigan case which would eventually bring about forced busing. On June 21, 1974, Judge Garrity ruled that the Committee was to create a plan to desegregate their schools. When the committee failed to provide such an idea, the federal court became involved. By federal decision, students were to be bused to schools in different districts to decrease the level of inequal education students were receiving.\n\nThose who opposed the forced busing, which happened to be the majority of whites, especially mothers, in Boston, retaliated with protests. They eventually organized to create the infamous ROAR. While some of their concerns were legitimate, the organization was ultimately pro-segregation of schools. Not all members were definitive racists, but there was a connection between the group and racism as some of the members spoke outwardly against blacks. Initially a small group of females, they quickly gained local popularity as many locals shared their opinions. The act of forced busing was seen as a populist movement that potentially threatened the traditional values that the women of ROAR held. The fusing of mainly African-American and white districts could dissipate the borders between two very different neighborhoods that held different values, leading to certain groups feeling alienated.\n\nLouise Day-Hicks created \"Save Boston Committee\" in February 1974 with an agenda to restore \"the custodial rights of parents over their children\". She believed it was unfair for the government to force all public schools to desegregate, claiming it was neither a viable nor a beneficial way to improve American society and education. The group was later renamed ROAR to oppose the Racial Imbalance Act in 1974. The busing change in their eyes was \"a total disaster\". Hicks changed the name by the summer to ROAR. She used her position as a mother to rally others into her cause, arguing that the government needed to take a different approach if they wanted a stable nation. Some Americans, namely white mothers believed they were righteous in their cause and that they just wanted to keep the school environment running properly as much as possible.\n\nThe group's purpose was to fight off U.S. Federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity's court order requiring the city of Boston to implement desegregation busing — an order intended to eliminate \"de facto\" racial segregation in its public schools. To supporters, ROAR's purpose was its namesake; i.e., to protect the \"vanishing rights\" of white citizens. To its many opponents, however, ROAR was a symbol of mass racism coalesced into a single organization. ROAR was composed primarily of women, and its leaders argued that \"the issue of forced busing is a women's issue.\"\n\nOn April 3, 1974, the committee organized a 20,000 person march from Boston City Hall Plaza to the State House. On March 19, 1975, 1,200 ROAR members marched in Washington DC to generate national support for their cause.\n\nLouise Day Hicks, the founder of the organization, firmly opposed the racial integration of schools in Boston for ten years beforehand. Her office served as the headquarters for ROAR, she led a majority of protests, and she responded to all letters addressed to ROAR. Once a fight between Hicks and fellow member Pixie Palladino broke out, members' trust in Hicks began to diminish.\n\nPalladino was considered to be more radical than Hicks. In January 1975, Palladino and eighty ROAR women stormed into a governor's commission on the status of women, dressed in \"Stop Forced Busing\" T-shirts. On March 10, 1976, Palladino began to create her own group, \"United ROAR\", which catered to beliefs that were more moderate than those of Hicks.\n\nFran Johnnene was one of ROAR's most influential members. Johnnene was mostly responsible for holding meetings at her house in Hyde Park, rounding up neighbors and community members. Johnnene was also involved with the less radical anti-busing group, the Massachusetts Citizens Against Forced Busing, in February 1974. Towards the end of 1975, Johnnene left ROAR due to the increased radicalism.\n\nA majority of the group's members were white Boston housewives, known as \"militant mothers.\"\n\nThere were instances of both violent and peaceful protest from the organization ROAR. During a protest, a wooden bus was burned as a representation of the forced busing policy (Powell). There were also occasions on which school children and parents alike pelted the buses coming from predominantly African-American areas (Gellerman). Protester signs often displayed racial slurs such as, 'Nigger Go Home,' and depicted monkeys (Gellerman). On December 11, 1974, at South Boston High, Michael Faith, a white student was stabbed by a black student by the name of James White. Hicks, present at the scene, attempted to calm the crowd, most of which belonging in ROAR. At that time, she prioritized the black students' safety on their way back home.\n\nHowever, members also protested in peaceful ways. For example, in the time immediately following the desegregation, majority of white children did not attend school in both the formerly African-American schools and historically white schools (Gellerman). They reenacted the Boston Massacre to symbolize their empathy with the oppressed inhabitants of colonial America (Lukas). On April 3, 1974, over 20,000 ROAR protesters marched on the State House to show their distaste for desegregation busing. On March 19, 1975, 1,200 members of ROAR marched on Washington DC to gain national recognition for their cause and possibly an amendment placed into the constitution that would illegal desegregation busing.\n\nBy the year 1975, ROAR shifts its focus from busing to feminine issues, including participating in the signing for the year 1975 to be known as \"International Women's Year.\" At that point, the forced busing act was seen more as an attack on women, specifically mothers. ROAR however remained ignored by the government, but continued to protest fervently. Though the media particularly the Boston Globe, often portrayed the group as racist, ROAR leader Virginia Sheehy states that their issues are mainly class-based. Sheehy argued by stating that she initially worked alongside black women in the Home and School Association prior to the forced busing issue. On the other hand, The Real Paper, a local newspaper company stated that the ROAR group is truly fighting for their traditional values. Overall, ROAR helped to consolidate the conservatism movement in the following year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "254108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254108", "title": "Textbook", "text": "Textbook\n\nA textbook or coursebook (UK English) is a manual of instruction in any branch of study. Textbooks are produced according to the demands of educational institutions. Schoolbooks are textbooks and other books used in schools. Nowadays, most textbooks aren't published exclusively in printed format; many are now available as online electronic books.\n\nThe history of textbooks dates back to civilizations of ancient history. For example, Ancient Greeks wrote \"texts\" intended for education. The modern textbook has its roots in the standardization made possible by the printing press. Johannes Gutenberg himself may have printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers, who used the books as instructional aids (e.g., alphabet books), as well as individuals who taught themselves.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Plato lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing. Before the invention of the Greek alphabet 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like Homer's epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student Plato in his famous Dialogues.) \n\nThe next revolution for books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw printing press to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nGutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic Gutenberg Bible in the 1450s — a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament, copies of which can be viewed on the British Library website. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.\n\nCompulsory education and the subsequent growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many standardized texts for children. Textbooks have become the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century New England Primer and the 19th century McGuffey Readers.\n\nTechnological advances change the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic and PDF books, online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an electronically published book, or e-book, is \"Principles of Biology\" from Nature Publishing.\n\nMost notably, an increasing number of authors are foregoing commercial publishers and offering their textbooks under a creative commons or other open license.\n\nThe textbook market does not operate in the same manner as most consumer markets. First, the end consumers (students) do not select the product, and the people (faculty and professors) who do select the product do not purchase it. Therefore, price is removed from the purchasing decision, giving the producer (publishers) disproportionate market power to set prices high. However, some argue that textbooks are really part of another product; the class that the student registered to take. But the price of the textbook still isn't typically taken into account when this occurs and isn't part of the perception of the product. \n\nThis fundamental difference in the market is often cited as the primary reason that prices are high. The term \"broken market\" first appeared in the economist James Koch's analysis of the market commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance.\n\nThis situation is exacerbated by the lack of competition in the textbook market. Consolidation in the past few decades has reduced the number of major textbook companies from around 30 to just a handful. Consequently, there is less competition than there used to be, and the high cost of starting up keeps new companies from entering.\n\nStudents seek relief from rising prices through the purchase of used copies of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive. Most college bookstores offer used copies of textbooks at lower prices. Most bookstores will also buy used copies back from students at the end of a term if the book is going to be re-used at the school. Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores where the books will be sold. Textbook companies have countered this by encouraging faculty to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website. If a student has a new textbook, then he or she can use the pass code in the book to register on the site. If the student has purchased a used textbook, then he or she must pay money directly to the publisher in order to access the website and complete assigned homework.\n\nStudents who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.\n\nMost leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math & science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. \"New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices,\" A study conducted by The Student PIRGs found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of previous edition, and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by faculty demand. The Student PIRGs' study found that 76% of faculty said new editions were justified “half of the time or less” and 40% said they were justified “rarely” or “never.” The PIRG study has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per student.\n\nThe Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on electronic textbooks, or \"eTextbooks,\" does not always save students money. Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost through resale.\n\nAnother publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is \"bundling,\" or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook. Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material. Students do not always have the option to purchase these items separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.\n\nAccording to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they “rarely” or “never” use the bundled items in their courses.\n\nA 2005 Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:\n\nWhile publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers’ practice \nof packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books...If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.\nBundling has also been used as a means of segmenting the used book market. Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.\n\nLegislation on the state and federal level seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately. Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision, but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of \"integrated textbooks.\" The Federal bill only exempts 3rd party materials in integrated textbooks, however publisher lobbyists have attempted to create a loophole through this definition in state bills.\n\nGiven that the problem of high textbook prices is linked to the \"broken\" economics of the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures. By inserting price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the economic forces operate more normally.\n\nNo data suggests that this is in fact true. However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult to obtain. Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40% got an answer when they directly asked. Furthermore, the study found that 23% of faculty rated publisher websites as “informative and easy to use” and less than half said they typically listed the price.\n\nThe US Congress passed a law in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act that would require price disclosure. Legislation requiring price disclosure has passed in Connecticut, Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Publishers are currently supporting price disclosure mandates, though they insist that the \"suggested retail price\" should be disclosed, rather than the actual price the publisher would get for the book.\n\nOnce a textbook is purchased from a retailer for the first time, there are several ways a student can sell his/her textbooks back at the end of the semester or later. Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.\n\nAs for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.\n\nWhen students resell their textbooks during campus “buyback” periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain. If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company. The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore. Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.\n\nStudents can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the US Air Force Academy, it is possible to e-mail entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.\n\nOnline marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an online auction format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.\n\nOnline book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus \"buyback\" periods are not in effect. Students enter the ISBN numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer \"free shipping\" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.\n\nIn response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.\n\nAccording to textbook author Henry L. Roediger (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks. As methods of \"dealing with this problem\", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books. The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction. The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of used books, and would make that entire industry illegal.\n\nAnother alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks.The article \"E books rewrite the rules of education\" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been \"gaining momentum\". According to the article \" Are textbooks obsolete?\", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. \"The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says \" As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market\".\n\nIn-store rentals are processed by either using a kiosk and ordering books online with a third party facilitator or renting directly from the store's inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.\n\nAnother method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.\n\nThe latest trend in textbooks is \"open textbooks.\" An open textbook is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by its author(s). According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard. A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.\n\nAlthough the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense. To offer another perspective, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work.\n\nThe other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks. Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.\n\nOn the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing. Most notably, the startup publisher Flat World Knowledge already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by more than 900 institutions in 44 countries. Their business model was to offer the open textbook free online, and then sell ancillary products that students are likely to buy if prices are reasonable - print copies, study guides, ePub, .Mobi (Kindle), PDF download, etc. Flat World Knowledge compensates its authors with royalties on these sales. With the generated revenue Flat World Knowledge funded high-quality publishing activities with a goal of making the Flat World financial model sustainable. However, in January, 2013 Flat World Knowledge announced their financial model could no longer sustain their free-to-read options for students. Flat World Knowledge intends to have open textbooks available for the 125 highest-enrolled courses on college campuses within the next few years.\n\nCK-12 FlexBooks are the open textbooks designed for United States K-12 courses. CK-12 FlexBooks are designed to facilitate conformance to national and United States and individual state textbook standards. CK-12 FlexBooks are licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. CK-12 FlexBooks are free to use online and offer formats suitable for use on portable personal reading devices and computers - both online and offline. Formats for both iPad and Kindle are offered. School districts may select a title as is or customize the open textbook to meet local instructional standards. The file may be then accessed electronically or printed using any print on demand service without paying a royalty, saving 80% or more when compared to traditional textbook options. An example print on demand open textbook title, \"College Algebra\" by Stitz & Zeager through Lulu is 608 pages, royalty free, and costs about $20 ordered one at a time (March, 2011). \"(Any print on demand service could be used - this is just an example. School districts could easily negotiate even lower prices for bulk purchases to be printed in their own communities.)\" Teacher's editions are available for educators and parents. Titles have been authored by various individuals and organizations and are vetted for quality prior to inclusion in the CK-12 catalog. An effort is underway to map state educational standards correlations. Stanford University provided a number of titles in use.\n\nCurriki is another modular K-12 content non-profit \"empowering educators to deliver and share curricula.\" Selected Curriki materials are also correlated to U.S. state educational standards. Some Curriki content has been collected into open textbooks and some may be used for modular lessons or special topics.\n\nSimilar to the issue of reimportation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S. market, the GAO report also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels. While the 1998 Supreme Court decision Quality King v. L'anza protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the first-sale doctrine, textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors. Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States. For example, some U.S. booksellers arrange for drop-shipments in foreign countries which are then re-shipped to America where the books can be sold online at used prices (for a \"new\" unopened book). The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.\n\nAccording to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher. The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. \nBookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.\n\nAccording to the GAO study published July 2005:\nFollowing closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.\n\nRising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.\nAccording to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005: \"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period.\"\n\nAccording to the 2007 edition of the College Board’s Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007: \"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent.\"\n\nIn most U.S. K-12 public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.\n\nTextbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the Texas Education Agency sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.\n\nIn recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as Howard Zinn (\"A People's History of the United States\"), Gilbert T. Sewall (\"\") and James W. Loewen (\"\"), make the claim that U.S. history textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient Rome to the Soviet Union (USSR) and the People's Republic of China. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.\n\nScience textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.\n\nDiscussions of textbooks have been included on creation and evolution in the public education debate. The \"Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County\" case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.\n\nIn his book, \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\", the late physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard P. Feynman described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks. At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent — for reasons of timing — a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.\n\nLargely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of new math and reform mathematics which have sought to replace traditional mathematics in what have been called the math wars. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast \"progressive\" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity with approaches that often incorporate principles of constructivism and discovery. Texts such as TERC and CMP discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to \"devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples\", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.\n\nIn the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.\n\nIn some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.\n\nWith higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades. A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade. A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, “Turn the Page,” reported that the average U.S. student spends $700–$1000 per year on textbooks.\n\nWhile many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party—faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers—for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward open textbooks and other lower-cost digital solutions.\n\nTextbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.\n\nIn cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, \"the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases\".\n\nTextbooks are an important aspect of inclusive education in how they incorporate inclusive language, diverse identities, and human rights, particularly as they reflect issues of culture, gender, and religion.\n\nThe defense of cultural diversity, as understood by UNESCO, is an ethical imperative, inseparable from children’s universal right to education. It implies a commitment to the fundamental rights of persons belonging to minorities and to the cultural rights that are an integral part of human rights. Culture is also central to contemporary debates on citizenship and identity, social cohesion, and the growth of knowledge- based economies. Education has a major part to play in shaping such dialogues as cultural exchanges and economic cooperation become increasingly more common. Textbooks can be used to promote cultural diversity and, in particular, nurture culture in its broadest sense understood as the “whole complex of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a society or social group.”\n\nHaving concentrated on rooting out racist and xenophobic prejudice in textbooks as early as 1946, in the 1970s UNESCO started to tackle gender stereotypes, which are recognized as a source of enduring inequality between women and men. A research programme on the image of women was launched after the 1980 Copenhagen World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women to identify and characterize sexism and recommend various steps to eliminate it. The programme showed that sexism in textbooks often consists of failing to recognize the range of actual roles played by men and women in society and neglecting the real advances that have been made in terms of gender equality.\n\nTextbooks should help students understand the roles most often assigned to women and men and recognize those aspects of social change needed to build a fairer social order that includes both sexes and sexual minorities on an equal footing with the mainstream society. Discussions prompted by reading textbooks and teacher-pupil interactions can be used to address, question, and dismiss stereotypes. Relating examples from past societies and telling stories that give prominence to other gender categories (besides men and women) and other sexual orientations (besides heterosexuality) can show the prejudicial effect of the division of humankind into two sexes and the imposition of heterosexuality.\n\nWith the rise of globalization, the multiplicity of world views and religious practices that individuals confront has increased. Textbooks are instrumental in the process of raising awareness about others’ beliefs and fostering understanding of, and respect for, the diversity of beliefs present in societies and the world at large. Textbooks can help to combat prejudice, present pluralism as an asset, and encourage mutual understandings based on respect for the right to express one’s beliefs. They contribute to promoting tolerance, critical thinking in the face of divisive stereotyping and discrimination, and the independence of individual choice.\n\n\n"}

He taught for a time at Millfield School. In 1983, he published his collection of verse, \"Sing England to Italy\". These poems were described by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman as \"deeply felt and... very beautiful\". Leng taught creative writing, and as a further education teacher, he delivered such diverse subjects as philosophy, cosmology, science and history, and gave the annual Einstein Lectures at Croydon College. However, his major preoccupation was with mathematical physics, and after delivering papers to a number of major mathematical conferences during the 1990s, in 1999 Leng produced his \"The Theory-of-Everything Equation\", in which \"all things originate in and constantly communicate with a 'multiverse' that produces 'points' which turn, thus producing the cosmos\".\n\nLeng died in London in 2002, after contracting an illness while attending a mathematical conference in Beijing.\n"}
{"id": "3447484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3447484", "title": "William Pope.L", "text": "William Pope.L\n\nPope.L (also known as William Pope.L, born 1955 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American visual artist best known for his work in performance art, and interventionist public art. However, he has also produced art in painting, photography and theater. He was included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is a Guggenheim Fellow and a recipient of the Creative Capital Visual Arts Award. Selected now for the second time, Pope.L will be included in the upcoming Whitney Biennial of 2017.\n\nPope.L attended Pratt Institute from 1973 to 1975 and participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program from 1977 to 1978. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Montclair State University, Montclair, New Jersey, in 1978. He received a Master of Fine Arts degree in visual arts from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1981.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, Pope.L was a lecturer of Theater and Rhetoric at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. As a faculty member he directed a production of Lorraine Hansberry's \"A Raisin In the Sun\", in which he used both African-American and Caucasian actors as members of the same family.\n\nFor \"ATM Piece\", performed in 1997, he attached himself with an eight-foot length of Italian sausage to the door of a Chase Bank in midtown Manhattan wearing nothing but a skirt made out of dollar bills.\n\n\"eRacism\", a project that Pope.L began during the late 1970s, included over 40 endurance-based performances consisting of “crawls”, varying in length and duration. In one example titled \"Tompkins Square Crawl\" (1991) Pope.L dressed in a business suit and crawled through the gutter in Tompkins Square Park, New York, pushing a potted flower with one hand. Another example titled \"The Great White Way\" involved a crawl which stretched over 22 miles and took five years to complete. For this performance he donned a Superman outfit and strapped a skateboard to his back. The crawl stretched the entire 22 miles of Broadway, in New York City. Documentation of this performance was included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.\n\nIn 2001 the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) advisory renew panel granted Pope.L $42,000 in financing for a traveling retrospective called \"William Pope.L: eRacism\". Shortly after announcing the award, the acting chairman, Robert S. Martin, rescinded funding for the grant. Joel Wachs, then president of the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, stated in the December 21 issue of \"The New York Times\": \"It is important, particularly in light of what I would consider an attack on freedom of expression, to stand firm. We want this exhibition to occur; we want other funders to step forward; we don't want the N.E.A.'s decision to be something that has the effect of stopping what I think is going to be an important exhibition of art.\" \nThe Warhol Foundation, in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the LEF Foundation provided $50,000 in funding for the traveling retrospective to tour the United States. \"eRacism\" exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art at Maine College of Art; Diverse Works Art space, Houston, 2003; Portland Institute for Contemporary Art (PICA), Oregon, 2003; and Artists Space, New York, 2003 .\n\nThe catalog \"William Pope.L: Friendliest Black Artist in America\" was produced by curator Mark Bessire in conjunction with the retrospective exhibition.\n\nIn 2002 Pope.L received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award. In 2004 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2005 \"The Black Factory\", an art installation on wheels, traveled from Maine to Missouri as part of The Interventionists show organized by the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (Mass MOCA). \"Typically the Factory arrives at a city or town and sets up its interactive workshop on the street. People bring objects that represent blackness to them. The Factory’s workers use these objects in tightly rehearsed but loosely performed skits to stimulate a conversation — a flow of ideas, images and experiences. Most objects are photographed and made part of the Factory’s virtual library, some are housed in the Factory’s archive for later use, and some are pulverized in the Factory’s workshop to make new products available in the Factory’s gift shop.\"\n\nIn 2006 he was selected as one of the United States Artists fellows, for which he was awarded a $50,000 unrestricted grant.\n\nHe was featured alongside other performing artists: Sean Penn, Willem Dafoe, Brad Pitt, Steve Buscemi, and Juliette Binoche in Robert Wilson's LAB HD portraits. In 2008, Pope.L's piece \"One Substance, Eight Supports, One Situation\" was selected to participate in The Renaissance Society's group exhibition, \"Black Is, Black Ain't\".\n\nIn 2010 Pope.L was appointed faculty at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 2015 MOCA, Los Angeles presented \"Trinket\", the largest solo museum presentation of Pope.L's work to date. The centerpiece of the show is \"Trinket\", a monumental, custom-made American flag (approximately 54 x 16 feet) hanging on a pole in the middle of the Geffen. During the museum's public hours the flag will be continuously blown by four large-scale industrial fans — the type used on Hollywood film sets to create wind or rain effects — and will be illuminated from below by a bank of custom theatrical lights. Over time the flag will appear to fray at its ends due to the constant whipping of the forced air, a potent metaphor for the rigors and complexities of democratic engagement and participation. \"Trinket\" was originally produced in 2008 at Grand Arts, in Kansas City, Mo., as the centerpiece of Pope.L's exhibition Animal Nationalism. \n\nIn 2015 Pope.L produced \"The Beautiful\", a new choreographed crawl performance staged for the first time at Art Basel in Miami Beach. For \"The Beautiful\", four men, dressed as Superman with skateboards strapped to their backs, roll onward in the dark. The rumbling of their wheels grows louder through speakers as they approach the crowd, and blends with the low churning of electric guitars. The ‘Super-Gents’ reach a wooden stage and crab-walk their way up, barely fitting onto the small surface. Holding each other, they finally break into a heart-rending, soulful version of the patriotic song America The Beautiful.\n\nPope.L's art focuses on issues of consumption, social class, and masculinity as they relate to race. He is quoted as saying of his own work: “I am a fisherman of social absurdity, if you will… My focus is to politicize disenfranchisement, to make it neut, to reinvent what’s beneath us, to remind us where we all come from.”\n\nIn his Foundation for Contemporary Arts Fellowship bio, he writes: \"Like the African shaman who chews his pepper seeds and spits seven times into the air, I believe art re-ritualizes the everyday to reveal something fresh about our lives. This revelation is a vitality and it is a power to change the world.\".\n\n\n"}

The yearly event officially began on all US Nickelodeon channels: Nickelodeon, Nick GAS (until 2008), Noggin (now Nick Jr.), The N (now TeenNick), Nicktoons and NickMusic on October 1, 2005. The event was first shown on October 2, 2004 on Nickelodeon. Some foreign versions of Nick also participated. The event is designed as a finale for Nick's six-month-long Let's Just Play campaign. In addition, Nick.com would also have special features for children to learn how to stay active and healthy.\n\nThe event encourages children to think about getting away from the TV and being physically active. Schools and educational organizations have also been encouraged to host events around this theme.\n\nAs it has since 2004 (except 2018), Nickelodeon will suspend programming on WWDoP across all of its TV channels–Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Nicktoons and TeenNick– and websites from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. (ET/PT) (where TV grid listings have this listed as \"Off air\" or \"Worldwide Day of Play\") urging kids to “get up, go outside and play.” According to Viacom, the owner of the Nickelodeon networks, millions of children and adults are expected to participate in \"thousands of events in dozens of countries.\"\n\nWhen the \"Let's Just Play\" campaign ended in September, Nickelodeon aired the finale during the last Saturday of September, the \"Worldwide Day of Play\". Nickelodeon and its sister channels suspend programming for three hours from 12 Noon to 3PM ET/PT. During the time there was no programming, a special message would appear on the screen. There was no \"Let's Just Play\" campaign in 2008, though the Day of Play was held that year.\n\nNickelodeon's 15th WWDoP will be taking place on September 29, 2018, but there is no \"Off-Air\" screen this year on the Nick networks.\n\nAfter Nickelodeon resumes airing, they usually air marathons and premieres of TeenNick series, or \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". In 2007, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"Just Jordan\", \"Tak and the Power of Juju\", \"Zoey 101\", \"iCarly\", \"Back at the Barnyard\" had new episodes.

Later followed in 2011, new episodes of \"iCarly\", \"Big Time Rush\" and \"Supah Ninjas\" aired. In 2012, before the Worldwide Day of Play begin, new episodes of \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"\" aired as well with an hour-long final season premiere of \"iCarly\" later that night with a sneak peek of See Dad Run following iCarly. For 2013, new episodes of \"Sanjay and Craig\" and \"Rabbids Invasion\" aired prior to the event, while premieres of \"Sam & Cat\" and \"The Haunted Hathaways\" were shown that evening. In 2014, new episodes of \"Sanjay And Craig\" and \"Breadwinners\" were shown prior to the event, while new episodes of \"The Haunted Hathaways\", \"Henry Danger\", \"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn\", \"The Thundermans\", and \"AwesomenessTV\" were shown in the evening. In 2015, new episodes of Henry Danger, Game Shakers, and 100 Things To Do Before High School had aired that evening. In 2016, season premieres of Henry Danger, Game Shakers, & School Of Rock had aired that evening. In 2017, new episodes of Henry Danger and Game Shakers had aired that evening.\n\nSpecial appearances were arranged for the Worldwide Day of Play.
