The creation of universal academic standards requires agreement on rubrics, criteria or other systems of coding academic achievement. At colleges and universities, faculty are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades without regard for those students' actual abilities, both to keep those students in school paying tuition and to boost the schools' graduation rates. Students often use course evaluations to criticize any instructor who they feel has been making the course too difficult, even if an objective evaluation would show that the course has been too easy. It is very difficult to find a direct correlation between the quality of the course and the outcome of the course evaluations.\n\nStudent evaluations are a controversial method of assessing academic achievement. Recent studies have correlated high student evaluation of instructors with high grades rather than mastery of content. Studies have also noted that students' understanding of assessment criteria can lead to enhanced learning experiences.\n\nAccording to a 2009 report by UNESCO, changes in the university structure in the late 20th and early 21st century have led to increasing access to or \"massification\" of higher education which has, in turn, resulted in both a diversification of the student population but also a general decrease in academic standards globally.\n\nIn the UK, degree awarding bodies themselves are responsible for standards in higher education, but these are checked during inspection by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual). On its website QAA defines academic standards as 'The standards set and maintained by institutions for their courses (programmes and modules) and expected for their awards.'\n\nThe Dearing Report recommended in 1997 that benchmarking be used to measure and improve academic standards. From 1997 to 2011 this was done by code of practice and other guidelines known as the \"Academic Infrastructure\". During 2012-13, this was replaced by the \"Quality Code for Higher Education\", which included points about the availability of information about the learning experience to emphasize the role of the student as a paying customer of the institutions.\n\nIn the USA, regulation is at state level by bodies such as the Standards and Assessment Division of the Arizona Department of Education.\n\nThe Common Core is a group of academic standards which focus on two main subjects: mathematics and English language arts (ELA). These standards are intended to ensure mastery of information and prepare students for entry into the next grade and beyond. The core originated as a way to standardize the way students were taught from state-to-state, and also to quality of information students received. The Common Core has now been adopted by 42 states in the US.\n\nThe Common Core standards are:\n\n"}

Clark Kerr, then the President of UC, was a key figure in its development. The Plan set up a coherent system for postsecondary education which defined specific roles for the already-existing University of California (UC), the California State \"College\" (CSC) system of senior colleges, now California State \"University\" (CSU), and the California Community Colleges system (CCC).\n\nThe Master Plan also proposed a statutory framework for its implementation, which was signed into law by Governor Brown on April 27, 1960. The statute actually implementing the Master Plan is formally titled the Donahoe Higher Education Act (now located at Part 40 of Division 3 of Title 3 of the California Education Code), to honor the memory of Assemblywoman Dorothy Donahoe of Bakersfield. Donahoe had authored the legislative resolution which eventually resulted in the study that created the Master Plan, and was one of its foremost advocates. However, she died on April 4, 1960, and did not live to see the Plan's recommendations signed into law.\n\nPrior to the Master Plan's development in the 1960s, California struggled to reform its social institutions. Under political stranglehold, due to the 1920s-era railroad monopoly, new, self-proclaimed reformers attempted to overthrow the economic and political corruption existing in the state at the time. They wanted to create new institutions with a public morality to give California a new form of purpose. However, in the early years of California's emergence the population remained largely mobile, moving from opportunity to opportunity, making it almost impossible for the state to create permanent public schools. Furthermore, California progressives encountered obstacles in the form of people who thought that education should remain the work of local and religious groups, as well as being opposed to paying taxes for social purposes. Another wall towards progress that they needed to circumvent was the issue of appropriating land and money for universities. The 1st and 2nd Organic Acts (of 1866 and 1868, respectively) helped by first introducing the possibility of a state secular institution and second, actually allowing for the creation of a state university controlled by a Board of Regents (which would become the University of California).\n\nIn the 1950s, the state's legislators and academic administrators foresaw an approaching surge in University enrollment, due to the baby boom children coming of age. They needed a plan to be able to maintain educational quality in the face of growing demand. The underlying principles that they sought were:\n\nThe original Master Plan was approved by the Regents and the State Board of Education and submitted to the Legislature in February 1960. In April of that year, the California Legislature passed the \"Donahoe Act\" placing into statute a number of components of the Master Plan. However, California's Master Plan is more than a single statute. The 1960 Master Plan is embodied in several documents:\n\nClark Kerr stated that the goal of the master plan was to balance the \"competing demands of fostering excellence and guaranteeing educational access for all.\" The Master Plan achieved the following:\n\nAccording to the Plan, the top one-eighth (12.5%) of graduating high school seniors would be guaranteed a place at a campus of the University of California (Berkeley, Los Angeles, etc.) tuition-free. The top one-third (33.3%) would be able to enter the California State University system (San Francisco State, California State University, Los Angeles, etc.). Community colleges (Bakersfield College, College of the Canyons, Citrus College, Mount San Antonio College, etc.) would accept any students \"capable of benefiting from instruction.\" These percentages are now enforced by sliding scales equating grade point average and scores on the SAT or ACT, which are recalculated every year. No actual ranking of students in high schools is used as many schools do not rank students.\n\nGraduates of the community colleges would then be guaranteed transfer to the Cal State or UC systems in order to complete bachelor's degrees. This practice was carried over from previous years before the Plan was enacted, with graduates from the CCC being accepted as third-year students at the Universities by virtue of their prior coursework. Finally, the Plan established that the University of California would be the sole portion of the system charged with performing academic research, and would award master's and doctoral degrees in support of that mission. The Cal State system, in addition to awarding master's degrees, would be able to award joint doctorates with the UC.\n\nThe \"California Idea\" - California's tripartite system of public research universities, comprehensive 4-year undergraduate campuses, and open-access community colleges – has been highly influential, and many other states and even nations have imitated this structure. California higher education has had a poor record of college completion and 4-year Baccalaureate degree attainment. Subgroups such as Latinos and African Americans, who are a large and growing demographic, show even worsening statistics of degree attainment.\n\nThe Master Plan meant that essentially, \"anyone from anywhere in California could, if they worked hard enough, get a bachelor’s degree from one of the best universities in the country (and, therefore, in the world), almost free of charge.\"\n\nThe Plan increased overall efficiency in the higher education system, as well as produced greater number of graduates at a lower per-student cost by removing redundancies. This was accomplished by clearly specifying the missions of each system segment, in addition to clarifying what \"territory\" belonged to each institution. It established a \"rational\" planning process for the growth of the university systems, setting aside a past practice in which the Legislature would introduce bills establishing new four-year universities in a member's home district, a kind of political pork.\n\nThe Plan was the basis for a substantial surge in development in California higher education. Today, many credit the California universities for the place the state holds in the world economy, as well as bolstering its own economic makeup with great investment in high technology areas, such as Silicon Valley, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Plan has contributed to the massive economic contributions that the UC, CSU, and CCC systems have had to the state and its growth. According to a study by the Regents of California, the UC system is directly responsible for adding about $32.8 billion to the gross state product, which is about 1.8 percent of the total GSP, a key indicator of economic performance \n\nIn 1972, a review of the Plan found that the basic structure was good, but that it should be changed slightly to accommodate the ideas of the time. For example, the review board suggested that weekend and evening programs be expanded to serve “non-traditional” students, and incorporating technology such as T.V.\n\nIn 1978, Proposition 13, the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, was enacted, causing the free public education to be eliminated. (Since tuition was still banned under the act, the word was replaced with per-unit enrollment fees.) Though the costs were low, many taxpayers were very angered by it, though this might have been because of the direct effects of the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation.\n\nThe 1987 revision specifically recognized the contributions of the independent sector and made explicit provision to include the independent sector in the planning functions of the state's higher education system. It also established a policy to set the maximum award for Cal Grants in state law.\n\nIn 2005, the demand for high school and community college administrators brought about a widely debated exception to the existing differentiation of function between the CSU and UC systems. The awarding of doctoral degrees had originally been exclusive to the UC system, with the provision that the California State Universities could offer PhD degrees as \"joint\" degrees in combination with the University of California or an accredited private university. Under the provisions of SB 724, signed into law September 22, 2005, the campuses of the California State University were then able to directly offer a Doctor of Education degree (Ed.D) \"focused on preparing administrative leaders\". It was argued that this fulfilled the original purpose of many of the CSUs, which were set up as normal schools to train teachers.\n\nIn 2010, the CSU was also given the authority to exclusively offer two more Doctoral degrees - Doctorate in Nursing (DNP) and Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT).\n\nWhen the Master Plan was first founded in 1960, post-secondary education enrollments were equally divided among 2-year and 4-year institutions. However, in 2010, due to a lack of funding, the framers of the Master Plan limited eligibility admission to UC and CSU. The cost-cutting move diverted a large number of students to 2-year institutions, which would still allow them to finish their lower division work and then transfer to a 4-year institution.\n\n\n\n"}

The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Applied Science depending upon the university.\n\nThe degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, project management and specific topics in electrical and electronics engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub fields of electrical engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub fields towards the end of the degree.\nIn most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States and Canada), Chartered Engineer (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union).\n\nElectrical engineers can also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering, a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering or an Engineer's degree. The Master and Engineer's degree may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the United Kingdom and various other European countries, the Master of Engineering is often considered an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering.\n\nApart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to \"electronics\" engineering course. \"Electrical\" engineering courses have other specializations such as machines, power generation and distribution. Note that the following list does not include the large quantity of mathematics (maybe apart from the final year) included in each year's study.\n\nElements of vector calculus: divergence and curl; Gauss' and Stokes' theorems, Maxwell's equations: differential and integral forms. Wave equation, Poynting vector. Plane waves: propagation through various media; reflection and refraction; phase and group velocity; skin depth. Transmission lines: characteristic impedance; impedance transformation; Smith chart; impedance matching; pulse excitation. Waveguides: modes in rectangular waveguides; boundary conditions; cut-off frequencies; dispersion relations. Antennas: Dipole antennas; antenna arrays; radiation pattern; reciprocity theorem, antenna gain. Additional basic fundamental in electrical are to be study\n\nNetwork graphs: matrices associated with graphs; incidence, fundamental cut set and fundamental circuit matrices. Solution methods: nodal and mesh analysis. Network theorems: superposition, Thevenin and Norton's maximum power transfer, Wye-Delta transformation. Steady state sinusoidal analysis using phasors. Linear constant coefficient differential equations; time domain analysis of simple RLC circuits, Solution of network equations using Laplace transform: frequency domain analysis of RLC circuits. 2-port network parameters: driving point and transfer functions. State equations.\n\n\"Electronic Devices:\" Energy bands in silicon, intrinsic and extrinsic silicon. Carrier transport in silicon: diffusion current, drift current, mobility, resistivity. Generation and recombination of carriers. p-n junction diode, Zener diode, tunnel diode, BJT, JFET, MOS capacitor, MOSFET, LED, p-I-n and avalanche photo diode, LASERs. Device technology: integrated circuits fabrication process, oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation, photolithography, n-tub, p-tub and twin-tub CMOS process.\n\n\"Analog Circuits:\" Equivalent circuits (large and small-signal) of diodes, BJTs, JFETs, and MOSFETs.

For example, in the United States and Canada \"only a licensed engineer may...seal engineering work for public and private clients\". [4] This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. [5] In other countries, such as Australia, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. [6] In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. [7] An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.\n\nSignificant professional bodies for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology(IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature on electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 300 conferences annually. [8] The IET publishes 14 journals, has a worldwide membership of 120,000, certifies Chartered Engineers in the United Kingdom and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.

She is the author of three novels: \"The Testament of Yves Gundron\" (2000), \"Brookland\" (2006) and \"The Book of Esther\" (2016).\n\nBarton was raised in New Jersey, where she attended Kent Place School. She attended Harvard College, from which she graduated \"summa cum laude\" and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society. She also earned an MFA in fiction writing from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.\n\nBarton’s first novel, \"The Testament of Yves Gundron\", was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in January 2000. The book’s titular character is an inventor in the primitive and isolated farming village of Mandragora. When Gundron invents the harness – a device which alters the nature of farming – the villagers' lives change irrevocably. As Yves begins to recount the story of these changes, Ruth Blum, a Harvard anthropologist, arrives to study the village. Although the novel at first appears to take place in the Middle Ages, Yves’s brother tells tales of travels to \"Indo-China,\" and the villagers sing songs that are demonstrably examples of the blues.\n\nSome critics found Barton's technique of juxtaposing cultural milieus jarring. But many appreciated the novel's postmodern gamesmanship. In a rare blurb, the famously reticent writer Thomas Pynchon praised \"Yves Gundron\" as “[b]lessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt—a story that moves with ease and certainty, deeply respecting the given world even as it shines with the integrity of dream,” and John Freeman, writing for \"Time Out New York\", called it “An engrossing folktale that, in our technology-crazed era, ought to be required reading.” \"Yves Gundron\" was named a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of the Year for 2000. It has been translated into Dutch, French, Norwegian, and Greek.\n\nBarton's second novel, \"Brookland\", was published in 2006. \"Brookland\" takes as its basis Thomas Pope’s \"Rainbow Bridge\", a bridge that was proposed for the East River nearly a hundred years before the construction of John Roebling’s Brooklyn Bridge, but which was never actually built. In \"Brookland\", the bridge is the brainchild not of Pope but of a character invented by Barton: Prudence (\"Prue\") Winship, the proprietor of a successful gin distillery she inherited from her father. The novel is the story of the costs, both financial and personal, that the planning, construction, and ultimate destruction of the bridge exact from Prue and her community. Upon its publication, \"Brookland\" received widespread praise; in a review in the \"New Yorker\" magazine, Joan Acocella wrote that Prue Winship \"is not a ‘good-models’ feminist heroine, nor is she one of the bad-girl heroines of second-stage feminism. She is a thorny, struggling soul. Together with the book’s profound treatment of the spiritual ills born of the Enlightenment, this wonderful character is Barton’s main gift to us.” \"Brookland\" was also named a \"New York Times\" Notable Book, and was named one of the twenty-five best works of fiction and poetry of the year by the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nHer third novel, \"The Book of Esther\", is an alternate history tale in which the sixteen year-old heroine leads the resistance of a Jewish Empire against a German invasion in 1942, using magic and steampunk technology.\n\nBarton’s fiction has appeared in \"Conjunctions\", \"Story magazine\", and \"American Short Fiction\", and she has published essays in such venues as Moistworks.com and the \"Boston Review\". She frequently writes book reviews for the \"New York Times Book Review\", the \"Los Angeles Times Book Review\", and \"Bookforum\".\n\nBarton joined the Creative Writing faculty at Oberlin College in 2018. She previously taught at Yale University, New York University, Columbia University, Princeton University, Smith College, Bard College, and Eugene Lang College. She is married to the short-story writer Thomas Israel Hopkins; the couple has two sons.\n\nIn a 2008 essay at Nextbook.org (now Tablet Magazine), entitled \"Eli Miller’s Seltzer Delivery Service,\" Barton writes at length of her Jewish upbringing, although in one 2007 article she described herself as “a Jewess who wouldn’t leave the house without a stash of Tylenol, safety pins and mints.”\n"}

{"id": "11759510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11759510", "title": "Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index", "text": "Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index\n\nThe Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index (FSPI), a product of Academic Analytics, is a metric designed to create benchmark standards for the measurement of academic and scholarly quality within and among United States research universities.\n\nThe index is based on a set of statistical algorithms developed by Lawrence B. Martin and Anthony Olejniczak. It measures the annual amount and impact of faculty scholarly work in several areas, including:\n\nThe FSPI analysis creates, by academic field of study, a statistical score and a ranking based on the cumulative scoring of a program's faculty using these quantitative measures compared against national standards within the particular discipline. Individual program scores can then be combined to demonstrate the quality of the scholarly work of the entire university. This information is gathered for over 230,000 faculty members representing 118 academic disciplines in roughly 7,300 Ph.D. programs throughout more than 350 universities in the United States.\n\nUnlike other annual college and university rankings, \"e.g.\", the \"U.S. News & World Report\" annual survey, the FSPI focuses on research institutions as defined by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. It draws on the approach used by the United States National Research Council (NRC), which publishes a ranking of U.S.-based graduate programs approximately every ten years, but focuses on providing a more frequently-gathered set of benchmark measurements that do not include the qualitative and subjective reputation assessments favored by the NRC and other ranking systems.\n\nThe system for evaluating university programs that forms the basis of the FSPI was developed by Lawrence Martin and Anthony Olejniczak of Stony Brook University. Martin had been studying, speaking, and writing about faculty scholarly productivity since 1995. During that period, a series of discipline-specific, per-capita regression models was created and tested to evaluate their accuracy and the feasibility of predicting the academic reputation of the faculty of doctoral programs.\n\nThese prototype materials employed data from the National Research Council's 1995 publication \"Continuity and Change\" (and the subsequent CD-ROM publication of data), describing and evaluating American Ph.D. programs by field. Martin and Olejniczak found that the reputation of a program (as measured by faculty scholarly reputation from a survey conducted by the National Research Council) could be predicted well using a discipline-specific regression equation derived from quantitative, per capita data available for each program (the number of journal articles, citations, federally funded grants, and honorific awards). Reputation could be predicted with high statistical significance but important deviations from the regression line were also apparent; that is to say, some schools were outperforming their reputation, while others were under-performing. The prototype materials based on this method, and the data from the 1995 NRC study, were subsequently presented at numerous academic conferences from 1996 to 2004, and have formed the basis on which the FSP Index was developed.\n\nUnfortunately, like many academic productivity algorithms, the FSPI is not without major flaws. It fails to adequately differentiate among and apply appropriate measures to evaluating the very distinct academic fields represented in most colleges and universities. Furthermore, a number of specific objections have been raised about how the FSPI measures scholarly productivity. Among them are: 1) inadequate—or inconsistent—weighting of quality of journals in which publications appear; 2) failure to differentiate labor involved in producing different types of publications (publications based on secondary sources and those based on tedious and deep research are not differentiated—hence departments with many faculty members who write much but research little are better rated; 3) failure to differentiate between scholarly concentrations of departments. Departments with faculty who are more involved in obscure, non-mainstream research are less cited than those involved in fashionable, mainstream areas of research and scholarship; 4) citation indexes, extensively used in scholarly productivity indexes, do not measure citations in books; 5) citation indexes are more appropriate for hard science disciplines and less appropriate for humanities disciplines; 6) non-conventional publications, which are increasing in number (e.g. - Web sites and on-line publications, audio and media productions) are ignored; 7) use of such indexes promotes \"researching and publishing to the index\" in order to preserve and enlarge university, government, and private grant support—and indirectly promote conservative, safe, mainstream research and publications.\n\nIn spite of these objections, today the product is used by numerous universities.\n\n"}

The group focuses on economic development, job training and health initiatives in core-city Jacksonville and is also engaged in international projects. \n\nThe organization was founded in 1994 by the Rev. Dr. Robert V. Lee, III, an Episcopal priest who was rector at Church of Our Saviour (Jacksonville, Florida) for more than a decade. In its early years, the group focused on programs to promote financial literacy, youth mentoring, housing development and crime prevention, particularly in East Jacksonville. Dr. Lee continues to serve as CEO of the organization.\n\nFreshMinistries has worked to achieve the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to eliminate poverty through a number of initiatives. Current projects include: \n\n\nIn the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, FreshMinistries and its international arm, Be The Change International (BTCI) were asked by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate a major aid and relief operation there. The organizations' emergency relief effort shipped to the Haitian people many supplies, including three ambulances (one of which was delivered to the Haitian government), emergency aid, food, water, water purification systems, clothing, school supplies, large generators, and 147 large tents to serve as temporary schools and shelter.\n\nTom and Betty Petway made a $1 million gift donation in December, 2003. The couple had worked with the organization since the late 1990s and respected the work the group does. Petway was CEO of Zurich Insurance Services and said at the time: \"We're impressed with the work FreshMinistries has done in Jacksonville in creating opportunities for people of all races and faith traditions to participate economically and socially in our community. The organization needs the financial backing to continue the work it has started in the community, including assisting with other service organizations and ministries in the city.\"\nFreshMinistries used the money for several existing programs, including the Beaver Street Enterprise Center business incubator, youth programs, college internships and financial literacy initiatives.\n\nThe organization has also received considerable support from Jacksonville philanthropists Delores and Wayne Weaver. The organization's east Jacksonville community center, the Weaver Center for Community Outreach, is named in honor of the couple.\n\nFreshMinistries receives ongoing state support through the Florida Department of Children and Families, as well as private contributions. \n\nFreshMinistries received $10 million of $100 million in abstinence-focused grants awarded by the United States Agency for International Development, part of the President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The grant funded Siyafundisa, an initiative to provide onoing HIV/AIDS prevention programs in Africa. The grant is the largest the ministry has received.\n\n\nRelief for Haiti - Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in Washington, D.C. asked FreshMinistries and Be The Change International, to coordinate a large-scale effort to bring desperately needed doctors, medical technicians, translators and pharmaceuticals to Haiti. FreshMinistries and Be The Change International responded quickly and efficiently, delivering much needed goods to the country.\n\nCrime rate drop in Jacksonville's Eastside - In late 2009, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Officer Stephen Gallagher announced at a community meeting on the Eastside that violent crime in the area was down 34 percent and property crime was down 32 percent from 2008. Gallagher credited the Eastside Neighborhood Association, an initiative of FreshMinistries, as an \"extremely important\" part of the drop in crime.\nAlso responsible for the drop in crime were neighborhood cleanups and several neighborhood anti-crime walks organized by FreshMinistries to include Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford, local council persons, area patrol officers and neighborhood leaders.\n\nJacksonville chosen for Financial Access Pilot - In April 2008, Jacksonville, FL was chosen as one of eight cities in the U.S. to participate in a new pilot program to \"increase financial education and bank and credit union accounts for Americans currently outside of the financial mainstream.\" The pilot was recommended by several members of the President's Council on Financial Literacy, including Dr. Lee.\nJacksonville Mayor John Peyton said, \"We're honored to have Jacksonville chosen to participate in this worthwhile new initiative. Our existing efforts, under the leadership of FreshMinistries, recognized in 2005 by the U.S. Treasury for Excellence in Financial Literacy … will be able to reach more low-to-moderate income families and help them save for the future.\"\n\nChange Agent - In 2006, The Rev. Dr. Robert V. Lee III, founder and CEO of FreshMinistries, was named a \"Change Agent\" by the Florida Times-Union for creating FreshMinistries and, \"helping people start businesses, revitalize their neighborhoods and get out of debt.\"\n\nOperation New Hope - In 1999, FreshMinistries launched an initiative, called Operation New Hope, to train \"forgotten\" adults (those with troubled backgrounds) in Jacksonville in the construction industry, leading to employment opportunities. Aside from restoring individuals the program also restored neighborhoods and provided low income housing opportunities for core city residents. Operation New Hope is now no longer affiliated with FreshMinistries, having become its own separate, sustainable entity, and has since expanded its reach and operations in Jacksonville to include the re-entry and training of recently incarcerated individuals.\n\nKlutho building restoration - In 1998, the City of Jacksonville asked FreshMinistries to take over the restoration of an important historical landmark, The Klutho Apartment Building, designed by Henry John Klutho, as part of a city-wide effort to revitalize economic growth in the Springfield neighborhood.

It includes a foreword by novelist Matthew Pearl and is dedicated to Sean Collier. \"Geeks & Greeks\" is set at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and locations in Boston, Cambridge, and the Quincy Quarries. The story was inspired by MIT's hacking culture and the writer's experiences with fraternity hazing. At MIT a hack is a clever, benign prank or unsanctioned public display or installation that requires technical sophistication to execute and often incorporates an offbeat sense of humor. \"Geeks & Greeks\" has been described as \"Good Will Hunting\" meets \"Animal House\".\n\n\"Geeks & Greeks\" is the story of Jim Walden, a brilliant and charming young man who wants desperately to become an astronaut. Unfortunately he gets kicked out of high school for a prank. After a viral video catches the attention of MIT's admission office he is offered a scholarship to MIT.\n\nAt MIT Jim pledges Alpha Zeta Omicron (AZO), a raucous fraternity, and gets indoctrinated into MIT's hacking culture. Jim and his pledge brothers endure all manner of high-tech hazing at the hands of Luke Bardolf, a gruff AZO senior who is obsessed with pulling off the greatest hack at MIT.\n\nJim befriends Dexter Garfinkel (the ultimate nerd and AZO's live-in problem set slave) and begins a romance with Natalie Taylor (the Shakespeare-loving receptionist at a fertility clinic). Other characters include Professor Neustadt (who mentors Jim and helps him understand the significance and meaning of hacks) and the Bridge Troll (a homeless man who Jim aids).\n\nWhen an elaborate prank goes wrong, MIT's Discipline Committee sanctions Jim and forces him to make restitution, leading Jim to Natalie's fertility clinic as a way to make money quickly. Meanwhile Jim and Luke engage in an escalating back-and-forth prank battle, which leads to a climactic showdown at the Quincy Quarries after Luke nearly kills Dexter with his recklessness.\n\nIn the end Jim draws on his hacking prowess in a frantic race against time to prove to MIT that he deserves to be there, save his scholarship, make restitution with a bold gamble, exact revenge against Luke, win back Natalie, and inspire Dexter to revolt against his indentured servitude.\n\nElements of \"Geeks & Greeks\" were inspired by hazing incidents Altes witnessed as an MIT student as well as actual hacks, such as:\n\nThe book contains 120 endnotes citing the real-life events that influenced the graphic novel.\n\nCritical reception has been generally favorable. The Miami Herald called \"Geeks & Greeks\" a \"funny, human story of struggle and redemption with believable characters in outrageous but plausible situations.\" Library Journal called it an \"amusing romp\" and said its \"inventive dialog effectively juxtaposes outrageousness with hyperacademic geekery, like the 'milliHelen' measure of beauty, the insult 'nanophallus,' and a football cheer based on pi.\" The Post-Standard cited the \"vast pool of knowledge\" Altes drew on in creating a graphic novel that \"sets out to entertain while also showing what the modern nerd is really like.\" MIT's student newspaper \"The Tech\" called it \"a compelling read, filled with jokes that will please anyone with nerdier sensibilities and stories that are sure to inspire young readers to apply to the Institute,\" although they criticized the book for \"racial and gender under-representation\" among the characters. \"Geeks & Greeks\" has received positive reviews on the geek/comic culture websites FanboyNation.com, ForcesOfGeek.com, ForeverGeek.com, and ComicCrusaders.com.\n\nFilm rights to \"Geeks & Greeks\" have been optioned to Whydah Productions.\n\n"}

Pask first learned about cybernetics in early 1950s when the originator of the subject, Norbert Wiener, spoke at Cambridge University, where Pask was an undergraduate student. Pask was asked to be of assistance during Wiener's talk.\n\nHolding three doctorate degrees, Pask published more than 250 journal articles, books, patents and technical reports from funding from United States Armed Forces, the British Ministry of Defence, the British Home Office and the British Road Research Laboratory. He taught at the University of Illinois, Old Dominion University, Concordia University, Open University, University of New Mexico, Architectural Association School of Architecture and MIT.\n\nPask was born in Derby, England, in 1928, and educated at Rydal Penrhos. Before qualifying precociously as a mining engineer at Liverpool Polytechnic, now Liverpool John Moores University, Pask studied geology at Bangor University. He obtained an MA in natural sciences from Cambridge in 1952 and a PhD in psychology from the University of London in 1964. Whilst visiting professor of educational technology, he obtained the first DSc from the Open University and an ScD from his college, Downing Cambridge in 1995. From the 1960s Pask directed commercial research at System Research Ltd in Richmond, Surrey and his partnership, Pask Associates.\n\nPask's primary contributions to cybernetics, educational psychology, learning theory and systems theory, as well as to numerous other fields, was his emphasis on the personal nature of reality, and on the process of learning as stemming from the consensual agreement of interacting actors in a given environment (\"conversation\").\n\nHis work was complex, extensive, and deeply thought out, at least until late in his life, when he benefited less often from critical feedback of research peers, reviewers of proposals and reports to government bodies in the US and UK, and, perhaps most especially, the tension between experimentation and theoretical stands. His publications, however, represent a storehouse of ideas that are not fully mined.\n\nPask's most well known work was the development of:\n\nPask participated in the seminal exhibition \"Cybernetic Serendipity\" (ICA London, 1968) with the interactive installation \"Colloquy of Mobiles\", continuing his ongoing dialogue with the visual and performing arts. (cf Rosen 2008, and Dreher's History of Computer Art)\nPask influenced such diverse individuals as Ted Nelson, who references Pask in Computer Lib/Dream Machines and whose interest in hypermedia is much like Pask's entailment meshes; and Nicholas Negroponte, whose earliest research efforts at the Architecture Machine Group on \"idiosyncratic systems\" and software-based partners for design have their roots in Pask's work as a consultant to Negroponte's efforts.\n\nPask wrote several books and more than two hundred journal articles. Books include:\n\n\nPapers include:\n\n\n\n\nWhile working with clients in the last years of his life, Gordon Pask produced an axiomatic scheme for his Interactions of Actors Theory, less well-known than his Conversation Theory. \"Interactions of Actors (IA), Theory and Some Applications\", as the manuscript is entitled, is essentially a concurrent spin calculus applied to the living environment with strict topological constraints. One of the most notable associates of Gordon Pask, Gerard de Zeeuw, was a key contributor to the development of Interactions of Actors theory.\n\nInteractions of Actors Theory (IA) is a process theory. As a means to describe the interdisciplinary nature of his work, Pask would make analogies to physical theories in the classic positivist enterprises of the social sciences. Pask sought to apply the axiomatic properties of agreement or epistemological dependence to produce a \"sharp-valued\" social science with precision comparable to the results of the hard sciences. It was out of this inclination that he would develop his Interactions of Actors Theory. Pask's concepts produce relations in all media and he regarded IA as a process theory. In his Complementarity Principle he stated \"Processes produce products and all products (finite, bounded coherences) are produced by processes\".\n\nMost importantly Pask also had his Exclusion Principle. He proved that no two concepts or products could be the same because of their different histories. He called this the \"No Doppelgangers\" clause or edict. Later he reflected \"Time is incommensurable for Actors\". He saw these properties as necessary to produce differentiation and innovation or new coherences in physical nature and, indeed, minds.\n\nIn 1995, Pask stated what he called his Last Theorem: \"Like concepts repel and unlike concepts attract\". For ease of application Pask stated the differences and similarities of descriptions (the products of processes) were context and perspective dependent. In the last three years of his life Pask presented models based on Knot theory knots which described minimal persisting concepts. He interpreted these as acting as computing elements which exert repulsive forces to interact and persist in filling the space. The knots, links and braids of his entailment mesh models of concepts, which could include tangle-like processes seeking \"tail-eating\" closure, Pask called \"tapestries\".\n\nHis analysis proceeded with like seeming concepts repelling or unfolding but after a sufficient duration of interaction (he called this duration \"faith\") a pair of similar or like-seeming concepts will always produce a difference and thus an attraction. Amity (availability for interaction), respectability (observability), responsibility (able to respond to stimulus), unity (not uniformity) were necessary properties to produce agreement (or dependence) and agreement-to-disagree (or relative independence) when Actors interact. Concepts could be applied imperatively or permissively when a Petri (see Petri net) condition for synchronous transfer of meaningful information occurred. Extending his physical analogy Pask associated the interactions of thought generation with radiation : \"operations generating thoughts and penetrating conceptual boundaries within participants, excite the concepts bounded as oscillators, which, in ridding themselves of this surplus excitation, produce radiation\"\n\nIn sum, IA supports the earlier kinematic Conversation Theory work where minimally two concurrent concepts were required to produce a non-trivial third. One distinction separated the similarity and difference of any pair in the minimum triple. However, his formal methods denied the competence of mathematics or digital serial and parallel processes to produce applicable descriptions because of their innate pathologies in locating the infinitesimals of dynamic equilibria (Stafford Beer's \"Point of Calm\"). He dismissed the digital computer as a kind of kinematic \"magic lantern\". He saw mechanical models as the future for the concurrent kinetic computers required to describe natural processes. He believed that this implied the need to extend quantum computing to emulate true field concurrency rather than the current von Neumann architecture.\n\nReviewing IA he said:\nInteraction of actors has no specific beginning or end. It goes on forever. Since it does so it has very peculiar properties. Whereas a conversation is mapped (due to a possibility of obtaining a vague kinematic, perhaps picture-frame image, of it, onto Newtonian time, precisely because it has a beginning and end), an interaction, in general, cannot be treated in this manner. Kinematics are inadequate to deal with life: we need kinetics. Even so as in the minimal case of a strict conversation we cannot construct the truth value, metaphor or analogy of A and B. The A, B differences are generalizations about a coalescence of concepts on the part of A and B; their commonality and coherence is the similarity. The difference (reiterated) is the differentiation of A and B (their agreements to disagree, their incoherences). Truth value in this case meaning the coherence between all of the interacting actors.\n\nHe added:\nIt is essential to postulate vectorial times (where components of the vectors are incommensurate) and furthermore times which interact with each other in the manner of Louis Kaufmann's knots and tangles.\nIn experimental Epistemology Pask, the \"philosopher mechanic\", produced a tool kit to analyse the basis for knowledge and criticise the teaching and application of knowledge from all fields: the law, social and system sciences to mathematics, physics and biology. In establishing the vacuity of invariance Pask was challenged with the invariance of atomic number. \"Ah\", he said \"the atomic hypothesis\". He rejected this instead preferring the infinite nature of the productions of waves.\n\nPask held that concurrence is a necessary condition for modelling brain functions and he remarked IA was meant to stand AI, Artificial Intelligence, on its head. Pask believed it was the job of cybernetics to compare and contrast. His IA theory showed how to do this. Heinz von Foerster called him a genius, \"Mr. Cybernetics\", the \"cybernetician's cybernetician\".\n\nThe Hewitt, Bishop and Steiger approach concerns sequential processing and inter-process communication in digital, serial, kinematic computers. It is a parallel or pseudo-concurrent theory as is the theory of concurrency. See Concurrency. In Pask's true field concurrent theory kinetic processes can interrupt (or, indeed, interact with) each other, simply reproducing or producing a new resultant force within a coherence (of concepts) but without buffering delays or priority.\n\n\"There are no Doppelgangers\" is a fundamental theorem, edict or clause of cybernetics due to Pask in support of his theories of learning and interaction in all media: Conversation Theory and Interactions of Actors Theory. It accounts for physical differentiation and is Pask's exclusion principle. It states no two products of concurrent interaction can be the same because of their different dynamic contexts and perspectives. No Doppelgangers is necessary to account for the production by interaction and intermodulation (c.f. beats) of different, evolving, persisting and coherent forms. Two proofs are presented both due to Pask.\n\nConsider a pair of moving, dynamic participants formula_1 and formula_2 producing an interaction formula_3. Their separation will vary during formula_3. The duration of formula_3 observed from formula_1 will be different from the duration of formula_3 observed from formula_2.\n\nLet formula_3 and formula_3 be the start and finish times for the transfer of meaningful information, we can write:\nThus\n\n\"A\" ≠ \"B\"\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nPask remarked:\n\nConversation is defined as having a beginning and an end and time is vectorial. The components of the vector are commensurable (in duration). On the other hand actor interaction time is vectorial with components that are incommensurable. In the general case there is no well-defined beginning and interaction goes on indefinitely. As a result the time vector has incommensurable components. Both the quantity and quality differ.\n\nNo Doppelgangers applies in both the Conversation Theory's kinematic domain (bounded by beginnings and ends) where times are commensurable and in the eternal kinetic Interactions of Actors domain where times are incommensurable.\n\nThe second proof is more reminiscent of R.D. Laing: Your concept of your concept is not my concept of your concept—a reproduced concept is not the same as the original concept. Pask defined concepts as persisting, countably infinite, recursively packed spin processes (like many cored cable, or skins of an onion) in any medium (stars, liquids, gases, solids, machines and, of course, brains) that produce relations.\n\nHere we prove \"A\"(\"T\") ≠ \"B\"(\"T\").\n\n\"D\" means \"description of\" and <Con \"A\"(\"T\"), \"D\" \"A\"(\"T\")> reads A's concept of \"T\" produces A's description of \"T\", evoking Dirac notation (required for the production of the quanta of thought: the transfer of \"set-theoretic tokens\", as Pask puts it in 1996).\n\nor, in general\n\nalso, in general\n\nand vice versa, or, in general terms\n\ngiven that for all Z and all T, the concepts\n\nand that\n\nAA = A(A) is not equal to BA = B(A) and vice versa, hence, there are no Doppelgangers.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nPask attached a piece of string to a bar with three knots in it. Then he attached a piece of elastic to the bar with three knots in it. One observing actor, A, on the string would see the knotted intervals on the other actor as varying as the elastic was stretched and relaxed corresponding to the relative motion of B as seen from A. The knots correspond to the beginning of the experiment then the start and finish of the A/B interaction. Referring to the three intervals, where x, y, z, are the separation distances of the knots from the bar and each other, he noted x > y > z on the string for participant A does not imply x > z for participant B on the elastic. A change of separation between A and B producing Doppler shifts during interaction, recoil or the differences in relativistic proper time for A and B, would account for this for example. On occasion a second knotted string was tied to the bar representing coordinate time.\n\nTo set in further context Pask won a prize from Old Dominion University for his Complementarity Principle: \"All processes produce products and all products are produced by processes\". This can be written:\n\nAp(Con(T)) => D (T) where => means produces and Ap means the \"application of\", D means \"description of\" and Z is the concept mesh or coherence of which T is part. This can also be written\n\nPask distinguishes Imperative (written &Ap or IM) from Permissive Application (written Ap) where information is transferred in the Petri net manner, the token appearing as a hole in a torus producing a Klein bottle containing recursively packed concepts.\n\nPask's \"hard\" or \"repulsive\" carapace was a condition he required for the persistence of concepts. He endorsed Rescher's Coherence Theory of Truth approach where a set membership criterion of similarity also permitted differences amongst set or coherence members, but he insisted repulsive force was exerted at set and members' coherence boundaries. He said of Spencer Brown's Laws of Form that distinctions must exert repulsive forces. This is not yet accepted by Spencer Brown and others. Without a repulsion, or Newtonian reaction at the boundary, sets, their members or interacting participants would diffuse away forming a \"smudge\"; Hilbertian marks on paper would not be preserved. Pask, the mechanical philosopher, wanted to apply these ideas to bring a new kind of rigour to cybernetic models.\n\nSome followers of Pask emphasise his late work, done in the closing chapter of his life, which is neither as clear nor as grounded as the prior decades of research and machine- and theory-building. This tends to skew the impression gleaned by researchers as to Pask's contribution or even his lucidity. \n\n\n\n"}

'gwa-jam' usually shows the name of the university, the major, the student number, etc.\n\nUniversities, majors, and clubs are slightly different, but the most common design is to put the initial capital letters of the universities name on the chest and the student number on the arm. Also, on the back side, write down the name of the Universities in English or scholarly form, then write down 'univ' below it, and write down the name of the major at the bottom. The colors are usually matched in the universities symbol color, but they are sometimes matched to the color of the members' symbols. In recent years, they have been drawing universities flowers on their backs.\n\nSpring, the most common season for 'Gwa-jam', is sometimes called 'Gwa-jam season'. 'Gwa-jam' is good to wear on any clothes and warm in the spring weather. In recent years, even long padding for increased warmth. Likewise, the university name, major, and student number are written. In addition to ‘Gwa-jam’ and long padding shape, it also matches with unique design.\n\n'Gwa-jam', a fashion item, goes beyond clubs and clubs to meet clubs and student council. Even a small group like this they wear uniform clothes for belonging feeling.\n\nRecently, high school students also started wearing 'Gwa-jam'. Like universities, they are universally distributed, regardless of their affiliation and singularity / engineering. Starting in 2015, new students started to wear green 'Gwa-jam' at 'Shinil High School', an autonomous private high school in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul. Some students from the student council in 2014 began wearing the red \"Gwa-jam\" with the school name, and all the students had the same 'Gwa-jam' when they responded well. The 'Gwa-jam' culture, which is worn by university students, is spreading to foreign high schools, independent high schools, and international high schools. It is said that it started from the point of raising the pride of school and strengthening the alliance between the alumni, but it is pointed out that it may fall into 'collective superiority' from high school student.\n\n'Gwa-jam' is positively evaluated as a sign of belonging and intimacy. Kim Jae-hwi, a professor of psychology at Chung-Ang University, analyzes that 'Gwa-jam' culture is an expression of identity, solidarity, and pride rather than school pride, and a cheap and convenient fashion item. It can also be related to the desire hierarchy theory of \"Maslow theory\". And that it is the desire to be recognized and belonged to others by wearing 'Gwa-jam' because it is linked to the 'social desire', the third stage of the desire hierarchy theory. In addition, Sungkyunkwan University sociology professor analyzes that it is a natural phenomenon that arises when he is proud of their school.\n\nSince the 2000s, there has been criticism that 'Gwa-jam' promotes culturalism through cultural demonstration and distinction. It is a view that intellectuals who have to act with social consciousness encourage the negative social phenomenon of degreeocracy. In particularly, the prestigious 'Gwa-jam' has a relative deprivation effect on those who do not have a bachelor's degree.\n"}

{"id": "57159893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57159893", "title": "Helen Ladd", "text": "Helen Ladd\n\nHelen F. Ladd is an education economist who currently works as the Susan B. King Professor Emeritus of Public Policy and Economics at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy. In recognition of her research on the economics of education, she has been elected to the National Academy for Education and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHelen Ladd earned a B.A. from Wellesley College in 1967, a master's degree from the London School of Economics in 1968 and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1974, writing a thesis on the relationship between local public expenditures and the composition of the property tax base under Richard Musgrave and Martin Feldstein. After her Ph.D., Ladd worked as Assistant Professor of Economics at Wellesley College (1974–77) and then as Assistant Professor and later Associate Professor of City and Regional Planning at Harvard University (1978–86) before moving to Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy in 1986. There, she has been a Professor of Public Policy and, since 1991, also a Professor of Economics, until her emeritation in 2017. Since 2014, she has been the Susan B. King Professor Emerita of Public Policy and Economics. Additionally, Ladd has held visiting appointments at the University of Wellington, University of Cape Town, University of Amsterdam and at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (London). In addition to her academic positions, she is affiliated with the Brookings Institution, Learning Policy Institute, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Urban Institute, and has repeatedly presided over the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. Moreover, she has co-chaired a National Academy of Sciences Committee on Education Finance from 1996 to 1999. Finally, she performs editorial duties for \"Regional Science and Urban Economics\", \"Journal of Policy Analysis and Management\", and \"Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis\", and has done so in the past for \"Research on Urban Policy\", \"Journal of the American Planning Association\", \"Evaluation Review\", and the \"National Tax Journal\".\n\nHelen Ladd is married to Edward Fiske.\n\nHelen Ladd's research focuses on school finance, school accountability, teacher labour markets, school choice, and early childhood programmes. Therein, she has frequently collaborated with Charles Clotfelter, Jacob Vigdor as well as with her husband and fellow educational researcher Edward Fiske. According to IDEAS/RePEc, she belongs to the top 5% of economists in terms of research output.\n\nEarly in her research career, Ladd has conducted extensive research on local public finance. She finds that commercial property in Boston has a stronger impact on the demand for local education expenditures than industrial property and criticizes the use of total property tax base per pupil as a measure for local fiscal capacity for education. Ladd has also contributed to the debate on how to optimize state aid in the U.S. in order to offset fiscal disparities (low resources or high costs) across communities (with Katharine Bradbury, Mark Perrault, Andrew Reschovsky and John Yinger). Together with Yinger, Ladd has further expanded on the fiscal crisis of U.S. cities in the 1970s and early 1980s in her book \"America's Ailing Cities\", wherein she explores how it affected cities' policies and disparities between them. Researching local tax mimicking between neighbouring U.S. counties, Ladd finds evidence of it with regard to the burdens of total local taxes and property taxes but not of sales taxes. Studying the relationship between public finances and local population growth in the U.S., Ladd finds a U-shaped relationship between spending and density and a positive relationship between local population growth and per capita public spending, with the effect mainly reflecting the higher population density and a larger share of local public spending, suggesting that established residents in fast-growing areas may experience declining quality in public services and/or rising local tax burdens.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Ladd has performed research on the topic of school accountability. In Dallas, she finds performance-based school accountability to increase the outcomes of Hispanic and Caucasian 7th-graders but not Afro-American students, and to decrease drop-out and principal turnover rates. In the late 1990s, Ladd repeatedly criticized the implementation of value-added measures of school effectiveness, arguing based on her observations in e.g. North Carolina that these measures' lack of consideration for differences in schools' resources discouraged effective teachers and principals from working in schools with large shares of disadvantaged students and exacerbate educational inequality (with Randall Walsh and Arnaldo Zelli). In sum, she has argued, along with e.g. Eva Baker or Edward Haertel, that test scores should only be one part of teacher evaluation and not dominate decisions about teachers' compensation or promotion.\n\nLadd and Sheila Murray find no evidence of a direct effect of the share of elderly households on spending on education, though they may do so through their locational decision: as they tend to live in counties with low shares of children, the tax price of education is higher in other counties, which could decrease education spending in those counties. With regard to school vouchers, Ladd has argued that the gains in student achievement from voucher programmes are likely to be small and to harm many disadvantaged students due to parents' tendency to judge schools by the characteristics of their students, with a slightly better case being made for means-tested vouchers. In research with Robert Bifulco on charter schools in N.C., Ladd finds that students make substantially smaller gains in achievement in charter schools than in public schools and that these effects aren't due to positive impacts of charter schools on traditional public schools, though the high rates of student turnover at charter schools appear to account for a third of the difference. Moreover, they find these charter schools to have raised the racial isolation of Afro-American and Caucasian students and widened their test-score gaps, in particular as students (and their families) tend to choose charter schools that are more racially isolated than students' previous schools, resulting in very few racially balanced charter schools. Ladd has also performed research on school choice and school competition outside the U.S., e.g. analyzing the liberalization and decentralization of New Zealand's compulsory state education system during the 1990s, which yielded many cautionary lessons about the potential long-term consequences of market-based education reforms.\n\nTogether with Clotfelter and Vigdor, Ladd has also conducted extensive research on teacher labour markets. In line with Ladd's research on North Carolina's school accountability system, Ladd, Clotfelter, Vigdor and Roger Aliaga Diaz find that this system strongly increased the turnover of high-quality teachers in schools serving low-performing students, though the extent of the decline in teacher quality at such schools remains unclear. Later research by Ladd, Clotfelter, Vigdor and Justin Wheeler confirmed that the school personnel serving students in high-poverty schools in N.C. generally have lower qualifications than those in lower poverty schools.* In further research in N.C., Ladd, Clotfelter and Vigdor find that the way how novice teachers are distributed by school administrators across schools and classrooms disadvantages Afro-American students and that the generally positive returns to teacher experience in students' math and reading achievement are much larger with regard to math for socioeconomically advantaged students, possibly explaining why the most highly qualified teachers often teach the most advantaged students. However, they (with Elizabeth Glennie) also find that offering higher salaries to teachers in high-poverty schools in N.C. was successful in substantially reducing these schools' teacher turnover rates, with experienced teachers displaying the strongest response. They find that gaps between Caucasian and Afro-American student achievements are large and persistent, Hispanic and Asian students tend to gain on Caucasians over their schooling, with the racial gaps in math typically widening over time for high-performing students and closing for low-performing students. Moreover, they also find that teacher credentials (e.g. licensure or certification systematically and substantially affect student achievement and that the unequal distribution of teacher credentials by race and socioeconomic status of high school students exacerbates gaps between demographic groups' educational achievement. Finally, Ladd also observes that teachers' perceptions of their working conditions are good predictors of their transitions to other schools, with school leadership as the most salient dimension of working conditions.\n\nWith regard to the economics of education, Ladd has contributed substantially to research on the relationship between poverty and education: Together with Jens Ludwig and Greg Duncan, Ladd evaluates the impact of the Moving to Opportunity programme of residential mobility, wherein volunteering low-income families were randomly assigned to either receive rental subsidies for housing in low-poverty areas as well as counseling and housing search assistance, to only receive unrestricted rental subsidies or to a control group, finding that assignment to the first group considerably raised elementary school children's performance in reading and math, though there is also some evidence that teens in both experimental groups experience increases in grade retentions, drop-out rates and disciplinary actions at school due to differences between the academic and behavioural standards between their new and old schools. Moreover, in further research on the relationship between education and poverty, Ladd has strongly criticized Bush- and Obama-era efforts to improve the U.S. education system for their ignorance of the growing performance gap between the achievement of students from advantaged and disadvantaged families and their lack of focus on the educational challenges of disadvantaged students. Another area of research concerns the impact of technology on education, wherein Ladd, Vigdor and Erika Martinez confirm earlier findings of large gaps between different racial and socioeconomic groups' access and use of home computers and observe that the introduction of home computer technology and high-speed Internet access in households tends to modestly decrease students' math and reading test scores. Furthermore, in another study outside the U.S., Ladd and Fiske have evaluated the post-Apartheid education reform in South Africa, concluding that while genuine equal treatment of races was at hand, equality in terms of educational opportunity or adequacy remained elusive. Finally, in a much-cited study, Ladd finds strong evidence for discrimination in mortgage lending, most of which she attributes to profit-driven statistical discrimination, notably reflecting the fact that minority borrowers often display characteristics associated with lower creditworthiness.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14476158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14476158", "title": "Higher education in Poland", "text": "Higher education in Poland\n\nHigher education in Poland started in the Middle Ages. In 1364 the first Polish university (later called Jagiellonian) was created in Cracow. In 1826 the first technical university was established in Warsaw, leading eventually to the establishment of Warsaw University of Technology, the largest technical university in Poland.\nFrom 1919-1939 universities were focused primarily on arts, science, and engineering. Education was based solely on Humboldt's model of university combining research and teaching. This model incorporates a strict hierarchy of authority and a considerable degree of autonomy for its governing bodies.\n\nMany higher education institutions were established after World War II. At the end of communism (1989), there were 820 institutions in Poland, about 20 of them being engineering oriented. In the 1990s a two-tier system was reinstituted. The first tier was considered to be vocational rather than academic. The two-tier system was instituted in Poland well before it was suggested by the Bologna declaration.\n\nAfter 1989 higher education in Poland changed dramatically. Borders were opened, leading to free mobility and autonomy of universities in curricula and management. New laws concerning higher education, convertible Polish currency, easy communication, (telephone and Internet), and access to European education and research programs made higher education more accessible.\n\nIn 2001 there were 1,224,600 students enrolled in the publicly funded universities and colleges. In the private universities and colleges there were 519,100 students. This number has quadrupled over previous enrollment figures. This rise in the rate of enrollment in higher education strongly influences the qualification level of the youngest age group making up the workforce.\n\nConsidering that an individual's active life lasts about forty years, more time is needed to raise the level of adult education. In a 1995 census, 6.8% of the Polish population held a higher education degree. In 2008, this percentage was 17,4.\n\nThe impact of the Bologna declaration on education in Poland made the diploma supplement mandatory for all diplomas in Poland. Polish universities then pushed for the European Credit Transfer System which was a quality assessment and accreditation program. There had been no official national system of credit transfer and accumulation in Poland previously. Therefore; a credit-point system was introduced for particular specialization.\n\nThe promotion of mobility had the goal to reach 10 percent. The obstacle in student mobility are differences in the organization of the academic year in European countries. The number of students coming to Poland is about 10 times lower than other countries and the need for other European languages was evident. Warsaw had 300 students in English and at the Technical University of Lodz there were 500 students in\nEnglish and French.\n\nThe European co-operation in quality assurance, Poland is trying to solve the problem of quality and accreditation in a highly professional way. The process of accreditation of study programs at Polish higher education institutions has been significantly accelerated. There are two forms of accreditiation, a state-controlled and academic community-owned one. For Poland, belonging to the European family is very important they do not want to be disseminated in Poland. For them, lifelong learning and promoting the European higher education area is their primary concern, they also believe that the European higher education area is best promoted by following the Bologna Declaration priorities and does not need any further comments.\n\nThird Republic of Poland concentrated on the opening of new universities in the major cities. Poland started setting up vocational and pedagogical schools and university branch campuses. Private universities and colleges became more easily accessible to young people from the country and from working-class families than were the public higher educational institutions. The location is one of the most important criteria in choosing a university this is due to costs for travel and room and board often exceed the costs of tuition at a private university located close to a student's place of residence.\n\nEducation in Poland is one of the few sectors that was not restructured after the ending of the communist era. The systems in use for managing public universities and colleges vary substantially from those used in the private sector. The costs of instruction in public universities and colleges are higher than those in private institutions. The globalization of public life and the perspective of Polish membership in the European Union are pushing Polish graduates to choose to work abroad. It is inevitable that children from poor families and from small villages have practically no possibilities to enter admission competition and to take entrance examinations. Private higher education institutions, located close to the homes of such candidates, are more easily accessible to them.\n\nPoland has been at the forefront of the development of the private higher education sector. Private educational institutions provide education to students for a fee; not for profit and usually invest their financial surplus in the development of themselves and their facilities.\n\nPrivate higher education institutions are devoid of the burden of collective management. Their decisions are made by the rector or presidents. The senate and the faculty council are entirely advisory bodies which confer the academic degrees. Private institutions can respond rapidly to the changing needs of educational demand and labour market needs.\n\nThe majority of private higher educational institutions offer 3 year courses of study for a bachelor's degree. Only about twelve institutions offer a 5-year course of study which leads to a master's degree and only one has obtained the right to confer the doctorate degree. There are now 12 private institutions that occupy top positions relating to the standards of tertiary education which are published every year by many\ninstitutions.\n\nPrivate higher education institutions are decidedly more expensive for students than are the public. Private institutions are more flexible and definitely offer higher quality services than do their public counterparts . The public institutions are taking note and are taking measures to reduce these proportions. Nearly 100% of private institutions are funded from tuition fees and not from the state budget. They are dependent on their markets.\n\nThe effects of globalization and education are enormous. Education used to be regarded as a non-tradable service however; private provision of education is huge business in many nations. The technological developments like the Internet and cheaper telecommunications combined with increased acceptance on non-traditional educational settings (remote learning) may well broaden the scope of international trade in education services in the coming years and at this point has created the potential for fast growth.\n\nGlobalization has heightened the demand for education, which has also increased many private higher education institutions however; globalization may also lead to an erosion of national regulatory frameworks for education. In a globalized environment where businesses and workers find themselves operating more often in foreign environments, the national character of educational frameworks will potentially cause problems.\n\nBy 2010 Poland is hoping that the number of people enrolled in higher education should rise 35-40% and 40-45% in 2020. These increases will raise new challenges for higher education in regards to its accessibility, particularly for the inhabitants of villages and small towns. Ideally Poland wants to decrease the differences in the level of civilization between the country regions and the various social groups. With the spreading effects of the metropolises, the situating of universities and colleges in the medium-sized cities offers a chance to establish education centers of high quality and the possibility of creating innovative processes. The large well-equipped private higher education institutions with increasingly stable staffs are expected to prosper.\n\nThe ultimate goal for private institutions is to have official recognition of university status. The majority of institutions educating such specialists will be forced to diversify their offerings, which are bound to increase their costs. Higher education in Poland is trailing many European countries. They need to adapt to the changing labour market which will generate a larger demand for postgraduate, supplementary and retraining studies. By doing this it will increase the role of higher education in the fostering of regional development; the creation of regional innovation networks and a cultural atmosphere.\n\nIt is not easy to maintain the national traditions, habits and historical experience and at the same time fulfill common European priorities. The private higher education institutions are not as well treated as public institutions. Only the large national universities can guarantee high-quality education, while private schools require special supervision.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36167150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36167150", "title": "Institute for Management Information Systems", "text": "Institute for Management Information Systems\n\nThe Institute for Management Information Systems is a research institution of the Department of Information Systems and Operations, at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU). The WU is the largest university having a business and economics focus in Europe. The master's program \"Information Systems\" provided by the department is ranked 4th by \"The Eduniversal Best Masters Ranking\" in Western Europe.\n\nThe institute was founded by Univ.Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Hans Robert Hansen in 1978 who chaired it for over 30 years. In early days, the development of industry oriented reference models for electronic commerce was the research and teaching emphasis. In 2009, Univ. Prof. Dr. Sarah Spiekermann has taken over the chair of the institute. Up to the present, the research focus is on ethical computing, privacy issues in the information society, as well as context-aware systems and ubiquitous computing.\n\nThe research mission of the institute is to design and investigate technologies that enhance social compatibility and long-term market success. The social compatibility of IT systems references the ability of IT systems to support basic human values and rights. These values and rights include privacy, security, autonomy, system control and calmness. Together with industry partners and international political institutions, the institute develops technical policies and procedures to ensure that designers consider these rights and values when they develop systems. The institute's conceptual and technical work is informed and supported by the analysis of economic conditions, which are given in the form of international markets for personal information, a trend towards automation, decision delegation as well as Internet economics. Furthermore, social and psychological dimensions of IT usage and acceptance are considered. Taken together, the institute follows a three-dimensional research approach, allowing for and using technical, economic and social methods of analysis. A wide range of methods to contribute to the development of a \"sustainable\" technology landscape is applied. The institute is a think tank for business and society that focuses on the sustainable design of information technology. As a think tank, it contributes its work to international policy-relevant processes.\n\nIn the common body of knowledge, the institute offers two introductory courses to Management Information Systems. First, Business information systems 1 (BIS 1) is dealing with the fundamentals of business informatics. Second, Business information systems 2 (BIS 2) puts an emphasis on modelling business processes with software tools such as ARIS.\n\nThe specialization \"Management Information Systems\" serves the need of second- and third-year students. After an introduction to the basics of every-day computing, data structures of the semantic web and ERP systems (e.g., Microsoft Dynamics) are discussed. In the following, students can specialize in E-Commerce or easily usable business programming tools.\nThe following courses are covered in the specialization.\n\n\nIn the master’s program \"Information Systems\" the institute's goal is the training of IT managers rather than informing the IT - knowledgeable economist. These executives, who will also be responsible for the implementation of new information systems, shall be educated to promote sustainable system development. In the master's common body of knowledge, the institute offers a training in user-centered system design. Building on these foundations, the competence field \"Sustainable IT\" carries the institute's research activities into the classroom. In turn, students in the competence field's core seminars \"Ethical Computing\" and \"Privacy and Security\" give impulses for the research questions raised.\n\nThe institute has contributed 881 publications to the community by June 26, 2012.\n\nProf. Hansen and Prof. Neumann published and regularly updated \"Wirtschaftsinformatik 1\", which is used as a reference book in the German-speaking academic field and has been sold almost 500 000 times.\n\nIT Talk is a debating platform which invites experts and thought leaders to discuss and reflect current IT-related topics.\n\nThe head of the institute, Univ. Prof. Dr. Sarah Spiekermann composes ethical reflections concerning the role of IT and society in the online version of the Austrian newspaper \"Der Standard\".\n\n"}
{"id": "26281562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26281562", "title": "Intergovernmental Bureau for Informatics", "text": "Intergovernmental Bureau for Informatics\n\nThe Intergovernmental Bureau for Informatics (IBI) originated as a transformation of the International Computation Centre (ICC) that was created by UNESCO in 1951 by Resolution 2.24 of the General Conference, implementing the mandate of Resolutions 22(III) of October 3, 1946, 160(VII) of August 10, 1948, 318(XI) of August 14, 1950 and 394(XIII) of the UN's ECOSOC .\n\nThe ICC's objective was to implement a Computation Centre that would serve the international scientific community. This was at a time when it was thought that only a few computation machines would become available and moreover they were very costly. The IBI started its activities in 1961 and it was soon overwhelmed by the speed of technological developments to the point that in 1969 it was about to become defunct due to a lack of content. Given this situation the transformation of the IBI was started. This transformation was directed by its Argentinean General Manager at the time, Professor Fermin A. Bernasconi.\n\nIBI membership peaked in 1985 with 43 member countries, of which three were developed countries, France, Italy and Spain and also its largest contributors. The rest were developing or underdeveloped countries. In 1985, France withdrew its membership from IBI and by the end of 1986 Spain also withdrew. This was the start of a crisis within the IBI which led to the dissolution of this organisation in 1969. The archives of the IBI were deposited at the UNESCO. The member countries of the IBI at the time when it had the most members were the following: \nAlgeria, Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso (formerly the Republic of Upper Volta), Cameroon, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Mexico, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Sao Tomé and Principe, Senegal, Spain, Syria, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Zaire.\n\nIBI-ICC was the only inter-governmental organization whose objective was to assist its member countries, in a permanent way, in the area of Information Technology. Its aim was to help them to better understand the impact of technology on society and to take the best advantage of these opportunities. IBI collaborated and helped its member countries to formulate strategies and policies to develop this area.\n\nWith these objectives, the ICC organized the first International symposium on Economics of Automatic Data Processing in October 1965, held in Amsterdam, (The Netherlands). IBI-ICC organized a second international symposium in 1974, on the Economics of Informatics held in Mainz, (Germany) in September. In October 1972 IBI-ICC organized the first World Conference on Informatics in Government in Florence, (Italy).\n\nFrom 1975 onward IBI-ICC intensified its activities in the area of the development of governmental policies and strategies for informatics. The objectives of IBI-ICC was, therefore, to help member countries to establish policies for the development of Informatics in their societies. In November 1975 it organized an international symposium on \"National Planning for Informatics in Developing Countries\" in Baghdad (Iraq). Some 500 participants from 53 countries attended. \n\nFrom 1976 onward IBI-ICC organized a series of workshops on the study of policies and strategies in informatics that were held in Punta Ala and in Venice, (Italy). These workshops ended with the Strategies and Policies International Conference (SPIN) in Informatics. The SPIN Conference was organized by the IBI-ICC and the UNESCO with the support of the Spanish Government and took place in September 1978 in Torremolinos, (Spain) with the participation of 86 countries, among them the \"big powers\", the USA and the USSR.\n\nOther issues addressed by the IBI-ICC related to trans-border data flows especially of the protection of personal information. To this end the first International Conference on Transborder Data Flows was organized in Rome (Italy) in September 1980 followed by a second held in 1984, also in Rome (Italy). Both conferences saw a large participation from countries and experts.\n\nWithin this context of Policies and Strategies for Informatics, the IBI-ICC also organized regional conferences. In Latin-America it organized the Latin-American Conferences for Information Managers (CALAI) held in Argentina (1970), in Mexico (1972), in Argentina (1979), in Mexico (1980), in Chile (1981), in Brazil (1982), in Uruguay (1983), in Mexico (1984), in Argentina (1985 and 1987). Subsequently these conferences were pt on by other organizations. \n\nIn Africa IBI-ICC organized the first African Conference on Informatics in Abidjan (Ivory Coast) in 1979, followed by a second held in Dakar (Senegal) in 1983. IBI-ICC also sponsored the first SEARCC Conference held in Singapore in 1976.\n\nIBI-ICC was also very interested in the training in informatics. It created several regional centres for training in informatics. The CREI (the Regional Centre for the Teaching of Informatics) was opened in Madrid (Spain) in 1976, in collaboration with the Spanish Government and its activities continued until 1997. The CREALC was set up in the Federal District of Mexico in 1981 and another centre in Dakar (Senegal) in 1983. IBI-ICC also had a large fellowship program for training of students from developing member countries in developed countries. In 1983, IBI-ICC, with the Argentinean government, created a foundation in Argentina for starting what would be later called the ESLAI (Latin-American school for informatics), providing it with initial funding.\n\nWithin Latin America IBI-ICC organized two major events in 1984. in April it participated in the Round Table on \"Informatics: a means of development or dependence for Latin America\" put on by X CALAI-Panel 84 in Viña del mar (Chile). The proceedings were later published by IBI-ICC. In May 1984, in collaboration with the government of President Belisario Betancourt of Colombia, IBI-ICC organized \"Informatics and Soveignty\", strategies for regional integration, held in Cali (Colombia) from the 10th to the 12th and which gave birth to the formation of the Cali Club. The final report was also published by IBI-ICC.\n\nThe IBI also dealt with other areas of informatics and its applications to the industrial sector, for which it created a research centre in Valencia (Spain) together with the Spanish government, the IBIDI.\n\nAdditionally it organized international symposiums to examine the relationship between informatics and the press in the \"Presinfo\" symposium held in Valencia (Spain) in October 1984 and the \"Sisyphus\" symposium also held in Valencia (Spain) in May 1986 which dealt with the change from the Industrial to the Information Society.\n\nThe IBI promoted technical assistance for cooperation with its member countries by sending experts to develop national informatics plans as was done in Chile in 1976 or Iraq in 1977 and for the drafting of contracts for the public procurement of equipment and computer services as in Iraq and Tunisia.\n\nIn the mid 70s the IBI encouraged the development of Informatics Laws, publishing many studies on the relationship between law and informatics in various sectors of the society. Moreovover it participated in and collaborated on conferences on this subject.\n\nIn the early 80s the IBI-ICC collaborated on efforts to standardize the use of the Arabic language in informatics. In order to achieve this it organized and financed a committee, the COARIN, for the adaptation of Arabic written characters to the ASCII code which, at that time, proved very difficult.\n\nAmong the publications put out by the IBI is the AGORA magazine published between 1981 and 1986 with 15 editions dedicated to subjects on informatics in a changing world.\n\nThe IBI was the only international body to disappear from the League of Nations, raising a serious concerns. A UNESCO document stated that, before the departure of France and Spain from IBI, the budget of the agency had dwindled to half. The other major contribution came from Italy and therefore, officially, this was the cause of the dissolution.\n\nFormer officials, however, allude to other reasons. Some say it was as a result of a crackdown by corporations, mostly American and the U.S. government itself, who would have put pressure on the governments of Spain and Italy as a result of the fall in equipment sales to developing countries and because of the projects in Nicaragua and Cuba for which the U.S. government threatened commercial reprisals in Brazil between 1986-1988.\n"}

Teams are selected on a country-by-country basis, with each country sending its top two teams to the competition. The IMMC was inspired by the HiMCM, a similar contest sponsored by COMAP but mainly attracting teams within the United States. The HiMCM in turn was established in the 1990s to create a high school counterpart to COMAP’s MCM. Contestants in the IMMC are given five days to research (the contest permits the use of any inanimate source) and write a mathematical paper detailing their mathematical model for a given situation. At the conclusion of the five-day period, papers are sent to an international expert committee composed of mathematics faculty from the world’s leading universities. Traditionally, 3-4 teams are awarded the top designation of Outstanding and invited to an awards ceremony, held in a different country each year.\n\nEach participating country is expected to choose its two best teams of four contestants each to compete in the IMMC. Globally, different methods have been used to select teams from their respective countries.\n\nHong Kong holds the contest early and allows any interested team to participate. A national judging panel selects the two best papers to move on to the international round of the competition. In 2015, 60 papers came out of the Greater China region alone.\n\nIn 2015, the United States used a different qualification process, inviting the top two teams from the 2014 HiMCM to compete in the IMMC. In 2016, the United States adopted a hybrid of Hong Kong’s approach and its own former approach: any team receiving a score of Meritorious or higher in the 2015 HiMCM (roughly 25% of competing teams) was invited to compete in the 2016 IMMC. As in Hong Kong, the United States held the IMMC early, completed a national round of judging, and selected the two best papers to move on to the international round.\n\nMost countries use a selection process similar to that used by Hong Kong, and countries entering the IMMC for the first time will also likely adopt a similar process.\n\nPapers passing the national selection round move on to the international expert judging panel. In 2015, the Expert Panel included:\n\n\n17 teams from the following countries competed in the 2015 IMMC:\n\n\nOf these teams, four were awarded the top designation of International Outstanding and invited to the awards ceremony in Hong Kong:\n\nPalo Alto High School, Palo Alto, CA, USA\n\nThe Affiliated High School of Peking University, Beijing, China\n\nRaffles Girls' School (Secondary), Singapore\n\nShanghai Nanyang Model School, Shanghai, China\n\nSeven were awarded the Meritorious designation:\n\n\nFour were awarded the Honorable Mention designation:\n\n\nTwo were awarded the Successful Participant designation:\n\n\n40 teams from the following 23 countries competed in the 2016 IMMC:\n\nOf these teams, three were awarded the top designation of International Outstanding and invited to the awards ceremony at the International Congress on Mathematics Education in Hamburg, Germany:\n\nPalo Alto High School, Palo Alto, CA, USA\n\nDiocesan Girls' School, Kowloon, Hong Kong (SAR)\n\nPui Ching Middle School, Kowloon, Hong Kong (SAR)\n\nFourteen were awarded the Meritorious designation:\n\nNine were awarded the Honorable Mention designation:\n\nFourteen were awarded the Successful Participant designation:\n\nThe 2015 IMMC winning teams from the USA, Singapore, and China were brought to Hong Kong for the IMMC Award Presentation Ceremony on 5 July 2015 at Hong Kong University, sponsored by Guangdong Qtone Education Co., Knowledge Magazine, Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, Competition on System Modeling & Optimization (COSMO), CUHK, HKACE, and the Hong Kong Entrepreneurs and Executives Club.\n\nSpecial guests included Hong Kong political leader the Honorable Mrs. Fanny Law and movie directors Mr Tsui Siu-Ming and Mr Tang Yat-Ming. Professor Frederick Leung, Chairman of the Board of Faculty, Faculty of Education, University of Hong Kong, gave the opening speech. Law encouraged educators in Hong Kong and elsewhere to continue to pursue the type of educational innovation promoted by the IMMC. Given that the 2015 problem revolved around mathematically modeling a movie filming production schedule, directors Tsui and Tang discussed their own experiences in the movie industry and how applicable teams’ models were to real-world movie filming decisionmaking.\n\nThe 2016 IMMC winning teams from the USA and Hong Kong, in addition to the Meritorious German team, were brought to Hamburg, Germany for the IMMC Award Ceremony on 26 July 2016 at the University of Hamburg as part of the quadrennial International Congress on Mathematical Education. Dr. Sol Garfunkel described how the contest has evolved and discussed plans for the future.\n\nThe IMMC has received broad press coverage throughout the world, with the majority of coverage concentrated in the U.S. and Greater China.

This bill, along with Land Reforms Ordinance and other agricultural legislation, imparted drastic changes in Kerala society, and paved the way for the natural death of feudalistic society in Kerala.\n\nThe Education Bill sought to regulate appointments and conditions of teachers. Salaries of teachers were to be paid through the treasury. There was a provision of takeover of management of educational institutions, which arguably violated the constitution. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal and the bill received the assent of the president of India.\n\nEven though the Education Bill failed to pass through the Assembly, many of its provisions were later implemented by subsequent governments with amendments.\n"}

Panormo, Schroeder of Petersburg, Alonso of Madrid, Pages and Benitez of Cadiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga, Rada, and Lacôte of Paris), but it is not only about instrumental technique, but also includes details about the theory of scales, harmony, sonority, composition, and above all music as an art.\n\nThe first edition was in French and appeared in Paris in 1830 with the title of \"\". Brian Jeffery (the modern publisher of A. Merrick's old English translation) mentions: \"It is the only version known to have Sor's direct authority. Now extremely rare, it was never reprinted; indeed, an early biographer of Sor (Baltasar Saldoni in his \"Diccionario de Efemérides de Músicos Españoles\", I, Madrid, 1868) says (he does not state on what authority) that Sor destroyed the plates.\" During the same period Simrock in Bonn had brought out a parallel French and German edition.\n\nThe English edition is a translation from the original in French made by A. Merrick, the organist of Cirencester, and published in London by Cocks & Co. probably in 1832, as \"Method for the Spanish Guitar\". The French and German versions do not carry the word \"Spanish\" in the title. This version is today available from Brian Jeffery's.\n\nBrian Jeffery mentions: \"Later in the century, in 1897, Frank Mott Harrison published in London a \"Method for the Guitar\" by Ferdinando Sor, a work of small value which says (of course wrongly) that the original was written in Spanish.\"\n\nAfter Sor's death, Napoléon Coste, one of his pupils, published a revision of the original called \"\". Matanya Ophee states that in Coste's revised and augmented version, there is an introduction which is helpful in better understanding Sor, and some of the circumstances under which Sor wrote the original method.\n\nBrian Jeffery controversially regards Coste's version somewhat negatively (\"travesty of the original ... bears little resemblance to the original\"), even though the title immediately makes it clear, that it is not the original, but was adapted and augmented by Coste (augmented incidentally, with numerous pieces of high quality). Today Coste's version is highly regarded in its own right (the title mentioning of Sor, possibly being more a sign of respect, than what Jeffery has termed \"a disservice to his friend's memory\"). Ophee has written: \"He [Coste] is certainly not hostile to Sor and to his memory\".\n\nIn the method (in plate VII, example 27), Sor quotes bars 22 to 25 of Sonata Op. 35, No. 1 by Jan Ladislav Dussek; mentioning \"that the celebrated Düssek had the texture of the orchestra in view when he wrote for the pianoforte the passage in example twenty-seventh, plate VII.\"\n\n"}

Although Japan's reverence for its unique history and art is well documented and illustrated by collections of art and documents, there is almost no archivist tradition. Before the creation of the National Archives, there was a scarcity of available public documents which preserve \"grey-area\" records, such as internal sources to show a process which informs the formation of a specific policy or the proceedings of various committee meetings.\n\nIn accordance with the National Archives Law No.79 (1999), the core function of preserving \"government documents and records of importance as historical materials\" includes all material relating to (1) decision-making on important items of national policies, and (2) processes of deliberation, discussion, or consultation prior to reaching any decision-making, and the process of enforcing policies based on decisions made. The transfer of what are deemed historically important materials from the various ministries and agencies is carried out on a regular basis in accordance with the Transfer Plan prepared and revised by the Prime Minister for each fiscal year. Preservation, restoration cataloging, microfilming and digitization are all important aspects of the archive's responsibilities. However, the National Archives is in the process of becoming something more than simply a historical repository, because it is also a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies which are situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.\n\nSince the Meiji Period (1868–1912), administrative documents had been preserved respectively by each government ministry. A library for the cabinet of the early Meiji government was established in 1873; and in 1885, this became the Cabinet Library (\"Naikaku Bunko\"), which evolved as the nation's leading specialized library of ancient Japanese and Chinese classical books and materials. The Cabinet Library's collection included government records of the Edo period and the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867) and other material. These collections are an important element of the archive's core holdings.\n\nIn November 1959, the President of the Science Council of Japan issued a recommendation establishing a National Archives to prevent scattering and loss of official documents and to facilitate public access. In July 1971, the newly created Archives began receiving, assessing, and cataloging government documents and records of importance as historical materials; and also, the Archives focused on the conceptually distinct program designed to encourage wider interest by mounting exhibitions and fostering research.\n\nIn July 1998, the Tsukuba Annex (\"Tsukuba Gakuen Toshiwas\") was established in Ibaraki Prefecture in order to expand and improve the storage of archival materials.\n\nA Cabinet resolution in 1999 led to the creation of the , which opened in November 2001. The center digitizes data from various national institutions, such as the National Archives, Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Military Archives of the National Institute for Defense Studies of the Japan Defense Agency, and provides the digital data through the Internet.\n\nThe National Archives became an Independent Administrative Institution on April 1, 2001, when an Act amending part of the National Archives Law came into effect. Archival responsibilities include managing public access to stored records, and overseeing the collection as it grows and develops and preservation protocols.\n\nThe enhanced independence of the archives was designed to help further its institutional focus on measures for the proper conservation of historical materials.\n\nThe National Archives website provides information about the archives and catalog data which allow the holdings to be searched online. The site offers English and Japanese versions, the holdings themselves are, of course, mainly in Japanese. The website facilitates access to brief descriptions and some images of documents, books, and cultural properties. The Digital Gallery may be searched using keywords or various categories, opening access to digitised images of scrolls; maps; photographs; drawings; posters; and documents. English summaries of publications from the National Archives (journal and annual report) are available for downloading from the site.\n\nFrom April 2005, the digital archive system in this website has provided high-resolution pictures of a range of holdings, including the materials designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan. The collections in the National Archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and the state; and the archives are integral in a process of defining memory institutionally within Japan's prevailing political systems and cultural norms.\n\nThe National Archives has evolved as a model for developing prefectural and municipal archival collections—some of which predate the establishment of the national institution. In these smaller institutions, similar activities of preservation, restoration, cataloging, microfilming and digitization are evolving. For example, the Digital Gallery includes digitized photos of the stack room for official documents in Shiga Prefecture in 1924. These images were appended to a report submitted by the prefectural governor to the chief of the cabinet secretariat in November of that year. Shiga's governor was describing the progress of work intended to modernize standards and procedures for compiling and storing of written records, which was expected to produce improved efficiencies in administrative services.\n\n\n\n"}

An intensive, sequential phonics-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn—visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.\n\nSamuel Torrey Orton (1879–1948), a neuropsychiatrist and pathologist at Columbia University, brought together neuroscientific information and principles of remediation. As early as the 1920s, he had extensively studied children with the kind of language processing difficulties now commonly associated with dyslexia and had formulated a set of teaching principles and practices for such children.\n\nAnna Gillingham (1878–1963) was an educator and psychologist at Teachers College, Columbia University. Working with Dr. Orton, she trained teachers and compiled and published instructional materials. Gillingham combined Orton’s teaching methods with her analysis of the structure of the English/American language and with Bessie Stillman, she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual: Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. First published in 1935/6, this work is updated and republished regularly.\n\nLanguage-based: The Orton-Gillingham approach is based on a technique of studying and teaching language, understanding the nature of human language, the mechanisms involved in learning, and the language-learning processes in individuals.\n\nMultisensory: Orton-Gillingham teaching sessions are action-oriented and involve constant interaction between the teacher and the student and the simultaneous use of multiple sensory input channels reinforcing each other for optimal learning. Using auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements, all language skills taught are reinforced by having the student listen, speak, read and write. For example, a dyslexic learner is taught to see the letter A, say its name and sound and write it in the air – all at the same time. The approach requires intense instruction with ample practice.\nThe use of multiple input channels is thought to enhance memory storage and retrieval by providing multiple \"triggers\" for memory.\n\nStructured, Sequential, and Cumulative: The Orton-Gillingham teacher introduces the elements of the language systematically. Sound-symbol associations along with linguistic rules and generalizations are introduced in a linguistically logical, understandable order. Students begin by reading and writing sounds in isolation. Then they blend the sounds into syllables and words. Students learn the elements of language—consonants, vowels, digraphs, blends, and diphthongs—in an orderly fashion. They then proceed to advanced structural elements such as syllable types, roots, and affixes. As students learn new material, they continue to review old material to the level of automaticity. The teacher addresses vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension in a similar structured, sequential, and cumulative manner.\n\nCognitive: Students learn about the history of the English language and study the many generalizations and rules that govern its structure. They also learn how best they can learn and apply the language knowledge necessary for achieving reading and writing competencies.\n\nFlexible: Orton-Gillingham teaching is diagnostic and prescriptive in nature. Teachers try to ensure the learner is not simply recognising a pattern and applying it without understanding. When confusion of a previously taught rule is discovered, it is re-taught from the beginning.\n\nIn 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, \"Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction.\" The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.\n\nThe Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton-Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques.\n\nAn overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from classroom use of OG methods with first graders, and use in special education or resource room settings with older children with learning disabilities.\n\nIn July 2010, a US Department of Education agency reported that it could not find any studies meeting its evidence standards to support the efficacy of Orton-Gillingham based strategies.\n\nOne study found it was effective for students who were English Language Learners.\n\nResearch has indicated the system is effective in remediating instruction for students with dyslexia, although further research mentions that its efficacy is yet to be determined.\n\nFrom the Spring 2007 Academy News, the publication of the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators, the following is a list of AOGPE accredited schools:\n\n"}

Smithells was most notable for research into neural tube defects, congenital abnormality registers, genetic counselling, and rubella in pregnancy and for later suggesting direct examination of the foetus by photography using ultrasonography.\n\nSmithells great uncle and grandfather had been professors of chemistry at the University of Leeds and his father was a Leeds graduate, so Smithells family always had a strong connection to the university. Smithells took his early education at Rugby School and later studied medicine at St. Thomas' Hospital Medical School. This was followed by 2 years of national service with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Germany in 1949-1951.\n\nIn 1948 he married Joy Muriel Foster née Beaver, who died 4th February 2010. They had five children and eleven grand-children.\n\nSmithells died on 13 June 2002 from prostate cancer.\n\nAfter two years as a senior registrar at Guy’s Hospital, in 1959, Smithells became a lecturer at the University of Liverpool and became consultant paediatrician and medical superintendent for Alder Hey Children's Hospital in 1964. In 1968 he took up the chair of Paediatrics and Child Health at Leeds University, and worked in all the hospitals in Leeds. By 1962, Smithells had established congenital abnormality register and genetic counselling service at the University of Liverpool.\n\nSmithells retired from the chair of Paediatrics and Child Health in 1988. After his retirement, he continued to work. From 1989 to 1997 Smithells was appointed a medical consultant in vaccine damage tribunals that were established in 1979 to provide payments to children seen to be damaged by a vaccine. Further appointments included a position as a consultant on the European Registration of Congenital Abnormalities and Twins registry. From 1994 to 1996 he also employed as part-time Director of the International Centre for Birth Defects in Rome, Italy.\n\nDick Smithells work during his long career was the prevention of disease in children. Early in his career, Smithells recognized the effects of poor nutrition in pregnant women and how it led to birth defects with studies taking many years. Indeed his most notable research in his career, was the establishing link between folic acid deficiency and neural tube defects. It wasn't until 1991 that the Medical Research Council ratified his decision by recommending that pregnant women's diets should contain sufficient folic acid.\n\nMany of Smithells early papers were about the effects of Thalidomide on the foetus, and he developed a special unit to support children damaged by thalidomide, and was later heavily involved in securing compensation for children disabled by the \nthalidomide drug, and taking a position in the Thalidomide Trust to facilitate that role.\n\nThese are Smithells most important papers:\n\nSmithells wrote the following books that described diagnostic methods before the rise of ultrasound scans. \n\n\nIn 1985, Smithells was awarded the Harding award in 1985 from Action Research for the Crippled Child In 1992, Smithells was awarded the prestigious James Spence Gold Medal in 1992, by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The Rank Prize for Nutrition followed and was awarded jointly in 1995. In 1998 he won the Dawson Williams Memorial Prize of the British Medical Association. During 2000, Smithells won the International Research Award of the Joseph P Kennedy Foundation for research into the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects.\n"}

Having worked in different areas, she was refitted in 1992 to 1993 as a brig (two-masted square-rigged sailing ship) and now serves as a sail training ship. During summer, she usually operates in the Baltic Sea, and usually embarks for journeys to farther destinations for winter, including several trans-Atlantic crossings.\n\n\"Roald Amundsen\" has a length overall of , a length of hull of and a waterline length of . The vessel has a beam of and a maximum draft of . \"Roald\"s masts reach a height of and are rigged with 18 sails with a total area of .

The vessel is equipped with two generators, one of , the other of . The ship can carry 180 tons of ballast. \"Roald Amundsen\" has crew of 17 with up to 31 trainees embarked.\n\nThe hull of the ship was built at the shipyard \"Roßlauer Werft\" on the Elbe River in Roßlau, German Democratic Republic, in 1952. Originally intended for fishing as a deep sea fishing lugger, plans were changed before the completion of the ship, and she was then instead built as a type of tanker. The vessel was completed at the shipyard \"Peene-Werft\" in Wolgast, Germany, on the Baltic Sea.\n\nNamed \"Vilm\", the ship was put to use for the National People's Army (NVA), first as a tanker and supply vessel, operating out of Peenemünde and crewed mainly by civilian seamen. Converted to a transporter for bilge water in the 1970s on the Peene-Werft, \"Vilm\" then made regular trips to the bases of the National People's Army to take the ships' bilge water to a centralized treatment facility. This service was discontinued at the end of 1988.\n\nAfter not having been used for a year, \"Vilm\" was towed to Neustadt in Holstein and there at the navy base used as living quarters. At the beginning of 1991, the ship was put up for sale by the Vebeg GmbH, a corporation to sell federal property.\n\nDetlev Löll and Hanns Temme purchased the ship at an auction and, with the help of some of the former crew, sailed the ship to Wolgast in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In spring 1992, a complete overhaul began, in the course of which the ship received a new exterior keel and was refitted as a brig; the rig includes five square sails at each mast and includes lifting yards for the upper-three yards (upper main topsail, topgallant and royal) at each mast, lowering the center of gravity of the ship when sails are furled. The overhaul was subsidized by the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Bundesagentur für Arbeit and formed part of the job creation program \"Fridtjof Nansen\" (led by the owner), which comprised the refitting of this ship as well as other sailing ships and .\n\nIn 1993, the ship was put to its new use under the name of \"Roald Amundsen\". It was chartered by the newly founded sail training club \"LebenLernen auf Segelschiffen e.V.\" (short: LLaS; German: learning to live on sailing ships). After a short intermezzo with another sail-training club, \"Segelschiff Fritjof Nansen e.V.\", in 1993, \"Roald Amundsen\" has since been chartered by the LLaS and used for sail training.\n\n\"Roald Amundsen\" now operates all year around as a sail training vessel with voyages lasting between one and three weeks. Her home port is Eckernförde, a harbour city in Schleswig-Holstein near Kiel in northern Germany. Summer months are spent with voyages on the Baltic Sea from Denmark to Baltic countries or the North Sea. Winters are spent in warmer regions. \"Roald Amundsen\" has repeatedly crossed the Atlantic Ocean, bound for South American ports in Brazil and French Guiana (1998), for tall ships events in North America (2000, 2010), and for the Caribbean (2001, 2011/12, 2012/13). Further destinations include Iceland (1995), England and Ireland (2006), the Mediterranean (2006/07, 2007/08), the Canary Islands (1995), and others. During her North American voyage in 2010, \"Roald Amundsen\" visited the Great Lakes and there met with the US brig ; the two brigs formed an unofficial friendship, and as of 2013, \"Roald Amundsen\" still flies a flag of \"Niagara\" at some occasions such as the Tall Ship Parade at Kiel Week. Another friendship, based on their respective crews on board for Kiel Week, has been formed with the German wooden schooner \"Amphitrite\"; both ships have established a tradition of berthing next to each other during the event.\n\nThe ship has participated in the Tall Ships' Races and is rated as a Class A tall ship by Sail Training International.\n\n"}
{"id": "18138370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18138370", "title": "Safe space", "text": "Safe space\n\nThe term safe space refers to places created for individuals who feel marginalized to come together to communicate regarding their experiences with marginalization, most commonly located on university campuses in the western world, but also at workplaces, as in the case of Nokia.\n\nThe terms safe space (or safe-space), safer space, and positive space may also indicate that a teacher, educational institution or student body does not tolerate violence, harassment or hate speech, thereby creating a safe place for all students.\n\nThe Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) which claims to represent 200,000 Muslims in Victoria stated that the Muslim community suffered mental health and other problems due to the suspicions to which it is subjected. \n\nThe ICV proposed that Islamic community groups be given funds to create \"safe spaces\" where \"inflammatory\" issues could be discussed without being judged. Government rejected the proposal and instigated a review of government funding towards the ICV.\n\nPositive Space initiatives have been prevalent in post-secondary institutions across Canada including the University of Western Ontario, McGill University, the University of Toronto, Algonquin College, the University of British Columbia, and Queen's University.\n\nIn early 2015 the increasing adoption of safe spaces in UK universities aroused controversy due to accusations that they were used to stifle free speech and differing political views.\n\nIn April 2016, a member of the Edinburgh University Students' Association was subject to a vote on whether to be expelled from a meeting within a safe-space for violating rules about making gestures of disagreement; the vote went in her favour. She had waved her arms in disgust with a claim made against her by another speaker.\n\nIn September 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May hit out at universities for implementing \"safe space\" policies amid concerns that self-censorship is curtailing freedom of speech on campuses. The Prime Minister said it was \"quite extraordinary\" for universities to ban the discussion of certain topics which could cause offence. She warned that stifling free speech could have a negative impact on Britain's economic and social success.\n\nIn the United States the concept originated in the women's movement, where it \"implies a certain license to speak and act freely, form collective strength, and generate strategies for resistance...a means rather than an end and not only a physical space but also a space created by the coming together of women searching for community.\" The first safe spaces were gay bars and consciousness raising groups.\n\nIn 1989 Gay & Lesbian Urban Explorers (GLUE) developed a safe spaces program. During their events including diversity-training sessions and antihomophobia workshops, they passed out magnets with an inverted pink triangle, \"ACT UP's...symbol\", surrounded by a green circle to, \"symbolize universal acceptance,\" and asked, \"allies to display the magnets to show support for gay rights and to designate their work spaces free from homophobia.\"\n\nAdvocates for Youth states on their website that a safe-space is \"A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or challenged on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect, dignity and feelings and strongly encourage everyone to respect others.\" However, some people consider safe space culture as a violation of the First Amendment and a mechanism for retreating from opinions which contrast with one's own.\n\nIn general, these may be individuals or institutions which support a safe space for LGBT students and employees. They may offer or mandate staff training on diversity, include being a safe space in the organization's mission statement, develop and post a value statement in the organization's office, online, or on printed documents, or, if part of a coalition, encourage the coalition to include being a safe space in its mission and values.\n\nThe idea of safe spaces has been criticized on the grounds that it stifles freedom of speech.\n\nWriting for \"The New York Times\" in 2015, journalist Judith Shulevitz distinguished between meetings where participants mutually consent to provide a safe space, and attempts to make entire dormitories or student newspapers safe spaces. \n\nAccording to Shulevitz, the latter is a logical consequence of the former: \"Once you designate some spaces as safe, you imply that the rest are unsafe. It follows that they should be made safer.\" She gave the example of a safe space at Brown University, when libertarian Wendy McElroy, who was known for criticizing the term \"rape culture\" was invited to give a speech: \"The safe space ... was intended to give people who might find comments 'troubling' or 'triggering,' a place to recuperate. The room was equipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma.\"\n\nIn 2015, journalist Conor Friedersdorf criticized the use of outdoor safe spaces to block press coverage of student protests. According to Friedersdorf, such uses reverse the intent of safe spaces: \"This behavior is a kind of safe-baiting: using intimidation or initiating physical aggression to violate someone's rights, then acting like your target is making you unsafe.\"\n\nIn 2016, British actor and writer Stephen Fry criticized safe spaces and trigger warnings as infantilizing students and possibly eroding free speech. Frank Furedi of the \"Los Angeles Times\" and Candace Russell of \"HuffPost\" have similarly stated that safe spaces contribute to echo chambers surrounded by like minded people, insulating those inside said chambers from hostile or negative speech.\n\nOther known speakers who have criticized the concept of safe spaces include Christina Hoff Sommers and Steven Crowder.\n\n\"The Atlantic\" reported in 2016 that safe spaces were considered by some to be re-segregation.\n\n\"Safe Space\", a 2015 episode of the animated comedy series \"South Park\", parodied the concept of safe-spaces.\n\nThe country duo of Chad Prather and Steve \"Mudflap\" McGrew turned the 1990 Garth Brooks song \"Friends in Low Places\" into \"Friends in Safe Spaces\", which parodied the practice.\n\n\n"}

The summer training is followed by a winter program where youth work through higher levels of training syllabus to become accredited members of the crew the following year.\n\n\"Playfair\" was constructed for Toronto Brigantine Inc. in 1973 as an addition to an already established sail training organization which began operation with the STV Pathfinder in 1962.\n\nDuring the Royal Visit to Canada in 1973, Queen Elizabeth II christened \"Playfair\" at her launching in Kingston on Wednesday, June 27 with \"Pathfinder\" docked just astern; Prince Philip was in attendance.\n\nShe was commissioned by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1974, and remains the only Canadian ship to be commissioned by a reigning monarch.

Famous at age 14 as one of the three \"Baby Ballerinas\" of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1930s, she matured into an artist whom critics called \"the most unusual dancer of her generation.\"\n\nShe was born in Moscow a few months before the October Revolution in 1917. Because her father was a banker to the Tsar Nicholas II, the whole family was put under house arrest by revolutionaries. But, with the help of their servants, her mother and the four children escaped and fled through the Caucasus, arriving eventually in the south of France. A few years after they had settled in Paris, where there was a large Russian émigré community, Tatiana, known as Tania, began her ballet studies with Alexandre Volinine, who had trained at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. She also studied with Mathilde Kschessinska, a friend of the family who had been \"prima ballerina assoluta\" of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theaters. Under Volinine's tutelage, the girl developed strength, elevation, and speed; under Kschessinska, quick footwork and lyrical \"port de bras\".\n\nAt 14, Riabouchinska was chosen by Nikita Balieff to join his Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe, Le Théâtre de la Chauve-Souris (The Bat Theater), often billed simply as La Chauve-Souris. In the 1931 edition of their revue, which featured Russian songs, dances, and comedy numbers, she appeared in two short ballets, \"Diana Hunts the Stag\" and \"The Romantic Adventures of an Italian Ballerina and a Marquis\". In Paris, she was seen by choreographer and ballet master George Balanchine, who quickly signed her for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, then being organized by Colonel Wassily de Basil and his associates. She joined that company after the American tour of La Chauve-Souris. She and two other young dancers in the company became known as the Baby Ballerinas.\n\nIn 1932, in her first season with the de Basil company, Riabouchinska created the role of the Child in Léonide Massine's \"Jeux d'Enfants\" and in two works by Balanchine, \"La Concurrence\" and \"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\". Subsequently, she created roles in other Massine works, including the first three of his famous, and controversial, \"symphonic\" ballets: Frivolity in \"Les Présages\" (1933), set to Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony; the third and fourth movements of \"Choreartium\" (1933), set to Brahms's Fourth Symphony; and Reverie in \"Symphonie Fantastique\" (1936), by Berlioz.\n\nAfter Michel Fokine joined the company, he created the roles of the Golden Cockerel in \"Le Coq d'Or\" (1937), the title role of \"Cendrillon\" (1938), and the Florentine Beauty in \"Paganini\" (1939) especially for her. Besides these roles, she danced in many other ballets in the company repertory. For \"Les Sylphides\", perhaps Fokine's most famous work, she was coached by the choreographer himself. Her dancing of the Prelude, with exquisite pointework, soft little jumps, feathery landings, and liquid arm movements, became legendary, and she retained the role throughout her career.\n\nRiabouchinska also created many roles in ballets choreographed by David Lichine, a principal dancer in the de Basil company, who made a second career as a choreographer. Besides leading roles in \"Nocturne\" (1933) and \"Les Imaginaires\" (1934), she embodied the Chief Spirit in \"Le Pavillon\" (1936), the Angelic Apparition in \"Francesca da Rimini\" (1937), the Flower Girl in \"Le Lion Amoureux\" (1937), and the Romantic Girl in \"Graduation Ball\" (1940), a joyous characterization that became another of her signature roles.\n\nRiabouchinska remained with the de Basil company, which was finally renamed as the Original Ballet Russe, until 1942. The conflict of World War II disrupted its normal operations, and the company had to stop touring in Europe.\n\nShe married David Lichine in 1943, and the two of them embarked on a joint career as free agents, dancing and choreographing for many companies in the United States, England, France, and Argentina. They had one daughter, Tanica Lichine.\n\nIn the United States, Riabouchinska also appeared on Broadway in an unsuccessful operetta entitled \"Polonaise\" (1945), choreographed by Lichine to music of Frédéric Chopin. She appeared in a Hollywood film, \"Make Mine Music\" (1946), in which she and Lichine danced his choreography in the \"Two Silhouettes\" sequence. Throughout their years of dancing together, they were one of the ballet world's most admired and beloved couples.\n\nIn 1953, the Lichines retired to Los Angeles, where they devoted their energies to their dance academy in Beverly Hills. They also founded and directed several small performing groups. After David Lichine died in 1972, Riabouchinska continued to teach for many years, counting a number of Hollywood celebrities among her students.\n\nIn the late 1990s, she was filmed teaching class in her studio and reminiscing about her years with the de Basil company. This footage, along with many archival film clips of her performances with the company, is included in the documentary film \"Ballets Russes\" (2005), a Goldfine/Geller production.\n\n\n\n"}

It had Mrs Stephanie King as a vice principal from the year 2008 onwards, the director of the School was Mr Robert Boulos and the principal was Richard Woods. Unity High is situated in the centre of Khartoum.\n\nThe school was found in 1902 as an all-girls school and was originally called the Unity High School for Girls. In the preceding years, the Coptic community in Khartoum had established a boys' school but lacked the resources to found a girls' school. Some Coptic families then approached the Anglican missionary Llwellyn Gwynne (who later became Bishop of Khartoum) for help and the Coptic Girls School was opened in 1902 but changed its name to the Church Missionary Society Khartoum Girls School in 1903. In 1928 the Church Missionary Society school closed and the land reverted to Bishop Gwynne who with the support of four local Christian communities and the financial help of Christian merchants, then opened the Unity High School for Girls.\n\nUnity High School became co-educational in 1985.\n\nOn 25 November 2007 the school came to international attention when one of its teachers was arrested by Sudanese authorities for allegedly insulting Islam by allowing the children in her class to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nThe school was closed until January 2008 for the safety of pupils and staff as reprisals were feared.\n\nAngela Isaac and Khalda Zahir graduated from the Unity High School in 1946 and that year Angela became the first Sudanese girl to enter university (University of Khartoum).
