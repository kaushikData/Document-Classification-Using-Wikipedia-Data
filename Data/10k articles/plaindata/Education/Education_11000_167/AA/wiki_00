In 1964 Faisal opened a large campus for the school in Jeddah, and from that point forward, arranged an annual fund of several million Saudi riyals from the national budget. Kamal Adham, Faisal's Turkish father-in-law, traveled to the United Kingdom to meet officials from the government. Adham told the officials that the school ought to be modeled after Victoria College, a school in Khartoum, Sudan inspired by British education. The Government of Saudi Arabia provided funds and staff members for the school. Steve Coll, author of \"The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century\", said that during the 1960s and 1970s Al-Thager \"had the reputation of a private enclave for the sons of businessmen and the royal family.\" Al-Thager became the most prestigious school in Jeddah.\n\nThe school's entrance examinations were open to all Saudis. Some lower class Saudis were granted acceptance and attended the school with wealthier Saudis. Around that era, each graduating class consisted of around 60 boys. During that period many Egyptian and Syrian teachers, who had been involved in dissident Islamic organizations in their home countries, taught at Al-Thager, as many did in other Saudi primary and secondary schools and universities. Coll said in the 1960s and early 1970s that the school \"had a relatively secular flavor.\"\n\nAround the early 1970s many Al-Thager students engaged in political debates. One group of students, influenced by Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, were in favor of Pan-Arab nationalism. Another group of students, influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood, were in favor of additional Islamic influence in politics in the Arab world. Coll said that Al-Thager was \"a conspicuous example of modernization without secularization.\"\n\nIn the 1960s the school campus was located near downtown Jeddah, with the campus north of Old Jeddah Road. A two story concrete and fieldstone building served as the school's main classroom building. Steve Coll, author of \"The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century\", said that the building was in a \"featureless modern style.\" The school had two classroom wings, one for middle school students and one for high school students. An interior courtyard was located between the wings.\n\nIn the 1960s most students were day students and commuted to school. The boarding students and some foreign teachers lived in dormitories on the school's second floor.\n\nIn the 1960s Al-Thager was the only school in Jeddah to have air conditioning.\n\nSteve Coll, author of \"The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century\", said that in the 1960s and 1970s Al-Thager \"prided itself on its modern curicculum\" and that it was the only Saudi school that \"could even begin to compare itself to a place like\" Brummana High School in Brummana, Lebanon. During that period the school had English instruction provided by many foreign English teachers from England and Ireland. Al-Thager, like other Saudi schools, had religion as a core component in the instruction. At noon, the boys performed \"zuhr\", the Islamic prayer at noontime. Each morning, the school prompted boys in a military-style call of order to assemble in rows. Teachers had canes, and disciplined boys by striking their feet.\n\nThe students wear western-style school uniforms seen in American and British university preparatory schools; in most Saudi schools for boys, the students wear thobes and cloth headdresses. During the 1960s and 1970s, students wore white oxford shirts with ties, grey trousers, black socks, and black shoes. During winter periods students wore charcoal-coloured blazers.\n\nOsama bin Laden began attending Al-Thager in 1968, either in the fifth or sixth grade. Osama's education at Al-Thager ended in 1976. Former teachers, Brian Fyfield-Shayler and Seamus O’Brien gave an interview to \"The New Yorker\" in which they claimed that they remembered teaching Osama bin Laden at the school. Some of Osama's half-brothers were enrolled at Al-Thager.\n\n\n"}

ARC is a support network for formerly incarcerated individuals and advocates for criminal justice reform. ARC’s mission is to reduce incarceration, improve the outcomes of formerly incarcerated individuals, and to build healthier communities.\n\nIn 1997, Budnick first became interested in juveniles in prison after reading a \"Rolling Stone\" article about Brandon Hein and three other youths who were found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in California even though three of them never touched the weapon. Budnick sent the article to a producer who optioned it for a documentary film called \"Reckless Indifference\".\n\nIn 2003, Budnick began volunteering at the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, California. Budnick was a volunteer teacher for a group called InsideOUT Writers. As of 2014, Budnick still volunteers at the Nidorf Juvenile Hall. After this experience and others, Budnick began to tell administrators and politicians about the problems he was seeing in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems. After the success of Budnick's The Hangover franchise, Budnick was able to leverage the work he does for incarcerated juveniles. Jake Gyllenhaal went with Budnick to the Sylmar juvenile detention center, to Men's Central Jail and out to California State Prison, Los Angeles County.\n\nIn 2012, Budnick was named California's Volunteer of Year by Governor Jerry Brown for a program he envisioned. After seeing kids desperate to change their lives but unable to because of California law at that time, Budnick and other launched a pilot program out of Los Angeles County where every single kid coming into the prison system—if they are doing the right things on their own—got to go to a place where they could get their high school diploma or GED, go to college classes, learn a trade, and be in self-help programs and substance-abuse programs. In 2013, the program was adopted statewide.\n\nBudnick began to see many of the kids he worked with—in some of his college programs—come out of prison and going into universities, community colleges, and obtaining employment. Budnick saw a network of ex-offenders and ex-gang-members who were changing their lives. Then, Budnick and others started doing retreats where the formerly incarcerated young people would meet with mentors and lawyers, and eventually formed a private Facebook page where they organized events and provided support.\n\nIn 2013, Budnick officially launched the Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC), a formal organization of formerly-incarcerated young adults who work to support one another, and that also aims to lower the number of people flowing into the criminal justice system through policy advocacy and community organizing. Budnick said \"I started to see that there was not an organization out there that had high-achieving guys coming out of prison who could articulate why hope is important and why kids deserve a second chance and why kids are different from adults.\"\n\nARC serves as a support network and a connection to services for over one hundred formerly incarcerated individuals. Members must commit to live crime-free, gang-free, drug-free, in school or working, and in service to their community. ARC provides support through mentoring, case management, internship and employment opportunities, regular support network meetings and social outings. Members receive mentoring from professional adult volunteers, known as ARC Allies, and through ARC’s Leadership Council that includes formerly incarcerated youth who are now university graduates, lawyers, engineers, politicians and other successful professionals. ARC host retreats for members of the ARC network.\n\nARC’s policy reform advocacy is conducted by formerly incarcerated individuals who have successfully transformed their lives. In 2014, ARC teamed up with the Ford Foundation and others to host a TEDx conference inside Ironwood State Prison with hundreds in attendance. ARC produced a documentary about the event. Prophet Walker, a founding member of ARC, was a guest of Michelle Obama's at the 2015 State of the Union. After serving a six-year prison sentence, Walker sought to strengthen the bond between police officers and inner-city residents. ARC's Budnick writes about criminal justice policy for the Huffington Post. ARC successfully advocated for California Senate Bill 260, which guarantees that offenders who received long sentences as juveniles have the opportunity to be considered for parole.\n\nIn 2015, James Anderson, a formerly incarcerated young man and first founding staff of ARC, spoke alongside John Legend in Sacramento about criminal justice reform. With the help of ARC, Anderson was accepted into UCLA. Anderson has met personally with President Barack Obama.\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Brent Bolthouse, Dede Gardner, Jake Gyllenhaal, Hill Harper, Bruce Karatz, and Damon Lindelof, among others, serve on the board of directors. Major donors have included the California Endowment, the California Wellness Foundation and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Ben Lear, Common, Jonah Hill, Mike Tollin, Nasir Jones, Raul Ruiz, Tony Cardenas, and Zach Galifianakis, among others, serve on ARC's Advisory Board.\n\n"}

With concentrated sulfuric acid, granulated table sugar (sucrose) performs degradation reaction which changes its form to black solid-liquid mixture. Carbon snake experiment can sometimes be misrecognized as black snake, \"sugar snake,\" or \"burning sugar\", which involve the reaction with baking soda instead of sulfuric acid.\n\nConcentrated sulfuric acid can perform a dehydration reaction with table sugar. After mixing, the color changes from white to brownish and eventually to black. The expansion of the mixture is the result of vaporization of water and CO inside the container. The gases inflate the mixture to form a snake-like shape, and give off a burned sugar smell. The granularity of the sugar can greatly affect the reaction: powdered sugar reacts very quickly but sugar cubes take longer to react.\n\nWhen sucrose gets dehydrated, heat is given out to the surroundings in an exothermic reaction, while graphite and liquid water are produced by the decomposition of the sugar:\n\nAs the acid dehydrates the sucrose, the water produced will dilute the sulfuric acid, giving out energy in the form of heat.\n\nParanitroaniline can be used instead of sugar. It takes longer time for a black snake to develop and it requires heating under fumehood, but once formed, the black snake rises from the container very rapidly. It may lead to explosion if too much sulfuric acid is used.\n\n\n"}

Antonucci is known for creating the Cartoon Network animated comedy series \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\". He also created \"Lupo the Butcher\", \"Cartoon Sushi\", and \"The Brothers Grunt\".\n\nAntonucci dropped out of the Sheridan College of Visual Arts to take a job as an animator at Hanna-Barbera, where he worked on a number of series, including \"The Flintstones Comedy Hour\", \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\", \"The Smurfs\", and \"Richie Rich\". He continued his career in Vancouver, where he worked on animated shorts and television commercials for International Rocketship Limited, and created his first solo work, the animated short \"Lupo the Butcher\". At MTV, he worked on a number of commercials, his series \"The Brothers Grunt\", and the animation showcase program \"Cartoon Sushi\", which he co-created with Keith Alcorn. He went on to create \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" for Cartoon Network. In 2008, Antonucci signed to the now-defunct WildBrain.\n\nThroughout his career, Antonucci won a number of awards. Many of his commercials for Converse, ESPN and Levi's won a number of awards. \"Lupo the Butcher\" was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic.\n\nAntonucci's parents were Italian immigrants to Canada. His experiences as a child in an immigrant family deeply influenced his later work, such as \"Lupo the Butcher\".\n\nAntonucci attended the Sheridan College of Visual Arts but quit to take a job as an animator\nat Canimage Production, a division of Hanna-Barbera.\n\nStarting his career as an animator, Antonucci worked on numerous shows, including \"The Flintstones Comedy Hour\", \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\", \"The Smurfs\", and \"Richie Rich\".\n\nIntending to move to Los Angeles in 1984 to find more work, Antonucci landed in Vancouver, British Columbia. He landed a job at International Rocketship Limited, animating short films and television commercials. His first effort was on the short film \"Hooray for Sandbox Land\".\n\nAntonucci's first solo work was \"Lupo the Butcher\", produced by International Rocketship Limited, about a short-tempered butcher who swears at the meat he is cutting and gets extremely mad at the smallest mistakes. Antonucci says the short arose out of his own frustration at having to work in children's film for so long, and to try his hand at creating a full-fledged character on film. The short animated film screened at several film festivals, including Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in the United States.\n\nThe 'Lupo' character was eventually licensed by the Converse athletic shoe company. This led to additional work, including animated commercials for Levi Strauss & Co. and MTV. He also originally created bumpers for Cartoon Network featuring the jester.\n\nOn April 1, 1994, Antonucci started an animation company named a.k.a. Cartoon, which produced the short-lived MTV series \"The Brothers Grunt\", which began airing in 1994 and ended its run in 1995. Antonucci went on to work on MTV's \"Cartoon Sushi\" show in 1997, directing, writing and providing voices, in addition to being responsible for the title sequence of the show.\n\nFeeling confined to \"gross\" and \"edgy\" work, such as his series \"The Brothers Grunt\", Antonucci decided to produce an animated children's television show again with his company a.k.a. Cartoon. He resolved, however, to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the cartoon styles from the 1940s to the 1970s. Antonucci spent months designing the show, before trying to sell it to Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon told him that they would take the show, if they also obtained creative control. Antonucci refused to give it, and instead took the show to Cartoon Network. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission the show, after they agreed to let Antonucci go in his own direction.\n\nAntonucci is a strong advocate of hand-drawn animation. The wobbling animation in \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" is an homage to the hand-drawn cartoons with a style that harkens back to cartoons of the 1940s to the 1970s. To give the impression of movement, \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" uses shimmering character outlines similar to \"Squigglevision\". The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in \"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist\", but are still visible, and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.\n\nAccording to Antonucci, the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons. The Eds also possess personality traits similar to The Three Stooges, whose money-making schemes and antics also invariably backfire. The cul-de-sac children and the Kanker Sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, stating that he \"thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own\" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first-generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.\n\n\"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" is the only A.k.a. Cartoon show to have a theatrical movie based on the animated television series. The series' finale movie, \"Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show\", aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series. However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On March 30, 2012, the series received another opportunity to air re-runs on the revived block \"Cartoon Planet\".\n\nWhile Antonucci was working on \"Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show\", it was announced on September 4, 2008 that he signed to WildBrain; Antonucci stated that he was \"already kicking around three different ideas for his first Wildbrain project.\" On June 11, 2013, animator Joe Murray posted a short interview with Antonucci for his class on his website, and on the end wrote: \"He's currently working on a new series, so rock on.\"\n\nAntonucci's first solo work \"Lupo the Butcher\" was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic. Eric Fogel, creator of \"Celebrity Deathmatch\", stated that \"Lupo the Butcher\" \"opened [his] eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and inspired [him] to pursue a career path that was a bit more... twisted\". Throughout his career, Antonucci received a number of awards. He worked on a number of award-winning commercials for Converse, ESPN and Levi's. In 1998, for his work on \"Cartoon Sushi\", Antonucci received a National Cartoonists Society Division Award for Television Animation. His series \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" received several awards and nominations; for his work on the series, Antonucci won a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation in 1999 and a Leo Award for Best Director in an Animated Production or Series in 2000. He became best known for \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\", which with an almost 11-year run remains the longest running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date. It was also Cartoon Network's most popular series among boys ages 2–11. Bob Higgins, head of WildBrain, considered \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" to be a \"landmark in animation\". Joe Murray, famous for creating the animated series \"Rocko's Modern Life\" and \"Camp Lazlo\", called Antonucci \"one of the founders and mainstays of modern animation\".\n"}

It is a charter of Outward Bound International (OBI).\n\nLearning through experience was the philosophy of the original Outward Bound when it was founded in 1941. It is an educational process based on action and reflection. Experiences are intentionally designed, presented, and reflected upon to instill values and promote skills. The mission of OBCR is to promote personal, cultural, and environmental integrity through Outward Bound principle-based adventure. Staff undertake diversity training to help deliver this. \n\nThe Costa Rica charter combines adventure activities - including hiking, rafting, kayaking, surfing, rappelling, SCUBA diving and tree climbing - with the cultural experience of learning first-hand about the Costa Rican way of life and environment by staying with local families and immersion in wilderness settings. The organization's aim is to develop 12 character traits: \n\nThe organization claims that five core principles are central to every Outward Bound course:\n\n\nThe first Outward Bound school was opened in Aberdovey, Wales in 1941 by Kurt Hahn and Lawrence Holt with the support of the Blue Funnel Line. Outward Bound grew out of Hahn's work in the development of the Gordonstoun school and what is now known as the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Outward Bound's founding mission was to give young seamen the ability to survive harsh conditions at sea by teaching confidence and tenacity. Jim Hogan served as warden for the first year of the school. \n\nFifty years later, in September 1991, a Coloradoan named Jim Rowe traveled by land from home - where he had been working as an instructor for Colorado Outward Bound School (COBS) - to Costa Rica. The first year in Costa Rica he focused on learning first-hand indigenous culture, rainforest ecology, and Costa Rican geography. He returned the second year with a monolithic raft and some SCUBA diving equipment to begin an adventure activities company, using the same boat to run SCUBA and river trips.\n\nIn Rowe's third year he focused more on equipment, river rafting, and mountaineering. His central location in Quepos had three uncrowded rivers ideal for rafting. Running day trips on the river helped him build the needed capital and marketing funds to establish a school for running courses more relevant to his philosophical approach to instructing. Rather than running quick commercial trips, he started leading trips whose objectives were to learn through adventure. He founded Save the Rainforest Expeditions School (STRES) to provide an avenue to work with youth applying the same philosophies as he used at COBS. STRES claimed to focus on teaching self-reliance, leadership, compassion, and service in a Costa Rican environment: Outward Bound principles were taught through rainforest adventures and service projects geared toward rainforest conservation as well as indigenous village assistance.\n\nOne year later, Rowe applied for and received a provisional charter (a charter that would become a permanent charter after three years) if OBCR maintained Outward Bound International (OBI) policies and procedures. In September 1997, OBCR received a full charter from Outward Bound International.\n\nOutward Bound Costa Rica instructed 4,787 students in 2008 and totaled 23,816 SPDs (Student Participation Days). These numbers reflect students who participated in Open Enrollment courses(OBCR's scheduled courses), Girl Scouts courses, day and weekend courses with Costa Rica's local schools and organizations, custom-made courses, and Iztarú Scouting Camp courses.\n\nOutward Bound Costa Rica courses must focus on physical challenge, personal development, and safety amidst rainforests, rivers, and beaches. Additionally, there is cultural immersion in remote rainforest villages run by native Costa Ricans. Course categories include: \n\n\nLocations include: \n\n\n\n"}

Denning\n\nPeter James Denning (born January 6, 1942) is an American computer scientist and writer. He is best known for pioneering work in virtual memory, especially for inventing the working-set model for program behavior, which addressed thrashing in operating systems and became the reference standard for all memory management policies. He is also known for his works on principles of operating systems, operational analysis of queueing network systems, design and implementation of CSNET, the ACM digital library, codifying the great principles of computing, and most recently for the book \"The Innovator's Way\", on innovation as a set of learnable practices.\n\nDenning was born January 6, 1942, in Queens, NY, and raised in Darien, CT. He took an early interest in science, pursuing astronomy, botany, radio, and electronics while in grade school. At Fairfield Prep, he submitted home designed computers to the science fair in 1958, 1959, and 1960. The second computer, which solved linear equations using pinball machine parts, won the grand prize. He attended Manhattan College for a Bachelor in EE (1964) and then MIT for a PhD (1968). At MIT he was part of Project MAC and contributed to the design of Multics. His PhD thesis, \"Resource allocation in multiprocess computer systems\", introduced seminal ideas in working sets, locality, thrashing, and system balance.\n\nAt Princeton University from 1968 to 1972, he wrote his classic book, \"Operating Systems Principles\", with E G Coffman. He collaborated with Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman on optimality proofs for paging algorithms and on a simple proof that compilers based on precedence parsing do not need to backtrack. At Purdue University (1972–1983) he supervised numerous PhD theses validating locality-based theories of memory management and extending the new mathematics of operational analysis of queueing networks. He co-founded CSNET. He became department head in 1979 and completed another book on computational models, \"Machines, Languages, and Computation\", with Jack Dennis and Joe Qualitz.\n\nAt NASA Ames from 1983 to 1991 he founded the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS) and turned it into one of the first centers for interdisciplinary research in computational and space science.\n\nAt George Mason University from 1991 to 2002 he headed the Computer Science Department, was an associate dean and vice provost, and founded the Center for the New Engineer. The Center was a pioneer in web-based learning. He created a design course for engineers, called \"Sense 21\", which was the basis of his project to understand innovation as a skill. He created a course on Core of Information, Technology the basis his Great Principles of Computing project.\n\nAt Naval Postgraduate School since 2002 he heads the Computer Science Department, directs the Cebrowski Institute for Innovation and Information Superiority. He chaired the faculty council.\n\nDenning served continuously as a volunteer in Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) since 1967. In that time he served as president, vice president, three board chairs, Member-at-Large, Editor of ACM Computing Surveys, and Editor of the monthly ACM Communications. He received seven ACM awards for service, technical contribution, and education. ACM presented him with a special award in June 2007 recognizing 40 years of continuous service.\n\nDenning has received 26 awards for service and technical contribution. These include one quality customer service award, three professional society fellowships, three honorary degrees, six awards for technical contribution, six for distinguished service, and seven for education.\n\nHe married Dorothy E. Denning in 1974. She went on to become a noted computer security expert.\n\nDenning's career has been a search for fundamental principles in subfields of computing. He writes prolifically. From 1980 to 1982 he wrote 24 columns as ACM President, focusing on technical and political issues of the field. From 1985 to 1993 he wrote 47 columns on \"The Science of Computing\" for \nAmerican Scientist magazine, focusing on scientific principles from across the field. Beginning in 2001 he has written quarterly \"IT Profession\" columns for Communications of the ACM, focusing on principles of value to practicing professionals.\n\nIn 1970 he published a classic paper that displayed a scientific framework for virtual memory and the validating scientific evidence, putting to rest a controversy over virtual memory stability and performance.\n\nIn 1966 he proposed the working set as a dynamic measure of memory demand and explained why it worked using the locality idea introduced by Les Belady of IBM. His working set paper became a classic. It received an ACM Best paper award in 1968 and a SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award in 2005.\n\nIn the early 1970s he collaborated with Ed Coffman, Jr., on \"Operating Systems Theory\", which became a classic textbook used in graduate courses and stayed in print until 1995. That book helped to erase doubts that the OS field could be approached as a science.\n\nIn the middle 1970s he collaborated with Jeffrey Buzen on operational analysis, extending Buzen's basic operational\nlaws to deal with all queueing networks. The operational framework explained why computer performance models work so well, even though violating the traditional stochastic Markovian assumptions. It has become the preferred method for teaching performance prediction in computing courses.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he was one of the four founding Principal investigators of Computer Science Network, sponsored by the National Science Foundation The other three were Dave Farber, Larry Landweber, and Tony Hearn. They led the development of a fully self-supporting CS community network that by 1986 included 165 sites and 50,000 users. CSNET was the key transitional stepping stone from the original ARPANET to the NSFNET and then the Internet. In 2009, the Internet Society awarded CSNET its prestigious Jon Postel award, recognizing its key role in bridging from the ARPANET to NSFNET.\n\nHe led the ACM Digital Library project 1992-97, which went live in 1997. The Association for Computing Machinery became the first professional society to offer a fully searchable library of everything it ever published.\n\nIn 1999, he expanded the search for fundamental principles to cover all of computing. The discovery of natural information processes in biology, physics, economics, materials, and other fields convinced him that the basic definitions of computation had to be modified to encompass natural information processes as well as artificial. He and his team have produced a draft framework.\n\nThe Great Principles framework revealed that \"innovating\" is a core practice of computing. Unable to find anyone who understood how to teach the skill of innovating, he joined with Bob Dunham and identified eight foundational practices of innovation. They published \"The Innovator's Way\", a book laying the eight essential practices of successful innovation.\n\nDenning has been a major influence in computing education. In the early 1970s he led a task force that designed the first core course on operating systems (OS) principles. OS became the first non-math CS core course. In the mid 1980s he led a joint ACM/IEEE committee that described computing as a discipline with nine\nfunctional areas and three cognitive processes, the basis of ACM Curriculum 1991. In the 1990s he set out on a quest to codify the great principles of computing. He maintains that computing is a science both of natural and artificial information processes. NSF designated him a Distinguished Education Fellow in 2007 to launch a movement to use the Great Principles framework for innovations in education and research. In 2009, ACM's SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) recognized his contributions with its lifetime service award.\n\nDenning is an inveterate punster who frequently uses humor to get points across.

David is a Filipino journalist, sociologist, and public intellectual. He is a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of the Philippines Diliman. He currently pens a weekly newspaper column for the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\", as well as being a member of the board of advisor of ABS-CBN Corporation.\n\nRandy David hails from Pampanga and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, major in Sociology, from the University of the Philippines Diliman in 1965. He also pursued doctoral studies at the University of Manchester, though he opted not to complete them and chose instead to remain in the Philippines during the martial law government of President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nA longtime professor in the Department of Sociology of the University of the Philippines Diliman, David first came into widespread prominence in 1986, when he accepted an offer by the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation to host a public affairs talk show on IBC-13. The show, named \"Truth Forum\", was notable as the only public affairs talk show during its time that was conducted in Filipino, rather than English. David later joined the newly re-established Associated Broadcasting Company as a newscaster and the host of a new talk show, \"Public Life with Randy David\". After leaving the network in 1995, David hosted \"Public Life\" for GMA Network, and until 2003, \"Off the Record\" (with Katrina Legarda) for ABS-CBN, his last regular hosting stint to date. Since 1995, his newspaper column, \"Public Lives\", has appeared every Sunday on the pages of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.\n\nOn February 25, 2006, David was arrested in Santolan, Quezon City while celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first People Power Revolution. The reason for the arrest was the lack of permit to rally, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo having revoked all permits after she declared a state of national emergency just a few hours earlier. He was later released with all charges dropped. In May, 2006, the Supreme Court declared that the arrests of David and his co-detainees were invalid.\n\nDavid expressed interest in running for a congressional seat in Pampanga should Gloria Macapagal Arroyo run for Congresswoman in the 2010 general elections, a fight that has been dubbed by several Senators and mediamen as \"David vs. Gloriath\". David later chose not to run, and Arroyo was elected to the seat in May 2010.\n\nDavid is married to Karina Constantino-David who served until 2008 as the Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) of the Philippines. The couple has four children, including broadcast journalist Kara David, UP National Institute of Geological Sciences (NIGS) professor Dr. Carlos Primo David, Nadya Melina David and Jika David. The Bishop of Kalookan, the Most Reverend Pablo Virgilio David, D.D. is his younger brother. David is also the son-in-law of the historian Renato Constantino.\n"}

R2S is the largest savings experiment conducted in the United States to date. This initiative builds on Intuit’s TurboTax Free File Alliance Online product, available free to lower-income taxpayers, to reach thousands of households.\n\nThe goal of the initiative is to design and test a low-touch, scalable intervention that can transform the tax-refund windfall into savings to improve financial security. The intervention builds on existing infrastructure and integrates with normal financial behavior, so it can quickly and inexpensively be expanded to reach millions of American households.\n\nThe experiment was developed by economics professors Michal Grinstein-Weiss at Washington University in St. Louis and Dan Ariely at Duke University and uses Intuit's TurboTax tax preparation software.\n\nThe moment people are notified about their tax refund is a golden opportunity to divert money into short- and long-term savings. The participant just learned they will be receiving money, the money feels like a windfall (outside of their normal income pattern) and they do not yet have the money in hand.\n\nThe R2S initiative capitalizes on this opportunity. The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. For example, would mentioning the names of the taxpayer’s children increases the desire to divert money? Or would providing taxpayers a sense \nof common behavior among their peers motivate increased debt clearing?\n\nThe R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. The prompts are informed by behavioral economics principles and have been shown in prior research to significantly increase savings intention in lower-income taxpayers. The variation in the prompts tests the influence of particular motivations on financial decision-making, compared with an unprompted control group. The variation in defaults tests the effect of defaults and of anchoring on savings behavior.\n\nThe R2S initiative involves collecting three streams of data to evaluate the impact of the intervention and inform the design of future innovations to build savings, including the Intention Survey, In-Product Saving Offer, and Household Financial Survey.\n\nThe Intention Survey is cross-sectional and designed to elicit information about possible behaviors and responses to behavioral economics-inspired prompts. It also gauges ownership of financial products (e.g., checking account, savings bond) and interest in using or opening these products at tax time. Findings from the Intention Survey contributed to the development of the In-Product Saving Offer and the Household Financial Survey. In 2012, 4,087 Intuit customers responded to the Intention Survey.\n\nThe In-Product Saving Offer is the largest saving experiment ever undertaken in the U.S. TurboTax Freedom Edition users with refunds are assigned randomly to a treatment condition or control group. The control group uses the regular TurboTax program. The treatment group uses a version of the program in which they receive a prompt and a saving opportunity designed to increase saving. Data generated by program use and refund allocation behavior will be evaluated to determine whether the prompts, saving opportunity, or both increased saving levels compared to the control groups. In 2012, 150,000 people were included in the study, and about 1 million tax filers are expected to be included in 2013.\n\nThe Household Financial Survey (HFS) is a longitudinal cohort study designed to determine the impact of tax-time saving and examine the effects of supply (e.g., availability of and access to savings products) and demand (e.g., awareness of the need for precautionary savings) factors that may influence the use and impact of the intervention. HFS participants will be sampled from those randomized in the In-Product Saving Offer and surveyed immediately after tax filing and again six months later. The HFS will allow R2S researchers to understand the impact of saving on the financial lives of households by (a) describing the context in which people choose to save at tax time, (b) determining if savings initiated by the In-Product Offer are new (i.e., not money that would have been saved in the absence of the intervention), and (c) verifying whether the savings ultimately increase households’ financial security. In 2012, the HFS pilot included about 350 households, and the research team expects about 12,000 households to participate in the study in 2013.\n\nUltimately, R2S has numerous implications for ongoing policy discussions at state and federal levels. First, the findings will show whether (a) the use of behavioral economics-inspired interventions can increase saving at tax time and (b) saving-promotion efforts yield increased financial security and improved household balance sheets. Second, the project could provide evidence on the effect of supply- and demand-side constraints to saving and thus inform policy discussions regarding financial access, financial knowledge, and consumer protection. Third, the design and operation of the R2S initiative may be of interest to those considering policy innovations that leverage private-sector resources or incorporate public-private partnerships to achieve public policy objectives.\n\nThe team is also planning an ambitious program of dissemination to share R2S findings with a variety of audiences. Several policy, academic, and general interest publications will be produced detailing the impact of the experiment and findings from the research in each year. R2S also plans to host events to share interesting findings with the research and policy communities and with the general public.\n"}

However, in keeping with its mandate to prepare students for University of California (UC) admission, the Santa Cruz Waldorf High School integrated Waldorf curriculum with the course requirements of the UC system.\n\nThe school operated on a trimester system. In addition to the math, English, science, history, social studies, and foreign language core curriculum, the school provided specialty courses in art (painting, drawing, sculpture), practical arts (metalwork, woodwork, jewelry making, pottery, bookbinding), archery, chorus, drumming, chamber music and drama. In addition to the usual activities, the physical education program included surfing, rock climbing, kayaking, sailing, meditative motion, and hiking. Math courses were delivered at three skill levels: basic algebra, advanced algebra, and calculus.\n\nIn keeping with its Pacific Rim educational theme, the school's foreign language program included Mandarin Chinese and Spanish, and the student body included a number of visiting students from the People's Republic of China. The school has also hosted visiting students from South America and Europe.\n\nSports teams included men's and women's basketball and track.\n\nThe Santa Cruz Waldorf High School was created in 2004 with a 9th grade class of 11 students and graduated its first 12th grade class in June, 2008.

{"id": "1771493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1771493", "title": "School governor", "text": "School governor\n\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, school governors are the overseers of a school. In state schools they have three main functions: of:\n\nThey are the largest volunteer force in the country.\n\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, every state school has a governing body, consisting of specified numbers of various categories of governors depending on the type and size of school. Governors are unpaid, but they may be reimbursed for expenses for such as the care of dependants or relatives and travel costs.\nUnder section 50 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 employers must give anyone in their employment who serves as a governor reasonable time off their employ to carry out their governor duties. Employers can decide whether this time off is given with or without pay.\n\nGenerally, the following categories are applicable:\n\nThe proportions vary between differing types of school, but as an example, in community schools, which are usually owned by the LEA, the regulations prescribe that parent governors should be at least one-third of the governors, staff governors at least two places, but no more than one-third, including the headteacher; LEA governors 20% and community governors at least 20%. Church schools will typically include a representative of the church in addition to the above categories. The minimum number of governors is nine, the maximum is twenty (although sponsor governors are additional to these numbers). Governors are appointed for a maximum of four years, this term is renewable.\n\nThe headteacher of each school is \"ex officio\" a staff governor, but he or she can decline to take up the position. Should they decide \"not\" to become a member of the governing body, their place is left vacant.\n\n\"Staff governors\" (other than the head teacher) are elected by the school staff and must be paid to work at the school, directly by the school (that is, not under an external contract such as catering or cleaning). At least one staff governor must be a teacher, and if there are three or more staff governors, at least one must be a member of the support staff. If no member of the appropriate category stands for election, the vacant place can be filled by an elected person from the other category (i.e. if no teachers wish to become governors, all staff governors may be support staff, and vice versa).\n\n\"Parent governors\" can either be elected by parents of children at the school, or if insufficient numbers are elected, can be appointed by the governing body to fill any remaining vacancies. Such appointees need not be parents of children currently attending the school – if no suitable candidates are found, they may be parents of former pupils, or of any child of school age. Parents so appointed can be removed from their positions by a majority vote of the governing body.\n\n\"Associate members\" may be appointed by the governing body as members of committees, and may include pupils, school staff, or anyone else who the governing body feel could contribute to its work. Their voting rights are decided by the governing body, and are also limited by law to exclude matters concerning the budget, admissions, pupil discipline and the election or appointment of governors. Associate members are not governors and are not included in the school's instrument of government.\n\nBy law, governing bodies meet at least three times every year, as a \"full governing body\", where the ongoing business of committees, the governing body and the school are discussed, reported on and where decisions are taken by a majority vote. Most of the work of governors, however, is done at committee level.\n\nThe governing body is led by the \"chair\", elected by the governing body from within its membership, though anyone who works at the school cannot stand for the office. Since 1 September 2003, the term of office for the chair can be set to more than one year.\n\nThe chair is supported in their work by one or more vice chairs, who may be delegated certain tasks or responsibilities. Certain tasks, including signing-off the school budget, can only be done by the chair. The process for election of chair and vice-chair and their term of office should be laid down in the governing body's standing orders.\n\nThe full governing body can remove the chair or any vice chairs by a majority vote of no confidence.\n\nThe governors are supported in their work by a clerk to the governing body. In many schools this role is combined with that of bursar or administrative officer, although they may also be employed solely in a clerking role. In some areas clerking services may be provided by the local education authority. The clerk is remunerated for their work.\n\nThe clerk is usually considered an integral part of the governing body, giving advice whilst not entitled to vote. Their role is primarily one of providing advice and interpretation on the regulatory and administrative framework in which governors work, preparing and distributing minutes and agendas, keeping records and dealing with correspondence.\n\nThe headteacher of the school is responsible for day-to-day management of the school. The role of the governing body is to provide strategic management, and to act as a \"critical friend\", supporting the work of the headteacher and other staff.\n\nSchools generally have a delegated budget to cover salaries, running costs, maintenance and equipment; the governing body is responsible for managing this budget. They can decide how many and what types of staff to employ, which equipment to upgrade or replace and what the priorities are for implementing new strategies and initiatives.\n\nGovernors must appoint the headteacher, and may be involved in the appointment of other staff.\n\nGovernors also have a role in monitoring the school's progress, and in setting annual targets for the school's performance and for the headteacher (and ensuring that the headteacher sets targets for other staff).\n\nGovernors must review school exclusions in certain circumstances, and have the power to reinstate an excluded pupil or reduce the term of the exclusion (although not to increase it).\n\nFoundation schools, voluntary aided schools and academies act as their own admissions authorities. In such schools, the governing body sets the admissions policy, makes admissions decisions and defends admissions appeals.\n\nMost governing bodies use a committee structure to undertake their monitoring and evaluation roles. Membership and terms of reference of committees must be determined annually. Finance, staffing, admissions, health and safety, curriculum and premises committees are very common. Other areas covered by committees may include marketing, discipline and management. Many governing bodies form working groups to tackle specific problems.\n\nSince 1 September 2003, particular committees can be given delegated powers to make decisions about the school that do not then require any approval by the full governing body\n\nGovernors and clerks can be offered training and support either by the local authority, by central government or by other organisations.\n\nThere are a number of organisations, websites and resources that support governors and governing bodies in England and Wales.\n\nThe National Governors' Association is a representative body for school governors in England. The NGA is an independent charity. Governors can join the NGA as individuals, as members of a governing body, or through their local governors' association.\n\nGovernor Wales is the voice of governors of schools in Wales. Governor Wales is funded by the Welsh Assembly.\n\nSGOSS – Governors for Schools is a government funded charity tasked with recruiting governors for governing bodies in England. SGOSS also receives support from business organisations. The SGOSS service is free to local education authorities, volunteers, employers and schools. In 2012 SGOSS began a partnership with the University of Manchester to ensure local schools have access to skilled governors.\n\nGovernorLine offers free, confidential advice, information and support to school governors, clerks and individuals involved directly in the governance of maintained schools in England. GovernorLine is a free service delivered by an organisation called WorkLife Support under contract to the UK government.\n\nGovernorNet.co.uk was a UK government website with information for school governors. It was closed by the Department for Education in April 2011, with a recommendation to governors to use the variety of forums that are available including UK Governors and TES Connect.\n\nIndependent schools, and public schools in particular, generally have governing bodies, although by their very nature, such schools usually decide on their own requirements for their composition.\n\nA study published in 1995 examined whether they were bodies of 'active citizens' providing opportunities for democratic participation in the governance of schools or unpaid volunteers doing the bidding of the state. It also found that the composition and functioning of governing bodies was shaped by the social divisions of class, race and gender.\n\n\n"}

It usually covers withdrawals due to medical reasons and the death of the student’s legal guardian(s) by either refunding or covering the costs associated with attending the student’s institution. Tuition insurance may also cover student loans.\n\nTuition insurance can be obtained through educational institutions or directly from an insurance provider. It can also be obtained as part of a student loan. Most tuition insurance policies cover the cost of tuition in whole or partly if a student has to withdraw from his or her studies due to medical reasons; however, this may be limited to the first weeks of the semester. If the withdrawal is due to mental health reasons the reimbursement rarely exceeds 60%.\n\nTuition insurance has existed since 1930. It benefits both students and educational institutions since it may cover the money a student owes an educational institution in case the tuition payer can no longer cover these costs.\n"}

Its official language is French. As of 2016, ULiège is ranked in the #251–300 category worldwide according to \"Times Higher Education\", 265nd by \"QS World University Rankings\", and between the 205th and 300th place by the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\". More than 2000 people, academics, scientists and technicians, are involved in research of a wide variety of subjects from basic research to applied research.\n\nThe University was founded in 1817 by William I of the Netherlands, then King of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and by his Minister of Education, Anton Reinhard Falck. The foundation of the university was the result of a long intellectual tradition which dates back to the origins of the Bishopric of Liège. Beginning in the eleventh century, the influence of the prince-bishops of Liège attracted students and prominent scientists and philosophers, such as Petrarch, to study in its libraries. The reputation of its medieval schools gave the city the reputation as a new Athens.\n\nA 17 March 1808 decree by Napoleon I concerning the organization of an imperial university indicated Liège as the site of a new academy to be composed of a Faculty of Arts and a Faculty of Science—the first university charter for Liège. Ultimately, Liège owes its university to William I of the Netherlands, who remembered the city's prestigious legacy of teaching and culture when he decided to establish a new university on Walloon soil.\n\nNearly 200 years later, settled to some extent in the district of Liège, the University of Liège depends on the French community of Belgium. The University is located at the edge of the River Meuse, in the center of \"the Island,\" the Latin Quarter of Liège. By 2009, the Agronomical University College of Gembloux (FUSAGx) is part of ULiège. It has adopted a new name for academics as well as research, namely 'Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech'.\n\nThe University of Liège has:\n\nThe ULiège comprises:\n\n\"For full list see \"\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are responsible for the management of information resources and the associated activities of learning, instruction, research, and continuing education. Their primary purpose is to work toward the growth, preservation, dissemination, and accessibility of information resources as a participant in the knowledge creation process.\n\nTheir structure, function, values, and objectives are defined in their Policies and Services Manual as well as in their Strategic Plan, the most recent being for 2013-2016.\n\nThe BUZ is composed of 19 central and campus libraries in addition to the administrative headquarters, and other additional libraries included through agreements with separate institutions.\nWhile the official inauguration of the University of Zaragoza Library is marked by its formal opening to the public on November 17, 1796, the efforts behind its creation were a product of the enlightenment and the educational policy of King Carlos III, whose Royal Order of March 14, 1759 ordered the establishment of libraries at all universities in the kingdom.\n\nUnfortunately, all initial development was terminated as a result of the Spanish War of Independence. On August 4, 1809, during the second siege of the city by French troops, the building was destroyed. Reconstruction begins after the war, but the requirement of substantial funding made this process a lengthy one. This began the development of the itinerant nature of the library, which has become part of its identity. The library was without a permanent home for all of the 19th century and much of the 20th century.\n\nThe library officially reopened in 1849. Towards the end of the 19th century, the library divided into three sections: the Main/University Library, the Medicine and Science Library, and the Historical Archive. The collections were further subdivided in the beginnings of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, many traditional library functions were supplanted by the establishment of pro-Franco ideology and cultural repression. Replacement activities included providing troops with books and other materials (Servicio de Lectura al Soldado) and organizing the Commission for the Purification of Libraries in the University of Zaragoza District to remove works banned by the Fascist state. During Franco’s regime, the construction of the Ciudad Universitaria (University City) area required the gradual relocation of several departments. The Colleges of Letters and Philosophy, Sciences, Law, and Medicine, and their respective libraries were moved to the new campus. Most of the archives and historical materials were relocated to the Letters and Philosophy building, but part of the collection was still inside the 16th century Cerbuna Chapel when it collapsed on May 6, 1973; the collapse was attributed to structural deterioration and institutional neglect.\n\nFollowing the approval of the Law of University Reform in 1984, the library began to reestablish itself after the approval of new democratic bylaws. This marked the beginning of a period of change that included a significant increase of staff and the construction of new library buildings for the College of Economics and Business (1996) and the College of Letters and Philosophy/Arts and Letters (2003). The BUZ began a progressive reorganization of its collections that moved away from its traditional fragmented nature, while maintaining the decentralization of individual colleges. The process of catalog automation and the development of the digital library took place from 1995 to the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nIn 1984, the year of the university’s 400th anniversary, the Main Library was relocated to the newly restored and modified building designed by Ricardo Magdalena (an architect and designer native to Zaragoza) that had been built to house the Colleges of Medicine and Science. In 2011, the Main Library, its associated services, and the European Documentation Center returned to the main hall. The old reading room now serves as an exhibition space for the BUZ collection. This move followed a full restoration of the space that began in 2006.\n\nThe BUZ is a single library system spread through many institutions and managed by the library commission.\n\nThe University of Zaragoza Library is home to the most important bibliographic holdings in all of Aragon. It contains more than 1 million volumes in different formats and mediums, and provides access to over 20,000 online journals and databases corresponding to areas of study at the university; the online resources are accessible from 24 access points in academic buildings on campus. Through Roble, the online catalog, users can discover what is available in the library and sign up to receive updates on newly acquired titles. Since 2013, the search tool Alcorze has allowed users to search the library’s catalog, digital repository, and subscription databases simultaneously.\n\nAs a part of its dedication to the preservation of knowledge, the University maintains collections containing materials of significant intrinsic or historical value. The majority of this collection is located in the Main library. Because of their uniqueness, these materials are kept in a special collections unit with additional restrictions. Many of these materials are accessible through the University of Zaragoza Digital Archives.\n\nThe highlights of the collection include 416 manuscripts dated from the 15th-19th century, 406 incunables, and an important collection of printed works from the 16th-18th century. Additionally, there is a broad spectrum of publications from research-oriented and cultural institutions throughout Aragon.\n\nThe BIVIDA project (Digital Library of Aragonian Law) provides digitized copies of many of the works on Aragonian law held by the University of Zaragoza Library.\n\nThe library provides several different services, including use of its collections, spaces for academic instruction, studying, and research, outreach, reference services, and instruction.\n\n\n\nThe BUZ uses the following methods to share relevant information with users about the library itself, the services provided, resources, and activities. These methods also serve to direct user opinions and suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2008, the University of Zaragoza Library has been an active proponent of open access policies through the Zaguán digital repository. Zaguán provides access to a broad range of digitized documents from the library’s archives including scholarly articles, books, dissertations, reports, preprints, and personal archives bequeathed or donated to the library, like those of the poet Miguel Labordeta.\n\nIn 2011, the library earned the EFQM (European Foundation for Quality Management) Excellence Award 400+ rating for its management system based on the criteria of the EFQM Excellence Model. This rating was renewed in 2013 and 2015\nAdditionally, the Development Institute of Aragon recognized the library with the Club Empresa 400 rating in 2012, and the Award for Excellence in Business in 2013.\n\n\n"}

The political leader of the department is the Provincial Minister of Education; this is Donald Grant.\n\nDuring the apartheid era, education in South Africa was segregated according to race, with different government departments administering schools for the different races. What is now the Western Cape was at that time part of the Cape Province, and schools for white students were run by the Education Department of the Cape Provincial Administration. Schools for coloured students were run by the House of Representatives Education Department, while schools for black students were run by the Department of Education and Training. Some integration of these schools had occurred during the last years of apartheid, but the administrations remained divided.\n\nOn 27 April 1994, the date of the 1994 general election, the Interim Constitution of South Africa came into effect, abolishing the old provinces and establishing the nine new provinces. The new Western Cape Education Department inherited those schools of the previous departments that were located within the Western Cape.\n\nThe administrative head of the department, subordinate to the Minister, is the Superintendent-General of Education (also known as the Head of Education); this is Penny Vinjevold.\n\nIn the 2010/11 financial year the department had 40,181 employees and a budget of R11,845,691,000.

{"id": "20391957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20391957", "title": "Working class education", "text": "Working class education\n\nWorking class education is the education of working-class people.\n\nPrior to the 19th century, education for most members of society was elementary and only an elite received advanced education. This was intended to provide members of each social class with an education befitting their expected future status—toil or leadership.\n\nChildren of the working class have a different educational experience than children of the middle and upper classes. Because of this, working class children can start out life at a disadvantage. Their educational experience may be hindered for several reasons, including influences from their parents, the schools they attend, and their expectations and attitudes, all of which are strongly affected by previous generations\n\nThe schools in the lower income districts are characterized by overcrowding and lack of resources. This is because the funding of American public schools comes mostly from their district's property taxes. Residential segregation occurs when people segregate themselves based on class and race. This leaves schools in the low income school districts with little because those who are capable of paying higher property taxes move to districts where there are higher taxes and schools are receiving more. For example, in New York City, where efforts are being made to level the playing field, students in the wealthiest school districts are given almost twice as much as students in the poorest district, an annual amount of $13,974 compared to $7,457. When schools lack funding, programs such as special education classes and extracurricular activities are cut back. This causes some working class children to not get the attention and help they require. When schools and teachers are not receiving the goods required to fulfill their duty, students cannot be expected to display the motivation to learn in a flawed system.\n\nThe way parents act in the home and raise their children has a large effect on how children will interact in social institutions. Many social scientists claim that middle class parents practice concerted cultivation, meaning a child's life is filled with organized activities and social interactions with adults. Due to the extent of their interactions outside of the home, the children of concerted cultivation develop a greater mastery of language and are instilled with a sense of entitlement, both of which allows them to become more comfortable when interacting with institutions. On the other hand, many working class parents practice the accomplishment of natural growth, where children have more control over their free time and are exposed to fewer interactions with adults that are outside of the home. These children are usually left to occupy themselves with activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or playing outside. Working-class parents put less emphasis on planned activities, than their middle class counterparts, because they are less likely to have the funds to pay for them.\n\nThe problem that comes with these differences in parenting practices is that schools, along with other institutions, are more harmonious with concerted cultivation, the parenting practice of the middle class. Teachers want parents and children to engage and be proactive, but parents and children of the working class feel a sense of constraint that leaves them confused on how to \"work the system\" and often causes them to become hostile towards schooling. Because working class parents are often uncomfortable around authority figures, they are less likely to communicate with their child's teacher or become involved in the school. As a result of this, low income school districts have lower involvement in parent teacher conferences. This could also be attributed to the fact that working class parents often have to hold down more than one job and do not have very much time to help their children with homework or attend school functions. As a consequence, working-class children mature in narrow social settings, receive fewer resources, and feel less entitlement.\n\nThe children of the working class approach school with a different attitude than those of higher class. This is because their sense of entitlement is lower than that of their middle class counterparts. Working-class students sometimes feel unentitled or that they do not belong in affluent high schools or colleges. Instead of viewing education as a way up in the world, the working class views it as valuable but not as a reality for them. For working class parents, they are more consumed with the tasks of simply getting by and providing for their children than they are with good grades and higher education. Parents pass this survival mentality onto their children and cause a cycle where working class children do not have the same aspirations instilled in them that the middle class does. Only 54% of students whose parents only received their high school diploma go on to pursue their bachelor's degree. This statistic is compared to the 82% of students whose parents received their bachelor's degree that go on to college. First generation students who do on go to college experience a culture shock once they get there because they are not as comfortable and sure of themselves as those that have come from a family that has received higher education. A 2012 review of the literature has shown that working-class students have a greater risk of being excluded from social life at universities, including formal activities such as campus-based clubs, societies, and organizations and informal activities such as parties and nonclassroom conversations. This is an important problem because social integration predicts student retention, and working class students are twice as likely as middle class students to drop out before their second year of college because they lack the persistence they need to face challenges and succeed in college.\n\nThe attitude of children born into the working class strongly reflects the way their parents raise them. The outlook and importance of education is not the same as families with wealth. Inheritance plays a strong role in the way parents and children view and value education.\n\nThere are some ways that this may be changed. In order to break this cycle, working class students might be taught the values of the middle class or the schooling system develop programs that help those students that are not receiving the support and guidance they need from home. The middle class values are the same values that are felt by the authority figures at school; therefore, through teaching working class students to value education and be more involved they will be able to navigate social institutions with greater purpose and poise. The problem could be that working class parents did not have these values instilled in them; therefore, they are less likely to pass these values on to their children. Schools have been left with the responsibility of being the only places for some children to learn the rules and values that are present in most institutions.\n\nSolving the problem of racism within these institutions, causing perpetual problems and nearly impossible change, would take large steps towards rectifying problems within the education system. As long as institutionalized racism exists, problems within the educational system will continue to exist.\n\nDue to the lack of resources in needy schools, educational facilities are forced to develop support systems that do not have any additional costs. Programs that have been introduced into lower income schools include the following:\n\n"}
