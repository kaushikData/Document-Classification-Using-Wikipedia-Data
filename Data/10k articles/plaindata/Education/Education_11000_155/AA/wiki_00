It is named after famous Bengali poet, writer and musician Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose philosophy has inspired the purpose and mission of the organization.\n\nThe Bangladesh Nazrul Sena was founded in 1964 in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan). Its activities were curtailed during the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, but began rapidly growing following the independence of Bangladesh. It was inspired by the philosophy of Kazi Nazrul Islam, who is regarded as the \"national poet\" of Bangladesh. The organization seeks to combat child abuse, injustice and discrimination of children and young people based on socio-economic background, religion, poverty, birth, sex, health and handicaps.\n\nGoverned by a central committee of trustees and board members, the Bangladesh Nazrul Sena has 35 branches and chapters across Bangladesh, through which it sponsors initiatives and programmes for healthcare and education for Bangladeshi youth. It works with public schools, kindergarten schools and orphanages to provide care and support for the development of children and young adults. The organization also supports many volunteer activities and programmes.\n\nThe organization has also established the Nazrul Sena School, which is a well-known kindergarten school in Mymensingh.

{"id": "58403719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58403719", "title": "Bathroom reading", "text": "Bathroom reading\n\nBathroom reading is the act of reading text while in a bathroom, usually while sitting on the toilet and defecating. The practice has been common throughout history and remains widespread today with both printed material and smartphones.\n\nBathroom reading has been commonplace throughout history. Ancient Roman bath houses often contained libraries with scrolls for reading. Before the invention of modern toilet paper, Americans in the colonial period often used newspaper or similar printed material to wipe themselves, because newsprint paper is fairly soft and absorbent. Writing in the 18th century, the English statesman Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield reported that he knew \"a gentleman who was so good a manager of his time that he would not even lose that small portion of it which the call of nature obliged him to pass in the necessary-house; but gradually went through all the Latin poets, in those moments.\n\nThe advent of the smartphone is believed to have significantly increased bathroom reading. A 2009 study conducted in Israel found that a majority of adults read from their smartphones on the toilet, and a 2015 study conducted by Verizon found that 90% of cell phone users admitted to reading from their phones while on the toilet.\n\nThe term \"bathroom reading\" refers to any literary material deemed suitable for casual or light reading. In 2011, the Canadian author Margaret Atwood wrote:\n\nPulp magazines were associated with bathroom reading, which the film \"Pulp Fiction\" references in repeated scenes of John Travolta's character Vincent Vega reading the pulpy spy novel \"Modesty Blaise\" while sat on a toilet. Bathroom reading also refers to a genre of books containing humor and trivia, such as the \"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader\" series.\n\nIn James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\", the protagonist Leopold Bloom reads a magazine on the toilet and then wipes himself with it.\n\nAccording to a professor at the Columbia University Medical Center, reading in the bathroom can potentially facilitate the spread of disease if airborne bacteria land on reading material and are transmitted to the reader; however, the activity is not a significant health concern as long as the reading environment is sanitary, the reader does not have a compromised immune system, and the reader practices ordinary hygiene. \n\nA University of Arizona microbiologist who researched the topic in 2002 found that bathroom reading at the workplace was not a significant hygiene risk, noting that paper is a relatively unattractive environment for bacteria and that desk areas often have more bacteria than bathrooms because they are cleaned less frequently.\n\nAlthough time spent on the toilet can increase the incidence of hemorrhoids, a 2009 study found that bathroom readers were not more likely than non-bathroom readers to have hemorrhoids.\n\nEven when people read for extended periods of time during defecation, it is rare for bathroom readers to feel disgusted by the smell of their own feces, or even to consciously notice the smell. Sigmund Freud also noted this phenomenon in \"Civilization and Its Discontents\", though he described lack of awareness of fecal smell in general, not just while reading: \"in spite of all man's developmental advances, he scarcely finds the smell of his own excreta repulsive, but only that of other people's.\"\n\nThe psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel believed bathroom reading was an indication of early childhood trauma. He wrote that the activity is \"an attempt to preserve the equilibrium of the ego; part of one's bodily substance is being lost and so fresh matter must be absorbed through the eyes.\" James Strachey, who translated Freud's works into English, similarly noted that the activity of casual reading while defecating was essentially \"infantile\" behavior.\n\nDiMassimo Brand Advertising once tested political advertising in bathrooms by placing various messages about George W. Bush and Al Gore in New York City public restrooms. The company's study found that 62 percent of people \"remembered the exact message\" of bathroom ads, compared to 16 percent for billboard advertisements.\n\n"}

Founded in 2012, it delivers the most current questions to provide users with the best available board review, in a web application. The test questions are peer-reviewed by medical practitioners to guarantee the most relevant preparation for users. The exam provides user feedback on how they compare to their peers overall on a test and how they compared on specific questions. BoardVitals boasts a pass rate among its users as much as ten percent higher than the national average.\n\nBased in New York City, BoardVitals was the recent winner of the 2014 Gust Catapult NYC venture capital competition for start-ups in the area, providing the firm with further venture capital and angel investing opportunities.\n\nBoardVitals was founded in 2012 by Dr. Andrea Paul and Dan Lambert. Dr. Paul is a graduate of Michigan State medical school, and a former resident at Yale medical school and Mt. Sinai Hospital. She has stated that among her motivations for the company was the disorganization she experienced while studying for medical board exams. In an interview with \"Entrepreneur Magazine\", she remembered when she “was preparing for [her] own boards, [she] was putting together things from other books and notes that were not up to date.” She critiqued the lack of any standardized preparation or review and therefore sought to make a dynamic change. Dr. Paul left her Yale residency program to team up with several medical educators.\n\nShe partnered with Harvard Business School graduate and software developer Dan Lambert in 2012 to head Board Vitals as its CEO. Lambert was formerly a co-founder and CTO at Pushpins, which was acquired by Ebates in 2013.\n\nAfter its founding in 2012, BoardVitals has undergone several rounds of financing. In January 2014 it received a $500k seed investment from venture capital firms Rothenberg Ventures and Accelerator Blueprint Health.\n\nIn February 2014, BoardVitals entered the Gust Catapult NYC startup contest sponsored by entrepreneur and investor David S. Rose. The contest creates a platform for startups to pitch their business plan to a series of angel investors and venture capitalists. BoardVitals was selected as the winner of the competition out of over two hundred candidates. It was then invited to spend three months in a Silicon Alley incubator under the tutelage of Rose. BoardVitals has drawn the attention of several major investment groups.\n\nIts clients include Harvard medical school, Yale medical school, and the Veterans Health Administration. In addition it has partnerships with several medical publishers, including McGraw-Hill, Wolters Kluwer Health, and Wiley Publishers. The business model focuses on aggregating questions and answers from Publishers, Universities, and individually contributing physicians in a single location.\n\nMedical practitioners often continue their education after medical school by completing a residency in a specialty field to become a medical specialist. To complete their certification, the practitioner is required to pass a board certification exam to illustrate mastery of knowledge. Traditionally, there has been no standard review for these tests and study often includes outdated material. In addition, traditional review often requires multiple sources such as textbooks, lecture notes, and journals that can become costly and tedious. In recent years there has been a decline in pass rates among board certifications.\n\nBoardVitals offers comprehensive test preparation for several specialty fields available on any electronic device. The material is taken from top medical universities, publishers and individually practicing physicians and compiled into a review database that can be accessed anytime from any number of mobile devices. It also only provides the most up-to-date medical knowledge in its curriculum, making sure its users never review obsolete material. Other material is sourced from top medical journals and texts in each specialty.\n\nQuestions are written by faculty from top institutions and by several physician contributors. These questions are voted up or down through crowdsourcing among users to determine which questions more accurately reflect the specific specialty exam. This also ensures that out of date content is removed.\n\nIts board review programs are offered to individuals as well as medical schools, residency programs, teaching hospitals, and other medical facilities, both in the United States and abroad. It currently offers test reviews and questions for sixteen specialty fields:\n\nDr. Paul has stated the company plans to expand this to many more fields in the coming years.\n\nEach exam and question offers users feedback on their performance. It indicates where they stand in comparison to their peers, including data about what other users answered on a particular question. The statistics give users an accurate review of their performance in each section. User can customize practice tests to suit their exact needs, with advanced statistics available to offer premier test review. Board Vitals has given a guarantee that users will pass their board review.\n\nDr. Paul was recently named among the top ten disruptive women in healthcare startups. \"Gust.com\" named Board Vitals the 'Most Promising' startup in New York. The company has been featured in business profiles by several newspapers including \"CNN\", \"Forbes\", and \"Fox News\".\n\nBoard Vitals has been used by over 100,000 clinicians for board certification preparation and continuing education.\n"}

In return for the bursary the individual is usually obligated to be employed at the institution for the duration as the bursary. According to \"The Good Schools Guide\", a bursary is \"usually for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard times\".\n\nAccording to \"The Hobsons UK Boarding Schools Guide\", numerous independent schools have bursary capability, namely grants from the school to help pay education fees. These are usually awarded after a \"means test\" of family income and are not necessarily dependent on examination performance, although some account of academic ability will be taken. Bursaries may be awarded in addition to scholarships where financial need is demonstrated and the prospective student would otherwise be unable to enter the school.\n\nTo obtain such a bursary, it is customary for parents to be asked by the school's bursar to fill in an application form, giving details of their financial circumstances, supported by documentary evidence, including capital assets. The application will be considered by the school in accordance with its bursary policy. The award will often only remain in force until the pupil has sat the next relevant public examination. Most schools will review bursaries annually to ensure that the justification for an award remains. In Britain any award made before GCSE will not necessarily continue to the A-level stage. \n\nThere are two types of bursary awarded by institutions (such as universities). The first is a means-tested bursary which is available for all students whose parents earn under a threshold value per annum. It is often given out using a sliding scale, with people at the lowest end of the scale receiving a full bursary and the monetary award decreasing in value with proportion to the parental earnings.\n\nThe second type of bursary, also known as a \"scholarship\" or \"prize\", is one based on performance. These awards are generally given for good performance in the exams preceding university or college entrance in which the student achieves grades above the standard entry. These can be awarded by the university or, sometimes, by companies.\n"}

The building contains a lecture theatre and accommodation and demonstrates ecological building principles such as passive solar building design and heat recovery ventilation as well as low-impact building materials such as wood, hemp, lime and rammed earth. The external walls of the building are made from 500mm thick hempcrete, whereas the lecture theatre has 7.2m high walls made from 320t of rammed earth.\n\nA building management system is used to monitor a wide variety of parameters inside the building, providing data for research projects by CAT's sustainable architecture students.\nThe building is used for teaching postgraduate degrees and short courses and is also available as a conference venue and exhibition space. \n\nIn 2010, the WISE building was awarded the first place in the Daily Telegraph's list of \"Top 10 Buildings 2010\" and came 4th in The Guardian's \"Top 10\" list of buildings for 2010. It received a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Award in 2011.\n\nCAT originally relied on a collection of water, wind and solar power, but following power shortages it began to receive power from the National Grid. Shortly afterwards, in 2004, a large new wind turbine was built using funds generated by selling shares in the project to the community, Bro Dyfi Community renewables. From 2009 September onwards CAT operates a microgrid system which includes elements of on- and off-grid operation.\n\nCAT gets its water from an existing man-made reservoir in the slate quarry on which it is based and processes its own sewage in its reedbeds.\n\nThe presence of the Centre in the Dyfi Valley has brought an increased environmental emphasis to the area, which is now designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In the nearest town, Machynlleth, CAT plc formerly operated a wholefood vegetarian café and a separate shop. Following the closure of CAT plc, the CAT charity retained ownership of the vegetarian cafe but subsequently sold it to its workers. The cafe is now run as a private enterprise but continues to operate as a vegetarian cafe. The wholefood shop was closed, as the building was not owned by CAT; however, a new wholefood shop Dyfi Wholefoods was opened by the staff who were made redundant. An industrial estate (the Dyfi Eco Park) near Machynlleth Railway Station houses the offices of Dulas Ltd, a renewable energy company started by ex-CAT employees.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "422994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422994", "title": "Digital object identifier", "text": "Digital object identifier\n\nIn computing, a Digital Object Identifier or DOI is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). An implementation of the Handle System, DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.\n\nA DOI aims to be \"resolvable\", usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL, indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to uniquely identify their referents. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL. It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link leaving the DOI useless.\n\nThe developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000. Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs. The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF. By late April 2011 more than 50 million DOI names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations, and by April 2013 this number had grown to 85 million DOI names assigned through 9,500 organizations.\n\nA DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash.\n\nThe prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier, and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form codice_2, where codice_3 is a series of at least 4 numbers greater than or equal to codice_4, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants. The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like codice_5.\n\nFor example, in the DOI name codice_6, the prefix is codice_7 and the suffix is codice_8. The \"10.\" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace, and the characters codice_4 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. codice_8 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the \"DOI Handbook\").\n\nDOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc.\n\nThe names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model.\n\nThe official \"DOI Handbook\" explicitly states that DOIs should display on screens and in print in the format codice_11.\n\nContrary to the \"DOI Handbook\", CrossRef, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, codice_12) instead of the officially specified format (for example, codice_11) This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a PURL — providing the location of an HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.\n\nThe CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyper-linked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.\n\nMajor applications of the DOI system currently include:\n\nIn the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's publication service OECD iLibrary, each table or graph in an OECD publication is shown with a DOI name that leads to an Excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs. Further development of such services is planned.\n\nOther registries include Crossref and the \"multilingual European DOI Registration Agency\". Since 2015, RFCs can be referenced as codice_14.\n\nDOI and other special identifiers can help to unify information about references with different spelling in various language versions of Wikipedia.\n\nThe IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated. It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system. DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request. However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.\n\nThe indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as GS1 and ISBN.\n\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\nDOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its codice_15 field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as doi.org.\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as codice_16 (preferred) or codice_17, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI codice_6 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as codice_19. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non-paywalled version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version. Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016. While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs, which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox, enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like codice_20 or codice_21 directly in the Firefox browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system. It safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level codice_22 prefix.\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a not-for-profit cost recovery basis.\n\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9. The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot, which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010. The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.\n\nDOI is a registered URI under the info URI scheme specified by IETF . info:doi/ is the infoURI Namespace of Digital Object Identifiers.\n\nThe DOI syntax is a NISO standard, first standardised in 2000, ANSI/NISO Z39.842005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier.\n\nThe maintainers of the DOI system have deliberately not registered a DOI namespace for URNs, stating that:\n"}
{"id": "181117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181117", "title": "Epistle", "text": "Epistle\n\nAn epistle (; , \"epistolē,\" \"letter\") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal didactic letter. The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in ancient Egypt as part of the scribal-school writing curriculum. The letters in the New Testament from Apostles to Christians are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to Paul are known as Pauline epistles and the others as catholic (i.e., \"general\") epistles.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians wrote epistles, most often for pedagogical reasons. Egyptologist Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the Fifth-dynasty Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi—in his many letters sent to his viziers—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre. Its existence is firmly attested during the Sixth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, and is prominently featured in the educational guide \"The Book of Kemit\" written during the Eleventh Dynasty. A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The epistolary formulae used in the Ramesside Period found its roots in the letters composed during the Amarna Period of the Twentieth Dynasty. Wente describes the \"Satirical Letter\" found on the Papyrus Anastasi I of the Nineteenth Dynasty as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic ostraca (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the gods; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of Persian and Greek domination.\n\nEpistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the Greeks and particularly the Romans. The letters of Cicero are one of the most important sources on the history of the late Roman Republic and preserve features of colloquial Latin not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of Pliny the Younger likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. Ovid produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in elegiac couplets: the \"Heroides\", letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the \"Tristia\" and \"Ex Ponto\", written in first person during the poet's exile. The epistles of Seneca, with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later patristic writers.\n\nEpistles are written in strict accordance to formalized, Hellenistic tradition, especially the Pauline epistles. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers. Any deviancy is not the result of accident but indicates an unusual motive of the writer.\n\nIn contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see Philippians 1:1). The scribe (or more correctly, the amanuensis) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the \"episte\" (e.g., Romans 16:22). In the absence of a postal system, the courier may also be named (e.g. Ephesians 6:21–22).\n\nAfter the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, \"Grace and peace to you.\" \"Grace\" was a common Hellenistic greeting, while \"peace\" (shalom) was the common Jewish greeting; this reflected Paul's dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.\n\nThe body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.\n\nThe epistles of the New Testament canon are usually divided as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the New Testament. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word \"epistle\" is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus \"epistle\" lends additional weight of authority.\n\n\nIn the context of a liturgy, epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the General epistles)—sometimes also from the Book of Acts or the Revelation of John, but not the Four Gospels—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Mass and Anglican Eucharist, epistles are read between the Collect and the Gospel reading. The corresponding Gregorian chants have a special tone (\"tonus epistolae\"). When the epistle is sung or chanted at Solemn Mass it is done so by the subdeacon. Epistles are also read by an Elder or Bishop in the Lutheran Divine Service, between the gradual and the Gospel.\n\nIn the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Rite Catholics the Epistle reading is called the \"Apostol\" (the same name is given to the lectionary from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the Apocalypse (Revelation of John). Unlike the Latin Rite there are never readings from the Old Testament. There are Epistle lessons for every day of the year, except for weekdays during Great Lent, when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the Paschal cycle, being ultimately dependent upon the date of Pascha (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the feast days of numerous saints and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the Prokeimenon and the Alleluia. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the Gospel, though some services, such as Matins, will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle. A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the reader, though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a bishop), it is read by a deacon. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the Prokeimenon.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the ars dictaminis became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the Roman road system in the early Middle Ages, factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves. A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period's \"lingua franca\", Latin.\n\n\n"}

The name of the technique as first used in English by Zena Rommett states its essence, which takes the basic ballet barre training from the standing position to the floor, \"taking the effort of standing out of the equation\".\nSince 1998 Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) Foundation holds August Certification/Renewal conferences at City Center of New York City, where teachers of Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) are certified and re-certified so that the technique will continue to progress instead of fossilizing. Summer conferences in Italy \nAccording to Rommett, the technique allows the trainees to enhance their precision and posture, making fixes that remain in their muscle memory and become evident as they go back to train in standing position. Rommett also claims that by training in this technique certain typical dancer injuries can be prevented.\n\nThe benefits of floor barre are limitless. Primarily, there will be less strain on the hip joints. Often, when a dancer is standing at the barre, their turnout is forced beyond the individual’s range of motion. This means that the dancers are using gravity and their weight to forcibly turn their legs out in an attempt to reach that ‘ideal’ 180 degree turnout. This is not natural and can be quite dangerous for the joints. Floor barre emphasizes the importance in utilizing natural turnout by allowing movement that is both gravity resisted and assisted.\n\nFloor barre is also recommended for dancers recovering from injury because it enforces neutral spine, which corrects improper posture, and is not too strenuous for the recovering body. As a dance specific rehabilitation, it rebuilds strength and natural mobility. Exercises in floor barre can specifically target certain parts of the body such as the psoas muscles, hamstrings, or pelvis while still allowing the dancer to focus on increasing center awareness.\n\nDancers who over-rotate while utilizing their turnout can experience an overuse based syndrome known as Plantar Fasciitis. It is geared towards dancers and runners because of the constant heel rise to toe in their activities and exercises; it is caused by the excessive force used on that specific part of the foot, the plantar fascia. For dancers, it is most likely developed from a repetitive grandplié or relevé. If a dancer has this condition, it is unnecessary to stop dancing unless the case is severe. Modifications in the movement and overall correcting the issue is enough. It can resolve within several months and it can be repelled with the proper practice.\n"}

Other courses and services help family members prepare for the demands of a mobile lifestyle and living abroad, and provide employees and their families with important information about such critical and timely topics as emergency preparedness and cyber-security awareness, among others.\n\nAccording to the Foreign Service Institute’s website, the Foreign Service Institute is the U.S. government’s “premier foreign affairs training provider...dedicated to ensuring the career-long learning opportunities required for success in today’s global arena. FSI promotes substantive, regional, and linguistic expertise, leadership finesse, personal resilience and innovative problem-solving. FSI serves the U.S. Department of State and the entire U.S. government foreign affairs community as a strategic enabler of diplomatic excellence.”\n\nThe Director of the Foreign Service Institute is equivalent in rank to an Assistant Secretary of State, and is appointed by the Secretary of State. The FSI Director is the Chief Learning Officer responsible for professional training for the U.S. Department of State and federal foreign affairs agencies.\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute was first proposed as an in-service, graduate-level training institute for State Department employees and others in the Foreign Service. A number of different training schools and programs preceded the Foreign Service Institute, including the Consular School of Application (1907), the Wilson Diplomatic School (1909), the Foreign Service School (1924), the Foreign Service Officers' Training School (1931) and the Division of Training Services (1945).\n\nIn 1946, President Truman signed legislation that enabled Secretary of State George C. Marshall to establish the Institute on March 13, 1947. The Foreign Service Institute was initially authorized in Title VII of the Foreign Service Act. The issuance of Departmental orders fulfilling this section of the Act were delayed by the need to first resolve certain administrative issues. The orders were ultimately issued and, on March 13, 1947, Secretary of State George Marshall announced the establishment of the Foreign Service Institute.\n\nIn 1947, the Foreign Service Institute opened in the Mayfair Building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. at 2115 C Street NW, a building that was subsequently razed for the new State Department headquarters. The institute included four schools: Basic Officer Training, Advanced Officer Training, Management and Administrative Training, and Language Training. FSI then moved to leased space in Rosslyn, Virginia until October 1993, when it relocated to its current home. In 1954, the Wriston Report criticized the resources and support being devoted to FSI, and in the following year, FSI overhauled its curriculum, adding longer specialized training, putting a greater emphasis on language training, and opening up courses to wives of Foreign Service Officers.\n\nIn October 1993, FSI moved to the National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia, and remains headquartered there today.\n\nIn 2017, FSI celebrated the 70th anniversary of its founding, with the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training releasing an e-book in honor of its anniversary.\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute currently has four schools: Leadership and Management, Language Studies, Professional and Area Studies, and Applied Information Technology, along with the Transition Center and an executive office for administrative functions.\n\nThe School of Language Studies (SLS) offers instruction in more than 70 languages and proficiency testing in over 100 languages. Enrollments may be 8–44 weeks, depending on the difficulty of the language and the individual's proficiency objectives. The Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies also maintains a network of language field schools in Taipei, Yokohama, Seoul, and other regional programs in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia where a further 44 weeks of instruction is offered overseas in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic. Programs and courses of study also include self-study, early morning classes and distance learning courses. FSI is a co-creator of the speaking and reading language proficiency rating scales used throughout the U.S. government. SLS is active within the U.S. government’s interagency community of language trainers and testers and frequently benchmarks with external foreign affairs agencies on language instruction.\n\nThe School of Professional and Area Studies (SPAS) offers training in foreign affairs specialties, such as consular, management tradecraft, political and economic affairs, public diplomacy, curriculum and staff development, office management, and orientation programs. It also offers guidance on the socio-cultural patterns, politics, economics, and international relations of world regions and individual countries. SPAS provides tailored programs in Consular, Economic and Commercial, Management, Office Management, Political, and Public Diplomacy, as well as new-hire orientation programs and in-depth Area Studies courses. SPAS is also home to the Center for the Study of the Conduct of Diplomacy (CSCD), which examines recent diplomatic experiences in order to capture best practices and lessons learned. CSCD produces comparative analyses which are incorporated into FSI training and used to help prepare foreign affairs professionals at all ranks for the challenges faced at U.S. missions around the world.\n\nThe School of Applied Information Technology (SAIT) is divided into four broad generalities: training to improve the business application skills of all employees, training in the technologies employed across the Department of State for IT professionals, IRM tradecraft courses that provide IT managers with broad IT management skills, and training for new Information Management Specialists and Information Management Technical Specialists to prepare them for initial and continued overseas employment with the Department.\n\nThe Leadership and Management School (LMS) offers mandatory and elective leadership and management training for supervisors and managers from entry to executive levels; roundtables and policy seminars for senior leaders; and crisis management training overseas and at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center.\n\nThe Transition Center (TC) prepares employees and their family members for effectiveness in the foreign affairs community throughout, and after, their careers. The Transition Center provides:\ninsights and information on all domestic and overseas posts;\nworkshops and courses on Foreign Service life skills and security training; and\ntraining, counseling, and other assistance for Department of State and foreign affairs employees from other agencies leaving U.S. Government service. TC’s Center of Excellence in Foreign Affairs Resilience (CEFAR) provides consultations and training designed to help individuals, family members, and teams perform in high-stress and high-level-threat environments.\n\n\n"}

Hudson Taylor(1832–1905). \nHe was influential in the early translation of the Chinese Language, wrote many manuals on the teaching/learning for elementary students of the Chinese Language and became a University of Peking professor. He was killed during the Boxer Rebellion on 20 June 1900 and is considered a Christian martyr.\n\nFrancis James was born in June 1851 in Upton, Berkshire. He was the third child of five born to John James (born about 1824 also in Upton, died 1897) and Sarah Mitten (born about 1818 in Robertsbridge, Sussex and died in 1889), who were married in 1847. He came from a long line of the James family all living at The Forge (Blacksmith) in the small village of Upton in Berkshire. His great-grandfather, Francis James born 1763, and his grandfather, Richard James born 1797, were both the village blacksmiths, but his father John started up the business of a grocers and bakery together with Francis’ brothers John, Joseph and Matthew. His sister, Martha, also worked in the new village store whilst her husband Richard Bellamy took over the job of blacksmith. In the early 1900s the store also became a post office in the hands of John. Francis followed suit and became a baker in the family business when was age 20. From his mother he inherited \nhis sympathetic disposition, and from his father the tenacity of purpose and strength of will which were his \nchief characteristics. Little is known of his movement between 1871 and 1876 when he left England for China.\n\nJames was brought to China in 1876 by the China Inland Mission (CIM)to be a missionary. James and Joshua J. Turner were the first Protestant Christian missionaries in Shanxi and begin to help out victims of the disaster and famine. James worked in Honan and in the north of the country for the following two years. He became fluent in Chinese, and taught at a university. He and two companions set out in 1876 with over 4000 Gospels and other books, as well as religious tracts. They travelled 1,700 miles in three months. On their travels in 1877-78, they found widespread famine, which killed about one third of the population of one province. The accounts of the famine published by James and a few other missionaries brought famine relief from around the world. He resigned the CIM in 1881, along with many other young members. \nIn 1878 he married a CIM member, Marie Huberty, a French speaking Belgian (born about 1846 in Liège, Belgium and died in Santa Cruz, California, United States, date unknown). She was a graduate of French Protestant School, Liege. He took her maiden name as his own middle name. \nAfter a return to England in 1881, James joined the English Baptist mission group in Shantung, China.\nJames resigned the Baptist group in 1892. He became a Theist about 1894. He lived for several years in the United States, where in 1895 he was awarded the Lowell Lectureship in Boston, and lectured on the history, beliefs and philosophies of China. He returned to China in 1897, having taken the post of translator at the Imperial Arsenal, near Shanghai. This position he held for about a year, and he was then invited to join and accepted a place and was appointed a professor at the Imperial University in Peking. which appointment he held at the time of his death. He left his wife and children in the U.S. in 1893 to further the education of the children. They had two sons, Hubert Carey James, (born in Shanxi, China in 1879 and died 1953 in San Mateo, California), who became an accountant and Harold Francis James, (born in Berkshire, England in 1881 and died 1957 in Calhoun, Illinois) who studied at the Academié Julian in Paris with Jean Paul Laurens (1838–1921) a French painter and sculptor and Harold became an artist, an artistic author and a college teacher. Harold was profiled posthumously in \"Who Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975\" edited by Peter Hastings and published in 1999. He was also one of the artists included in \"Biographical Directory of Kansas Artists Active Before 1945\" compiled by Susan Craig and published in 2006.\n\nIn 1900, during the siege of Peking (the Boxer Rebellion), when many Christian churches and premises were burnt, and many native Christians were being killed, James secured refuge in Prince Su's palace, just across a canal from the besieged foreign legations, for about 3,000 endangered Chinese Christians. On 20 June 1900, James left the relative safety of the British legation, and was captured by Chinese soldiers. Some sources state that he was decapitated and his head was stuck on a spear for public viewing, by orders of General Ronglu(Jung Lu) (1836–1903), who was directing the siege of the foreign legations. Others state that he was shot. His killing was the second of an eminent foreigner following the declaration of war by the Chinese government, the first being Clemens von Ketteler, the German Minister. Thousands of Christians were killed in the uprising, including 182 Protestant missionaries. The term China Martyrs of 1900 was used by Protestant churches thereafter to describe the slayings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12337040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12337040", "title": "Front Sight Firearms Training Institute", "text": "Front Sight Firearms Training Institute\n\nFront Sight Firearms Training Institute, also known as Front Sight and as Front Sight Resorts, was founded in 1996 by Dr Ignatius Piazza. It is a privately owned and operated organization whose purpose is twofold: 1) to provide training, mostly on how to safely operate firearms in self-defense settings, also referred to as providing \"comfort of skill at arms\", and 2) an activism goal to \"positively change the image of gun ownership in our lifetimes\" by repudiating unfavorable views of gun owners put forth by various private gun control, and political, organizations. It claims to have grown to be the largest gun training organization in the US, and larger than all the others combined (as measured in terms of annual students).\n\nFront Sight currently operates two locations, its main location near Pahrump, Nevada and a second location in Nikiski, Alaska.\n\nThe original Front Sight facility was located on rented property near Bakersfield, California. and operated from 1996 until 2002.\n\nIn 1998, a property in Nye County, between Las Vegas, Nevada and Pahrump, Nevada (near Nevada State Route 160 and Tecopa Road) was purchased and the operation gradually moved there. This location, called \"Front Sight Nevada\", provides facilities for training in firearms as well as climbing, rappelling, and other forms of self-defense.\n\nThe Front Sight Nevada facility is still under development. As of June 2014 the facility includes a classroom area that can seat 450 students, 24 shooting ranges for handgun, rifle, and shotgun (with both static and moving targets), 8 live-fire simulator ranges with shooting house, underground training simulators, a gunsmithing facility and armory, a martial arts and edged weapons gym, a rope, rappel and climb facility including zip lines, a pro shop, and food service for breakfast and lunch. An additional 26 shooting ranges are currently under construction. These ranges will expand Front Sight’s capacity to 50 total ranges capable of training up to 2000 students on the property at the same time.\n\nFront Sight acquired an extensive property on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska in 2004. This location, called \"Front Sight Alaska\", previously focused on outdoorsmanship and includes training and activities such as big game hunting, fishing, kayaking, and bear safety, but from lack of student demand, has scaled back many of these classes. Front Sight Alaska has very little on-site development at this time except the ranges. There is no armory, gunsmith, pro shop or food services.\n\nIn early 2012, Texas news sources revealed preliminary agreements had been signed for a Front Sight Texas campus, to be located in East Montgomery County. Front Sight ultimately opted not to open a third facility but instead focused on completing the Nevada complex.\n\nIn late March 2014, Front Sight broke ground on 26 additional ranges (in the \"phase 3\" area), in preparation of temporarily shutting down \"phase 2\" ranges to build the Front Sight hotel. The hotel was expected to open in the summer of 2016.\n\nThe new ranges became operational in late 2017, and in January 2018 Front Sight released a \"construction progress update\" showing ongoing construction of the hotel and related resort buildings. As of May 2018 no revised opening date has been announced.\n\nNoted speaker and author on gun violence Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has lectured and taken courses at Front Sight, having graduated from the Four Day Defensive Handgun course.\n\nIn 2006, Mark Wahlberg attended sniper shooting classes at Front Sight to prepare for the 2007 movie \"Shooter\". That same year, Piazza and Front Sight were sued in a class action by certain members of the \"First Family\", an exclusive membership to the Front Sight facility, for failing to deliver on expectations made when the memberships were purchased. A settlement was reached in 2007.\nOn May 11, 2009, due to Front Sight's legal counsel failing to appear to a hearing, Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for Northern California ordered a temporary receiver be appointed to Front Sight. This case is related to the class-action suit, brought by plaintiffs, regarding a multimillion-dollar shortfall in the class-action fund. On May 18, 2009, Front Sight's legal counsel appeared at a settlement hearing and Judge James Ware discharged the interim receiver, leaving Front Sight in control of all aspects of its business. The termination of the receivership was made after the court received a copy of the receiver's report and based upon evidence presented at the May 18 hearing.\n\nSince 2002, Front Sight has supported the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, offering gun training for pilots.\n\nIn the wake of mass school shootings, Front Sight offers free firearms training for up to three teachers from any school.\n\nThe majority of Front Sight courses involve firearms training, but there are many other classes available. Among the firearms courses offered are handgun, shotgun, rifle and submachine gun; these are available as two- or four-day classes and are offered at entry level as well as more advanced levels of training. Classes typically run from 8am to 5pm with an hour break for lunch, and often include classroom lectures as well as practical training on ranges. Upon completion of entry level classes, students pass a Skills Test and can either be awarded a 'Distinguished Graduate' certificate, a Graduate certificate, or a 'Certificate of Completion' depending on their score, which is based on a combination of marksmanship and timed accuracy at shooting, weapons handling, and malfunction clearances.\n\nAdvanced classes usually have prerequisites requiring intending students to have first attended and possibly to have either earned a Graduate or Distinguished Graduate grade in the Skills Test for the prerequisite class.\n\nOther training includes empty hand defense, edged weapons, rappel and climb, child safety, youth achievement, corporate team building, and armorer's courses. Some of these classes are only available by invitation or to those who have completed necessary prerequisite courses.\n\nTwo new classes were added in March 2018 - a two day advanced tactical handgun class, and a one day tactical awareness class.\n\nBefore a student can begin a firearms course, they must pass a background check in excess of Federal requirements and may require a reference from an existing Front Sight member or previous student. People wishing to take courses who do not know a Front Sight Member or previous student may use upstanding members of society as references. Lifetime members must renew that background check once in every calendar year that they take a firearms course.\n\nAs of July 2014, there are approximately 100,000 households with Front Sight members, having grown from approximately 70,000 households in July 2013.\n\n\"Gun Training Reports\" are provided free of charge for those who join the non-exclusive Front Sight emailing list. These \"Gun Training Reports\" are written by Dr. Piazza and consist of Gun Training Tips, news stories about or relevant to gun owners, and Transcripts of some of the first time attendee's classes.\n\nDry Practice Manuals in ammunition-less home practice are available via the website. These are soft cover manuals with black-and-white photo illustrations.\n\nThe \"Front Sight Blog\" is published every few days. Every Monday's post is written by Dr. Piazza and is relevant to \"gun ownership, firearms training or Second Amendment issues.\" The blog is where comments and email responses sent in to Front Sight by gun owners are posted.\n\n"}

The idea is to allow students to diversify and pick subjects of their personal preference. The Kollegstufe does not yet allow students to specialize on one or very few subjects like the university does, so a complex set of rules for the Kollegstufe ensures that important subjects (e.g. mathematics, languages) cannot be dropped, a sufficient coverage for different fields of education is achieved and the number of lessons per week covers the required minimum. If you finish the Kollegstufe successfully, which means you comply with all the regulations and pass the final exams, you get the \"Abiturzeugnis\", formally called \"Zeugnis der Allgemeinen Hochschulreife\", which entitles one to attend a German university.\n\nThe regulations for the Kollegstufe and also for the Abitur are different in the different \"Länder\" (federal states) of Germany.

The ministry has previously included culture and sport, although this is now covered by the Ministry of Culture and Sport.\n\nIn the first decade of statehood, the education system was faced with the task of establishing a network of kindergartens and schools for a rapidly growing student population. In 1949, there were 80,000 elementary school students. By 1950, there were 120,000 - an increase of nearly 150 percent within the span of one year. Israel also took over responsibility for the education of Arab schoolchildren. The first minister of education was Zalman Shazar, later president of the State of Israel. \nSince 2002, the Ministry of Education has awarded a National Education Award to five top localities in recognizing excellence in investing substantial resources in the educational system. In 2012, first place was awarded to the Shomron Regional Council and followed by Or Yehuda, Tiberias, Eilat and Beersheba. The prize has been awarded to a variety of educational institutions including kindergartens and elementary schools.\n\n"}

OSL is a transdisciplinary pedagogy that is dependent on the use of physically open spaces - in the sense that tables and chairs are absent - and an open approach to intellectual content and the role of the tutor. Participants in OSL, typically but not exclusively, learn in an 'embodied' way.\n\nThe idea was to apply the practices and theories of the theatrical rehearsal room and the theatrical ensemble to the university curriculum. From these early aspirations developed a pedagogy that has now been used successfully in a dozen departments including Chemistry, Law, Business, English, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Medicine. OSL is a collaborative pedagogic practice and does not, therefore, have a single originator or author.\n\nIn OSL, the workshop is the fundamental activity of pedagogic interaction. Examples of OSL activities include 'still image' or 'tableau', in which participants embody sometimes abstract ideas; 'theory building', in which participants create a narrative, a concept, or a 'theory' from a collection of materials relating to a particular subject; and simulation and roleplay.\n\nOSL employs methods such as ‘enactive’ learning, ‘kinaesthetic’ learning and the various styles of teaching developed by practitioners such as Augusto Boal and Paulo Freire. Theoretically the work owes its greatest debt to thinkers like Vygotsky, Howard Gardner, and David A. Kolb. In terms of the suggestion that it promotes a style of teaching and learning that seeks to undermine a Cartesian separation of mind and body, its greatest debt is to work in Neuroscience by academics such as Andy Clark, and to phenomenology of the kind developed by Husserl. OSL also has connections to ‘applied drama’, ‘applied theatre’, or ‘applied performance’. OSL can include any kind of learning in which the participants are required to engage with both mind and body in a workshop environment, and promotes a combination of 'mindfulness' and 'playfulness'.\n\nOSL approaches are often dependent upon removing obstacles and mediations between bodies and minds. They can have a positively disruptive relationship to digital technologies. Where participants in challenging learning situations might ordinarily seek escape into the internet, OSL brings them back to a more immediate and unmediated presence. This has the potential to frame and question digitally-dependent habits, if handled carefully. Technology may then be reintroduced, carefully and with conscious awareness of potential effects, to extend the time and place in which OSL occurs and has effect.\n"}

These courses are divided into:\nCore courses are the most common form of education undertaken in Years 11 and 12 and include both Authority and Authority-registered subjects. Authority subjects are those whose syllabuses are maintained by the QSA and whose results contribute to a student's Overall Position, which is the ranking used for entrance to tertiary education institutions, whereas Authority-registered subjects are developed from a Study Area Specification. Authority-registered subjects do not contribute to the Overall Position of a student. Preparatory and Enrichment courses are commonly Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualifications, which often result in Certificate qualifications. Advanced courses are often university subjects completed alongside a student's regular secondary schooling.\n\nStudents are assessed based upon the subjects which they undertake. A student's final grade is given as a Level of Achievement, of which there are five:\nEach of these achievement levels are split into 10 rungs, to further differentiate the achievement of individual students. A VHA10 is the highest mark a student can achieve for a subject and a VLA1 is the lowest. These marks, along with the weighting of subjects (determined by students' academic performance in the Queensland Core Skills Test) is responsible in determining a students Overall Position.\n\nIn order to be awarded a QCE, a student must be awarded at least 20 credits from their studies, in which at least 12 credits must come from Core courses. Core courses not fully completed may also contribute some credits, however the level of achievement must be at least a Sound Achievement (or Pass). In addition, a student must pass the literacy and numeracy requirements. Even if failing to receive a QCE at the end of Year 12, a student may continue to work towards one, though credits expire after nine years.

{"id": "16257219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16257219", "title": "Rowen House School", "text": "Rowen House School\n\nRowen House was an independent British boarding school founded in 1979 in Belper, Derbyshire. The name was not a misspelling, but a reference to the Utopian thinker and eutopian practitioner, Robert Owen. This \"educational experiment\" used the power of the childhood group like Summerhill School.\n\nIt was based on the principles developed by A. S. Neill at Summerhill School, in turn deriving from those pioneered by Homer Lane in his Little Commonwealth. The children which it served were however substantially different. Summerhill children were those of fee-paying parents, who patronised it for ideological reasons. Rowen House was funded by state education authorities looking for respite care for behaviourally disordered girls from usually socially deprived backgrounds. A particularly apt phrase has been coined for them – \"school phobic\". Moreover, they were largely entering their teenage years.\n\nNevertheless, the basic Summerhill principles applied. That even children who resist being taught have an appetite to learn. Moreover, will learn self-control in an environment free of imposed control, where it is negotiated within a mutually supportive social community. In other words, democracy instead of authoritarianism.\n\nIts head, Bryn Purdy, had worked at Summerhill and had also been invited to join Wills in his Bromley project. After this, he applied its principles in an inner city \"special\" school set up by the Local Education Authority for day pupils.\n\nAs Shotton was later to write \"What unites the Little Commonwealth . . . and Rowen House . . . is the importance attached to personal autonomy, the aversion to systems of reward and punishment, hostility to coercive pedagogy and the fundamental and central belief in [shared responsibility].\"\n\nHowever, in the 1970s, control of state education became more centralised, with more emphasis on what could be termed behaviourist principles. Accordingly, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the semi-formal approach to engaging the children in learning and self-discipline.\n\nAccordingly, Bryn Purdy and his wife bought a former orphanage in Belper to develop as an independent school to which various local authorities might refer children, specifically adolescent girls, who were finding it impossible to progress in more conventional educational settings.\n\nSuch children may have been subjected to a family background of neglect or violence, and to sustained bullying at school, to which they have reacted in the only way they knew how. As Purdy puts it \"a teacher, through his or her headteacher, will bring the child to the attention of an educational psychologist, who may engage the help of a social worker. Then, after five years or so, when the child is at the end – no, when the child has cut his tether – the psychiatrist will call a Case Conference… the odd headteacher or social worker, or educational psychologist, who cares for the individual child, will press for his or her welfare, and, eventually, the child will arrive at our school.\"\n\nPurdy uses the term \"unschool\"… \"When a child has suffered failure, for whatever reason, at school or at home, we feel that we must offer her something different, perhaps radically different, from the arena of failure in the past… We aim to enter into as egalitarian a relationship with her as possible. One of the means of achieving this is to hold an assembly each day which we call the 'Moot'.\"\n\nThe \"Moot\" was the morning meeting central to the school day, where each individual felt free to raise any issues that concerned it. Unlike other previous schools, such as the \"Little Commonwealth\", fining was not imposed for misdemeanours, since the children had virtually no money. Instead restitution was sought and agreed with the other children.\n\nInitially characterised by outbursts of shouting and emotionality, frequently bordering on violence, as Purdy puts it \"Each day, week, month, brought less shouting, less wrangling; more rationality, more humour. The character of the Moot changed from a judicial 'court' to an exercise of conviviality, a daily conversation between friends.\"\n\nAlthough classes were voluntary, most children attended at least some of them most of the time and since each child was there voluntarily the lessons tended to be productive. Among the many parents, teachers, educationalists was an MP who felt moved to express praise in Parliament.\n\nA number went on to attend a local college part-time to progress to 'A' level and, after leaving, some have gained degrees at university.Children who would have been otherwise deserted by the educational system have gone on to successful lives.\n\nWith the Education Reform Act 1988 however, introduction of the National Curriculum became compulsory. The Inspectorate of Schools insisted that the Moot be removed from the timetable and that attendance at class be compulsory. This was exactly the environment that the children had come from, and with which they had been unable to cope. While schools like Summerhill were sufficiently well known and well connected to continue (and won a ground-breaking tribunal appeal) it became impossible for Rowen House to continue.\n"}

The program which made its first presentation in September 2005 to three recipients who had sustained injuries in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), was conceived and implemented with the assistance of Gen. Ralph \"Ed\" Eberhart, USAF (Ret), President of the Armed Forces Benefits Association.\n\nFollowing its first presentation, the Segs4Vets program began the process of seeking a waiver which would allow the presentation of Segway's to active-duty military personnel who had been severely injured and permanently disabled while serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In August 2006, the Segs4Vets program became the only recipient of a blanket waiver from the United States military allowing a donation in excess of $1000 to active-duty military personnel.\n\nThe Segs4Vets program provides successful candidates with a universally designed mobility device which aims to draw attention away from their disability. The Segway is a tool that aims to help many of the mobility issues facing our disabled veterans, in a manner which is psychologically uplifting and physically beneficial. Since 2005, the organization has provided over 1200 Segways to wounded veterans.\n\nIn May 2006, Colonel William J.

Barney Barnum, to facilitate the full integration of injured service members into the Marine Corps and Navy, or to assist in their transition into the private sector, became aware of the Segs4Vets program. In July 2006, the small staff of the SIMS program, Colonel O'Brien, HMC Christine Jensen, USN, and Joseph Wade began collaborating with the Segs4Vets program to encourage it to serve more OEF & OIF severely injured.\n\nThe results of this collaboration resulted in the first major Segs4Vets presentation ceremony on December 7, 2006 during a SIMS luncheon at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. In May 2007, the SIMS program concluded its work having identified gaps in coverage for the severely injured and recommended solutions for those deficiencies.

Social capital is often seen as the missing link in development; as social networks facilitate access to resources and protect the commons, whilst co-operation makes markets work more efficiently. Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks. There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labour', vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists. However, research analysing social capital from a gendered perspective is rare, and the notable exceptions are very critical.\n\nTo summarise the debate, it is argued that communitarian theories of social capital naturalise the labour that women put into maintaining social networks and take advantage of rather than valorise their work in the community and family. Communitarian theories of social capital are the most prominent in development literature (mostly inspired by Putnam's 1994 work) and it is assumed that an increase in social capital is inherently good and can support political participation and market efficiency. Social capital is increased by building and fortifying the traditions and norms that underpin reciprocity, co-operation and trust. Whilst this could be seen to valorise the feminised role in maintaining these norms and traditions that is overlooked by development theories based on increasing GDP and getting the prices right, it could also be argued to ossify patriarchal traditions and norms and rely on women's naturalised, unpaid labour in the household and community.\n\nAssuming that social capital is inherently good overlooks hierarchies, power dynamics and difference within 'communities' and groups, and that norms can be downward levelling as well as supportive. A Marxist approach, inspired by the work of Pierre Bourdieu (Bourdieu 1985), can bring out the 'downside' to social capital, and is argued to be crucial if the concept of social capital is to valorise rather than exploit women's labour. Network theorists define social capital as 'aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network' (Bourdieu, 1985: 248), allowing the relationship between social networks and economic resources to be examined, and potentially exploitative or restrictive traditions, norms and relationships to be identified.\n\nOther critics claim that the concept of social capital is wholly inappropriate to the feminist project. Rather than being trapped in a paradigm that feminists have sought to problematise, gendered critiques of value and the economy would do better to draw on the work of Foucault than Bourdieu (Adkins 2005), or focus on economic diversity rather than how social capital supports capitalo-centric development (Gibson Graham 1996). However, given the prominence of social capital on the development agenda and the plethora of policy and academic work that refers to the term, it seems vital that the gendered dimensions of the debate be highlighted.\n"}

The school, is located in the residential neighborhood of Carrasco Norte, Montevideo, Uruguay. The school's head master is Patricia Ponce de Leon. The school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), currently offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP).The College also offers valuable international exams such us the IGCSE programs and the A levels. It has a very long list of distinguished former pupils, including economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions.\n\nThe school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\n\nThe school is located in the south-east neighborhood of Carrasco Norte in Montevideo's metropolitan area.\n\nIt was founded in 1955 by the Christian Brothers, the founders also of Cardinal Newman College, Buenos Aires.\n\nBy then many Uruguayans upper class Catholics were unhappy with the educational system of public schools were concerned that their children receive religious education. Between 1953 and 1954 efforts were made to the Christian Brothers for the congregation to be installed in Uruguay, and founded a school for boys in the exclusive suburb of Carrasco.\n\nThis created a committee composed of the Moor family, Davie, Surraco Germain, Manuel Pérez del Castillo and Stella Ferreira, Adolfo Gelsi Bidart, Enrique Rozada, Antonio Barreiro, Conrad Hughes, Francisco Ferrer, Rodolfo Anaya, Antonio Galan, Eduardo Strauch and Jorge Alvarez Olloniego. They also collaborated Gallinal Alberto Heber, William Strauch, Roberto Houni, Jorge Eduardo Aznárez and Berenbau.\n\nAfter arduous negotiations, in early 1955, from Nairobi, Brothers Nairobi J. I. Doorley and J. V. Ryan arrived, with a mission to make final arrangements for the opening of the new school. They rented a house located at 6585 Republic of Mexico Promenade Corner Puyol. Brother Doorley returned to Buenos Aires and was replaced by Brother P. C. Kelly. Shortly after, Brothers J. V. O'Reilly and H. G. McCaig arrived.\n\nClasses began on May 2, 1955. That year a polio epidemic forced authorities to postpone the start of courses. Brother Patrick Kelly, a devotee of the Virgin Mary and, since the school was facing the sea, decided to call it \"Stella Maris\", as the parish in the area.\n\nThe playground for physical activities and sports Carrasco was the beach in front of the house. Later, the Carrasco Polo Club allowed the use of their courts. The school grew rapidly. Of 93 students in 1955 went to 137 in 1956 and 279 in 1958. In 1957 he joined another house on the same block, in Potosi 1536, in the depths of the house of Puyol and the Rambla. In 1959 he began teaching school, with a first year and four teachers.\nOn March 12, 1961 opened the school's current location on the street Tajes Max, with the blessing of Cardinal Antonio María Barbieri. In late 1962 he graduated the first generation of students in fourth grade.\nIn 1963 he implemented the system of \"Houses\" (Casas), which identifies all the students into four groups: Prior, Sion, Iona and Newman, each with a color identificatorio. In 1972 the building was expanded, adding a new section for high school. In 1976 this area was completed with the construction of a second plant to high school, which includes a library and laboratories for physics, chemistry and biology.\n\nIn 1985 he joined the first generation of women to high school and, since 1989, joined the first generation of girls to primary school preparatory. Since that year the school became gradually to be mixed at all levels and have three groups by grade rather than the existing two. In 1991 the school added preschool from age four.\nThe Christian Brothers are not currently residing in Uruguay. In 1998 he left the school, although the institution remains the property of Edmund Rice Education Association, whose local address part three brothers of the congregation.\n\nThe school gained accidental fame when its alumni rugby team flew on Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which crashed into the Andes mountains on October 13, 1972. The story of the crash and rescue was first told in the 1974 book \"\" and more recently in the 2006 book \"\". The school also appeared in the documentary, \"\".\n\nTwelve of the 45 people on board the plane died in the crash, and more died of their injuries later. Another 8 perished in an avalanche. The remaining survivors endured hunger, crash-related injuries, altitude sickness, and temperatures that fell to 30 degrees below zero at night. On their eighth day in the mountains, they heard on the radio that the authorities had stopped searching for them. When their scarce food reserves were gone, they were forced to eat those who had died in the crash.\n\nOn December 12, 3 of the remaining survivors set out to find help, hiking west across the Andes Mountains to reach Chile. After scaling the nearly 17,000-foot Mt. Seler, they realized that the trek for help would take them much longer than they had thought. Therefore, to conserve their limited food supply, one of them returned to the crash site and the other two continued hiking west.\n\nOn 21 December 1972, the ninth day of their journey, they were found by huasos who grazed livestock in the high country, and the next day, the world learned of the 16 survivors who had beaten death for 72 days in the Andes mountains, in part by resorting to cannibalism.\n\n"}

The first edition of Der Roman was published 2005 at A. Francke Verlag (UTB, Tübingen and Basel) in German; in 2011, the second revised and extended German edition followed, as well as the English translation.\n\nA preface precedes the nine thematic chapters; references and an extensive and commented bibliography conclude the book.\n\nThe preface encourages a departure from the purely formal and narrow text analysis by repeatedly asking the question \"What's the difference ?\": What kind of effect would have resulted, if the narrator had described certain people, situations or circumstances in a different way? And why did he or she choose not to do this? Taking this approach, the analysis proceeds from the \"How\" to the \"What\"—and not vice versa. Acknowledgements conclude the preface.\n\nHere, each thematic chapter is described in a short summary without quoting the various literature examples in the text of \"The Novel: An Introduction\".\n\nThe chapter introduces the topic. It discusses the \"beginning\" and the \"meaning\" of a novel, the socio-cultural conventions/rules and the methodology of linking the individual events, which may be used in this narrative form, as well as the interactions of these elements. As a special case the autobiographical novel (it's me, who tells) is treated. Finally, a brief discourse is made on capturing the attention of the novel reader: the very first sentences of the story.\n\nHere, the historical development of the modern European novel is traced. The terms \"fact\" and \"fiction\" are explained, and told fiction, illusion and narrated realism be delineated. The diversity of types of novels is outlined.\n\nThe introduction to novel analysis is given. A summary table illustrates the thematic terms, which are used by various known narratologists (Gérard Genette, Seymour Chatman, Mieke Bal, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Gerald Prince, and Franz Karl Stanzel).\n\nTopics in this chapter are the \"narrative time\", that is, the approximate time required for the reader to read the novel, and the \"telling time\", i.e. the period that is covered by the novel. Their ratio, the \"narrative pace\" (narrative pace = telling time ÷ narrative time) may be changed several times within a novel by the narrator and thus be used to slow down (here it is important, here we remain longer) or to accelerate (lessening of importance) the narration.\n\nFurthermore, the \"order\", the sequence of narrated events - either natural succession or sequence anachronism (prolepsis, i.e. anticipation); analepsis, a flashback) - and the \"frequency\", that is the repeated narration of identical or equivalent events - discussed. Finally, the importance of using different tempi is elaborated.\n\nWith examples, Bode analyzes and documents character design and character development in the novel; \"figure\" means in the broadest sense: a person, a protagonist, a being.\n\nThis chapter — with more than a quarter of the book the longest — two models of narrative theory, the typological model of Franz K. Stanzel (Bode: \"Teutonic Rosette\") and the narrative theory of Gérard Genette (Bode: \"Gallic Taxonomy\"), are explained, compared and commented.\n\nThis chapter covers aspects and interpretations of multi-perspective narration. It discusses the difficulty to objectively recognize \"unreliable narration”, that is, \"If the reader has reasonable grounds to distrust a tale\". It also highlights the problems of the narrators gender and the described figure within the narrative.\n\nHere the challenge is addressed, to recognize symbolism in a novel, meaning \"if something appears particularly striking\". Symbolism does not necessarily mean \"a symbol\". It rather refers to recognizing allegories, metaphors, metonymies, and to \"decode\" them, and to wonder why the narrator has just taken this choice of presentation.\n\n\"Space\" refers to \"semantic spaces\", i. e. locations (nature, cities, rooms, etc.) described in the plot, which do not only stand for what they are but which the narrator used/constructed in parallel to the figure or the situation of the figure.\n\nIn the final chapter, Bode examines forms of presence or absence of experience(s) of the narrator in respect to his/her narration, the sense, orientation, and sense-making experiments in novels, and finally the future of the printed novel in an environment of ever stronger competition from visual media such as TV, cinema (video, DVD) and audio available on the internet.\n\n\"Further Reading\" contains 16 referenced and annotated (by Bode) book titles on subjects of narrative theory/narratology, perspective structure, narrative text analysis and theory of the novel.\n\nThe bibliography contains about 400 references on about 30 pages.\n\nGerman edition\n\nEnglish edition\n\n"}

Rebirth Brass Band snare drummer, Derrick Tabb and Allison Reinhardt developed a plan to establish a youth organization for music that would be citywide with the primary objective being to keep young children off the streets and provide a safe haven during peak times of gun violence - 3pm to 7pm. In 2007, Reinhardt and Tabb co-founded Roots of Music, Inc. and launched a pilot program in May 2008. The Roots of Music Crusader Band debuted in 2009 to wide critical acclaim. The program now services 140 students with a waiting list of approximately 400.\n\nStudents accepted into the Roots of Music after-school program participate in both academic tutoring and are members of the Roots of Music Crusaders Band. They are transported by bus from about 40 schools in Orleans Parish Monday through Thursday to the group's headquarters in the Tremé neighborhood of New Orleans.\n\nFor the first hour and a half of the after-school program, the students receive assistance with homework assignments and academic tutoring in core subjects as needed. The remainder of the time is dedicated to music education, song rehearsal and field practice (marching). Members of the Rebirth Brass Band and other New Orleans area music professionals support the program through mentoring and marching practice.\n\nAfter music education and rehearsal, the students receive a hot, nutritious meal provided by Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana, a member of the Feeding America network of food banks. After the meal, the children are transported via bus to their homes across Orleans Parish.\n\nThere is no after-school program on Fridays, but the group practices on Saturdays, focusing wholly on music education, marching and field routines. The students receive a hot meal after Saturday practice and are transported home via the program's buses.\n\nAside from academic and music education, the organization strives to instill self-discipline, offers mentoring and guidance counseling and has the support of mental health professionals. The program is completely free to the participants and relies on grants and private and corporate donations for sustainability. Roughly 25% of the program's budget is earmarked for transportation services. Lack of transportation was cited as one of the issues plaguing the families of at-risk children in regard to their ability to participate in extra-curricular activities. Roots of Music, Inc. holds a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.\n\nStudents of the Roots of Music after-school program must be between the age of 9 and 14 years old, qualify for free or reduced lunch, and attend a school in Orleans Parish. The participants must also maintain a 2.5 grade point average in all classes, the same requirement as the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS). TOPS pays tuition and some fees for qualifying college students who chose to attend a select group of colleges in Louisiana.\n\nStudents are expected to learn and abide by a code of conduct which emphasizes academic achievement, respect of self and others, self-discipline and self-control.\n\nThe Roots of Music and its co-founder Derrick Tabb have been the subject of numerous news articles. Tabb has been the recipient of several awards based on his work with Roots. In May 2009, Tabb was chosen as one of the 10 2009 CNN Heroes Top Finalist from over 9,000 entries. Derrick was also a recipient of the 2011 Blue Cross Blue Shield Angel Award. \"(see Derrick Tabb: Awards and honors for more comprehensive list)\"\n\nAfter the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans in 2011, The Roots of Music Crusaders performed at an exclusive $1,000-a-plate benefit concert hosted by Brad Pitt benefiting the Make It Right Foundation. The event was attended by Snoop Dogg, Rihanna and Kanye West.\n\nThe band participated in the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (\"JazzFest\") in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn the 2013 Rose Bowl Parade, Roots boasted the youngest drum major in the parade's history, 6 year-old Lawrence Honoré, Jr. Also in 2013, Roots was the recipient of StubHub's Rising Star Award.\n\nIn 2015, Roots performed for President Barack Obama during his visit to New Orleans to commemorate the 10th year since Hurricane Katrina devastated the area. During his speech, he praised the Roots of Music mentoring program. On January 11, 2016, The Roots of Music performed during the pre-inauguration festivities for Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards.\n\nRoots alumnus, Jazz Henry, performed at the Essence Music Festival in 2012 and in JazzFest 2014 with The Original Pinettes Brass Band.\n\nThe Roots of Music Crusaders appear on the title track of the studio album \"¿Which Side Are You On?\" by Ani DiFranco (2012).\n\n\n\n"}

Dee is an American economist and the Barnett Family Professor of Education at Stanford University, where he also directs the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities.\n\nThomas Dee earned a B.A. in economics with a focus on public policy from Swarthmore College in 1990, followed by an M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Maryland in 1994 and 1997. After his graduation, Dee worked as an assistant professor of economics at the Georgia Institute of Technology (1997–99) and later also at Swarthmore College (1999–2005). There, he was promoted in 2005 to the position of associate professor and given the direction of the college's public policy programme. In 2010, Dee moved to the University of Virginia as research professor of education and professor of public policy and economics (2010–12), before further moving to Stanford University as professor of education in 2012. From 2015 to 2018, Dee directed the Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis (CEPA) and served as Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Additionally, Dee is affiliated with a number of institutions, including the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), CESifo, the Danish National Center for Social Research, the American Enterprise Institute, and the China Center for Human Capital and Labor Market Research at Central University of Finance and Economics. Furthermore, he has been affiliated with the Association for Education Finance and Policy and the Institute of Education Sciences. In terms of editorial duties, Dee sits on the editorial boards of the \"Journal of Policy Analysis and Management\" and \"Educational Researcher\" and has sat on the board of \"Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis\" in the past.\n\nThomas Dee's current research interests mostly revolve around education, including the economics of education, the analysis and implementation of educational policy, school finance, school reform, and high-stakes testing. Earlier research has also focused on youth health, e.g. teenage traffic accidents and youth health behaviors such as smoking and drinking. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Thomas Dee belongs to the top 3% of economists as ranked by their research.\n\nThroughout his academic career, Dee has studied many topics related to education and education policy, e.g. competition between private and public schools, returns to education, and teacher incentives. Analysing the relationship between public school quality and the effect of competition from private schools, Dee finds that competition from the latter has a significant positive impact on the graduation rates of neighbouring public high schools. Investigating the existence of returns to education in the form of civic engagement and attitudes, Dee argues that educational attainment strongly increases voter participation, support for freedom of speech and newspaper readership (a measure of civic knowledge). With regard to the effectiveness of teacher incentives, Dee finds mixed evidence. In his evaluation of Tennessee's Career Ladder Evaluation System, which rewarded teachers who increased student achievement, together with Benjamin J. Keys, he finds that the test scores in mathematics of students assigned to career-ladder teachers were 3 percentile points higher than otherwise, but that such an assignment had no significant impact on reading scores. By contrast, his evaluation of IMPACT, the high-powered teacher-evaluation system introduced by Michelle Rhee in Washington D.C., conducted with James Wyckoff finds that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improved the performance of remaining teachers, while financial incentives were effective in further improving the performance of high-performing teachers. Additionally, Dee has pioneered research on the impact of demographic similarity between students and teachers as well as on the impact of No Child Left Behind, the flagship education programme of George W. Bush's administration.\n\nAnalysing the impact on students' school achievement of being taught by a teacher of the same ethnic group in Tennessee, Dee finds that assignment of students to a teacher of their own ethnicity significantly increased both black and white students' achievements in mathematics and reading. Vice versa, Dee has also studied how demographic similarity between students and teachers influences teachers' subjective evaluations of student behavior and performance and found students' racial, ethnic and gender characteristics to substantially colour teachers' perceptions of student performance. However, the former two effects mainly appear in conjunction with students coming from poor family backgrounds or living in the South, which provides a strong argument for the recruitment of teachers from underrepresented minorities. This research is complemented by Dee's study of the impact of being taught by a teacher of the same gender, which he finds to significantly improve the achievements of both male and female students as well as teachers' perceptions of student performance and engagement.\n\nTogether with Brian Jacob, Thomas Dee has extensively researched the impact of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) - and its emphasis on test-based school accountability - on students, teachers, and schools. In particular, Dee and Jacob find that NCLB improved the math achievements of younger students, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, but failed to do so with regard to reading, raised school district expenditure, in particular on teacher compensation, and improved the quality of teachers, and resulted in a shift of teaching time towards math and reading as tested subjects.\n\nThe other main area besides education on which Dee has conducted research is youth health, e.g. teenage smoking and drinking, sexual activity, and traffic accidents. Analysing how teen drinking and youth traffic fatalities respond to beer taxes, Dee finds that - while results vary substantially between U.S. states - beer taxes are generally ineffective in reducing teen drinking and associated traffic fatalities. In another study on teen drinking, Dee finds teen drinking and smoking to be complementary behaviours, with the increase in minimum legal drinking ages (MLDA) from 18 to 21 having reduced the numbers of teen smokers by 3-5% and higher cigarette taxes having lowered the prevalence of teen drinking. However, while teens facing a lower MLDA were substantially more likely to drink, the raise in the MLDA had no significant effect on educational attainment. Further research on the impact of macroeconomic conditions on alcohol abuse by Dee finds binge drinking to be strongly countercyclical, even among those who remain employed during the crisis. Finally, Dee, David Grabowski and Michael Morrisey investigated the impact of the introduction of graduated driver licensing (GDL) on teen traffic fatalities and find that GDL regulations reduced fatalities among 15- to 17-year-olds by at least 5.6% over 1992–2002 and didn't increase fatality risks for older teens once they didn't face GDL restrictions anymore.\n\n"}

{"id": "2842380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2842380", "title": "Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs", "text": "Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs\n\nVoorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs (VWO, meaning \"preparatory scientific education\" in Dutch) is the highest variant in the secondary educational system of the Netherlands, attended by approximately a fifth of all Dutch high school students. After leaving primary or elementary school students are enrolled in different types of secondary schools, according to their academic ability. The course is a six-year course and successful completion allows the candidate admission to Dutch universities. The VWO is therefore a matriculation exam.\n\nThe VWO includes the so-called Gymnasium variant, which differs from the regular VWO variant (also called Atheneum) in that it has Latin and/or Classic Greek as an additional, compulsory part of the curriculum (some schools offer additional courses as well). A few schools offer only the Gymnasium variant, called 'Categoraal Gymnasium'. Of all VWO students, around a quarter follow gymnasium, accounting for approximately 5-6% of all Dutch high school students.\n\nPrior to 2001, students had to choose at least 7 out of roughly 14 (options varied by school) topics on which they would ultimately take the national examinations. Dutch and a modern foreign language most often, but not necessarily English were the two compulsory topics, with five topics open for choice, which students picked according to their ability and interest. Students in the Gymnasium substream had to take at least one classical language (Ancient Greek, Latin). For others, the most commonly chosen topics included English, French, German, physics, biology, mathematics (applied and advanced), chemistry, history and economics (macro and micro). Less common topics were Spanish, Russian, West Frisian, Italian and philosophy.\n\nSince the 2001 'Phase II' reforms of Dutch secondary education, candidates have to specialize in one or more of four 'profiles' at the start of their fourth year of study in the VWO. They contain a fixed set of topics which form a less fragmented study course to offer students a better and more holistic preparation for their university studies.\n\nAn addition to the Phase II is the Technasium program, in both VWOs (Atheneums and Gymnasiums), acting as sort of a fifth profile. It was originally designed to give students a look into the world of technology oriented professions is based around O&O, Research and Design. Students work together in groups on assignments from actual companies and contests as diverse as designing a building, proposing a product involving solar energy or even developing a plan for the gentrification of an area. For the last two years, the school no longer acts as a contact person, and students must approach companies to find an assignment. The course is finished with a \"meesterproef\", literally a proof of mastery in which the students spend 160 hours a person on a project. \n\nIn Phase II, all students are required to participate in the following courses: Dutch, English, mathematics (there are four different courses in mathematics: A/B/C/D), Latin or Ancient Greek/an additional foreign language (Gymnasium students are not required to follow an additional foreign language other than English), PE (in Dutch: 'bewegingsonderwijs of lichamelijk onderwijs'), ANW (General Nature Sciences, only in the fourth/fifth class, depending on the school), CKV (a general form of culture and art education in the Atheneum stream) or KCV (classical cultural education in the Gymnasium stream, similar to CKV, except from the fact that it focuses on the classical aspect) and \"Maatschappijleer\" (only in the fourth class, similar to social sciences). The content of some subjects has also changed: economics has become a total subject, instead of variations between economics 1 or 2, similar to the fact that students no longer have to choose between French 1 or 2 and German 1 or 2 but instead take French and German as whole subjects. On top of these subjects the students have to choose a study profile. The profiles are sets of classes that prepare for future studies. Each profile has a set of fixed and optional classes that can be chosen from.\n\nThe four profiles are:\n\"Students following the first two profiles are required to follow history and in the second profile economics is also required. There are more optional additional courses in the first two profiles than in the last two profiles. The number of optional additional courses varies per school. Additional languages are considered to be part of the first profile, while geography and philosophy can be applied to both profiles.\"\nThe latter two profiles strongly overlap, so that it is possible to technically follow both profiles depending on the student's choice of optional topics. Students following Natuur en Gezondheid can do this by choosing mathematics B and adding physics to their curriculum; students following Natuur en Techniek can do this by adding biology. The main difference between the third and fourth profile is (depending on the school) the possibility to follow economy/geography/philosophy in combination with the N&G profile, or mathematics D/NLT (Nature, Life and Technology) with the N&T profile. It is possible to combine courses, which is quite common.\n\nProfiles can be combined as well, for instance \"Natuur en Techniek\" with additional biology doubles as \"Natuur en Gezondheid\". Therefore, the four profiles are often put into two groups, the M-line for the first two profiles listed and the N-line for the last two listed.\n\nStudents can also choose to do an extra additional course. For instance, a student following \"Natuur en Techniek\" can attend a third foreign language if the school has sufficient facilities to do so or studies it in his spare time and participate only in the mandatory examinations. A student can choose to discontinue that subject, at all times.\n\n"}

With regard to the impact of the Perry Preschool Program, he finds that the net present value of the programme is positive due to increased earnings, reduced social welfare costs, delinquency and crime costs, and childcare costs, and that its benefits to taxpayers increased its cost. 20 years later, Barnett has been able to confirm the maintenance of these effects, confirming that preschooling strongly increased the lifetime earnings and decreased the criminal activity of recipients, yielding enormously positive social and private returns on investment (e.g. benefits to the general public, assuming a 3% discount rate, already amount to $12.90 per dollar invested); the by far largest share of the programme's social gain accrues due to the reduction in male crime rates (with Milagros Nores, Clive R. Belfield and Lawrence Schweinhart). Overall, Barnett and Belfield highlight the potential of increased preschool investments for the improvement of social mobility, though they emphasize that the potential is strongly tied to the quality of preschool programmes, including highly qualified teachers and small group sizes in preschool. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "34509791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34509791", "title": "Writing about Writing", "text": "Writing about Writing\n\nWriting about Writing (WAW), is a method or theory of teaching composition which puts emphasis on reading and writing about writing in the writing course, and reimagines first-year composition as an \"introduction to writing studies.\" This is not to say WAW only teaches a first-year writing course as if it were an introduction to a writing major, but rather it advocates merging the \"how\" of writing with its practice. An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\"\n\nComposition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.\n\nIn 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed. This course sought \"to improve students' understanding of writing, rhetoric, language, and literacy\" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging \"more realistic conceptions of writing.\" The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.\n\nIn the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that \"writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits.\"\n\nThe article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about \"writing studies\", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.\n\nThe authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write \"rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study.\" Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.\n\nAfter its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled \"Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting\nMisconceptions.'\" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being \"that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit.\" She goes on to write, \"Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand.\" Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing \"major\" and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, \"Writing about Writing: A College Reader\", which was published in 2011.\n\nIn \"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\" Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:\n\nWAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article \"Writing about Writing in Basic Writing,\" Shannon Carter explains \"a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves.\" She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.\n\nMany instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled \"Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students,\" Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis—two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, \"Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products.\"\n\nAs WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and \"often in fundamental ways.\" \n\nIn his response to Downs and Wardle's \"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\" Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.\n\nKutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend \"the nuances of the composing process.\" He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, \"While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more.\" \n\nIn their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's \"dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge\", most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their \"research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once.\"\n\nDowns published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out: My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to \"FYC as Intro to Writing Studies\" is about as magnanimous as their response itself – that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories – for me, Schwegler and Shamoon – planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.He writes Miles et al. \"seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner.\" His main contentions are:\nHe concludes by writing \"I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities.\"\n\nA response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be \"lone pioneers\" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference Peter Elbow as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\"\n\nShannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be \"off-putting\" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.\n\nAs previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in \"recruiting\" more students to become majors in the field.\n\nPublished in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as \"encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy.\" \nIn the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a \"smart choice\" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition:\n\nThe book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write? How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings.\n\nBelow are some of the readings included in \"Writing about Writing: A College Reader\":\n\n\nThe book is praised for its accessibility and forward thinking. For instance, David R. Russell from Iowa State University called the book \"a milestone in composition textbooks.\" Russell is known for his work in Writing Across the Curriculum and activity theory.\n\nIts publisher's website describes it by saying \"Throughout the book, friendly explanations and scaffolded questions help students connect to readings and — even more important — develop knowledge about writing they can use at work, in their everyday lives, and in college.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "50634567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50634567", "title": "Yatchy", "text": "Yatchy\n\nYatchy is an online social networking service headquartered in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Its website was launched on July 15, 2015 by Akshat Jain with his college friend and fellow student Diptesh Pandey. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to their friends, relatives and neighbors, but later allowed public to access it. Since 2016, anyone in general aged 12 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of the website, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. Its name comes from the yacht, meaning a boat or small ship, usually with sails, often with an engine, built and used for racing or cruising.\n\nAfter registering to use the site, users can create a user profile, add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos, use various web apps, receive notifications when others update their profiles, sell & buy stuffs online from different sellers using Souk e-commerce platform, listen and upload music, create & conduct polls and quizzes, create & participate in forums. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into different lists. Also, users can complain or block unpleasant people.\n\nAkshat wrote a program called skycloud on August 2, 2011 while attending Sunbeam English School, Laharatara, as a computer science project. The software written was comparable to a basic web based Operating System which had its own set of pre-defined instructions, had its own software architecture and used \"various internet programming languages and scripts such as HTML, VBScript, CSS, XML\" for third party software support.\n\nThe site was quickly forwarded to several members of the school. Akshat expanded on this initial project by creating a tool ahead of graduation 1st year exams that allowed users to buy stuffs directly from sellers and users could keep a track of their shopping by logging into their accounts.\n\nThe following year, Akshat began writing code for a new website in April 2014. He said that he was inspired by biopics on Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. On July 15, 2015, Akshat launched \"Yatchy\", located at yatchy.com.\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Yatchy was opened to everyone at least 12 years old with a valid email address.\n\nYatchy user base was roughly 80% male and 20% female as of May 2016. Early adopters of Yatchy were mostly male (81%), and the dominant age bracket (67%) was between 18 and 40.\n\nA Yatchy User profile is a public visible account of a user. It includes basic social networking services like a profile photo, about section, background photo, cover photo, interests, places lived and an area to post status updates. It also includes several identity service sections, such as a contributor and other profiles area that let one link their \"properties across the web\". These sections optionally link to other social media accounts one has, any blogs one owns or have written or sites one is a contributor to. Customized or Vanity URLs were made available to the public.\n\nMembers registered on Yatchy are called Yatchyans. A user can see all the registered members at one place under the Yatchyans menu.\n\nYatchy has a powerful built-in search tool used to search contents across all the Yatchy services. A user can search for other members, apps, music and various contents across the site. The search tool is enough powerful to give a tailor-based search results based on the various metrics to the user.\n\nA user can refine his search results based on the area, pincode, habits, Date of Birth, activities of other users.\n\nYatchy is a highly customizable site. User can personalise entire site according to his needs. User can arrange different sections of the site according to his/her comfort, can choose what elements to be displayed to him and others. This has been made possible to re-arrangeable blocks system that Yatchy uses for the entire website. The entire website can be understood to be composed of blocks which are dynamic in nature.\n\nThe User Interface (UI) of yatchy is called \"\"feora ui\". Feora is a modern, scalable, dynamic, card stack system which displays contents in the form of cards which is comparatively easy to understand, less resource hungry & complicated and consumes lesser data while getting rendered at the client's device.\n\nFeora UI is able to adjust itself according to screen dimensions to display contents to the user.\n\nThe beauty of yatchy ecosystem is the support for 3rd-party apps or applications. Apps supported by yatchy are basically web and cloud apps which rely on powerful computers called servers to render content. The app support for yatchy was developed by Diptesh Pandey, the co-founder of Yatchy. Diptesh developed the 3rd-party apps support system for yatchy.\n\nWhen the co-founders of yatchy were developing it, one of the main objectives was to provide users the ability not to express their likeliness about a particular subject but also to provide the ability to show their dislikeness for that subject. Therefore, yatchy has a dislike button along with the like button so that users can properly express their views to the world.\n\nYatchy enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile. The website is free to its users. Yatchy requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings. Yatchy is committed to user privacy and doesn't share its users information with anyone.\n\nYatchy is both a consumer of and contributor to free and open-source software.\n\nThe website's primary color is red and blue. The shade of red used by the website is somewhat magenta red and the shade of blue used is similar to the color of horizon. Yatchy calls them as Apple Red and Sky Blue. The colors were chosen by the co-founders after trying out various other colors and combinations. The final combination was chosen after trying out 2000+ different color shades and combination. Yatchy is built in PHP and JavaScript. Other languages and technologies include CSS, Java, XML, C, C++, C#, HTML, Python, MySQL, Ruby On Rails.\n\nYatchy is developed as one monolithic application. According to Akshat, Yatchy is divided into several small files which is then distributed to the servers using FileZilla FTP Client and several other FTP Clients.\n\nYatchy uses a combination platform based on PHP and Apache to store data across servers. Using a software, new events are stored in log files. Yatchy handles requests as AJAX behavior.\n\nYatchy uses the \"Mail\"\" method to deliver the emails it sends to its users every day.\n\n"}
