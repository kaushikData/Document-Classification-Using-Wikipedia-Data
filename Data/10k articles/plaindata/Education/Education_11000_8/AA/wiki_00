The course materials were originally developed by Deryck Calderwood. Although made available to other organizations, the materials were primarily used in courses taught to youth ages 12–14 (in mixed-gender groups) in Unitarian Universalist congregations.\n\nAYS covered many topics including anatomy, gender identity, relationships, sexual intercourse and intimacy; as well as covering sexually transmitted diseases and birth control. AYS was based on the assumption that sexuality is a natural and healthy part of being a human. It considered the wide range of sexual feelings and behaviors as normal. AYS was unique among sex education courses because it used visual materials that depicted human sexuality in a realistic and graphic fashion. For example, film strips used in the course showed images of real heterosexual and homosexual encounters, and masturbation. These images did not try to hide the genitals or the details of penetration. One of the more controversial slide shows showed a man masturbating. The slides concluded with images of the man ejaculating into his navel and then tasting his own semen. Other media used in the course of AYS included audio tapes of interviews with transgender, homosexual, and heterosexual men and women speaking about their sexuality.\n\nAYS was considered very controversial both at the time of its inception and in the mid-1990s when it was replaced by Our Whole Lives. It was also featured in the book \"Harmful to Minors\" by Judith Levine as an example of complete sexual education.\n\n"}
{"id": "7341926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7341926", "title": "Academic grading in Germany", "text": "Academic grading in Germany\n\nGermany uses a 6-point grading scale (GPA) to evaluate the performance of school children. Grades vary from 1 (excellent, \"sehr gut\") to 6 (insufficient, \"ungenügend\"). In the final classes of German Gymnasium schools that prepare for university studies, a point system is used with 15 points being the best grade and 0 points the worst. The percentage causes the grade can vary from teacher to teacher.\n\nIn primary and lower secondary education (1st to 10th grade), German school children receive grades based on a 6-point grading scale ranging from 1 (excellent, \"sehr gut\") to 6 (insufficient, \"ungenügend\"). Variations on the traditional six grade system allow for awarding grades suffixed with \"+\" and \"-\".\n\nTo calculate averages of suffixed grades, they are assigned fractional values, where 1 is 1.0, 1- is 1.3, 2+ is 1.7, 2 is 2.0, 2- is 2.3 and so on. As schools are governed by the states, not by the federal government, there are slight differences. Often a more granular scale of \"1-\" (equal to 1.25), \"1-2\" (= 1.5), \"2+\" (= 1.75), etc. is used; sometimes even decimal grading (1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and so on) is applied.\n\nIn end-of-year report cards, only unmodified integer grades may be used; in some regions they are written in text form.\n\nTeachers who teach Grundschule (primary school) or Sonderschule (special education school) are allowed to use \"pädagogische Noten\" (\"pedagogic grades\"). Thus if a student tries very hard, but still does very poorly compared to the rest of the class, the teachers are allowed to give them good grades because they tried so hard.\n\nIn the final classes of Gymnasium schools (11th to 12th/13th grade) the grades are converted to numbers (\"points\"), where \"1+\" equals 15 points and \"6\" equals 0 points. Since 1+ exists in this system, theoretically a final Abitur grade of less than 0.6 is possible and such grades are used in an informal setting, although officially any student with less than 1.0 will be awarded a 1.0 Abitur. When the point system is used, a grade of 4 (5 points) is the lowest passing grade, and 4- (4 points) the highest failing grade.\nIn German universities (except for law schools) a 1 to 5 scale is used:\n\nFor law students at German universities, a similar system to the 1 to 5 scale is used that comprises one more grade that is inserted between 2 (\"gut\") and 3 (\"befriedigend\"), named \"vollbefriedigend\". This is because the grades 2 (\"gut\") and 1 (\"sehr gut\") are extremely rare, so an additional grade was created below \"gut\" to increase differentiation. Every grade is converted into points similarly to the \"Gymnasium\" system described above, starting at 18 points (excellent) down to 0 points (poor). 4 points is the lowest pass grade.\n\nA matter of particular interest for those considering studying abroad or even enrolling full-time in a German university is the conversion of grades. While the below information may prove useful, it is recommended to contact the interested university directly to inquire which method they use to convert grades.\n\nA number of systems exist for the conversion of grades from other countries into German grades. One such system, used by most universities in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, is called the \"Modified Bavarian Formula\":\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 = German grade, formula_3 = best possible score in foreign country's grading system, formula_4 = lowest passing score in foreign grading system and formula_5 = obtained foreign grade (to be converted into German grade). The resulting value is rounded to the next German grade (e.g. 1.6 is rounded to the German grade 1.7 and 2.4 is rounded to 2.3). For resulting values between two German grades, the score is rounded to the better grade (e.g. 2.5 is rounded to the German grade 2.3 and 1.15 is rounded to 1.0).\n\nSometimes, esp. with a Dr. Phil. (D.Phil. / Ph.D.) the Latin versions are used for the grading. In this case the grade (Note/Zensur) is called \"Prädikat\". The following rough guide may be used to convert into standard German grades:\n\n\nThere is no fail grade; in that case the dissertation is \"formally rejected\" without a grade.\n\nIn former East Germany, a 5-point grading scale was used until July 1991:\n\nWith the polytechnic reform of the school system initiated by the \"Act on Socialistic Development of the School System in the German Democratic Republic\" the Ministry of People's Education wanted to adapt academic grading for all institutions in its jurisdiction, which were general educational schools, vocational schools and professional schools for the qualification of lower classes teachers, educators and kindergartners. Therefore, a reorganized grading scale was enacted in \"Directive on the introduction of a unified grading scale for secondary schools, extended secondary schools, special schools, vocational schools, institutes of vocational masters' education, institutes of vocational school teachers' education, institutes of vocational teachers' further education, institutes of teachers' education and pedagogic institutes\". This directive was unchangedly effective from September 1, 1960, to August 25, 1993.\n\nFor all of the different subjects there were further recommendations with even more specific descriptions in relation to the general grading scale. These particular comments should help the teacher to grade the achievements of the students as objectively as possible.\n\nThis scale is identical to the current Austrian grading scale.\n\nAt public schools in Germany, teachers are supposed to evaluate students against fixed course-specific criteria, but often feel implicit pressure to grade students on a curve where grades are awarded based on performance relative to all other individuals rather than performance relative to the difficulty of a specific course.\n\nSpecifically, in the 2008 case of Sabine Czerny, a Bavarian primary school teacher, Czerny thought that 91% of the class would be able to make a successful transition into a Realschule or a Gymnasium (high schools for which normally only circa 50% of Bavarian children qualify based on their educational achievements). While the parents liked this result, the educational authorities questioned Czerny's grading standards. Czerny claims that her students' results stood up in cross-classroom tests; nonetheless she was transferred to another school. Czerny received much public sympathy and later went on to write a book about her experiences.\n\nGerman Gymnasiums are schools which aim to prepare students for college education. These schools are selective, and tough grading is a traditional element of the teaching. The culture of these works against students of average academic ability who barely qualify for a Gymnasium place, and who may then find themselves on the bottom of their class; these same students would have achieved better grades for the same effort if they had attended a non-selective comprehensive school (Gesamtschule).\n\nA study revealed that a sample of Gymnasium high school seniors of average mathematical ability who chose to attend advanced college-preparatory math classes at their school (\"Leistungskurs\") found themselves in the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of 5 (i.e. failed the class). Comprehensive school students of equal mathematical ability found themselves in the upper half of the equivalent course in their school and obtained an average grade of 3+. It was found that students who graduated from a Gesamtschule tend to do worse in college than their grades in high school classes would predict - and vice versa for Gymnasium students.\n\nOften the German grades are treated like an interval scale to calculate means and deviations for comparisons. Despite the fact that it lacks any psychometric standardization, the grading system is often compared to normally distributed norm-referenced assessments. Using an expected value of 3 and a standard deviation of 1, transformations into other statistical measures like Percentiles, T, Stanine etc. or (like in the PISA studies) an IQ scale are then possible.\n\nThis transformation is problematic both for high school grades and for university grades:\n\nAt high school level, schooling in most of Germany is selective — thus for instance a Gymnasium student who is underperforming compared to his classmates is likely to still be close to or above average when compared to his entire age group.\n\nAt university level, the distribution is highly non-normal and idiosyncratic to the subject. Substantially more German students fail exams in university than in other countries (usually about 20-40%, often even more). Grades awarded vary widely between fields of study and between universities. (In law degrees, for instance, only 10-15% of candidates get a grade better than \"befriedigend\".)\n\nThis might be one reason for the low graduation rates at university in international comparisons, as well as for the small number of people who obtain an \"Abitur\" in the first place. However, several empirical psychological studies show that the grades awarded in Germany at school and university have a high reliability when taking up higher education and research jobs. The universities usually demand high grades in Diploma Thesis or a Master Thesis. Thesis grades are by far the most critical factor while applying for job or higher education e.g. PhDs. One study from 1995 found that GPAs from school are a mild (weak) predictor for success in university and to a slightly better degree for success in vocational trainings, and that GPAs from school or university have nearly no predictive value for job performance. Nevertheless, due to rarity of psychometric testing (like Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and the like in the US) the GPA is usually used as the most predictive criterion available within an application process. For job recruiting, school/university grades have a high impact on career opportunities, as independent scientifically based recruitment and assessment is used by less than 8% of the German employers (50-70% in other European countries ).\n"}

Gottfried was awarded the Social Responsibility Award from the Western Psychological Association in 2011 \"based on her research in the field of intrinsic motivation that has contributed to enhancing knowledge about children’s motivational development and educational attainment.\" Her co-authored article titled \"A longitudinal study of academic intrinsic motivation in intellectually gifted children: Childhood through adolescence\" was awarded the MENSA International Limited Award for Excellence in Research in 1997. \n\nGottfried completed a B.A. in Educational Psychology and Counseling from Queens College in 1967. She then completed a M.A. at the University of Chicago in 1968. Later Gottfried attended the Graduate School of the City University of New York where she obtained her Ph.D in Educational / Developmental Psychology in 1975. Gottried is married to her research collaborator, Allen W. Gottfried, and has two children.\n\nGottfried is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (Divisions 7, 9, and 15), the Association for Psychological Science, and the Western Psychological Association. She was an Inaugural Fellow of the American Educational Research Association. She has served on the editorial boards of various scientific journals including Child Development.\n\nGottfried is the author of numerous publications pertaining to academic intrinsic motivation, relationships between the home environment, maternal and dual-earner employment status, and children's development, and giftedness. Her co-edited book, \"Academic motivation and the culture of the school in childhood and adolescence\", draws connections between academic motivation and achievement, social relationships, and school culture. In one of her longitudinal studies, Gottfried and colleagues analyzed pathways between math intrinsic motivation and performance in math courses in youth of ages of 9 to 17 years. The study identified links between children's math achievement and motivation, with both declining over the high school years.\n\nGottfried is the co-author, with Allen W. Gottfried and others, of the volume \"Gifted IQ: Early Developmental Aspects - The Fullerton Longitudinal Study\", which summarizes findings of the Fullerton Longitudinal Study that aimed to trace the development of giftedness before identification or labeling of children as gifted. Since 1970, the Fullerton Longitudinal Study has followed the development of over 100 individuals through measures of academic performance, personality traits, home and family environment, and giftedness. One of their co-authored papers on the Fullerton Longitudinal Study reported findings from twelve assessments of intellectual performance taken over a sixteen-year interval. The study aimed to establish the stability of intelligence over four developmental stages: infancy, preschool, childhood, and adolescence. Using latent variable modeling, the authors found a high degree of stability in intelligence from infancy through adolescence, even though there were weaker correlations between IQ scores when measures were taken at longer intervals. That is, the IQ scores at later time-points tended to be less correlated with scores at earlier time-points as the interval between assessment waves increased. \n\nAdele and Allen Gottfried also co-edited the book \"Maternal Employment and Children’s Development\" published in 1988\".\" This book addressed concerns about the growing numbers of women with young children who were entering the workforce. Their main finding was that the children of working mothers did not appear to suffer as a consequence of their mother's employment status.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "145663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145663", "title": "Bowling for Columbine", "text": "Bowling for Columbine\n\nBowling for Columbine is a 2002 American documentary film written, produced, directed, and narrated by Michael Moore. The film explores what Moore suggests are the primary causes for the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 and other acts of violence with guns. Moore focuses on the background and environment in which the massacre took place and some common public opinions and assumptions about related issues. The film also looks into the nature of violence in the United States.\n\nA critical and commercial success, the film brought Moore international attention as a rising filmmaker and won numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, a special \"55th Anniversary Prize\" at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, and the César Award for Best Foreign Film. The film is considered one of the greatest documentary films of all time.\n\nIn Moore's discussions with various people—including \"South Park\" co-creator Matt Stone, the National Rifle Association's then-president Charlton Heston, and musician Marilyn Manson—he seeks to explain why the Columbine massacre occurred and why the United States' violent crime rate (especially concerning crimes committed with firearms) is substantially higher than those of other nations. \n\nThe film's title refers to the story that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold—the two students responsible for the Columbine High School massacre—attended a school bowling class at 6:00 AM on the day they committed the attacks at school, which started at 11:17 AM. Later investigations showed that this was based on mistaken recollections, and Glenn Moore of the Golden Police Department concluded that they were absent from school on the day of the attack.\n\nMoore incorporates the concept of bowling into the film in other ways as well. For example, the Michigan Militia use bowling pins for their target practice. When interviewing former classmates of the two boys, Moore notes that the students took a bowling class in place of physical education. He suggests that this might have very little educational value and the girls he interviews generally agree, noting how Harris and Klebold led introverted lifestyles and careless attitudes towards the game, and that nobody thought twice about it. Moore questions whether the school system is responding to the real needs of students or if they are reinforcing fear. Moore also interviews two young residents of Oscoda, Michigan. Moore suggests a culture of fear created by the government and the media leads Americans to arm themselves, to the advantage of gun-making companies. Moore suggests that bowling could have been just as responsible for the attacks on the school as Marilyn Manson, or even President Bill Clinton, who launched bombing attacks on Serbia at the time.\n\nAn early scene depicts a bank in Michigan that gives customers a free hunting rifle when they make a deposit of a certain size into a time deposit account. The film follows Moore as he goes to the bank, makes his deposit, fills out the forms, and awaits the result of a background check before walking out of the bank carrying a brand new Weatherby hunting rifle. Just before leaving the bank, Moore asks: \"Do you think it's a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?\"\n\nIn Michael Wilson's documentary \"Michael Moore Hates America\", bank employees from the branch at which Moore is handed a free hunting rifle assert that they were misled during filming of the segment. They say that the bank's policy was to conduct background checks on rifle recipients and mail the rifles to a licensed gun dealer, but Moore's agents, under the pretext of \"doing a story on unique businesses across America\", convinced bank employees to have his rifle presented to him on camera the morning after filming his account opening. Further, they counter that contrary to the film's supposition that the bank kept hundreds of guns on their premises, the gun which was handed to Michael Moore in the film was shipped overnight from a vault in a branch 300 miles away. Moore denied that this sequence was staged but acknowledged the timing of events was compressed for production reasons. He reminded his readers that North Country Bank is a licensed firearms dealer and, in addition to its ATF license number, he produced out-takes where bank employee Jan Jacobson confirms on camera that rifles are secured locally on bank premises.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the film, the Beatles song \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" plays during a montage in which footage of the following is shown:\n\n\nEarly in the film, Moore links the violent behavior of the Columbine shooters to the presence of a large defense establishment manufacturing rocket technology in Littleton. It is implied that the presence of this facility within the community, and the acceptance of institutionalized violence as a solution to conflict, contributed to the mindset that led to the massacre.\n\nMoore conducts an interview with Evan McCollum, Director of Communications at a Lockheed Martin plant near Columbine, and asks him:\n\nMcCollum responds:\n\nAfter the release of the film, Lockheed Martin spokesperson Evan McCollum clarified that the plant no longer produces missiles (the plant manufactured parts for intercontinental ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead in the mid-1980s), but rockets used for launching satellites:\n\nErik Möller argues that Moore's question was not limited to the Littleton-area Lockheed Martin facility:\n\nThe film cuts to a montage of American foreign policy decisions, with the intent to counter McCollum's statement by citing examples of how the United States has frequently been the aggressor nation. This montage is set to the song \"What a Wonderful World\", performed by Louis Armstrong.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the onscreen text in the \"Wonderful World\" segment:\n\n\nThe montage ends with handheld-camera footage of United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the audio consisting solely of the emotional reactions of the witnesses, recorded by the camera's microphone. On the website accompanying the film, Moore provides additional background information for this section.\n\nMoore contrasts his portrayal of the U.S. attitude toward guns and violence with the attitude prevailing in areas of Canada where gun ownership is at similar levels to the U.S. He illustrates his thesis by visiting neighborhoods in Canada near the Canada–U.S. border, where he finds front doors unlocked and much less concern over crime and security. In regards to the film, Farber states \"Moore's thesis, which he later elaborated in \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", is that the fear-mongering that permeates American society contributes to our epidemic of gun violence\". We are also shown news stories being covered in Canada and how they don't follow the \"if it bleeds it leads\" mentality. This adds to Moore's argument that the media is driving America's fear as well as their need for protection. The cartoon \"A Brief History of the United States of America\" encompasses Moore's view of where the fear in America started and how it's progressed and changed over the years.\n\nIn this section, there is a montage of several social pundits stating possible causes for gun violence. Many claim links with violence in television, cinema, and computer games; towards the end of the montage, however, the same people all change their claims to Marilyn Manson's responsibility. Following this is an interview between Moore and Marilyn Manson. Manson shares his views about the United States' climate with Moore, stating that he believes U.S. society is based on \"fear and consumption\", citing Colgate commercials that promise \"if you have bad breath, [people] are not going to talk to you\" and other commercials containing fear-based messages. Manson also mentions that the media, under heavy government influence, had asserted that his influence on the acts of Klebold and Harris was far greater than that of President Clinton, who ordered more bombings on Kosovo on April 20, 1999, than any other day during the Balkans campaign. When Moore asks Manson what he would say to the students at Columbine, Manson replies, \"I wouldn't say a single word to them; I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.\"\n\n\"South Park\" co-creator Matt Stone—who grew up in Littleton—agreed to talk with Moore about his hometown and the shooting in the film. Although he did not feel that Moore mischaracterized him or his statements in the film, he harbored ill feelings about the cartoon \"A Brief History of the United States of America\". Both Stone and his fellow \"South Park\" creator Trey Parker felt that the cartoon was done in a style very similar to theirs. Also, its proximity to Stone's interview may have led some viewers to believe, incorrectly, that they created the cartoon. \"It was a good lesson in what Michael Moore does in films. He doesn't necessarily say explicitly this is what it is, but he creates meaning where there is none by cutting things together,\" Stone remarked in a later interview. As a humorous retort to this, Stone and Parker portrayed Moore as \"a gibbering, overweight, hot-dog-eating buffoon\" who ultimately commits a suicide bombing against the protagonists in their 2004 film, \"\".\n\nMoore follows up by exploring popular explanations as to why gun violence is so high in the United States. He examines Marilyn Manson as a cause, but states that more German citizens listen to Marilyn Manson (per capita) and that the country has a larger Goth population than the United States, with less gun violence (Germany: 381 incidents per year). He examines violent movies, but notes that other countries have the same violent movies, showing \"The Matrix\" with French subtitles (France: 255 incidents per year). He also examines video games, but observes that many violent video games come from Japan (Japan: 39 incidents per year). He concludes his comparisons by considering the suggestion that the United States' violent history is the cause, but notes the similarly violent histories of Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom (68 incidents per year). Moore ends this segment with gun-related-deaths-per-year statistics of the following countries:\n\n\n\"The American Prospect\" published a piece by Garance Franke-Ruta criticizing the film for ignoring the role that municipal governance plays in crime in the United States, and ignoring African-American urban victims of violence while focusing on the unusual events of Columbine. \"A decline in murders in New York City alone—from 1,927 in 1993 to 643 in 2001—had, for example, a considerable impact on the declining national rate. Not a lot of those killers or victims were the sort of sports-hunters or militiamen Moore goes out of his way to interview and make fun of.\"\n\nMoore takes two Columbine victims, Mark Taylor and Richard Castaldo (along with Brooks Brown, who remains unidentified during the segment), to the headquarters of American superstore Kmart in Troy, Michigan, to claim a refund on the bullets still lodged in their bodies. After a number of attempts to evade the issue, a Kmart spokesperson says that the firm will change its policy and phase out the sale of handgun ammunition; this comes after Moore and the victims go to the nearest Kmart store in Sterling Heights, Michigan, purchase all of their ammunition, and return the next day with several members of the media. \"We've won,\" says Moore, in disbelief. \"That was more than we asked for.\"\n\nFor the final scene of the film, Moore visits Charlton Heston's home and asks to speak to him via the speakerbox in front of his gated home. Heston declines to speak to him at the time, but agrees to look at his schedule for the next day. Moore returns and first shows his NRA card, which Heston expresses pleasure at. They go inside the large property and sit down to discuss American firearm violence. Heston's response includes the suggestions that the United States has a \"history of violence\" and more \"mixed ethnicity\" than other countries. He also states that he doesn't believe that the United States is anymore violent than other countries. Moore then asks Heston if he would like to apologize for leading NRA rallies in Flint, Michigan (Moore's hometown) after the shooting death of a six-year-old girl at Buell Elementary School and in Littleton after the Columbine shooting. Heston claims he didn't know about Kayla's death or how soon the rally was after it. When Moore presses to know if he would have cancelled the rally, he declines to answer and walks out of the interview. Moore implores him not to leave and asks him to look at a picture of Kayla. Heston turns around, but then turns back to continue his exit. Upon his exit, Moore leaves Kayla's picture outside the home. Moore was later criticized by some for his perceived \"ambush\" of the actor.\n\nThe film is dedicated to the memory of three people who all died in gun related circumstances:\n\n\nReviews for the film were overwhelmingly positive, with a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, was \"Certified Fresh\".Another score aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating in the 0–100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated a score of 72 based on 32 reviews, signifying 'generally favorable reviews'. Michael Wilmington of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote, \"It's unnerving, stimulating, likely to provoke anger and sorrow on both political sides—and, above all, it's extremely funny.\" A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"The slippery logic, tendentious grandstanding, and outright demagoguery on display in \"Bowling for Columbine\" should be enough to give pause to its most ardent partisans, while its disquieting insights into the culture of violence in America should occasion sober reflection from those who would prefer to stop their ears.\"\n\nHowever, the film had its negative reviews. Desson Thomson of \"The Washington Post\" thought that the film lacked a coherent message, asking \"A lot of this is amusing and somehow telling. But what does it all add up to?\"\n\nThe film was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, which means that children under the age 17 were not admitted to see the film theatrically unless under supervision. Film critic Roger Ebert chastized the MPAA for this move as \"banning teenagers from those films they most need to see\". Ebert had criticized the MPAA rating system on previous occasions. The film was noted for \"some violent images and language\".\n\nWith a budget of $4 million, \"Bowling for Columbine\" grossed $58,008,423 worldwide, including $21,576,018 in the United States. The documentary also broke box office records internationally, becoming the highest-grossing documentary in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Austria. These records were later eclipsed by Moore's next documentary, \"Fahrenheit 9/11\".\n\n\nDuring the screening at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival the film received a 13-minute standing ovation. It also won \"Most Popular International Film\" at the 2002 Vancouver International Film Festival.\n\nMoore was both applauded and booed at the Academy Awards on March 23, 2003, when he used his acceptance speech as an opportunity to proclaim his opposition to the presidency of George W. Bush and the United States-led invasion of Iraq, which had begun just a few days earlier.\n\nThe film was nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. In 2005, it was voted the third most popular film in the British Channel 4 program \"The 50 Greatest Documentaries\" of all time.\n\n\"Bowling for Columbine\" was released on VHS and DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 2003. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in a digital restoration with supplementary features by the Criterion Collection in June 2018.\n\n"}

In August 2012, ClassDojo announced it had raised $1.6 million of main seed capital from Paul Graham, SV Angel, SoftTech VC, Mitch Kapor, Lerer Ventures, and General Catalyst Partners.\n\nIn February 2013, ClassDojo released its first app for the Android operating system. That same year, the company raised $8.5 million in a series A round of funding, and began offering the platform in native languages other than English. In 2014, ClassDojo added a messaging function to its platform, allowing teachers to communicate with parents as a group or directly. ClassDojo added Class Story, a digital content stream created by class teachers and accessible by parents in August 2015. In late 2015, the company raised $21 million in a series B round of funding led by General Catalyst Partners.\n\nIn January 2016, ClassDojo partnered with Stanford University's Project for Education Research That Scales (PERTS) lab, to release a five-part series of educational videos discussing growth mindset. In September 2016, it was reported that the series had been viewed by one of every four kids in American classrooms. That same year, the platform added School Story, the update enables school administration and teachers to share school-related content to all parents connected to the school, and Student Stories, a tool for students to manage their unique portfolios, interact with classmates and share their experiences with their parents. In October 2016, ClassDojo released a video series about empathy that it created in partnership with the Making Caring Common Project at Harvard Graduate School of Education. In May 2017, the company, in partnership with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, released a mindfulness curriculum.\n\nThe platform allows students, teachers and parents to connect, support and develop student skills. To use the classroom communication program, teachers register to obtain a free account, and then create \"classes\" with their students. Students use the program initially with an access code; after creating an account, the students can customize avatars, see classes and see individual progress. Parents can also access ClassDojo when they are invited by the teachers, and can visualize the progress of the child and the information shared by the teachers. Teachers can reward students with positive feedback in real time when they show good exertion in a task or activity in class. Teachers are also able to communicate directly with parents through the platform.\n\nThe program is customizable, and the teachers can change the skills for which the students obtain feedback to adapt to the needs of the class or of the school. ClassDojo is available as a web application that can be used in any device with a web browser, and also with native applications for iPhone (iOS) and Android. The company plans to keep the main platform free for teachers. The founders say that it is because they want teachers, students and parents in all types of schools to use ClassDojo to encourage learning, skill development, and character-building.\n\nClassDojo is available as a web application that can be used on any device with a web browser, and also as a native application for iPhone and Android, with a website in HTML 5.2. The program can be viewed on any mobile device including Android, iOS, and other phones and tablets.\n\nIn 2011, ClassDojo received the Today Show's Education Innovation Award. The founders of the company were included on the \"Forbes\" \"30 Under 30: Education\" list in 2012. In 2013, \"Forbes\" recognized ClassDojo as one of the \"100 Most Promising Companies of the United States\". That same year, \"Fast Company\" included the company on its \"10 Most Innovative Education Companies in the World\" list. ClassDojo was awarded TechCrunch's Crunchie award for Best Education Startup and its founders were included on \"Inc.'s\" \"30 Under 30\" list in 2015. In 2016, \"Fast Company\" recognized the ClassDojo app as one of \"The 35 Most Innovative Apps of the Year\". In 2017, \"Inc.\" named ClassDojo one of the \"25 Most Disruptive Companies\" of the year.\n\nIn 2017, The London School of Economics, Parenting for a Digital Future , published a series of ethical, legal and mental health concerns related to the rapid growth of ClassDojo's use in the classroom. In the article, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Stirling, Ben Williamson and Alasdair Rutherford, write about the possible conflict that the ClassDojo Company could encounter as a private for-profit company collecting and storing sensitive student behavior data. They ask if parents are being fully informed about what the ClassDojo Company intends to do with the collected student data. Likewise, Williamson and Rutherford warn of a scenario where the ClassDojo Company could be sold for the data it collects and stores.\n\nWilliamson and Rutherford also explore the possible negative impact ClassDojo could impose on the classroom environment where they claim ClassDojo essentially acts as a classroom social media application where students face constant competition for teacher awarded ClassDojo behavior points. They question whether the classroom time teachers spend on data input could potentially reduce critical face-to-face interaction between teachers and students. They also warn of the possible negative impact the application can have on children's mental health potentially creating a distressed classroom climate where student behavior is individualized to dojo points discounting larger social and environmental influences on behavior.\n\nWilliamson and Rutherford write that they believe when considering the serious concerns of student data protection and mental health, it is time for teachers and parents to have a transparent conversation regarding use of ClassDojo in the classroom.\n"}

She was a specialist in medieval English literature and history, Arabic literature and language and of the author Herman Melville.\n\nIn addition she was a Zionist who played an important role in the foundation of the modern State of Israel.\n\nDorothee Metlitzki received a BA and two MA degrees from the University of London, one in medieval English and one in classical Arabic. After helping found Hebrew University in Jerusalem's department of English she moved to the US to attend Yale University, graduating with a PhD in 1954.\n\nShe then took a position at the University of California, Berkeley's English department as lecturer and later, in 1964, as an associate professor, the department's second woman to ever be tenured. This was followed, in 1966, by teaching for 36 years at Yale University and also becoming the second woman to ever be tenured by that University's department of English as well.\n\nShe published several academic books dealing with her interests including \"Celestial Origin of Elpheta and Algarsyf in Chaucer's \"Squire's Tale,\"\" \"Melville's \"Orienda\"\" and \"The Matter of Araby in Medieval England\".\n\nDorothee Metlitzki was born in 1914 in the city of Königsberg, (East Prussia) but soon moved to Yekaterinburg, Russia, where her father worked as an international banker who is still waiting to be repaid by the king of Denmark.\nHer father was imprisoned during the Russian Revolution and her mother moved the rest of the family to Lithuania, where her father rejoined them after his stay in prison.\n\nHaving left Lithuania for London following outbreaks of anti-semitism, Metlitzki became an active Zionist in England, working with fellow Zionists Aubrey Eban, Golda Meir and Moshe Sharet on the development of the State of Israel. She moved to Jerusalem after World War II and spent 15 years there founding the English department at Hebrew University.\n\nIn 1943 she married the Arabist Paul Kraus who had come with his baby daughter from Cairo, after his wife's death at birth. Kraus left back to the University of Cairo alone, as Dorothee was ill at a Jerusalem hospital. Within several months Kraus was found dead, alleged to have committed suicide. She remarried the Jewish Egyptologist Bernhard Grdseloff in 1945, and the couple had a daughter, Ruth. In 1947 Grdseloff developed cancer, and was hospitalized in Cairo, before the family was able to leave for Palestine, towards the establishment of the State of Israel. Dorothee spent the next years traveling between Israel and Egypt - then enemy states, and tending to her husband, till his death in a Cairo hospital in 1950.\n\nIn 1953, she moved to Connecticut with her sole daughter, and worked at Yale University. There she had a short marriage with the Assyrologist Jacob Finkelstein, moving after him to Berkeley, California, but the two quickly parted, and she returned to Yale where she taught until her death.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Before the establishment of the state of Israel, Metlitzki worked for advancing the Zionist movement, visiting various countries and speaking before Zionist women.\n\nDuring the term of Golda Meir as Prime Minister of Israel, Metlitzki worked in the government there as a press officer for the Foreign Ministry and secretary for the affairs of Arab women in the Israeli Federation of Labor. Using her knowledge of the Arabic language and culture, she served the Arab women, protecting their rights, with the vision of a bi-lingual bi-cultural state.\n\n"}

This has resulted in an improvement in the adult literacy rate (age 15 and above). Based on the 2005 census, the literacy rate was recorded at 72.7%.\n\nDocumentation of events before 1990.\n\nThe academic year is 33 weeks across all levels and is conducted in two semesters each consisting of 16–17 weeks.\n\nThe table below breaks down the ages of the students in the pre-primary, primary and secondary levels in the Laos education system. \n\nThere are kindergartens that cater to children from 3 to 5 years old. However, attendance in pre-school is not compulsory. Hence there is a low enrollment rate of below 10% for both males and females.\n\nThere are 8,968 primary schools in Laos. Primary school starts at the age of 6 and lasts for five years. This phase of education was made compulsory in 2003. The new law did not boost enrollment rate. It has stagnated since year 2000 with slight increase for female enrollment. Lao language, mathematics and physical education are some of the lessons conducted in a primary school. Students are given quizzes, tests and exams periodically and achieve a certificate after sitting for primary leaving examination.\n\nThere are an estimated 1,000 formal secondary schools established in Laos. The transition rate from primary to secondary is estimated to be 77.6%. \n\nSecondary school is branched into lower-secondary and upper-secondary. Before 2009, lower- and upper-secondary each lasted three years. It is now four years of lower secondary and three years of upper-secondary. Upper secondary is open to students who pass the lower secondary examinations. Thereafter, it is further divided into general, technical, vocational and primary school. Secondary education is legally free-of-charge, though the schools charge a registration fee.\n\nHigher education can be attained from National University of Laos (NUOL), private institutions and teacher training colleges. Qualifications on offer include diploma, Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree and Doctoral.\n\nIn 1975, the Sisavangvong University was dissolved following the departure of many teaching staff. Upper secondary graduates had to seek higher education in Eastern Europe and the USSR. In 1996, UNOL was set up to provide higher education for Laotian. It now comprises 11 faculties: Architecture, Engineering, Economics and Business Management, Environment, Law and Political Science, Agriculture, Education, Forestry, Letters, Sciences and Social Science. In 2006, they had 26,673 students.\n\nAccessibility to education in Laos is low, and this is a major problem. Only 50% of the primary schools offer full education up to Grade 5. Most of the students are poor and are deterred from attending school by the costly daily transport (due to the lack of boarding facilities) as well as the opportunity cost of not working. Furthermore, up to 30% of primary school teachers are unqualified to teach. This hinders school progression and takes up to 10 years to produce a primary school graduate (refer to graph). Gender inequality sets in through the years. It is almost non-existent in pre-school but reaches to more than 10% by lower secondary.\n\nFor NGO commtted to Lao's Education Development, refer to Action with Lao Children.\n"}
{"id": "3920181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3920181", "title": "Education in Nepal", "text": "Education in Nepal\n\nEducation in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and \"gurukulas\". The first formal school (Durbar School), established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse population.\nEducation in Nepal from the primary school to the university level has been modeled from the very inception on the Indian system, which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj.\n\nNepal's 1971 education plan hastened its development in the country. In 1951 Nepal had 10,000 students in 300 schools and an adult literacy rate of five percent. There were 49,000 schools in 2010, and by 2015 the overall adult literacy rate was 63.9 percent (males 76.4 percent and females 53.1 percent). It has already been more than half decade that public schools started imparting the education in the country. Curriculum developed in the country is not oriented towards\nthe practical education. Public schools\nare criticized for not being able to provide quality education. Lower-caste discrimination, and indigenous bias are now the primary barriers to equitable access to education. After thorough review\nof secondary literature, analysis through macro perspective under the influence of critical pedagogy it is found lack of physical and infrastructures,\ntextbooks, centralized curriculum, monolingual instructional, lack of constructive and critical pedagogical strategies, poverty and social exclusion are the\nmajor factors contributing for poor performance.\n\nThe Ministry of Education is responsible for managing educational activities in Nepal. The Minister of Education (assisted by the state or assistant minister) is the political leader of the ministry. The ministry, as a part of the government, is headed by the Secretary of Education and consists of the central office and other offices at the regional and district levels. Its central office is primarily responsible for policy development, planning, monitoring, and evaluation.\n\nThe ministry has established directorates in each of the five development regions and education offices in each of Nepal's 75 districts to bring educational administration to the people. These decentralized offices are responsible for overseeing local informal and school-level educational activities. Regional directorates are primarily responsible for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating educational activities, and the district education offices provide services.\n\nThe National Center for Educational Development (NCED) is Nepal's teacher-training body. It has 34 educational training centers (ETCs) to provide pedagogical support for teachers.\n\nNepal has two primary types of schools: community and institutional. Community (public) schools receive government grants, and institutional (private) schools are self-funded. Institutional schools are non-profit trusts or companies.\n\nWith one exception, all universities and academies are publicly managed and supported by public funding. Public universities also provide affiliation to private colleges. Academies of higher education are typically single-college institutes, and universities have constituent and affiliated colleges across Nepal.\n\nPrimary education in Nepal consists of grades one through five. Lower secondary levels are grades six through eight, and secondary levels cover grades nine and ten. Pre-primary education is available in some areas, and students usually begin grade one at age six. A national School Leaving Certificate (SLC) examination was conducted at the end of grade 10; according to the new Education Act, the national grade-12 examination will result in an SLC; the grade-10 examination will be known as the Secondary Education Examination (SEE).\n\nGrades 11 and 12 are considered the higher secondary level. The Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) supervises higher secondary schools, most of which are private. These grades had been controlled by the university system, and awarded proficiency certificates. Although some universities still offer these programs, most of these grades are now part of the school system. \n\nHigher education consists of bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. levels. Depending upon the educational stream and subject, a bachelor's degree may require three to five years of study; two years is the typical course. Some universities offer M.Phil. and post-graduate diplomas.\n\nVocational education begins after lower secondary education, and students can follow a two-year curriculum leading to a Technical School Leaving Certificate. Universities also offer professional and technical degrees. In addition to the formal track, one-year programs focusing on skills development are also available. The District Level Examination is given in grade eight. The new educational system has two levels: basic (grades one through eight) and secondary (grades nine through twelve).\n\nAlthough the Chitwan District was declared 100% literate in 2014, many children in remote villages do not have access to education past the primary level. The Chepang people have been called the \"poorest of the poor\" (in Nepal) by sociologists. Students often leave primary schools after they learn to read and write, but without additional education these skills may be forgotten. The April 2015 earthquake and 2015 blockade destroyed schools and severely impacted the nation's ability to keep its remaining schools open.\n\nGovernment schools use Janak textbooks, and private schools use reference books such as Ekta, Read More, Reliant, Asia, and Vidyarthi. Government schools perform poorly in the SLC exam, presently SEE exam, due to the lack of skilled teachers, textbooks, and neglect by the Ministry of Education of textbook reform.\n\nNepal's first college was Tri-Chandra College, founded in 1918. Until 1985, Tribhuvan University was the country's only university. During the early 1980s, the government developed the concept of a multi-university system in which each school would have its own nature, content, and function.\n\nThe first new university was Mahendra Sanskrit University. It was followed by Kathmandu University (the first private university) in 1990 and Purbanchal and Pokhara Universities in 1995 and 1996, respectively.\n\nMedical colleges, mostly private, exist throughout Nepal. Local students are admitted after an entrance exam, and foreign students are admitted after an interview. To be eligible for admission to MBBS courses in Nepal’s medical colleges, students must pass the higher secondary examination in science or its equivalent.\nMedical education is regulated by the Medical Council of Nepal. In addition to accrediting the country's medical colleges, the council conducts the licensing examination for new doctors, makes policies related to curriculum, admission, terms and examinations and makes registration recommendations.\n\nEngineering colleges also exist throughout Nepal, with most admitting local students through an entrance exam. Like the country's medical colleges, foreign students are admitted after an interview. To be eligible for admission to Nepalese engineering colleges, candidates are encouraged to pass the Intermediate in Science or have a diploma in engineering (or its equivalent).\n\nThe Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan University is the country's oldest engineering school. It has four colleges, and 13 private engineering colleges are affiliated with it. The IOE's central campus is Pulchowk Campus, considered to the best engineering college in Nepal. Pulchowk offers bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees in engineering. More than 16,000 students from around the world take the school's entrance examination. \n\nNepal Engineering College (NEC) in Changunarayan is the country's first private engineering college to offer bachelor's- and master's-level courses. Popular engineering fields in Nepal are architecture, civil engineering, computer engineering, electronics and communications, electrical and electronics, energy and rural engineering. The B.E. architecture courses take five years to complete, and other bachelor's-degree courses take four years.\n\nNepal ranks 11th in countries of origin for international students in the United States. According to \"Open Doors 2009\", the annual report on international academic mobility published by the Institute of International Education with support from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State, the number of Nepali students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education increased from 8,936 in the 2007–08 academic year to 11,581 in 2008–09 (a 29.6-percent increase). In the 2006–07 academic year, Nepal ranked 13th among countries of origin of international students.\n\nAccording to Terry J. White, counselor for public affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu, \"America's nearly 3,000 accredited schools of higher education continue to attract new students in what is becoming a highly competitive international 'market' around the world.\" The U.S. is the preferred destination for students from Nepal who want to study abroad because of the quality and prestige associated with an American degree. Another contributing factor is access to comprehensive, accurate information about study in the U.S. through EducationUSA offices in Nepal and increased activity by United States colleges and universities to attract students from Nepal. However, \"a culture of disrespect\" for humble Nepalese by U.S. Embassy staff has been reported by a co-founder of Nepali/American NGO, Possible Health.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "870066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=870066", "title": "Frankie Manning", "text": "Frankie Manning\n\nFrankie Manning (May 26, 1914 – April 27, 2009) was an American dancer, instructor, and choreographer. Manning is considered one of the founders of Lindy Hop.\n\nManning was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1914. After his parents separated, at the age of 3 he moved to Harlem with his mother, who was a dancer.\n\nManning began dancing as a child. Manning's mother sent him to spend summers with his father, aunt and grandmother on their farm in Aiken, South Carolina. On Saturdays, farmhands and locals would come to the farm to play music on the front porch with harmonicas and a washtub bass. Manning's grandmother encouraged the bashful boy to get out in the yard and dance with the others. Once he got in the dance circle, he developed a feel for dancing and did not want to stop.\n\nBack in New York, he started attending the dances at the Renaissance Ballroom in 1927 after his mother invited him to help her decorate the ballroom for a Halloween dance and promised to take him to the 9:00 dance that night. Watching from the balcony, he was surprised to see his mother dancing formal ballroom styles such as foxtrot and waltz, having only seen her dance before in a much looser and casual style at neighborhood rent parties. He danced with his mother later that night and she told him afterwards that \"Frankie, you'll never be a dancer, because you're too stiff.\" Manning really loved his mother and wanted to do things to please her, so that is why he wanted to learn how to dance. He started listening to records on a Victrola in his bedroom and would practice dancing with a broom or a chair trying to get \"un-stiff\". When he was older, he started going to Harlem's Savoy Ballroom, which was for better dancers, and was also the only integrated ballroom in New York. He frequented the Savoy in the 1930s, eventually becoming a dancer in the elite and prestigious \"Kat's Corner,\" a corner of the dance floor where impromptu exhibitions and competitions took place. During a dance contest in 1935, Manning and his partner, Frieda Washington, performed the first aerial in a swing dance competition against George \"Shorty\" Snowden, the inventor of the term Lindy Hop, and his partner, Big Bea, at the Savoy Ballroom. The airstep he performed was a \"back to back roll\" and was danced while Chick Webb played \"Down South Camp Meeting,\" which was Manning's request after having heard the song earlier in the evening. The airstep went flawlessly to the music and astonished the more than 2,000 audience members.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert White organized the top Savoy Ballroom lindy hop dancers into a professional performance group that was eventually named Whitey's Lindy Hoppers. Manning created the troupe's first ensemble Lindy Hop routines and functioned as the group's \"de facto\" choreographer, although without that title. The troupe toured extensively and made several films. While with Whitey's, Manning also danced with Norma Miller, who became known as the Queen of Swing. Whitey's Lindy Hoppers disbanded around World War II when many of the male dancers entered the armed forces. Manning himself served in the U.S. Army. After the war, in 1947, Manning created a small performance group called the Congaroos. When the Congaroos disbanded in 1955, Manning quietly settled into a career with the United States Postal Service. Some 30 years later, Manning started his second career in dancing: travelling the world as a renowned instructor and inspirator.\n\nIn 1982, Al Minns, a former member of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, started to teach Lindy Hop at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center, where he introduced a new generation of dancers to the Lindy Hop. Before he died in 1985, he told his students that Manning, another surviving member of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, also lived in New York City.\n\nIn 1986, dancers Erin Stevens and Steven Mitchell contacted Manning and asked him to teach them the Lindy Hop. Manning at first declined, before finally agreeing to meet with them; he was skeptical that a much younger generation would really be interested in swing or Lindy. However, Mitchell and Stevens returned to California and helped to spread Lindy Hop to the West Coast and other areas of the U.S. Thus, the swing revival began. That same year, Lennart Westerlund contacted Manning and invited him to Sweden to work with The Rhythm Hot Shots. Manning traveled to Sweden in 1987 and returned there every year from 1989 onward to teach at the Herräng Dance Camp.\n\nOnce the swing dance and Lindy Hop revival took hold during the late 1980s, Manning taught Lindy Hop to eager devotees around the world, occasionally appearing with Norma Miller. Sometimes, dance workshops returned him to places he had not been in decades. For example, Manning first visited Melbourne, Australia in 1939 to perform at the Princess Theatre. The swing revival and Melbourne's Swing Patrol, brought him back again in 2002; it was his first visit to Melbourne in 63 years.\n\nAt the age of 75, Manning co-choreographed the Broadway musical \"Black and Blue\", for which he received a 1989 Tony Award. In 2000, he was a recipient of a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.\n\nManning's autobiography, \"Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop\", written with co-author Cynthia R. Millman, was published by Temple University Press in May 2007. It contains a collection of stories about the early days of swing dancing, Manning's years performing with Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, his experiences during World War II, and his post-war dance troupe, the Congaroos. The book also recounts his experiences of the revival of swing dancing that began in the mid-1980s, and the two decades following.\n\nManning's annual birthday celebrations attracted dancers and instructors from all over the world. His 80th birthday, in 1994, was commemorated by a weekend-long celebration in New York City; his 85th culminated in a sold-out party at New York's Roseland Ballroom, where a pair of his dance shoes were placed in a showcase along with those of dancers such as Fred Astaire. For his 86th birthday, a huge gala was held in Tokyo in his honor, which included workshops taught by the maestro himself; the climax of the festivities featured a live orchestra. Manning drew a huge crowd of Japanese and foreign expatriate swing enthusiasts for this memorable occasion. Dedicated cruises were organized for his 89th and 90th birthdays; for his birthday dances, Manning followed his custom of dancing with one woman for every year of his life, partnering 89 and 90 women, respectively, in succession.\n\nA resident of Corona, Queens, Manning died in Manhattan on April 27, 2009, aged 94.\n\nHe is interred in the Hillcrest Plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York.\n\nBefore his death in April 2009, Manning had been planning to celebrate his 95th birthday in May 2009 in New York City at a special Lindy Hop dance event over Memorial Day weekend. The event, commonly referred to as Frankie Fest or Frankie 95, proceeded without him but in his memory and gathered dancers and instructors from around the world. In anticipation of the event, dance groups from all over the globe posted more than 160 videos to YouTube of local performances of the Shim Sham (a swing line dance long associated with Manning) as well as many videos of a Savoy-style routine choreographed especially for the Frankie 95 celebration by noted swing dancer and Lindy instructor Peter Strom. On Sunday of Frankie 95, attendees attempted to set three Guinness world records in Central Park, including one for the greatest number of people dancing the Shim Sham simultaneously in one place.\n\nProceeds from the five-day Frankie 95 celebration were used to create a Frankie Manning Foundation.\n\nManning was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nOn July 4, 2012, a road in the village of Herräng, Sweden, was named after Manning, as a gift from the municipality of Norrtälje for the 30-year jubilee of Herräng Dance Camp.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "728927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=728927", "title": "Friedrich Fröbel", "text": "Friedrich Fröbel\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel or Froebel (; 21 April 1782 – 21 June 1852) was a German pedagogue, a student of Pestalozzi, who laid the foundation for modern education based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He created the concept of the \"kindergarten\" and coined the word, which soon entered the English language as well. He also developed the educational toys known as Froebel gifts.\n\nFriedrich Fröbel was born at Oberweißbach in the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt in Thuringia. A cousin of his was the mother of Henriette Schrader-Breymann, and Henriette became a student of his. Fröbel's father, who died in 1802, was the pastor of the orthodox Lutheran (alt-lutherisch) parish there. The church and Lutheran Christian faith were pillars in Fröbel's own early education. Oberweißbach was a wealthy village in the Thuringian Forest and had been known centuries long for its natural herb remedies, tinctures, bitters, soaps and salves. Families had their own inherited areas of the forest where herbs and roots were grown and harvested. Each family prepared, bottled, and produced their individual products which were taken throughout Europe on trade routes passed from father to son, who were affectionately called \"Buckelapotheker\" or \"Rucksack Pharmacists\". They adorned the church with art acquired from their travels, many pieces of which can still be seen in the renovated structure. The pulpit from which Fröbel heard his father preach is the largest in all Europe and can fit a pastor and 12 people, a direct reference to Christ's apostles.\n\nShortly after Fröbel's birth, his mother's health began to fail. She died when he was nine months old, profoundly influencing his life. In 1792, Fröbel went to live in the small town of Stadt-Ilm with his uncle, a gentle and affectionate man. At the age of 15 Fröbel, who loved nature, became the apprentice to a forester. In 1799, he decided to leave his apprenticeship and study mathematics and botany in Jena. From 1802 to 1805, he worked as a land surveyor.\n\nOn 11 September 1818, Fröbel wed Wilhelmine Henriette Hoffmeister (b. 1780) in Berlin. The union was childless. Wilhelmine died in 1839, and Fröbel married again in 1851. His second wife was Louise Levin.\n\nHe began as an educator in 1805 at the \"Musterschule\" (a secondary school) in Frankfurt, where he learned about Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi's ideas. He later worked with Pestalozzi in Switzerland where his ideas further developed. From 1806 Fröbel was the live-in teacher for a Frankfurt noble family's three sons. He lived with the three children from 1808 to 1810 at Pestalozzi's institute in Yverdon-les-Bains in Switzerland.\n\nIn 1811, Fröbel once again went back to school in Göttingen and Berlin, eventually leaving without earning a certificate. He became a teacher at the \"Plamannsche Schule\" in Berlin, a boarding school for boys, and at that time also a pedagogical and patriotic centre.\nDuring his service in the Lützow Free Corps in 1813 and 1814 – when he was involved in two campaigns against Napoleon – Fröbel befriended Wilhelm Middendorf, a theologian and fellow pedagogue, and Heinrich Langethal, also a pedagogue. After Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna, Fröbel found himself a civilian once again and became an assistant at the Museum of Mineralogy under Christian Samuel Weiss. This did not, however, last very long, and by 1816 he had quit and founded the \"Allgemeine Deutsche Erziehungsanstalt\" (German General Education Institute) in Griesheim near Arnstadt in Thuringia. A year later he moved it to Keilhau near Rudolstadt. In 1831, work was continued there by the other cofounders Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal.\n\nIn 1820, Fröbel published the first of his five Keilhau pamphlets, \"An unser deutsches Volk\" (To Our German People). The other four were published between then and 1823.\n\nIn 1826 he published his main literary work, \"Die Menschenerziehung\" (The Education of Man) and founded the weekly publication \"Die erziehenden Familien\" (The Educating Families). In 1828 and 1829 he pursued plans for a people's education institute (\"Volkserziehungsanstalt\") in Helba (nowadays a constituent community of Meiningen), but they were never realized.\n\nFrom 1831 to 1836, Fröbel once again lived in Switzerland. In 1831 he founded an educational institute in Wartensee (Lucerne). In 1833 he moved this to Willisau, and from 1835 to 1836, he headed the orphanage in Burgdorf (Berne), where he also published the magazine \"Grundzüge der Menschenerziehung\" (Features of Human Education). In 1836 appeared his work \"Erneuerung des Lebens erfordert das neue Jahr 1836\" (The New Year 1836 Calls For the Renewal of Life).\n\nHe returned to Germany, dedicated himself almost exclusively to preschool child education and began manufacturing playing materials in Bad Blankenburg. In 1837 he founded a \"care, playing and activity institute for small children\" in Bad Blankenburg. From 1838 to 1840 he also published the magazine \"Ein Sonntagsblatt für Gleichgesinnte\" (A Sunday Paper for the Like-Minded).\n\nIn 1840 he coined the word kindergarten for the Play and Activity Institute he had founded in 1837 at Bad Blankenburg for young children, together with Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal. These two men were Fröbel's most faithful colleagues when his ideas were also transplanted to Keilhau near Rudolstadt.\n\nHe designed the educational play materials known as Froebel Gifts, or \"Fröbelgaben\", which included geometric building blocks and pattern activity blocks. A book entitled \"Inventing Kindergarten\", by Norman Brosterman, examines the influence of Friedrich Fröbel on Frank Lloyd Wright and modern art.\n\nFriedrich Fröbel's great insight was to recognise the importance of the activity of the child in learning. He introduced the concept of \"free work\" \"(Freiarbeit)\" into pedagogy and established the \"game\" as the typical form that life took in childhood, and also the game's educational worth. Activities in the first kindergarten included singing, dancing, gardening and self-directed play with the Froebel Gifts. Fröbel intended, with his \"\" – a songbook that he published – to introduce the young child into the adult world.\n\nThese ideas about childhood development and education were introduced to academic and royal circles through the tireless efforts of his greatest proponent, the Baroness (Freiherrin) Bertha Marie von Marenholtz-Bülow. Through her Fröbel made the acquaintance of the Royal House of the Netherlands, various Thuringian dukes and duchesses, including the Romanov wife of the Grand Duke von Sachsen-Weimar. Baroness von Marenholtz-Bülow, Duke von Meiningen and Fröbel gathered donations to support art education for children in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Goethe. The Duke of Meiningen granted the use of his hunting lodge, called Marienthal (Vale of Mary) in the resort town of Bad Liebenstein for Fröbel to train the first women as Kindergarten teachers \"(Kindergärtnerinnen)\".\n\nFröbel died on 21 June 1852 in Marienthal, now a constituent community of Schweina. His grave can still be found in the cemetery at Schweina, where his widow, who died in Hamburg, was also buried on 10 January 1900.\n\nFröbel’s idea of the kindergarten found appeal, but its spread in Germany was thwarted by the Prussian government, whose education ministry banned it on 7 August 1851 as \"atheistic and demagogic\" for its alleged \"destructive tendencies in the areas of religion and politics\". Other states followed suit. The reason for the ban, however, seems to have been a confusion of names. Fröbel's nephew Karl Fröbel had written and published \"Weibliche Hochschulen und Kindergärten\" (Female Colleges and Kindergartens), which apparently met with some disapproval. To quote Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, \"The stupid minister (Karl Otto) von Raumer has decreed a ban on kindergartens, basing himself on a book by Karl Fröbel. He is confusing Friedrich and Karl Fröbel.\"\n\nFröbel's student Margarethe Schurz founded the first kindergarten in the United States at Watertown, Wisconsin in 1856, and she also inspired Elizabeth Peabody, who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz’s kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in Boston in 1860. This paved the way for the concept's spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but had to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in New York City.\n\nThe pedagogue August Köhler was the initiator and cofounder in 1863 of the \"Deutscher Fröbelverein\" (German Fröbel Association), first for Thuringia, out of which grew the \"Allgemeiner Fröbelverein\" (General Fröbel Association) in 1872, and a year later the \"Deutscher Fröbelverband\" (German Fröbel Federation). August Köhler critically analyzed and evaluated Fröbel theory, adopted fundamental notions into his own kindergarten pedagogy and expanded on these, developing an independent \"Köhler Kindergarten Pedagogy\". He first trained kindergarten teachers in Gotha in 1857. In the beginning, Köhler had thought to engage male educators exclusively, but far too few applied.\n\nThekla Naveau founded in October 1853 the first kindergarten in Sondershausen and on 1 April 1867 the first kindergarten after the Prussian ban was lifted in Nordhausen. Angelika Hartmann founded in 1864 the first kindergarten after Fröbel’s model in Köthen, Anhalt. In 1908 and 1911, kindergarten teacher training was recognized in Germany through state regulatory laws.\n\nIn the meantime, there are many kindergartens in Germany named after Fröbel that continue his method. Many have sprung from parental or other private initiatives. The biggest Fröbel association, \"Fröbel e.V.\", today runs more than 100 kindergartens and other early childhood institutions throughout the country through the \"Fröbel-Gruppe\".\nCommitted to Fröbel's legacy is also the \"Neuer Thüringer Fröbelverein\" (NTFV; New Thuringian Fröbel Association), and in particular to protecting the legacy's business receipts. As well, the Association runs a school museum and the Fröbel Archive in Keilhau. Furthermore, it engages itself in Fröbel institutions worldwide (United States, United Kingdom, Japan). Through this network, the NTFV further continues one of the most prominent lines of modern pedagogy from the authentic \"Fröbel town\" of Keilhau. The Fröbel Diploma, now conferred by the Fröbel Academy in Nordhausen, can also be traced back to the NTFV. All this ensures that Fröbel’s ideas will live on into the future.\n\nFröbel's building forms and movement games are also forerunners of abstract art as well as a source of inspiration to the Bauhaus movement. In Fröbel’s honour, Walter Gropius designed the \"Friedrich Fröbel Haus\".\n\nIn 1892 followers of Fröbel established a college of teacher education in South West London to continue his traditions. Froebel College is now a constituent college of Roehampton University and is home to the university's department of education. The University of Roehampton Library is also home to the Froebel Archive for Childhood Studies, a collection of books, archives, photographs, objects and multi-media materials, centring on Friedrich Fröbel’s educational legacy, early years and elementary education. The Demonstration School, originally located at Colet Court, Kensington, has evolved into Ibstock Place School, Roehampton.\n\nToday the Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus in Berlin continues to train nursery school teachers.\n\n\n\n"}

It is made up of a Heat Event and a Final Event, which both forbid the usage of calculators and calculation assisting equipments (e.g. printed mathematical table). Though it bears the term \"Mathematics Olympiad\", it has no relationship with the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nThe predecessor of HKMO is the Inter-school Mathematics Olympiad initiated by the Mathematics Society of Northcote College of Education in 1974, which had attracted 20 secondary schools to participate.

Established in 1946, it offers a four-year, full-time program. Hussian College is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree for Art, with four concentrations: User Interface & Experience, Digital Media, Graphic Design, Visual Communications.\n\nStudio School, its Los Angeles branch campus, offers four Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degrees in Art, Film + Digital Content, Acting, Commercial Dance and Contemporary Musical Theatre + Film and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Entrepreneurship.\n\nThe first class at Hussian School of Art commenced on July 1, 1946. John Hussian, a member of Philadelphia's art community and a renowned lecturer, was encouraged by what is now the Philadelphia Museum of Art to open a school for veterans returning from World War II. Working under the G.I. Bill, Hussian worked with the Pennsylvania Department of Education Vocational Training and the Veterans Administration to provide training in fine art.\n\nIn the 1960s, many local competitors transitioned to collegiate status, while feedback from the industry and enrollment numbers indicated a continued need for career training in the visual arts. With Hussian’s guidance as president, the curriculum shifted to concentrate on commercial art. Hussian became a charter member in PAPSA (Pennsylvania Association of Private School Administrators) in the early 1960s.\n\nThe school was incorporated on July 1, 1969 and received its initial national accreditation as a member of National Association of Trade and Technical Schools (NATTS) in 1972.\n\nIn 1973, Ronald Dove became president of the Hussian School of Art. Dove adopted the same curriculum model and education philosophy that Hussian had established for the institution. In 1978, Hussian applied to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for consideration to award a 4-year AST degree. Formal approval to award the degree was granted in May 1979. In 1992, Hussian received its initial accreditation from ACCSCT, now ACCSC, and has remained in good standing from the time of initial accreditation.\n\nAs Dove retired, he appointed Bruce Wartman as president in July 2010 with the intention to train his predecessor as he reduced his responsibilities. Dove’s health began to suffer and he decided to sell the institution in 2011 to Education Equities, LLC. With the change of ownership, a formal board of directors was established and a strategic plan for the institution was created based on a needs assessment of the modern job market and professional art community. The planning process included introducing new institutional policies, introducing new digital media curriculum, hiring more faculty, and transitioning the institution to collegiate status.\n\nIn September 2011, Hussian submitted an application to become a degree-granting institution with the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

His works are closely identified with the school of thought named Onaism; Onaism is an art movement that is based on the fusion of the designs, ornamentation and motifs found in traditional Yoruba carvings and textiles with modern art pieces such as drawings and paintings. Filani is also a lecturer and an administrator – he served as a former provost of the Federal College of Education, Osiele, Abeokuta.\n\nFilani was born 8 September 1957 to a polygamous family, his father Jacob Ogunmoroti Filani was a native of Ikole-Ekiti in Ekiti State, he was a civil servant who worked in the municipal government council while his mother was a teacher. His father died in 1975 when Filani was 17 years old. Due to his father's job, the family lived in various towns when he was a young child. He completed his primary education at Bishop Akinyele Primary School, Ibadan (1967-1969) and St Peter's Primary School, Ikole (1969). He attended Doherty Memorial Grammar School in Ijero Ekiti with his brother, fellow artist Tolu Filani. While in Form 2, the school provided a classroom for students inclined towards artistic activities and subsequently hired an arts teacher to manage the class. He finished secondary education in 1974 and briefly worked for two years as a clerk at the Lafarge Cement plant in Ewekoro. From 1976-1980, he studied at Obafemi Awolowo University where he earned a degree in Fine Arts. At Ife, he was taught by some faculty staff that included Babatunde Lawal, Munio Makuchi, Agbo Folarin and Rowland Abiodun. It was at the university he met some of his fellow artists such as Moyo Okediji and Moyo Ogundipe; together they later went on to form the Ona art movement in the late 1980s. He also developed an interest in petro-polystyrene experimentation at Ife. He obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Benin, as part of his fulfilment for the completion of the degree, he staged an academic exhibition entitled 'A Trip to Wonderland'. He also developed skills in contrast composition and printmaking. Filani later earned a doctoral degree in Visual Arts from University of Ibadan in 2002.\n\nFilani served as a corps member at Kano Teacher's College between 1980 and 1981. He started his career as an art teacher in St Louis School, Owo in 1981. On completion of his M.F.A. studies, he joined the arts faculty of Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo in 1985, he rose through the ranks to become head of department before leaving the college in 1992 to establish the new arts department in the Federal College of Education, Akoka, Lagos. While at Adeyemi College, Filani was involved with the formation of Ona Group. Ona as an artistic concept is focused on re-adaptation and re-interpretation of traditional materials and methods that will culminate in the aesthetic high point of contemporary Yoruba art and design. He had two solo exhibitions during this period – \"Coming on Strong\", an exhibition of prints, paintings and drawings in August 1989 and \"Salute to Patience\" in 1991. Between 1992 and 1997, some of his works were shown in some group exhibitions in Lagos, the group exhibitions include, \"Best of Ife\" in 1993, \"On and On\" in 1993, \"Harvest of Sensation\" in 1991 and \"Legacy\", an exhibition in honor of Irein Wangboje in 1996. He had a solo exhibition in 1997 termed \"Patterns of Ona\".\n\nHe was at a time the dean of School of Technical Education and Provost, Federal College of Education, Osiele-Abeokuta.\n\nFilani's paintings fall under four categories:figurative expression, landscapes, partially dissected works and completely dissected compositions. A common feature of some of his paintings is the use of decorative linear drawings and patterns.\n\n\nFilani married Celestina Omigie in 1988, they attend the Mountain of Fire and Miracles church.\n"}

The bill amended the California Education Code and California Penal Code to change charges for some hazing rituals from misdemeanors to felonies, and for the first time gave prosecutors the ability to seek hazing charges against nonstudents.\n\nThe long title of the act was \"An act to amend Section 48900 of, and to repeal Sections 32050 and 32051 of the Education Code, and to add Section 245.6 to the Penal Code, relating to hazing\".\n\nIt was introduced into the California State Senate by Tom Torlakson, a Democrat from Antioch, as Senate Bill 1454. SB 1454 passed the state Senate 34–2 on May 30, 2006. It passed the California State Assembly with amendments on August 24, 2006, and the Senate concurred with the bill as amended on August 30, 2006. It was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on September 29, 2006.\n\nMatt's Law was named in memory of Matt Carrington, a 21-year-old California State University, Chico student from Pleasant Hill, California. Carrington died in the basement of a fraternity house located two blocks from campus.\n\nPrior to the enactment of Matt's Law, hazing (even in the case of death) was a misdemeanor as part of California's education code, rather than punishable under the state's penal code. Matt's Law prevents unaffiliated fraternities from using the argument that they cannot be punished for hazing, simply because they are not student organizations. The law also gives prosecutors clear authority to bring charges against anyone or any organization involved in hazing, not just currently enrolled students.\n\nOn February 2, 2005, Matt Carrington died as the direct result of a hazing ritual at Chico State University in Chico, California. In the basement of the fraternity house of fraternity Chi Tau (XT), Carrington was forced to drink water and do calisthenics with fans blowing on him. This water intoxication ritual, which dates back over 20 years at Chi Tau, caused swelling of his brain, seizures, and heart failure.

Model Crime Investigations is held annually in South Korea so it is usually known as KMCI. MCI is an extracurricular activity where students gather to learn about how a police department operates, as well as about how the broader criminal justice system functions. In the actual conference of simulation, participants will debate upon civil or criminal cases to find culprits among virtual suspects in committees. Unlike scientific investigation, in Model Crime Investigation participants usually interrogate suspects in oral arguments, and gather verbal evidence. Issues that can be discussed will vary from minor cases such as robbery to major crimes such as international terrorism, which are currently happening all around us. During the sessions, students who charge the investigation will have to work on affidavit by summarizing the points given by the suspects and witnesses, for the purpose of exterminating crimes by means such as arrest and/or complaint; and prosecute suspects. Along with Model United Nations, Moot Court, Mock Trial, or Model Congress, Model Crime Investigations aims to build students' global perspective.\n\n\nKMCI basically follows the system of Department of Justice in United States. Committees students can take are Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Marshals, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive, or Department of Homeland Security. Each student will work as police designated as a Lieutenant, Sergeant, or Commander, or will work as suspects defending themselves as innocent. Participants (if they are suspects) will typically receive a criminal case ahead of time, which includes the facts of the crime, their roles, alibis and pieces of evidence. Students taking roles as suspects must prepare and memorize the cases given to them. During model crime investigation sessions, participants working as Police, not knowing who the actual criminal(s) is (are), must gather these pieces of evidence through investigating, interrogating and interviewing suspects in order to find out who the offender(s) is(are).\n\nWhole committees are supervised and controlled by students role-playing as Generals: \nCommissioner General, Chief Superintendent General, Senior superintendent general, Superintendent General.\n\"(University of Students who took role as Generals in 2009 Korea Model Crime Investigations)\"\n\nEach session is operated by students following roles as Chiefs:\nChief of Police, Deputy Chief, and Assistant Chief\n\nParticipants will be designated in the following committees randomly\n\n\nAnd be given the roles in POLICE as\nCommander, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Senior Lead Officer, Patrol Force\n\n, OR be given the roles in SUSPECT as\nCriminal, Accomplice, Witness, and so on (Types of roles are subjected to be changed according to a criminal case of \ncommittee, and participants’ role must be kept fugitive by themselves.)\n\nPolice and Suspects has different goal of their own. As mentioned above, police should find out actual offenders by summarizing evidences given by suspects. Suspects should not let police to find about who the actual criminal is. Whoever achieves their goal is to win.\n\nBy going through procedures step by step, police officers have to find out the actual criminal, or criminals. All officers shall strictly adhere to the policy of the KMCI prior to any interrogation of suspects. No coercion, threats or promises shall be used under any condition to obtain a confession, statement, or admission from any individual. The immediate objective of the interviewing officer should be to establish a cooperative relationship. To this objective, an officer should:\ni. Display a sincere interest,\nii. Be patient and tactful, \niii. Be respectful\niv. Control personal feelings, and\nv. Provide reassurance.\n\nParticipants can be designated as a criminal, accomplice or as a witness. They are able to lie about their positions in order to confuse police, but their evidences should match with the stances Chiefs provides several weeks before session. Suspects’ positions MUST be kept in a secret before sessions start. Actual number of criminals among suspects can vary from zero to all. Suspects making a speech, refusing interrogation or getting an interview should: \n1. Display utmost respect,\n2. Be kind to interviewers, \n3. Cooperate interview as much as interviewee wants to, and\n4. Never distort their evidence\n\nInvestigation procedures are the only way which investigators can find valuable evidences. These investigations are divided into two parts: Preliminary investigation, and Follow-up investigation.\n\nMost preliminary investigations will be conducted by the members of Patrol Force since they usually are the first to arrive at the criminal scene. All officers designated to conduct preliminary investigation shall do their utmost to gather as much information as possible during this stage of investigation since its police department’s the very first stage figuring out the information of suspects. The officers responsible for a preliminary investigation shall interrogate the suspect, find out personal information about the suspect such as, but not limited to age, address, phone number, family members, and shall report the incident fully and accurately and yield the responsibility to the follow-up investigators.\n\nFollow-up investigation will be preceded by the Senior Lead Officer, Sergeant and Lieutenant because they are usually responsible for deeper investigations. It may be possible for the patrol force to conduct follow-up investigations, but the priority is given to other class officers. In this stage of investigation, police department would try to figure out more concrete and detailed information about the offenses and the suspects as thorough as possible, including following steps, although all of the steps may not be necessary in each case: review and analyze all previous reports prepared in the preliminary phase: conduct additional interviews with suspects, and preliminary investigating officers if necessary, conduct interrogations of all suspects, plan, organize and conduct crime scene searches for the purpose of gathering additional evidences: check criminal records of potential suspects: identify and apprehend suspects and: interview apprehended suspects in order to determine involvement in other crimes.\n\nDebate procedure incorporated UNA-USA format(United Nations Associations of United States of America) to foster active participation from students. Motions and points have to be introduced by participants to take an action in the committee, and the conference will be governed under the authority of student chiefs.\n\nIntroduction of an affidavit\nOnce an affidavit has been approved, copied, and distributed, a person/people may make a motion to introduce the affidavit. The Chief will recognize the affiant of the affidavit to read the paragraphs of the affidavit. The Chief, at his or her discretion, may allow the main signatories to answer any clarification points on the affidavit. for any reason. After that, the affiant has to express his/her reasons for supporting his/her own affidavit.\n\nSpeaker's list\nWhen a speaking time designated for an affidavit elapse, the Chief will terminate his speech. After that, the floor will be yielded to the Chief who will open the floor to debate. Chief will entertain other suspects’ or police agents’ speeches. These speeches must include reasons for disagreeing or sometimes supporting the contents in the affidavit. (Affiant also can take the floor again as long as the Chief recognizes him/her.)\n\nClosure of the debate\nWhen total allotted debate time is almost elapsed, a session will have final speeches. Usually, a final speech lasts 1 minute for, and 1 minute against the affidavit. When the final speeches are over, the debate procedure will automatically be closed, and voting procedures will begin.\n\n\n\n"}

It is named for its benefactors, John Motley Morehead III and the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation. Modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship, the Morehead-Cain provides a full four-year scholarship covering tuition, books, room and board, a laptop computer, and four summer experiences known as the Morehead-Cain's Summer Enrichment Program. Nominees must be a competitive applicant to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and unmarried with no children.\n\nThe Morehead Scholarship was created in 1951 by the Morehead Foundation, when John Motley Morehead III, bequeathed to the University of North Carolina $130 million, commissioned the University's planetarium, and funded the John Motley Morehead Foundation. The Foundation and scholarship was renamed the Morehead-Cain in 2007 after the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation contributed $100 million to the program.\n\nThe Summer Enrichment Program was established in 1974. It fully funds activities for students in four areas (Outdoor Leadership, Civic Collaboration, Global Perspective, and Professional Experience) which occur in the summers before their respective class year.\n\nThe summer before students enter the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, they participate in an NOLS or an Outward Bound course throughout the country in order to push themselves physically and mentally through a number of individual and group challenges.\n\nA relatively recent addition to the program is the development of the Civic Collaboration summer, in which teams of rising sophomores are placed in mid-sized US cities to partner with a governmental or community organization to help develop solutions to local and regional challenges. Previous placements have taken place in Albuquerque, New Mexico; St. Louis, Missouri; Louisville, Kentucky; and Chattanooga, Tennessee. \n\nBefore the student's Junior year they have an opportunity to design a summer that will bring them into contact with a global perspective or work environment. While many students travel abroad for this summer, other elect to remain in the United States to pursue global-minded work domestically. Students may pursue study abroad programs, traditional internships, purposeful travel, or other avenues for this summer\n\nThe final summer program encourages students to work in a professional capacity. Projects have ranged from policy work with the World Health Organization to investment banking and industry research with Goldman Sachs. This may be swapped with the Global Perspective option in the sequence of a student's summers in accordance with their individual four-year plan.\n\nThe selection process for the Morehead-Cain is extremely rigorous, with only three percent of each year's nominees selected as Morehead-Cain Scholars.

Pathak (born c. 1980) is Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research where he co-founded and directs the working group on market design.\n\nPathak grew up in Corning, New York. His parents emigrated to the United States from Kathmandu, Nepal. Pathak was educated at Harvard University where he received a Bachelor's and master's degrees in Applied Mathematics (summa cum laude) and PhD in Business Economics in 2007 with the support of The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. From 2002-2003, Pathak served as a visiting fellow at the University of Toulouse where he studied under Jean Tirole, the 2014 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Pathak served as a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. He joined the MIT faculty in 2008, and was voted tenure two years later in 2010 at the age of 30.\n\nAt MIT, Pathak co-founded and serves as Director of the School Effectiveness & Inequality Initiative, a group of economists who study the economics of education and the connections between human capital and the American income distribution.\n\nPathak is an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow and a recipient of a 2012 Presidential Early Career for Scientists and Engineers by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. In 2012, he was selected to give the Shapley Lecture, a lecture in honor of Lloyd Shapley given by a distinguished game theorist aged 40 or under at the 4th World Congress of the Game Theory Society. In 2018 he was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal, for his work that \"blends institutional knowledge, theoretical sophistication, and careful empirical analysis to provide insights that are of immediate value to important public-policy issues.”\n\nA protege of 2012 Nobel Prize winner Alvin E. Roth, Pathak is best known for his work in market design. He is a leader in the recent push to apply engineering methods to microeconomics. As a graduate student, Pathak worked with Roth to design the algorithm underlying the system used to match New York City public school students to high schools as incoming freshman.\n\nAround the same time, he worked together with Atila Abdulkadiroglu, Roth, and Tayfun Sönmez to design a new student assignment system for Boston Public Schools, which was adopted in 2005. The team of economists identified parents in Boston who developed heuristics on how to play this real-world game so that their children would not be unassigned, leaving those unaware of these features disadvantaged.\n\nBoston held citywide discussions and hearings on the school selection system and finally in 2005 narrowed the choice to one of two mechanisms: the top trading cycles mechanism for schools and the student-optimal stable mechanism based on the stable marriage problem. Eventually, Boston adopted the student-optimal stable mechanism. The policy change was the first time an incentive compatible strategyproof mechanism, based on an abstract concept from mechanism design, played a role in a public policy discussion. This work was recognized in the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences awarded to Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd Shapley ``for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.\"\n\nSince then, a number of other districts have abandoned Boston's old mechanism. In 2007, through an act of Parliament,\nBritish authorities outlawed the use of First Preference First arrangements, which made Boston's old method of school assignment illegal throughout 150 English districts.\n\nPathak continues to be involved with the Boston school choice plan. In 2012, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino asked for Pathak's help by appointing him the Technical Advisor to the Boston School Choice Plan. The city embarked on a discussion of several alternative zone plans, including the complete elimination of school choice, and Mayor Menino commissioned a report evaluating the alternative proposals. This frustrated some groups because it delayed citywide discussions about Boston's choice plan. After the report was released, some parent groups were unhappy even though it made no recommendations. In 2013, the school committee adopted a proposal developed by one of Pathak's graduate student. The proposal was controversial and seen as complicated. Nonetheless, members of the Boston school committee voted for it because it was the best compromise between competing objectives.\n\nPathak helped to design the OneApp common enrollment system used in the Recovery School District in New Orleans in 2011, involving a collaboration of assignment processes between charter schools and traditional public schools.\nPathak is also a leading scholar in education reform. He is most well known for numerous studies of charter schools which use randomness in assignment lotteries to deal with differences between charter and traditional students. One study compares Boston's charter, pilot and traditional schools, and finds Boston's charter schools to be unusually effective. A report by the Boston Teacher's Union criticized the report, claiming that they could not generalize the methodology to less-popular schools without waiting lists.\n\nHe also conducted the first such study of a KIPP charter school. Work with Joshua Angrist finds that charter schools outside of urban areas are not particularly effective.\n\nAnother study considers the effects of Boston's charter schools on college enrollment and persistence.\n\nA more controversial study examines the effects of Boston and New York's exam schools (Bronx Science, Boston Latin School, Stuyvesant High School) finding that the high achievement of these students is not due to the school, but to the school's admissions process. Even though they continue to remain popular among parents, the Washington Post's Jay Mathews wondered if exam schools are even needed based on the study.\n\nPathak has also studied the effect of home foreclosures on home prices in their surrounding neighborhood. This work has been cited in congressional testimony and featured in several outlets including PBS and NPR.\n"}

Over the course of her career, she has worked as a director, an editor, an assistant director, a cinematographer, a props assistant, an art director, a writer, a set decorator and a producer.\n\nHer first film, \"The Central Character\" (1979), was a short. \"The Women’s Companion to International Film,\" edited by Annette Kuhn and Susannah Radstone, states that this short \"received immediate attention as the work of a major new figure in Canada’s Avant Garde.\" Gruben went on to make another experimental short, \"Sifted Evidence\" (1982), which received international attention from film festival screenings.\n\nGruben worked as a set decorator for \"Spasms\" (1982), a horror film directed by William Fruet, before working her first feature film. Gruben wrote and directed \"Low Visibility\" (1984), which told the story of a man who had lost his ability to communicate and his memory. Gruben also wrote and directed \"Deep Sleep\" (1990), and directed \"Ley Lines\" (1993). \"Ley Lines\" is an autobiographical documentary based on Gruben’s family tree, where she follows her lineage from America to Germany and Canada.\n\nGruben began to teach at Simon Fraser University in 1984. Three years later, in 1987, Gruben and Colin Browne founded the Praxis Centre for Screenwriters. The program was part of the Simon Fraser University’s School for the Contemporary Arts, which received funding from both the government of British Columbia and the university. The purpose of the program was to assist Canadian screenwriters by providing the opportunity to work with professionals in the industry. In 2013, a Globe and Mail article announced that the program would end in 2014 due to lack of funding. The program will be leaving the university in 2015. Gruben is currently an associate professor at Simon Fraser University and specializes in Indian cinema.\n\nFor 2015, Gruben is serving as a judge for the Daryl Duke Prize. The prize of $25,000 is offered by the Daryl Duke Foundation to assist a screenwriter in producing their screenplay. The prize is offered in memory of Daryl Duke.\n\nGruben received the Teamsters 155 Woman of the Year Award in 2015 from Women in Film and Television, a non-for-profit organization that hosts the awards. Women in Film and Television Vancouver defined the criteria for the award in the 2015 Spotlight Award Winners section of its website. The award requires that the recipient be \"a woman who has achieved a significant success in the field of film or television, and who is recognized for mentoring other women in the industry.\"\n\n"}

Its membership include 55 government agencies and NGOs from 13 EU member states as well as from the United States, such as the Institute of National Remembrance, the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial, the Stasi Records Agency and the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. The platform has offices in Prague and Brussels. The President of the platform is Łukasz Kamiński, former President of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance.\n\nThe platform was founded in Prague on the occasion of the summit of Prime Ministers of the Visegrád Group on 14 October 2011. The signing ceremony took place in the Lichtenstein Palace under the auspices of Czech Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Polish Prime Minister and President of the European Council Donald Tusk, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Its goal is described as helping \"prevent intolerance, extremism, anti-democratic movements and the recurrence of any totalitarian rule in the future.\"\n\nThe initiative was originally proposed by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes and the Government of the Czech Republic, and the 2008 Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism; on 2 April 2009, the European Parliament passed a resolution in favour of the initiative, and in June 2009, the Council of the European Union welcomed the initiative. The Platform of European Memory and Conscience was founded as an initiative of the Polish EU presidency in 2011, after the project had been promoted by the Czech EU presidency already in 2009 and by the Hungarian EU presidency in 2011. The secretariat of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience was originally hosted by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, and the platform has received a strategic grant from the International Visegrád Fund. The founding institutions included government agencies of the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, as well as several NGOs. The organisation's strategic partners include the International Visegrád Fund and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. The motto of the platform is \"democracy matters.\"\n\nOn 8 April 2008, the Slovenian EU Presidency and the European Commission organised the European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes. The hearing called for the establishment of a foundation which would increase \"public awareness at the EU level, develop cultual and educational projects and notably provide support to networking of national research institutions specialised in the subject of totalitarian experience, provide support for the European and national research and educational projects.\"\n\nIn June 2008, the international conference European Conscience and Communism was hosted by the Czech Senate Committee on Education, Science, Culture, Human Rights and Petitions. The resulting Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism called for the establishment of an \"Institute of European Memory and Conscience\".\n\nIn 2009, Czech EU Presidency and the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes invited all member states to participate in the joint establishment of a Platform of European Memory and Conscience. Following a meeting in Prague in November 2008, representatives of 19 states and 12 partner institutions decided to establish a Working Group on the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, which was co-ordinated by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes. As of 2011, the working group included 35 institutions and organisations from 19 European countries. The working group co-operates closely with the Reconciliation of European Histories Group, an all-party group in the European Parliament which is chaired by former European Commissioner Sandra Kalniete.\n\nOn 18 March 2009, the Czech EU Presidency hosted the , as \"the third step towards the establishment of a European Platform of Memory and Conscience to support the activities of institutions engaged in reconciling with totalitarian regimes in Europe.\"\n\nOn 2 April 2009, the European Parliament adopted (553:44:33) a resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism, which called \"for the establishment of a Platform of European Memory and Conscience to provide support for networking and cooperation among national research institutes specialising in the subject of totalitarian history, and for the creation of a pan-European documentation centre/memorial for the victims of all totalitarian regimes.\"\n\nIn its 15 June 2009 conclusions, the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomed the initiative to create the Platform of European Memory and Conscience and requested that the European Commission provide financial instruments for the activities.\n\nIn February 2010, the Working Group on the Platform of European Memory and Conscience hosted the international conference Crimes of the Communist Regimes in the Czech Senate and the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic under the auspices of Prime Minister Jan Fischer. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Declaration on Crimes of Communism, which called \"upon EU member states to increase the awareness raising and education about crimes of communism,\" and stated that \"the creation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, as supported by the European Parliament and the EU Council in 2009, must be completed at EU level.\"\n\nIn its 9–10 June 2011 conclusions on the memory of crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe, the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council invited all interested parties to make use of existing EU programmes to establish a Platform of European Memory and Conscience.\n\nThe then-incumbent Polish EU Presidency founded the Platform of European Memory and Conscience with the participation of the governments and government institutions of a number of other EU countries on 14 October 2011. The Platform has received a strategic grant from the International Visegrád Fund.\n\nThe first President of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience was Göran Lindblad (former MP, Sweden, who drafted the Council of Europe resolution 1481); he was succeeded in 2016 by Łukasz Kamiński. The Executive Board members include Siegfried Reiprich (Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten, Germany), Paweł Ukielski (Warsaw Rising Museum, Poland), Zsolt Szilágyi (Head of Cabinet of László Tökés, Vice-President of the European Parliament), and Toomas Hiio (Estonian Institute of Historical Memory). Andreja Valič Zver (Study Centre for National Reconciliation, Slovenia) was a member 2011–2015.\n\nThe Platform has offices in Prague and Brussels. Neela Winkelmann serves as managing director of the Platform.\n\nIn 2012, the institution's Board of Trustees was elected. The first elected members were Sandra Kalniete MEP, Vytautas Landsbergis MEP, Tunne Kelam MEP, László Tökés MEP, and Milan Zver MEP. As of 2016, the Board of Trustees includes the original members as well as Paweł Robert Kowal MEP, Werner Schulz MEP, Monica Macovei MEP, Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė MEP, former Czech Senator Martin Mejstřík, former Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, former Solidarność leader Wojciech Roszkowski MEP, historian Stéphane Courtois, journalist Anne Applebaum, former Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša, and Czech actor Ondřej Vetchý.\n\nThe platform will co-ordinate the study of the totalitarian past on the European level. According to Daniel Herman, the Director of the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, one of the first joint projects might be a European history textbook.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience and the Reconciliation of European Histories Group hosted the conference Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes in the European Parliament, under the auspices of Hans-Gert Pöttering and Jerzy Buzek, devoted to the issue of forming a special court tribunal for the crimes of communism, and \"raising the issue of justice for the most serious crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe from the national to a European level.\" The conference was a response \"to growing calls for strengthened international justice formulated e.g., in the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.\" Following the conference, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience founded an international legal expert group to \"work on a road map for establishing a supranational institution of justice\" devoted to the \"crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships.\"\n\n\n\n"}

When Siemens lost the bidding for the competition to Intel, Siemens decided to create the Siemens Foundation to continue the tradition using the well-known Westinghouse name, calling the new competition the Siemens Westinghouse Competition (SWC) and, later, the Siemens Competition. The first awards were given in 1999.\n\nThe competition had the same goals as the old Westinghouse Competition, but with several added dimensions, most notably awards for team projects and regional awards. The regional finals were held in cooperation with six partner universities: MIT, Georgia Tech, Caltech, University of Texas at Austin, the University of Notre Dame, and Carnegie Mellon.\n\n2007 was the first year that women won the top prizes in both the individual and team competitions at Siemens.\nThe individual winner was Isha Jain of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the top team winners were Janelle Schlossberger and Amanda Marinoff of Plainview, New York.\n\nThe Siemens Competition ran for 18 years. On February 1, 2018, the Siemens Foundation announced that the 2017 competition would be its last.\n\nEach year, research reports submitted before a late-September to early-October deadline were subjected to a blind reading. 300 outstanding research reports, from more than 1600 entries, were selected as semifinalists. All semifinalists received a special recognition package, with their names announced in a full page USA Today advertisement. \nFrom the pool of semifinalists, 30 individuals and 30 teams (2-3 students) were selected as Regional Finalists and invited to compete during the month of November at one of the six partner universities (Caltech, UT Austin, Notre Dame, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Ga. Tech). In addition to project content, judging was also based on the oral presentation, poster display, cited references, and the question and answer session. All regional finalists received $1,000 scholarships and bronze medals. One individual and one team from each region advanced to the National Finals. These Regional winners received $3,000 (individual) or $6,000 (total for teams) scholarships, and silver medals.\n\nThe National Finalists (6 individual and 6 team projects) received an all-expense paid trip during the first weekend of December to Washington, DC. Winners of the Nationals received scholarships ranging from $10,000 to the coveted $100,000 grand prize for the top individual and top team.\n\nBelow is a list of the winners for each year of the Siemens Competition.\n\n\n\nSeveral schools were consistently successful in producing Regional and National Finalists. By far the most finalists came from North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, and many finalists also came from the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Troy High School, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, and Oak Ridge High School.

She has won numerous awards and recognition throughout her career including the \"Vanguardia Nacional\", the \"Distinción por la Cultura Nacional\" (Distinction of the National Culture), and the Alejo Carpentier Medal. In 2014, she was honored as the recipient of the National Dance Prize of Cuba.\n\nSilvina Fabars Gilall was born on 22 February 1944 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Her ancestry includes grandparents from Guinea and Ghana, who helped raise her. As a child, she was taught to read and write by an aunt and was only able to attend elementary school for 2 or three years, as her labor was needed. She worked in the cane fields, planted sweet potatoes, picked coffee and hauled wood and water. She lived in a community of Haitians and learned their folk dances and patois. At the age of fourteen, she joined Fidel Castro's rebel army in the and participated in the Cuban Revolution. In 1959, she began working at the airport in San Antonio de los Banos as a member of the legendary Mariana Grajales Women's Squad. Around the same time, she co-founded the first Cuban folk dancing company, known as the \"Ballet Folklórico de Oriente\" (Eastern Folk Dancing Company), where she performed as a singer and dancer until 1965.\n\nIn 1966, Fabars was invited by the playwright and theater director, Eugenio Hernández Espinosa, to come to Havana and try out for the National Folkloric Ensemble () (CFN). She was hired as a singer, but after a serious accident which damaged her vocal chords, was offered a position as a hairdresser or makeup artist. Fabars was determined to continue performing as a dancer. Unfamiliar with the folk dances and traditions of the western part of Cuba, she studied with the anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fernández, as well as many of the company's premier dancers, such as Santiago Alfonso, Luisa Barroso, Nieves Fresneda, Zenaida Hernandez and Emilio O’Farrill. By 1978, she was offered a professorship to teach dance and the following year, she became the principal dancer of the CFN. Some of her most noted performances include \"Yoruba Iyessá\" by the Mexican choreographer Rodolfo Reyes Cortés, which became a signature piece for Fabars; \"Ciclo Congo\"; \"Arara\", which features spinning movements with a basket on her head; and \"Rumbas y comparsas\", in which she was the zebra. She has performed in most of the repertoire productions of the CFN and has performed throughout the world, including in Algeria, Angola, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England, France, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Martinique, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and the United States.\n\nIn addition to teaching at the CFN, Fabars has taught throughout the country and helped establish groups and dance companies. As a teacher for the International Laboratory of Cuban Folklore which is a biannual course offered to teach Cuban dance, she has taught at the University of Alberta, in Canada; University of Liverpool and University of London in England; at the Tokyo Cultural Center of Japan, as well as in Cuba, Russia and Venezuela. She spent two years in Venezuela helping the ministry of culture develop a folk dance company before returning to Cuba and establishing a folk dance training facility at the House of Culture in Camagüey, where she currently teaches.\n\nThroughout her career, Fabars has won many honors. As part of the CFN, she has shared in awards which include the Golden Sandal trophy from Festidanza 1974 held in Arequipa, Peru; in the Golden Barrel and Silver Necklace awarded by the 30th International Vineyard Festivities of Dijon, France (1975); the Silver Platter from the 1976 Billingham Folkloric Festival of Billingham, England; and the Golden Temple trophy from the 1988 Almond Blossom Festival of Agrigento, Sicily, among many others.

It is a non-profit organisation based in London, UK. Its aim is to foster mutual cultural understanding through educational exchange between both nations. To do this, Fulbright helps students, scholars and professionals interested in studying abroad in the US or UK through its world-renowned scholarship programme and its EducationUSA advice service.\n\nThe US-UK Fulbright Commission is part of the worldwide Fulbright Program. This is one of the most prestigious and well-known scholarship programmes. The global programme was conceived by Senator J. William Fulbright after the Second World War to promote leadership, learning and empathy between nations through educational exchange. The global programme operates over 155 countries and has supported 300,000 alumni in exchanges to and from the US. \nWithin the global Fulbright programme, 28 alumni have served as head of state or government, 11 Fulbright alumni have been elected to US Congress, 1 Fulbright alumnus has served as Secretary-General of the UN, 43 Fulbright alumni from 11 countries have received the Nobel Prize (including 2 in 2010), and 78 alumni have received Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nThere are several scholarship programmes operating between the US and UK. However, the US-UK Fulbright Commission is the only organisation offering scholarships on a bi-national basis, in any field and at any university. According to its website, Fulbright offers a wide range of programmes including Distinguished Chairs for senior academics, postgraduate study scholarships, professional awards and Summer Institutes for younger students. \nSince 1948, the UK Commission has supported approximately 15,000 British nationals on exchanges to the US and nearly 12,000 Americans to the UK. In recent years, around 50 UK and 50 US citizens received grants annually in the US and UK respectively.\n\nIn addition to its scholarships, Fulbright provides information on and promotes US-UK exchange. In 2009/10, 8,861 British students studied in the US, and with the rise of tuition at UK universities, there has been increased interest in US study. That same year, another 45,000+ Americans studied in the UK. \nFulbright’s advisory service is part of the EducationUSA network of over 450 advising centres worldwide. The advisors are the UK's official source of information on educational exchange opportunities to the US. Advisors are able to provide accurate, unbiased information about all accredited US higher education institutions. \nFulbright’s website provides a lot of information on how to apply to US universities. They also offer events on US study, such as their College Day undergraduate university fair each autumn, a Grad School Day workshop in the spring, student and parent seminars throughout the year, webinars and advisor training. Students can also get additional advice by phone, email and in person at their office in Battersea.\n\nThe US-UK Commission is funded partially by the US State Department and UK government through BIS. They get additional support from individual and institutional partners. Fulbright is governed by a Board of Commissioners that includes representatives nominated by the US and UK governments. Work is carried out by ten full-time staff and participants in their internship programme.\nThe Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961 states that the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) administers the global Fulbright Program under policy guidelines set by the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board (FSB). ECA does this with assistance of bi-national commissions and foundations, U.S. embassies, and cooperating agencies in the United States, such as the Institute of International Education (IIE) and Council for International Exchange of Scholars.\n\nThe British Fulbright Scholars Association (BFSA) is the alumni association for British Fulbright Scholars. The BFSA is a private, non-profit organisation that promotes transatlantic relationships and international understanding through its network of Fulbright scholars. US-UK Fulbright alumni are also invited to join the State Alumni and Fulbright Association networks.\n\nAccording to the Fulbright website, the following individuals are notable alumni of the scholarship program:\n\n"}

This event is organized by Forum Foundation.\n\nThe first Forum was held in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain), from May 9 to September 26, 2004. It was organized by Barcelona's local council, the Catalan government (the Generalitat de Catalunya), the Spanish Government and UNESCO. It was conceived by Catalan prime mover (Pasqual Maragall, then Mayor of Barcelona) as a way of promoting the city's burgeoning tourist industry in the wake of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The official aims of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures included support for peace, sustainable development, human rights and respect for cultural diversity. However, many NGOs (including Greenpeace and Amnesty International) criticised the event for failing to live up to these lofty ideals and boycotted it as a result.\n\nThe event was controversial, with critics pointing to the $2.3 billion price tag and commercial sponsorship by multinationals (Endesa, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Telefónica, and Indra) with dubious reputations in the Third World. Several groups also criticised the massive property and coastline destruction involved in building the Forum site. This may explain why the Forum fell so far short of its projected attendance figures for the 141-day event. The forecasts were progressively scaled back from the planning stage, to 7 million and then 5 million during the event. The official final attendance figure was around 3.5 million, although even this figure is hotly disputed.\n\nThe 2007 Universal Forum of Cultures was held in Monterrey, Mexico. The event promoted Native American and \"White\" cultures.\n\nFor the third edition (2010), candidate cities were Chicago (United States), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Fukuoka (Japan), Alexandria (Egypt), Suwon and Gwangju (South Korea), Santiago de Chile and Valparaíso (Chile), Budapest (Hungary) and Durban (South Africa). Valparaíso, Chile was selected as host for the 2010 Universal Forum of Cultures.\nNaples, Italy was selected as host for the 2013 Universal Forum of Cultures, while both Quebec City, Canada and Amman, Jordan were selected to host the 2016 forum.

His latest works are „Speak German“ – a defence of the German language in the face of Anglicisms and „Man: A career“ which tells the story of Man’s rise to mastery of the Earth and plots our uncertain future.\n\nHis ideal is a concise written style, which avoids the typically German pitfalls of rambling sentences, separated verbs and complex constructions. Schneider is a critic of orthography reform and has founded with others the pressure group „living German“.\n\nHe has received several prizes and holds a chair as honorary professor in Salzburg.\n\n"}
