In 1995, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) transferred AARNet1 as a going concern to Telstra who then operated it as the initial Telstra Internet. Today, AARNet is Australia's National research and education network (NREN). It forms the Australian component of the global advanced research and education Internet network.\n\nAARNet Pty Ltd, which owns and operates the AARNet, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares. The shareholders are 38 Australian universities and the Australian CSIRO. AARNet's services in addition to Internet connectivity include Eduroam, voice, video and data storage services and a content mirror.\n\nAARNet was initially built between the University of Melbourne in Melbourne, where the international Internet feed initially landed, and university and CSIRO facilities in all Australian state capital cities and the Australian National University in Canberra. AARNet was formed in 1989 by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC).\n\nIn 1989, Kevin Robert Elz established the first permanent Internet feed to Australia, at the University of Melbourne. Until this time, researchers within Australia had limited access to the ARPANET, due to the high expense of providing communications between Australia and the United States. The national network infrastructure generally consisted of groups of hosts connected throughout the country exchanging mail and files on a periodic schedule using the SUN3 software and protocols, with several international dial-up links around the country exchanging this information where required.\n\nAARNet was initially built as a multi-protocol network, comprising Internet Protocol (IP) as well as DECnet and X.25 so as to accommodate pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet systems then in current use. With the rapid subsequent growth in popularity of the Internet, AARNet soon evolved into an IP-only network. In 1988, there were a number of popular network protocols, such as IBM SNA and X.25, and the ARPANET's IP protocol was only beginning to become favoured. Australian National University staff members Geoff Huston and Peter Elford were seconded by the AVCC in 1989 and tasked with technical management and build of the new network.\n\nAARNet introduced its 'value added reseller' program to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to use its network, the first being Connect.com.au in May 1994. AARNet gradually became a wholesale backbone ISP, serving over 300 smaller ISPs by June 1995. At that point, about 20% of total AARNet traffic was from these other users, and AVCC decided to sell the AARNet commercial assets to Telstra, who currently operates it under the name Telstra Internet.\n\nIn early 1997, AARNet2 went into service, a network that used ATM links and Internet services under a contract with Cable & Wireless Optus (CWO), now Optus. AARNet became a separate company from the AVCC in 1999.\n\nIn 2001 AARNet deployed its own international capacity by acquiring 310 Mbit/s of capacity from Sydney via Hawaii to Seattle. As of 2006, the current network is known as AARNet3, and the backbone uses a dark fibre network provided by Nextgen Networks.\n\nMajor milestones in the development of AARNet include:\n\n\n\n\n\nAARNet1 (1989–1997): Australia's first Internet:\n\nAARNet2 (1997–2006): Fostered the building of Optus' ATM and Optus' Internet networks:\n\nAARNet3 (2006–2013): The AARNet optical network:\n\nAARNet4 (2013–present): The AARNet optical network grows:\n\nAARNet was established in 1989 originally as an activity under the auspices of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC).\n\nAARNet was formed into a separate company on 22 December 1998.\nAARNet Pty Ltd, ACN 084540518, ABN 54 084 540 518, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares.\nThe shareholders are 38 of Australia's universities and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).\n\nAARNet Pty Ltd became a licensed telecommunications carrier (Telco) under the Australian Telecommunications Act on 27 November 2000, becoming Australian carrier number 61.\n\nThe AARNet4 national network comprises high capacity optical fibre transmission paths between switching centres in major cities from Cairns to Perth as well as branch lines to Darwin, Hobart and several other locations. Because optical fibre repair times are long, the backbone network follows two physically diverse paths. As at late 2013, capacity on each leg of the routed network was between 10 and 100 gigabit per second (Gbit/s). Starting with only 48 kbit/s national backbone capacity in 1990, this reflects a similarly rapid exponential growth rate as for AARNet's international capacity.\n\nThe Network peers with external content providers and ISPs to increase performance and availability of the network. The organisation has a selective peering policy for peering with other providers. This policy applies to all requests for settlement-free interconnection with AARNet, either via dedicated connections or traffic via public internet exchanges.\n\nAARNet provides the Internet to several million end-user devices at Australian universities, CSIRO, various other research and educational institutions, and some hospitals. Customer site connections are mostly at 1 to 10 Gbit/s rates, with most end-user Ethernet services at 1 Gbit/s, and Eduroam services at available Wi-Fi performance levels.\n\nAARNet's layer 3 services are usually delivered at the AARNet PoP sites. With the introduction of the AARNet3 optical fibre network (i.e. from 2006 onwards) AARNet progressively developed capability to extend services to customer sites in some locations, as well as providing layer 1 and layer 2 inter-campus connections in those areas. Prior to that, and at other locations, it is end-customer institutions' responsibility to extend services to site and to provision their own inter-campus network links. These are either operated directly by AARNet such as in Queensland or provided by companion networks such as SABRENet in South Australia and VERNet in Victoria.\n\nSummary of AARNet national IP network performance levels as at 2013:\n\nAARNet provides the Australian component of the global advanced Research and Education Internet network. AARNet has high capacity interconnections with North American (Internet2),\nEuropean (GÉANT) and Asian (TEIN3) components of the global network.\n\nAs at late 2014, AARNet operated a total capacity of 120 Gbit/s to North America and a further 5 Gbit/s to Asia. This equates to a 2.2 million-fold increase over AARNet's initial trans-Pacific capacity of 56 kbit/s in 1990 and represents an average doubling time of aggregate international capacity of only 14 months over the entire history of AARNet (cf. Moore's Law).\n\nIn addition to providing high capacity Internet transmission and routing services and a comprehensive range of core Internet services including BGP, DNS, NTP and IPv6, AARNet also provides a variety of higher-layer network services including:\nTo further optimise network traffic loads, AARNet operates high capacity peering links with various major content providers including the Australian ABC, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nThroughout their life, a major driver for the very high capacities of advanced Research and Education Internet networks including AARNet has been to meet the needs of data-intensive research across a wide range of research disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities. For example, to interconnect major research instruments such as synchrotrons and telescopes in remote locations to high performance computer systems and researchers around the world, such as astronomers in Europe viewing the southern sky using telescopes in Australia or high resolution realtime video links between remote locations.\n\nMost recently, AARNet has built a 100 Gbit/s WDM optical fibre transmission system from Perth to Geraldton and on to the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia in support of Australia's component of the international Square Kilometre Array project and the initial ASKAP telescope array at the MRO.\n\n"}

Students who attain between 60 and the passing grade get the chance to take an extra test that reviews the whole year's curriculum, and in which a 70 is needed to achieve a passing score.\n\nOften high schools will raise the pass grade to 75 in order to push their students to achieve a higher grade. This only applies to the highest high school grades, which are 10th and 11th grade. This method is primarily focused on improving grades by encouraging a higher cumulative grade point average throughout both years, leading towards a set of final exams in which this average grade becomes critically important.\n"}

Kaufman (born April 1944) is an American psychology professor known for his work on intelligence testing.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, Kaufman earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965; M.A. in Educational Psychology from Columbia University in 1967; and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1970 (under Robert L. Thorndike), specializing in psychometrics.\n\nHe has been married to psychologist Nadeen L. Kaufman since 1964. While Assistant Director at The Psychological Corporation from 1968 to 1974, he worked closely with David Wechsler on the revision of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and supervised the standardization of the revised version (WISC-R). He also collaborated with Dorothea McCarthy in the development and standardization of the McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities. He held positions at University of Georgia (1974–1979) and University of Alabama (1984–1995) before taking a position at Yale University.\n\nBoth have been at Yale University's Child Study Center in the School of Medicine since 1997.\n\nThe research team that Kaufman and his wife supervised while at the University of Georgia in 1978-79 developed the original Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) and several other psychological and educational tests, including the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (K-TEA/NU), Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT), and the second editions of both ( KTEA-II and KBIT-2). The Kaufman Survey of Early Academic and Language Skills (K-SEALS) and the Cognitive/Language Profile of the Early Screening Profiles address the preschool level. The Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test (KAIT), the Kaufman Short Neuropsychological Assessment Procedure (K-SNAP), and the Kaufman Functional Academic Skills Test (K-FAST) extend through the adult life span.\n\nIn 2004/2005, revised versions of the Kaufmans' tests were published, including the KABC-II, KTEA-II, and KBIT-2. The KABC-II integrates both the PASS and CHC theories of intelligence.\n\nKaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT)\n\nThe Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) is a brief, individually administered measure of verbal (vocabulary subtest) and non verbal (Matrices subtest) intelligence. It can be used with those aged 4–90 years old and takes between 15–30 minutes to administer. It can be useful in a variety of settings including clinical, educational, vocational, and research settings. The original KBIT was published in 1990, the second edition followed in 2004.\n\nThe KBIT-2 generates three scores: Verbal, Non Verbal and an overall IQ composite. Theoretically the verbal subtests measure crystallised ability and the non verbal subtests measure fluid reasoning.\n\nThe Verbal portion of the KBIT-2 is made up of two subtests, Verbal Knowledge and Riddles. These measure verbal, school related skills by measuring an individuals word knowledge, verbal concept formation, reasoning ability and range of general information. The Non Verbal portion is made up of the Matrices subtest and measures the ability to solve new problems by assessing ability to perceive relationships and complete visual analogies.\n\nKaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA)\n\nThe KTEA provides an individually administered measure of educational achievement for those aged 4 years 6 months – 25 years (comprehensive form) and 4 years 6 months – 90+ (brief form). The test can be used to identify an individual’s strengths and weaknesses in three key domains: maths, written language and spoken language. It can also be used as part of a comprehensive psychological, psychoeducational or neuropsychological test battery which can enhance understanding of the individuals total functioning.\n\nThe current edition was published in 2004. Since its publication it has become a widely used measure of academic achievement in education. The test takes between 15–80 minutes to administer and there are two alternate forms which enables it to be used to monitor progress or response to intervention.\n\nThe Comprehensive Form consists of 14 subtests grouped into 4 domain composites, 4 reading-related composites, an overall Comprehensive Achievement Composite in addition to separate subtest scores.\n\nThe Brief Form is a curriculum-based instrument which provides norm-referenced assessment in the same three core achievement domains as the comprehensive form. There is no content overlap with the Comprehensive Form, it can be used for retesting and includes the following subtests:\n\n\nThe Brief Form provides a battery composite as well as subtest scores in reading, maths and spelling.\n\nWidely regarded as a teacher and mentor, as well as a researcher, Kaufman's cadre of doctoral students at the University of Georgia has gone on to become a significant influence in the field as well. Kaufman mentored, among others, Cecil R. Reynolds, Randy W. Kamphaus, Bruce Bracken, Steve McCallum, Jack A. Naglieri, and Patti Harrison, all of whom became Professors at major universities and authors of some of the most widely used psychological tests in the United States. Also Kaufman with his wife, Nadeen, supervised foreign doctoral students at the University of Alabama including Toshinori Ishikuma and Soo-Back Moon, who became influential Professors in mother countries and translated and adopted the K-ABC for Japanese and Korean children, respectively.\n\n\nHis son is a professor and researcher in psychology (creativity): James C. Kaufman.\n\n"}
{"id": "242819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242819", "title": "Alma mater", "text": "Alma mater\n\nAlma mater (, ; pl. [rarely used] ) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university, school, or college that one formerly attended. The phrase is variously translated as \"nourishing mother\", \"nursing mother\", or \"fostering mother\", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students. Fine arts will often depict educational institutions using a robed woman as a visual metaphor.\n\nBefore its current usage, \"alma mater\" was an honorific title for various Latin mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele, and later in Catholicism for the Virgin Mary. It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto \"Alma Mater Studiorum\" (\"nurturing mother of studies\"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to \"alumnus\", a term used for a university graduate that literally means a \"nursling\" or \"one who is nourished\".\n\nAlthough \"alma\" (nourishing) was a common epithet for Ceres, Cybele, Venus, and other mother goddesses, it was not frequently used in conjunction with \"mater\" in classical Latin. In the \"Oxford Latin Dictionary\", the phrase is attributed to Lucretius' \"De rerum natura\", where it is used as an epithet to describe an earth goddess:\n<poem lang=\"la\" style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\">Denique caelesti sumus omnes semine oriundi\nomnibus ille idem pater est, unde alma liquentis\numoris guttas mater cum terra recepit (2.991–93)</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\">We are all sprung from that celestial seed,\nall of us have same father, from whom earth,\nthe nourishing mother, receives drops of liquid moisture</poem>\n\nAfter the fall of Rome, the term came into Christian liturgical usage in association with the Virgin Mary. \"Alma Redemptoris Mater\" is a well-known 11th century antiphon devoted to Mary.\n\nThe earliest documented use of the term to refer to a university in an English-speaking country is in 1600, when the University of Cambridge printer, John Legate, began using an emblem for the university's press. The device's first-known appearance is on the title-page of William Perkins' \"A Golden Chain\", where the Latin phrase \"Alma Mater Cantabrigia\" (\"nourishing mother Cambridge\") is inscribed on a pedestal bearing a nude, lactating woman wearing a mural crown. In English etymological reference works, the first university-related usage is often cited in 1710, when an academic mother figure is mentioned in a remembrance of Henry More by Richard Ward.\n\nMany historic European universities have adopted \"Alma Mater\" as part of the Latin translation of their official name. The University of Bologna Latin name, (nourishing mother of studies), refers to its status as the oldest continuously operating university in the world. Other European universities, such as the Alma Mater Lipsiensis in Leipzig, Germany, or Alma Mater Jagiellonica, Poland, have similarly used the expression in conjunction with geographical or foundational characteristics. At least one, the Alma Mater Europaea in Salzburg, Austria, an international university founded by the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2010, uses the term as its official name.\n\nIn the United States, the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, has been called the \"Alma Mater of the Nation\" because of its ties to the country's founding. At Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, the main student government is known as the Alma Mater Society.\n\nThe ancient Roman world had many statues of the Alma Mater, some still extant (e.g., at the Palatine Hill in Rome).\n\nModern sculptures are found in prominent locations on several American university campuses. For example, in the United States: there is a well-known bronze statue of \"Alma Mater\" by Daniel Chester French situated on the steps of Columbia University's Low Library; the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign also has an \"Alma Mater\" statue by Lorado Taft. An altarpiece mural in Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, painted in 1932 by Eugene Savage, depicts the \"Alma Mater\" as a bearer of light and truth, standing in the midst of the personified arts and sciences.\n\nOutside the United States, there is an \"Alma Mater\" sculpture on the steps of the monumental entrance to the Universidad de La Habana, in Havana, Cuba. The statue was cast in 1919 by Mario Korbel, with Feliciana Villalón Wilson as the inspiration for \"Alma Mater\", and it was installed in its current location in 1927, at the direction of architect Raul Otero.\n\n"}

{"id": "433707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=433707", "title": "Clarence Irving Lewis", "text": "Clarence Irving Lewis\n\nClarence Irving Lewis (April 12, 1883 – February 3, 1964), usually cited as C. I. Lewis, was an American academic philosopher and the founder of conceptual pragmatism. First a noted logician, he later branched into epistemology, and during the last 20 years of his life, he wrote much on ethics. \"The New York Times\" memorialized him as \"a leading authority on symbolic logic and on the philosophic concepts of knowledge and value.\"\n\nLewis was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts. His father was a skilled worker in a shoe factory, and Lewis grew up in relatively humble circumstances. He discovered philosophy at age 13, when reading about the Greek pre-Socratics, Anaxagoras and Heraclitus in particular. The first work of philosophy Lewis recalled studying was a short history of Greek philosophy by Marshall. Immanuel Kant proved a major lifelong influence on Lewis's thinking. In his article \"Logic and Pragmatism\", Lewis wrote: \"Nothing comparable in importance happened [in my life] until I became acquainted with Kant... Kant compelled me. He had, so I felt, followed scepticism to its inevitable last stage, and laid the foundations where they could not be disturbed.\"\n\nIn 1902, he entered Harvard. Since his parents were not able to help him financially, he had to work as a waiter to earn his tuition. In 1905, Harvard College awarded Lewis the Bachelor of Arts \"cum laude\" after a mere three years of study, during which time he supported himself with part-time jobs. He then taught English for one year in a high school in Quincy, Massachusetts, then two years at the University of Colorado. In 1906, he married Mable Maxwell Graves. In 1908, Lewis returned to Harvard and began a Ph.D. in philosophy, which he completed in a mere two years. He then taught philosophy at the University of California, 1911–20, after which he returned again to Harvard, where he taught until his 1953 retirement, eventually filling the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy. His Harvard course on Kant's first \"Critique\" was among the most famous in undergraduate philosophy in the U.S. until he retired.\n\nLewis's life was not free of trials. His daughter died in 1930 and he suffered a heart attack in 1932. Nevertheless, the publications of Lewis (1929) and Lewis and Langford (1932) attest to these years having been a highly productive period of his life. During this same period, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929, and in 1933, he presided over the American Philosophical Association.\n\nLewis accepted a visiting professorship at Stanford during 1957–58, where he presented his lectures for the last time. For the academic year 1959–60, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University. The move to Menlo Park enabled him and his wife to spend his final years near their grandchildren.\n\nLewis studied logic under his eventual Ph.D. thesis supervisor, Josiah Royce, and is a principal architect of modern philosophical logic. In 1912, two years after the publication of the first volume of \"Principia Mathematica\", Lewis began publishing articles taking exception to \n\"Principia' \"s pervasive use of material implication, more specifically, to Bertrand Russell's reading of \"a\"→\"b\" as \"\"a\" implies \"b\".\" Lewis restated this criticism in his reviews of both editions of \"Principia Mathematica\". Lewis's reputation as a promising young logician was soon assured.\n\nMaterial implication allows a true consequent to follow from a false antecedent. Lewis proposed to replace material implication with strict implication, such that a (contingently) false antecedent does not always strictly imply a (contingently) true consequent. This strict implication was not primitive, but defined in terms of negation, conjunction, and a prefixed unary intensional modal operator, formula_1. If \"X\" is a formula with a classical bivalent truth value, then formula_1\"X\" can be read as \"\"X\" is possibly true\". Lewis then defined \"\"A\" strictly implies \"B\"\" as \"formula_3(\"A\"formula_4\"B\")\". Lewis's strict implication is now a historical curiosity, but the formal modal logic in which he grounded that notion is the ancestor of all modern work on the subject. Lewis' formula_1 notation is still standard, but current practice usually takes its dual, formula_6 (\"necessity\"), as primitive and formula_1 as defined, in which case \"\"A\" strictly implies \"B\"\" is simply written as formula_6(\"A\"→\"B\").\n\nHis first logic text, \"A Survey of Symbolic Logic\" (1918), went out of print after selling several hundred copies. At the time of its publication, it included the only discussion in English of the logical writings of Charles Sanders Peirce and only the second monograph, after Russell's of 1900, on Leibniz. While the modal logic of \"A Survey\" was soon proved inconsistent, Lewis went on to devise the modal systems S1 to S5, and to set these out in \"Symbolic Logic\" (1932) as possible formal analyses of the alethic modalities. Lewis mildly preferred S2 over the others; the amended modal system of \"A Survey\" was S3, but it is S4 and S5 that have generated sustained interest, mathematical as well as philosophical, down to the present day. S4 and S5 are the beginning of what is now called normal modal logic. On Lewis' strict implication and his modal systems S1-S5, see Hughes and Cresswell (1996: chapt. 11).\n\nThis section follows Dayton (2004) closely. Around 1930, American philosophy began to experience a turning point because of the arrival of logical empiricism, brought by European philosophers fleeing Nazi Germany. This new doctrine challenged American philosophers of a naturalistic or pragmatic bent, such as Lewis. In any event, logical empiricism, with its emphasis on scientific models of knowledge and on the logical analysis of meaning, soon emerged as a, and perhaps \"the\", dominant tendency in American philosophy.\n\nWhile many saw Lewis as kin to the logical empiricists, he was never truly comfortable in such company because he declined to divorce experience from cognition. Positivism rejected value as lacking cognitive significance, also rejecting the analysis of experience in favor of physicalism. Both rejections struck him as regrettable. Indeed, his growing awareness of the pragmatic tradition led him in the opposite direction. For Lewis, it is only within experience that anything can have significance for anything, and thus he came to see value as a way of representing the significance of knowledge for future conduct. These convictions led him to reflect on the differences between pragmatism and positivism, and on the cognitive structure of value experiences.\n\nLewis agreed that pragmatism committed one to the Peircean pragmatic test. But in a 1930 essay, \"Pragmatism and Current Thought,\" he maintained that this commitment can be taken in either of two directions. One direction emphasises the subjectivity of experience. The other direction, and the one he took in 'his (1929), began with the Peirce's limitation of meaning to that which makes a verifiable difference in experience. Hence concepts are abstractions in which \"the immediate is precisely that element which must be left out.\" But this claim must be properly understood. An operational account of concepts mainly eliminates the ineffable: \"If your hours are felt as twice as long as mine, your pounds twice as heavy, that makes no difference, which can be tested, in our assignment of physical properties to things.\" Hence a concept is but a relational pattern. But it does not follow that one ought to discard the world as it is experienced:\n\"In one sense, that of connotation, a concept strictly comprises nothing but an abstract configuration of relations. In another sense, its denotation or empirical application, this meaning is vested in a process which characteristically begins with something given and ends with something done in the operation which translates a presented datum into an instrument of prediction and control.\"\n\nThus knowledge begins and ends in experience, keeping in mind that the beginning and ending experiences differ. Knowledge of something requires that the verifying experience be actually experienced. Thus for the pragmatist, verifiability as an operational definition (or test) of the empirical meaning of a statement requires that the speaker know how to apply the statement, and when not to apply it, and be able to trace the consequences of the statement in situations both real and hypothetical.\n\nLewis firmly objected to the positivist conception of value statements as devoid of cognitive content, as merely expressive. For a pragmatist, all judgements are implicitly value judgements. Lewis (1946) sets out both his conception of sense meaning, and his thesis that valuation is a form of empirical cognition.\n\nIn his essay \"Logical Positivism and Pragmatism,\" Lewis revealed his disagreement with verificationism by comparing it unfavorably with his preferred pragmatic conception of empirical meaning. From the outset, he saw both pragmatism and logical positivism as forms of empiricism. At first glance, it would seem that the pragmatic conception of meaning, despite its different formulation and its focus on action, very much resembles the logical positivist verification requirement. Nevertheless, Lewis argued that there is a deep difference between the two: pragmatism ultimately grounds meaning on conceivable experience, while positivism reduces the relation between meaning and experience to a matter of logical form.\n\nFor Lewis, the positivist conception of meaning omits precisely what a pragmatist would count as empirical meaning. Specifying which observation sentences follow from a given sentence helps us determine the empirical meaning of the given sentence only if the observation sentences themselves have an already understood meaning in terms of the specific qualities of experience to which the predicates of the observation sentences refer. Thus Lewis saw the logical positivists as failing to distinguish between \"linguistic\" meaning, namely the logical relations among terms, and \"empirical\" meaning, namely the relation expressions have to experience. (In the well-known terminology of Carnap and Charles W. Morris, empirical meaning falls under pragmatics, linguistic meaning under semantics.) For Lewis, the logical positivist shuts his eyes to precisely that which properly confirms a sentence, namely the content of experience.\n\nLewis (1929), \"Mind and the World Order\", is now seen as one of the most important 20th century works in epistemology. Lewis is now included among the American pragmatists, a belated assessment that is the major theme of Murphey (2005).\n\nLewis's late writings on ethics include the monographs Lewis (1955, 1957) and the posthumous collection Lewis (1969). From 1950 until his death, he wrote many drafts of chapters of a proposed treatise on ethics, which he did not live to complete. These drafts are included in the Lewis papers held at Stanford University.\n\nLewis (1947) contains two chapters on aesthetics and the philosophy of art. He was the first to employ the term \"qualia\", popularized by his student Nelson Goodman, in its generally agreed modern sense.\n\nLewis's work has been relatively neglected in recent years, even though he set out his ideas at length. He can be understood as both a late pragmatist and an early analytic philosopher, and had students of the calibre of Brand Blanshard, Nelson Goodman, and Roderick Chisholm. Joel Isaac, in his contribution to the 2006 \"Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society\" symposium referenced below, believes this neglect is justified. Lewis's reputation is benefiting from the growing interest in the historical aspects of pragmatism and of American philosophy generally.\n\nLewis's papers are kept at Stanford University.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A not-for-profit organization, CAAHEP is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). It is based in Clearwater, Florida.\n\n\nThe individuals who serve as Commissioners are representatives from CAAHEP's sponsoring organizations, along with a recent graduate of a CAAHEP accredited program and members of the general public. The Commissioners approve the organization's mission, vision, and bylaws, and decide which health science professions qualify to take part in the CAAHEP accreditation system. CAAHEP is also led by a Board of Directors, whose members are elected from among the Commissioners.When an education program in a health science profession seeks CAAHEP accreditation, the program will work with that profession's Committee on Accreditation (CoA).\n\nIn 1904, the American Medical Association established its Council on Medical Education (CME). The CME developed a rating system of medical schools in 1905, initiated inspections in 1906, and classified the institutions in 1907. The AMA then collaborated with the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study of the quality of medical education that resulted in the Flexner Report in 1910. These early efforts subsequently led to the development of specialized accreditation for the education of health professionals. It was also the precursor of accreditation activities for most other professional associations.\n\nEarly in the 1930s, several national bodies requested the collaboration of the AMA in establishing accreditation for education programs in their areas of interest. These early efforts established a basis and pattern for the role of the AMA in collaborating with other national associations for the accreditation of health sciences education programs. From 1935 through 1976, the recognized agency was the AMA Council on Medical Education. In 1976 the CME delegated to the newly formed Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) the responsibility and authority for health sciences education accreditation. In October, 1992 the AMA announced its intent to support the establishment of a new and independent agency to assume the accreditation responsibilities of CAHEA\n\nCAAHEP accredits over 2,200 programs in 28 health science disciplines. The programs reside in more than 1,300 postsecondary educational institutions across the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

Situated in two buildings located on the central campus of the University of Strasbourg, EOST consist of more than 150 permanent employees among its staff.\n\nThe School and Observatory for Earth Sciences was created by decree in 1997 from the fusion of the Geology and Earth Physics institutes of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Strasbourg. Interests in Earth Physics arose around 1880 in Germany with the birth of seismology and meteorology. The origin of the Geology Institute is even older and is linked to the French development of the University during the first half of the 19th century.\nAfter the annexation of Alsace by Germany, the Imperial University pursued a policy of elitism, basing its excellence on fundamental research as practiced at the University of Wilhelm von Humboldt (early 19th century). The same model was used when the French Grandes Ecoles were built. \nSince 1920, the IPGS and the IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris) conducted research and geophysical observations non-stop, without interruption during the War. Between 1939 and 1945, the IPGS was relocated in Clermont-Ferrand, were the Diplômes d'Ingénieurs were signed by Louis Cagnard, a famous French geophysicist.\n\nThe EOST engineering school is a French Grande École specialized in Earth sciences and accredited to deliver European University degrees, such as the Licence/Master/Doctorat, but also the French Diplôme d'Ingénieur. The school is a component of the University of Strasbourg. \nProfessors and researchers of the EOST are either affiliated with the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg (IPGS) or with the Laboratoire d'Hydrologie et de Géochimie de Strasbourg (LHyGeS). External keynote speakers from the industry and various research organisms also contribute extensively to teaching at the EOST.\n\nAfter two years of Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles, students take part into a national competitive examination. According to their results and ranking, they may apply to the EOST:\n\nThe school delivers the Diplôme d'Ingénieur de l'Ecole et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre de l'Université de Strasbourg, which is equivalent to a master's degree in Geophysical Engineering.\n\nThe classes are distributed as follows (as of 2011/2012):\n\nAfter the first semester of their third year, students need to complete an internship in the industry or in a research organism in order to obtain their degree.\nIn parallel, the top students who want to pursue in the academy can enroll in a master's degree - one in Earth Sciences (delivered by the University of Strasbourg), and one in Environmental Sciences and Engineering (co-delivered by the University of Strasbourg and the Ecole Nationale du Génie de l'Eau et de l'Environnement).\n\nThe EOST can deliver two different double degrees in partnership with\n\nMoreover, student exchanges are highly encouraged and partnerships with the following universities have been established through the Erasmus student exchange program \n\nSeveral organizations are based in the EOST buildings:\nThe EOST is also a member of \n\n\nA more extensive list of alumni can be found on.\n\nEOST hosts two research units: the Institute of Physics of the Earth of Strasbourg IPGS and the Laboratory of hydrology and geochemistry of Strasbourg LHyGeS.\n\nOnce dedicated to more general scientific topics, research at IPGS is currently focused on the comprehension of geological and geophysical phenomenon as well as applied sciences: environment, natural resources (energy, water) and hazards (seismic risks, landslides).\n\nSince its beginning in 2009 by the gathering of 3 research teams, the LHyGeS is dedicated to the analysis and the understanding of hydrological and geochemical phenomenon in natural environments. This unit focuses on the construction of quantitative and predictive patterns, through an approach combining geosciences, environmental and engineering sciences.\n\nEOST is the leader of the \"laboratory of excellence\" G-eau-thermie profonde project aiming to initiate a new research center for deep geothermal energy. Improving the knowledge of deep geothermal reservoirs and developing techniques are the main goals for the exploitation of this sustainable resource.\n\nEOST is involved in the REALISE network (Réseau Alsacien des Laboratoires en Ingénierie et Sciences de l’Environnement) and also provides leadership and administration. This network sets out to structure regional environmental research.\n\nEOST is an Observatory of Universe Sciences (OSU) under the supervisory authority of the CNRS (French national center for scientific research) and the University of Strasbourg. Its missions are to contribute to the monitoring of natural phenomenon and to provide the scientific community with data. \nEarthquakes, magnetic fields, gravity force, water chemical composition, gravitational instability are some examples of the natural phenomenon observed by EOST. To understand operational mechanisms at different time and space scales require human and instrumental resources.\nObservation is based on measuring devices relaying data to computer systems acquisition and processing. Maintenance and improvement of these tools are an important part of the mission of the observatories.\nData analysis and model building is part of the mission as well as providing the scientific community with data. It aims to the better understanding and prediction of natural phenomenon. \nEach year, a great amount of published scientific articles are based on data collected by EOST’s observational services, organized into themes: seismology, geodesy and gravimetry, magnetism, landslide processes, environment. \nEOST is the national coordinator (for the BCSF or OHGE) or active participant member of national networks (as the BCMT or RENAG). This network organization allows the sharing of means and skills.\n\nThe record and analysis of seismic waves enable researchers to understand the earth dynamics and to improve knowledge of seismic hazard. \nEOST is in charge of measuring devices localized both in the North-East of France and abroad (Sénégal, Terres Austales et Antarctiques Françaises). They are integrated in national (Réseau large Bande Permanent RLBP, Réseau Accélérométrique Permanent,…) and international networks. \nEOST is the national coordinator of the RLBP as well as the Bureau Central sismologique Français (BCSF) and the Réseau national de surveillance sismique (RéNaSS).These last two centralize all earthquakes data located on the French territory. Instrumental data are completed by population enquiries: the BCSF gathers comments on earthquakes felt in France.\n\n\nGeodesy and gravimetry allow the analysis of earth structure and strain. These methods are complementary to seismology.\nThe geodesic observational service of Strasbourg is part of the Réseau National de Géodésie RENAG (national geodesic network). EOST is responsible for 8 GPS stations located in the Rhénan area, assigned to study the tectonic strain of the North-East of France. \nEOST is also responsible for the Gravimetric observatory of Strasbourg. Through a supraconductive gravimeter, the observatory provides relative and continuous gravity field measurements. The observatory is part of the international project Global Geodynamics Project (GGP).\nThe project MIGA intends to create a new infrastructure based on quantum mechanics. This infrastructure will allow a better comprehension of terrestrial gravity variations and its implications.\n\n\nObservation of magnetism aims to comprehend the origins of magnetic fields variations at different time scales. \nEOST runs six permanent magnetic stations located in the Terres Australes et Antarctiques Française and in Madagascar Island. They are part of the Bureau Central de magnétisme terrestre (BCMT) network, under the supervisory authority of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, and the international network INTERMAGNET (INTERnational Real-time MAGnetic observatory NETwork).\n\nL’Observatoire multidisciplinaire des instabilités des versants OMIV (Multidisciplinary observatory for landsides processes) follows the evolution of several landslides in France through geophysics, geodesic, geochemical and hydrologic data. EOST is responsible for the Super-Sauze, La Valette (Southern Alps) and Villerville (Normandie) landslides as well as the coordination of the acquisition and the analysis of kinematics data.\n\nThe main study site of the Observatoire hydro-géochimique de l’environnement (OHGE) is a granitic catchment basin: the Strengbach. This site is located in the Vosgian massif between 800 and 1100 meters high. The ecosystems and its changes, linked to natural or anthropic disruption, have been studied and monitored for more than twenty-five years throughout a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n\nThe Museum of seismology and terrestrial magnetism, located in the former seismological station of Strasbourg, inaugurated on 1 July 1900, displays instruments for geophysical measurements and their evolution throughout history. \nThe collection of the Museum of mineralogy hosts more than 30 000 international samples of minerals and meteors. Many of the most beautiful pieces are frequently exposed in France and abroad. The museum is situated in a historical monument of EOST, built at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n"}

Truman on the condition of higher education in the United States. The commission to write this report was established on July 13, 1946, and it was chaired by George F. Zook. \n\nThe report is significant not only for its six-volume size but for the fact that it marks the first time in United States history that a President establishes a commission for the purposes of analyzing the country's system of education, a task typically left to the states as prescribed by the Tenth Amendment. Such Presidential commissions are, today, relatively common. See, for example, President Ronald Reagan's, A Nation at Risk, and President George W. Bush's, \"A Test of Leadership,\" sometimes known as The Spellings Report. \n\nThe Truman Commission Report, as it is sometimes known, calls for several significant changes in postsecondary education, among them, the establishment of a network of public community colleges, which would be free of charge for \"all youth who can profit from such education\". The commission helped popularize the phrase \"community college\" in the late 1940s and helped shape the future of two-year degree institutions in the U.S. The report also calls for increased Federal spending in the form of \"scholarships, fellowships, and general aid\".\n\n"}
{"id": "28275514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28275514", "title": "Higher education bubble in the United States", "text": "Higher education bubble in the United States\n\nThe higher education bubble in the United States is a claim that excessive investment in higher education could have negative repercussions in the broader economy. According to the claim generally associated with fiscal conservatives while college tuition payments are rising, the supply of college graduates in many fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, which aggravates graduate unemployment and underemployment, which in turn increases the burden of student loan defaults on financial institutions and taxpayers. Also, some claim that employers have responded to the oversupply of graduates by raising the academic requirements of many occupations higher than is really necessary to perform the work. The claim has generally been used to justify cuts to public higher education spending, tax cuts, or a shift of government spending towards the criminal justice system and the Department of Defense.\n\nBenjamin Ginsberg explains the connection between the increased ability to pay tuition and the increase in services provided in his book \"The Fall of the Faculty.\" According to Ginsberg, \"there have been new sorts of demands for administrative services that require more managers per student or faculty member than was true in the past.\" The Goldwater Institute echoes this sentiment with its findings that, \"Between 1993 and 2007, the number of full-time administrators per 100 students at America's leading universities grew by 39 percent, while the number of employees engaged in teaching, research or service only grew by 18 percent.\"\n\nAs discussed below, the \"higher education bubble\" is controversial and has been rejected by some economists. Indeed, many Americans still believe in the value of a college education, although they are unsure about its quality and affordability. Data shows that the wage premium the difference between what those with a four-year college degree earn and what those with only a high school education earn has increased dramatically since the 1970s, but so has the 'debt load' incurred by students due to the tuition inflation.\nThe data also suggests that, notwithstanding a slight increase in 2008–09, student loan default rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s. Those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed, even though they are more expensive to employ (they earn higher wages). The global management consulting firm McKinsey and Company projects a shortage of college-trained workers, and a surplus of workers without college degrees, which would cause the wage premium to increase, and cause differences in unemployment rates to become even more dramatic. What is also interesting is that the cost of tuition over last 4 years from 2009–12 has been increasing steadily over the years while wages have remained stagnant.\nThe inflation has been at really low levels in US in past 4 years and there are no explainable reasons why Cost of Masters / Graduation is rising higher than inflation\n\nIn 1971, \"Time\" ran an article \"Education: Graduates and Jobs: A Grave New World,\" which stated that the supply of post-graduate students was around twice larger than the expected future demand in upcoming decades. In 1987, U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett first suggested that the availability of loans may in fact be fueling an increase in tuition prices and an education bubble. This \"Bennett hypothesis\" claims that readily available loans allow schools to increase tuition prices without regard to demand elasticity. College rankings are partially driven by spending levels, and higher tuition prices are correlated with increased public perceptions of . Over the past thirty years, demand has increased as institutions improved facilities and provided more resources to students. Additionally, schools tend to enroll fewer students as they improve student offerings and increase prices. This suggests that it is in schools' best interest to increase tuition prices as much as possible, so long as financial aid ensures an ability to pay on the part of students and parents.\n\nA variation on the higher education bubble theory suggests that there is no general bubble in higher education that is, on average, higher education really does boost income and employment by more than enough to make it a good investment but that degrees in some specific fields may be overvalued because they do little to boost income or improve job prospects, while degrees in other fields may in fact be \"undervalued\" because students do not appreciate the extent to which these degrees could benefit their employment prospects and future income. Proponents of this theory have noted that schools charge equal prices for tuition regardless of what students study, the interest rate on federal student loans is not adjusted according to risk, and there is evidence that undergraduate students in their first 3 years of college are not very good at predicting future wages by major.\n\nA 2011 article in \"The Huffington Post\", related concern that new college graduates hiring rates are up by 10 percent and that attaining a secondary level education eventually pays off. It is also suggested that high school graduates are three times more likely to live in poverty than students with higher education degrees. A recent study from the Labor Department suggests that attaining a bachelor's degree \"represents a significant advantage in the job market\". However, the article also claims that those who only have a high school education unemployment is slightly higher at a rate of 9.3 percent. The proponents of the article also claim that companies are most likely to hire an applicant straight from college rather than one who has been unemployed.\n\nA 2010 article in \"The Christian Science Monitor\", suggest ten main benefits of obtaining a degree via higher education. Also suggesting that a college degree pays off financially and intangibly for the graduate, and overall for society. In November 2011, \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" ran an article claiming that the future is bright for college graduates and expected to improve. A rapid 10% increase is anticipated for new bachelor's hires. A survey conducted by \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" suggests that 40 percent of 3,300 employers plan to hire graduates from all fields of study. The survey suggested stability in the upcoming job market.\n\nA 2009 article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", related concern from parents wondering whether it is worth the price to send their children to college. \"The Economist\" in turn hypothesized that the bubble bursting may make it harder for colleges to fill their classes, and that some building projects will come to a halt. The \"Boston Herald\" further suggested the possibility of mergers, closures and even bankruptcies of smaller colleges that have spent too much and taken on too much debt. \"National Review\" writer Dan Lips has proposed that the bubble's bursting may bring down higher education prices.\n\nGlenn Reynolds wrote in the \"Washington Examiner\" that those who have financed their educations with debt may be particularly hard-hit.\nReynolds continued arguing his case in \"The Higher Education Bubble\" where he noted that higher education, as a \"product grows more and more elaborate and more expensive but the expense is offset by cheap credit provided by sellers who are eager to encourage buyers to buy.\"\n\nFurther speculation as to the higher education bubble was the focus of a series of articles in \"The Economist\" in 2011.\n\nThe view that higher education is a bubble is controversial. Most economists do not think the returns to college education are falling in fact, the data suggests the rate of return is increasing. Indeed, the returns to education are much higher than the returns to other forms of investment such as the stock market, bonds, real estate, and private equity. This suggests underinvestment in higher education the exact opposite of a bubble. Studies have typically found a causal relationship between growth and education, although the \"quality\" and type of education matters, and not just the number of years of schooling.\n\nIn a financial bubble, assets like houses are sometimes purchased with a view to reselling at a higher price, and this can produce rapidly escalating prices as people speculate on future prices. An end to the spiral can provoke abrupt selling of the assets, resulting in an abrupt collapse in price the bursting of the bubble. Because the asset acquired through college attendance a higher education cannot be sold (only rented through wages), there is no similar mechanism that would cause an abrupt collapse in the value of existing degrees. For this reason this analogy could be misleading. However, one rebuttal to the claims that a bubble analogy is misleading is the observation that the 'bursting' of the bubble are the negative effects on students who incur student debt, for example, as the American Association of State Colleges and Universities reports that \"Students are deeper in debt today than ever before ... The trend of heavy debt burdens threatens to limit access to higher education, particularly for low-income and first-generation students, who tend to carry the heaviest debt burden. Federal student aid policy has steadily put resources into student loan programs rather than need-based grants, a trend that straps future generations with high debt burdens. Even students who receive federal grant aid are finding it more difficult to pay for college.\" In this analogy, the increased inability of students to pay for their debt would represent the crash or bubble bursting, thus causing the tax payers to bail out the government for giving out bad loans -as the ratio of the aggregate debt compared to the aggregate earning potential grows to the tipping point, due to the finite amount of high paying positions, the limiting factor in this analogy.\n\nHowever, the data actually show that, notwithstanding a slight increase in 2008–2009, student loan default rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s. And even during the recession, those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed, even though they earn higher wages.\n\nOhio University economist Richard Vedder has written in the \"Wall Street Journal\" that:\n\nNader Habibi, who runs the website overeducation.org, writing in The New Republic, cited this evidence:\n\nA different proposal for the cause of rising tuition is the reduction of state and federal appropriations to colleges, making them rely more on student tuition. Thus, it is not a bubble, but a form of shifting costs away from state and federal funding over to students. This has mostly applied to public universities which in 2011 for the first time have taken in more in tuition than in state funding, and had the greatest increases in tuition. Implied from this shift away from public funding to tuition is privatization, although \"The New York Times\" reported that such claims are exaggerated.\n\nAnother proposed cause of increased tuition is U.S. Congress' occasional raising of the 'loan limits' of student loans, in which the increased availability of students to take out deeper loans sends a message to colleges and universities that students can afford more, and then, in response, institutions of higher education raise tuition to match, leaving the student back where he began, but deeper in debt. Therefore, if the students are able to afford a much higher amount than the free market would otherwise support for students without the ability to take out a loan, then the tuition is 'bid up' to the new, higher, level that the student can now afford with loan subsidies. One rebuttal to that theory is the fact that even in years when loan limits have not risen, tuition has still continued to climb. However, that may not disprove this proposed cause: It may instead mean that other factors besides 'loan limit' increases played a part in the increases in tuition.\n\nA third theory claims that as a result of federal law that severely restricts the ability of students to discharge their federally guaranteed student loans in bankruptcy, lenders and colleges know that students are on the hook for any amount that they borrow, including late fees and interest (which can be capitalized and increase the principal loan amount), thus removing the incentive to only provide students loans that the students can be reasonably expected to repay. As proof of this theory, it has been shown that returning bankruptcy protections (and other Standard Consumer Protections) to Student Loans would cause lenders to be more cautious, thereby causing a sharp decline in the availability of student loans, which, in turn, would decrease the influx of dollars to colleges and universities, who, in turn, would have to sharply decrease tuition to match the lower availability of funds. Under this theory, if student loans did not have the ability to file for bankruptcy, it would be more profitable for the lender if the student defaulted (due to the increases in the amount of the loan after fees and interest are capitalized), and thus there is no free market pressure-type motive for the lender or the college to help the student avoid default. This is especially true because the government, if it is the lender or guarantor of the loan, has the ability to garnish the borrower's wages, tax return, and Social Security Disability income without a court order. Some have called the Federal Government 'predatory' for making loans which will have such a high default rate, since the default rate for Student Loans is projected to reach 46.3% of all federal dollars disbursed to students at for-profit colleges in 2008 (Budget lifetime default rate, loan default rate only 18.6%, meaning that 18.6% of all loans contain 46.3% of all dollars loaned out).\n\nEconomic and social commentator Gary North has remarked at LewRockwell.com that \"To speak of college as a bubble is silly. A bubble does not pop until months or years after the funding ceases. There is no indication that the funding for college education will cease.\"\n\nAzar Nafisi, Johns Hopkins University professor and bestselling author of \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\", has stated on the \"PBS NewsHour\" that a purely economic analysis of a higher education bubble is incomplete:\n\nBased on the available data, recommendations to address rising tuition have been advanced by experts and consumer and students' rights advocates:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12491375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12491375", "title": "Independent study", "text": "Independent study\n\nIndependent study is a form of education offered by many high schools, colleges, and other educational institutions. It is sometimes referred to as \"directed study\", and is an educational activity undertaken by an individual with little to no supervision. Typically a student and professor or teacher agree upon a topic for the student to research with guidance from the instructor for an agreed upon amount of credits. Independent studies provide a way for well-motivated students to pursue a topic of interest that does not necessarily fit into a traditional academic curriculum. They are a way for students to learn specialized material or gain research experience. \n\nIndependent studies provide students opportunities to explore their interests deeper and make important decisions about how and where they will direct their talents in the future. Another way to understand independent study is to understand learning from a distance. Learning from a distance is a theory in which the student is at a physical or a mental distance from his or her teacher. The student and the teacher are connected by something such as a worksheet, an essay, or through a website on the internet.\n\nFor elementary and junior high, independent study is sometimes a Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program, where the student must research the topic and formulate and answer questions. At the end, they develop and present a product, although not all GATE systems participate in this.\n\nMany charter schools in the US provide independent study and homeschooling in a variety of formats: online, in-person or a hybrid of online/in-person interaction. These independent study programs are particularly helpful for those who find a traditional classroom setting to be unsatisfactory. For example, independent study is ideal for those who have children, health issues, intense work schedules, or gifted academic ability. Often students with high scholastic standing are encouraged to take independent studies to try to learn without attendance in a class. Independent study is also useful for self-directed learning activities that allow the student to be self-reliant.\n\nA program titled \"The Research Experiences for Undergraduates\" (REU) has been founded by the National Science Foundation which provides funding for undergraduates to engage in different areas of research outside of the classroom. Groups are formed of graduates, undergraduates, and faculty to work on a specific research project.\n\nStudies have shown that personality can influence whether a person enjoys an independent study project, rather than lectures. People that believe the teacher should be authoritarian did not perform well in independent studies. However, there is evidence to suggest that personality should not solely dictate who is allowed to receive independent study.\n\nThough not afforded the same attention as individual personality on behalf of the potential student, some interest should be given to the teachers and or professor's ability to relate to the distance learner. Breaking the mold of in-class instruction versus the distance learner can be a difficult task to undertake by the instructor. They are not the same environment and changes and or accommodations should be made while keeping integrity of the overall class.\n\n"}

It is renowned mainly for its contribution to the development of modern logic and analytic philosophy (Lvov-Warsaw School - Alfred Tarski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Stanisław Leśniewski) and to history of ideas (Warsaw School of the History of Ideas - Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Stanisław Ossowski, Maria Ossowska, Leszek Kołakowski, Adam Schaff). Provides master's degree studies, doctor's degree studies and postgraduate studies in philosophy both in Polish and in English.\n\nThe main centre of the medieval and early modern Polish philosophy was Kraków - history of philosophy in Warsaw begins in the 18th century. In the pre-partition Varsovian institutions, the Collegium Nobilium and the Szkoła Rycerska to the lecturers of philosophy belonged Antoni Wiśniewski and Marcin Nikuta. In the 19th century, after the foundation of the University of Warsaw in 1815, due to russification of the schools Polish philosophy, both idealist and positivist, developed mainly outside universities. Among main Polish philosophers connected with the 19th century University of Warsaw were Adam Zabellewicz and Henryk Struve.\n\nAfter 1918, when Poland regained independence, University of Warsaw was reorganized. Chairs of philosophy were held by Jan Łukasiewicz, Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Stanisław Leśniewski, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Stanisław Schayer.\n\nInitially, philosophical education were organized in the Faculty of Historical-Philosophical Studies (1915–16), soon transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1916–27), and then into the Faculty of the Humanities (Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and Schayer) and the Faculty of Mathematical Studies and Physics (Łukasiewicz, Leśniewski and Ajdukiewicz).\n\nOther important philosophers teaching in Warsaw were Alfred Tarski, Henryk Elzenberg, Maria Ossowska and Stanisław Ossowski. Worldwide renown in logic and analytic philosophy was enjoyed by the Warsaw School of Logic, part of the philosophical movement of Lvov-Warsaw School.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Warsaw secret courses of philosophy were conducted by Łukasiewcz, Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and others.\n\nAfter 1945, during the stalinist era, due to political predominance of marxist philosophy in Poland some professors were partially prohibited from pursuing didactic activity. After the Polish October (1956) a separate Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1954–65) emerged from the Faculty of Arts and many leading philosophers were allowed to teach. It was subsequently transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical-Sociological Studies (1965–68).\n\nIn the 50. and 60. Warsaw School of the History of Ideas emerged. To this informal group of non-analytical philosophers belonged mainly former marxists (called \"revisionist\"), inspired to some extent by the ideas of Tatarkiewicz and Ossowskis. After the Polish March (1968), when many \"revisionist\" Polish philosophers and sociologists (for example Leszek Kołakowski, Zygmunt Bauman, Adam Schaff) participated in the events, philosophy at Warsaw University was subjected to a thorough reorganization. Chairs were renamed to departments and the Faculty of Philosophical Studies were forcibly joined with the Faculty of Sociology, within which the Institute of Philosophy was established.\n\nIn the post-war period the tradition of Lvov-Warsaw School was also continued. To the most important philosophers and logicians of the post-war period connected with the University of Warsaw belong Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, Zdzisław Augustynek, Bronisław Baczko, Marek Fritzhand, Henryk Jankowski, Andrzej Kasia, Leszek Kołakowski, Władysław Krajewski, Tadeusz Kroński, Jan Legowicz, Stefan Morawski, Elżbieta Pietruska-Madej, Marian Przełęcki, Adam Schaff, Marek Siemek, Adam Sikora, Roman Suszko, Klemens Szaniawski and Bogusław Wolniewicz.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "82533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82533", "title": "International relations", "text": "International relations\n\nInternational relations (IR) or international affairs (IA) — commonly also referred to as international studies (IS), global studies (GS), or global affairs (GA) — is the study of interconnectedness of politics, economics and law on a global level. Depending on the academic institution, it is either a field of political science, an interdisciplinary academic field similar to global studies, or an entirely independent academic discipline in which students take a variety of internationally focused courses in social science and humanities disciplines. In all cases, the field studies relationships between \"political entities\" (polities) such as sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and multinational corporations (MNCs), and the wider world-systems produced by this interaction. International relations is an academic and a public policy field, and so can be positive and normative, because it analyses and formulates the foreign policy of a given state.\n\nAs political activity, international relations dates from the time of the Greek historian Thucydides (), and, in the early 20th century, became a discrete academic field (no. 5901 in the 4-digit UNESCO Nomenclature) within political science. In practice, international relations and international affairs forms a separate academic program or field from political science, and the courses taught therein are highly interdisciplinary.\n\nFor example, international relations draws from the fields of politics, economics, international law, communication studies, history, demography, geography, sociology, anthropology, criminology, psychology, and gender studies. The scope of international relations encompasses issues such as globalization, diplomatic relations, state sovereignty, international security, ecological sustainability, nuclear proliferation, nationalism, economic development, global finance, terrorism, and human rights.\n\nThe history of international relations can be traced back to thousands of years ago; Barry Buzan and Richard Little, for example, consider the interaction of ancient Sumerian city-states, starting in 3,500 BC, as the first fully-fledged international system.\n\nThe history of international relations based on sovereign states and many more types are often traced back to the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, a stepping stone in the development of the modern state system. Prior to this the European medieval organization of political authority was based on a vaguely hierarchical religious order. Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the Holy Roman Empire. More than the Peace of Westphalia, the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory's sovereign borders.\n\nThe centuries of roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of the independent, sovereign states, the institutionalization of diplomacy and armies. The French Revolution added to this the new idea that not princes or an oligarchy, but the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, should be defined as sovereign. Such a state in which the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a nation-state (as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state). The term republic increasingly became its synonym. An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state. (In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.)\n\nThe particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via colonialism and the \"standards of civilization\". The contemporary international system was finally established through decolonization during the Cold War. However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered \"modern\", many states have not incorporated the system and are termed \"pre-modern\".\n\nFurther, a handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty, and can be considered \"post-modern\". The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. \"Levels of analysis\" is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level.\n\nWhat is explicitly recognized as international relations theory was not developed until after World War I, and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other social sciences. The use of capitalizations of the \"I\" and \"R\" in international relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of international relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" (6th century BC), Thucydides' \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" (5th century BC), Chanakya's \"Arthashastra\" (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with Hobbes' \"Leviathan\" and Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" providing further elaboration.\n\nSimilarly, liberalism draws upon the work of Kant and Rousseau, with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of democratic peace theory. Though contemporary human rights is considerably different from the type of rights envisioned under natural law, Francisco de Vitoria, Hugo Grotius and John Locke offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity. In the 20th century, in addition to contemporary theories of liberal internationalism, Marxism has been a foundation of international relations.\n\nInternational relations as a distinct field of study began in Britain. IR emerged as a formal academic discipline in 1919 with the founding of the first IR professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now Aberystwyth University), hold by Alfred Eckhard Zimmern and endowed by David Davies. Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service is the oldest international relations faculty in the United States, founded in 1919. In the early 1920s, the London School of Economics' department of international relations was founded at the behest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Philip Noel-Baker: this was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at universities in the US and in Geneva, Switzerland. The creation of the posts of Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at LSE and at Oxford gave further impetus to the academic study of international relations. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE developed a focus on the history of IR in the early modern, colonial and Cold War periods.\n\nThe first university entirely dedicated to the study of IR was the Graduate Institute of International Studies (now the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies), which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the League of Nations. The Committee on International Relations at the University of Chicago was the first to offer a graduate degree, in 1928. The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, a collaboration between Tufts University and Harvard, opened its doors in 1933 as the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States. In 1965, Glendon College and the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively. In 2012, Ramon Llull University initiated the first International Relations degree in Barcelona,the favourite city \nfully in English.\n\nIn the academic discipline of international relations, Smith, Baylis & Owens (2008) make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place, and that this theoretical worldview aims to do so by being aware of implicit assumptions and explicit assumptions that constitute a non-normative position and align or position the normative towards the loci of other key socio-political theories such as political liberalism, Marxism, political constructivism, political realism, political idealism and political globalization.\n\nIR theories are roughly divided into one of two epistemological camps: \"positivist\" and \"post-positivist\". Positivist theories aim to replicate the methods of the natural sciences by analysing the impact of material forces. They typically focus on features of international relations such as state interactions, size of military forces, balance of powers etc. Post-positivist epistemology rejects the idea that the social world can be studied in an objective and value-free way. It rejects the central ideas of neo-realism/liberalism, such as rational choice theory, on the grounds that the scientific method cannot be applied to the social world and that a \"science\" of IR is impossible.\n\nA key difference between the two positions is that while positivist theories, such as neo-realism, offer causal explanations (such as why and how power is exercised), post-positivist theories focus instead on constitutive questions, for instance what is meant by \"power\"; what makes it up, how it is experienced and how it is reproduced. Often, post-positivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics. This is something which has often been ignored under \"traditional\" IR as positivist theories make a distinction between \"facts\" and normative judgments, or \"values\".\n\nDuring the late 1980s and the 1990s, debate between positivists and post-positivists became the dominant debate and has been described as constituting the Third \"Great Debate\" (Lapid 1989).\n\nRealism focuses on state security and power above all else. Early realists such as E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau argued that states are self-interested, power-seeking rational actors, who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival. Cooperation between states is a way to maximize each individual state's security (as opposed to more idealistic reasons). Similarly, any act of war must be based on self-interest, rather than on idealism. Many realists saw World War II as the vindication of their theory.\n\nRealists argue that the need for survival requires state leaders to distance themselves from traditional morality. Realism taught American leaders to focus on interests rather than on ideology, to seek peace through strength, and to recognize that great powers can coexist even if they have antithetical values and beliefs.\n\nThucydides, the author of Peloponnesian War is considered to be the founding father of the realist school of political philosophy, although Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of more complex political message within Thucydides' work. Amongst others, philosophers like Machiavelli, Hobbes and Rousseau are considered to have contributed to the Realist philosophy. However, while their work may support realist doctrine, it is not likely that they would have classified themselves as realists in this sense. Political realism believes that politics, like society, is governed by objective laws with roots in human nature. To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure. Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.\n\nPlacing realism under positivism is far from unproblematic however. E. H. Carr's \"What is History\" was a deliberate critique of positivism, and Hans Morgenthau's aim in \"Scientific Man vs Power Politics\" was to demolish any conception that international politics/power politics can be studied scientifically. Morgenthau's belief in this regard is part of the reason he has been classified as a \"classical realist\" rather than a realist.\n\nMajor theorists include E. H. Carr, Robert Gilpin, Joanne Gowa, Charles Kindleberger, Stephen Krasner, Hans Morgenthau, and Kenneth Waltz.\n\nAccording to liberalism, individuals are basically good and capable of meaningful cooperation to promote positive change. Liberalism views states, nongovernmental organizations, and intergovernmental organizations as key actors in the international system. States have many interests and are not necessarily unitary and autonomous, although they are sovereign. Liberal theory stresses interdependence among states, multinational corporations, and international institutions. Theorists such as Hedley Bull have postulated an international society in which various actors communicate and recognize common rules, institutions, and interests. Liberals also view the international system as anarchic since there is no single overarching international authority and each individual state is left to act in its own self-interest. Liberalism is historically rooted in the liberal philosophical traditions associated with Adam Smith and Immanuel Kant that posit that human nature is basically good and that individual self-interest can be harnessed by society to promote aggregate social welfare. Individuals form groups and later, states; states are generally cooperative and tend to follow international norms.\n\nLiberal international relations theory arose after World War I in response to the inability of states to control and limit war in their international relations. Early adherents include Woodrow Wilson and Norman Angell, who argued that states mutually gained from cooperation and that war was so destructive as to be essentially futile.\n\nLiberalism was not recognized as a coherent theory as such until it was collectively and derisively termed idealism by E. H. Carr. A new version of \"idealism\" that focused on human rights as the basis of the legitimacy of international law was advanced by Hans Köchler.\n\nMajor theorists include Montesquieu, Immanuel Kant, Robert Keohane, Michael W. Doyle, Francis Fukuyama, and Helen Milner.\n\nNeoliberalism seeks to update liberalism by accepting the neorealist presumption that states are the key actors in international relations, but still maintains that non-state actors (NSAs) and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) matter. Proponents argue that states will cooperate irrespective of relative gains, and are thus concerned with absolute gains. This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any international organizations blocking a nation's right to sovereignty. Neoliberal institutionalism, an approach founded by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, emphasize the important role of international institutions in maintaining an open global trading regime.\n\nProminent neoliberal institutionalists are Christina Davis, Judith L. Goldstein, G. John Ikenberry, Robert Keohane, Lisa Martin, and Joseph Nye.\n\nRegime theory is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behaviour of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation.\n\nWhile realism predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights and collective security among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition of regimes comes from Stephen Krasner, who defines regimes as \"principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue-area\".\n\nNot all approaches to regime theory, however, are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like Joseph Grieco have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation \"never\" happens, just that it is not the norm; it is a difference of degree).\n\nInternational society theory, also called the English School, focuses on the shared norms and values of states and how they regulate international relations. Examples of such norms include diplomacy, order, and international law. Unlike neo-realism, it is not necessarily positivist. Theorists have focused particularly on humanitarian intervention, and are subdivided between solidarists, who tend to advocate it more, and pluralists, who place greater value in order and sovereignty. Nicholas Wheeler is a prominent solidarist, while Hedley Bull and Robert H. Jackson are perhaps the best known pluralists.\n\nSocial constructivism encompasses a broad range of theories that aim to address questions of ontology, such as the structure-and-agency debate, as well as questions of epistemology, such as the \"material/ideational\" debate that concerns the relative role of material forces versus ideas. Constructivism is not a theory of IR in the manner of neo-realism, but is instead a social theory which is used to better explain the actions taken by states and other major actors as well as the identities that guide these states and actors.\n\nConstructivism in IR can be divided into what Ted Hopf (1998) calls \"conventional\" and \"critical\" constructivism. Common to all varieties of constructivism is an interest in the role that ideational forces play. The most famous constructivist scholar, Alexander Wendt, noted in a 1992 article in \"International Organization\" —and later in his 1999 book \"Social Theory of International Politics—\"that \"anarchy is what states make of it\". By this he means that the anarchical structure that neo-realists claim governs state interaction is in fact a phenomenon that is socially constructed and reproduced by states.\n\nFor example, if the system is dominated by states that see anarchy as a life or death situation (what Wendt terms a \"Hobbesian\" anarchy) then the system will be characterized by warfare. If on the other hand anarchy is seen as restricted (a \"Lockean\" anarchy) then a more peaceful system will exist. Anarchy in this view is constituted by state interaction, rather than accepted as a natural and immutable feature of international life as viewed by neo-realist IR scholars.\n\nProminent social constructivist IR scholars are Rawi Abdelal, Michael Barnett, Mark Blyth, Martha Finnemore, Peter A. Hall, Ted Hopf, Margaret Keck, Elizabeth Kier, Kathleen McNamara, Kathryn Sikkink and Alexander Wendt.\n\nFeminist IR considers the ways that international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. war, security, etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of International Political Economy (IPE). From its inception, feminist IR has also theorized extensively about men and, in particular, masculinities. Many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article \"Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals\" Signs (1988), Carol Cohn claimed that a highly masculinized culture within the defence establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion.\n\nFeminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onwards. The end of the Cold War and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship has sought to problematize the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline - often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women.\n\nProminent scholars include Carol Cohn, Cynthia Enloe, Charlotte Hooper, Sara Ruddick, J. Ann Tickner and Jacqui True.\n\nMarxist and Neo-Marxist theories of IR reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. It makes the assumption that the economy trumps other concerns; allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. Thus, colonialism brought in sources for raw materials and captive markets for exports, while decolonialization brought new opportunities in the form of dependence.\n\nA prominent derivative of Marxian thought is critical international relations theory which is the application of \"critical theory\" to international relations. Early critical theorists were associated with the Frankfurt School which followed Marx's concern with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions. Their emphasis on the \"critical\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism. Modern-day proponents such as Andrew Linklater, Robert W. Cox and Ken Booth focus on the need for human emancipation from the nation-state. Hence, it is \"critical\" of mainstream IR theories that tend to be both positivist and state-centric.\n\nFurther linked in with Marxist theories is dependency theory and the core–periphery model, which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political and financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and MNCs on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating undervalued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic and political dependence.\n\nMarxist theories receive little attention in the United States. It is more common in parts of Europe and is one of the more important theoretic contributions of Latin American academia to the study of global networks.\n\nInterest group theory posits that the driving force behind state behaviour is sub-state interest groups. Examples of interest groups include political lobbyists, the military, and the corporate sector. Group theory argues that although these interest groups are constitutive of the state, they are also causal forces in the exercise of state power.\n\nStrategic perspective is a theoretical approach that views individuals as choosing their actions by taking into account the anticipated actions and responses of others with the intention of maximizing their own welfare.\n\nThe \"inherent bad faith model\" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles' beliefs and his model of information processing. It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent. A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the Palestinian Liberation Organization.\n\nPost-structuralist theories of IR developed in the 1980s from postmodernist studies in political science. Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR (such as \"power\" and \"agency\") and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. The examination of \"narratives\" plays an important part in poststructuralist analysis; for example, feminist poststructuralist work has examined the role that \"women\" play in global society and how they are constructed in war as \"innocent\" and \"civilians\". (See also feminism in international relations.) Rosenberg's article \"Why is there no International Historical Sociology\" was a key text in the evolution of this strand of international relations theory. Post-structuralism has garnered both significant praise and criticism, with its critics arguing that post-structuralist research often fails to address the real-world problems that international relations studies is supposed to contribute to solving.\n\nInternational relations are often viewed in terms of levels of analysis. The \"systemic level\" concepts are those broad concepts that define and shape an international milieu, characterized by anarchy. Focusing on the systemic level of international relations is often, but not always, the preferred method for neo-realists and other structuralist IR analysts. \n\nPreceding the concepts of interdependence and dependence, international relations relies on the idea of sovereignty. Described in Jean Bodin's \"Six Books of the Commonwealth\" in 1576, the three pivotal points derived from the book describe sovereignty as being a state, that the sovereign power(s) have absolute power over their territories, and that such a power is only limited by the sovereign's \"own obligations towards other sovereigns and individuals\". Such a foundation of sovereignty permits, is indicated by a sovereign's obligation to other sovereigns, interdependence and dependence to take place. While throughout world history there have been instances of groups lacking or losing sovereignty, such as African nations prior to Decolonization or the occupation of Iraq during the Iraq War, there is still a need for sovereignty in terms of assessing international relations.\n\nThe concept of Power in international relations can be described as the degree of resources, capabilities, and influence in international affairs. It is often divided up into the concepts of hard power and soft power, hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering economics, diplomacy and cultural influence. However, there is no clear dividing line between the two forms of power.\n\nPerhaps the most significant concept behind that of power and sovereignty, national interest is a state’s action in relation to other states where it seeks to gain advantage or benefits to itself. National interest, whether aspirational or operational, is divided by core/vital and peripheral/non-vital interests. Core or vital interests constitute the things which a country is willing to defend or expand with conflict such as territory, ideology (religious, political, economic), or its citizens. Peripheral or non-vital are interests which a state is willing to compromise. For example, in the German annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938 (a part of Czechoslovakia) under the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia was willing to relinquish territory which was considered ethnically German in order to preserve its own integrity and sovereignty.\n\nIn the 21st century, the status-quo of the international system is no longer monopolized by states alone. Rather, it is the presence of non-state actors, who autonomously act to implement unpredictable behaviour to the international system. Whether it is transnational corporations, liberation movements, non-governmental agencies, or international organizations, these entities have the potential to significantly influence the outcome of any international transaction. Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. Al-Qaeda, as an example of a non-state actor, has significantly influenced the way states (and non-state actors) conduct international affairs.\n\nThe existence of power blocs in international relations is a significant factor related to polarity. During the Cold War, the alignment of several nations to one side or another based on ideological differences or national interests has become an endemic feature of international relations. Unlike prior, shorter-term blocs, the Western and Soviet blocs sought to spread their national ideological differences to other nations. Leaders like U.S. President Harry S. Truman under the Truman Doctrine believed it was necessary to spread democracy whereas the Warsaw Pact under Soviet policy sought to spread communism. After the Cold War, and the dissolution of the ideologically homogeneous Eastern bloc still gave rise to others such as the South-South Cooperation movement.\n\nPolarity in international relations refers to the arrangement of power within the international system. The concept arose from bipolarity during the Cold War, with the international system dominated by the conflict between two superpowers, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the international system as a bipolar one with two opposing powerbases and ideologies. Consequently, the international system prior to 1945 can be described as multipolar, with power being shared among Great powers.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had led to unipolarity, with the United States as a sole superpower, although many refuse to acknowledge the fact. China's continued rapid economic growth (in 2010 it became the world's second-largest economy), combined with the respectable international position they hold within political spheres and the power that the Chinese Government exerts over their people (consisting of the largest population in the world), resulted in debate over whether China is now a superpower or a possible candidate in the future. However, China's strategic force unable of projecting power beyond its region and its nuclear arsenal of 250 warheads (compared to 7700 of the United States) mean that the unipolarity will persist in the policy-relevant future.\n\nSeveral theories of international relations draw upon the idea of polarity. The balance of power was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the First World War, the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. Theories of the balance of power gained prominence again during the Cold War, being a central mechanism of Kenneth Waltz's Neorealism. Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed.\n\nRobert Gilpin's Hegemonic stability theory also draws upon the idea of polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. Hegemony is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power and others in the international system. This is contrary to many neorealist arguments, particularly made by Kenneth Waltz, stating that the end of the Cold War and the state of unipolarity is an unstable configuration that will inevitably change.\n\nThe case of Gilpin proved to be correct and Waltz's article titled \"The Stability of a Bipolar World\" was followed in 1999 by William Wohlforth's article titled \"The Stability of a Unipolar World\"\n\nWaltz's thesis can be expressed in power transition theory, which states that it is likely that a great power would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war. It suggests that while hegemony can control the occurrence of wars, it also results in the creation of one. Its main proponent, A. F. K. Organski, argued this based on the occurrence of previous wars during British, Portuguese, and Dutch hegemony.\n\nMany advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. Advocates of this point to growing globalization, particularly with international economic interaction. The role of international institutions, and widespread acceptance of a number of operating principles in the international system, reinforces ideas that relations are characterized by interdependence.\n\nDependency theory is a theory most commonly associated with Marxism, stating that a set of core states exploit a set of weaker periphery states for their prosperity. Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist).\n\n\nAs a level of analysis the unit level is often referred to as the state level, as it locates its explanation at the level of the state, rather than the international system.\n\nIt is often considered that a state's form of government can dictate the way that a state interacts with others in the international relation.\n\nDemocratic peace theory is a theory that suggests that the nature of democracy means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications for this are that democracies externalize their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.\n\nCommunism justifies a world revolution, which similarly would lead to peaceful coexistence, based on a proletarian global society.\n\nStates can be classified by whether they accept the international status quo, or are revisionist—i.e., want change. Revisionist states seek to fundamentally change the rules and practices of international relations, feeling disadvantaged by the status quo. They see the international system as a largely western creation which serves to reinforce current realities. Japan is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it.\n\nReligion can have an effect on the way a state acts within the international system. Different theoretical perspectives treat it in somewhat different fashion. One dramatic example is the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) that ravaged much of Europe. Religion is visible as an organizing principle particularly for Islamic states, whereas secularism sits at the other end of the spectrum, with the separation of state and religion being responsible for the liberal international relations theory. Events since the September 11 attacks in the United States, the role of Islam in terrorism, and the strife in the Middle East have made it a major topic. There are many different types of religions. One being Confucianism, which is China's major world view (Alexander, 1998).\n\nThe level beneath the unit (state) level can be useful both for explaining factors in international relations that other theories fail to explain, and for moving away from a state-centric view of international relations.\n\nInternational institutions form a vital part of contemporary international relations. Much interaction at the system level is governed by them, and they outlaw some traditional institutions and practices of international relations, such as the use of war (except in self-defence).\n\nThe United Nations (UN) is an international organization that describes itself as a \"global association of governments facilitating co-operation in international law, international security, economic development, and social equity\"; It is the most prominent international institution. Many of the legal institutions follow the same organizational structure as the UN.\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is an international organization consisting of 57 member states. The organisation attempts to be the collective voice of the Muslim world (Ummah) and attempts to safeguard the interests and ensure the progress and well-being of Muslims.\n\nOther generalist inter-state organizations include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

A member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs and the Daughters of the American_Revolution, she became a progressive educator.\n\nUnder the auspices of by the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs beginning in 1899, Katherine Pettit and May Stone spent three summers in social settlement work in Kentucky at Camp Cedar Grove, Camp Industrial (which later became the Hindman Settlement School), and Sassafras Social Settlement. Their journals, filled with words to local ballads and idiomatic expressions of their students and families from homes nearby, describe in detail their classes in health and homemaking, as well as teacher training. A local elder Solomon Everage watched the two women—\"quare fotched-on women from the level land,\"—for some time and eventually asked them to establish a permanent industrial school in the Troublesome Creek area.\n\nIn 1902 with financing from the Women's Christian Temperance Union, Katherine Pettit and May Stone co-founded Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, Kentucky. Pettit said that the goal of Hindman was \"to know all we can and teach all we can.\" The Kentucky WCTU sponsored the school until 1915, when it was formally incorporated as a private, non-profit, non-sectarian, and non-denominational corporation.\n\nMay Stone remained at Hindman as principal until 1936. Many of the graduates remained in the area. Carl Perkins, a native of Hindman who served thirty-six years in the United States House of Representatives, was a graduate of the settlement school.\n\nIn 1913, Pettit co-founded Pine Mountain Settlement School with Ethel deLong Zande in Harlan County, Kentucky. At Pine Mountain, Pettit directed outdoor work while Zande directed academics.\n\nFounding Pine Mountain as an example of the settlement movement, Pettit and deLong modeled the school after Hull House. According to Berea College's Southern Appalachian Archives,\n[Pettit and deLong] hoped that their modern ideas about health, nutrition, work efficiency, farm management, and the cultural value of indigenous crafts would permeate the surrounding communities -- both through the children, and through direct contact with adults.\n\nPine Mountain Settlement School is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nKatherine Pettit labored to preserve and encourage the teaching of Appalachian culture through arts, folk songs, and customs.\n\nHer teachings on natural vegetable dyeing were recorded in The Katherine Pettit Book of Vegetable Dyes. Wilmer Stone Viner, who had worked at Pine Mountain Settlement School, published this in 1946 after moving from Kentucky to Saluda, North Carolina. Consequently, Pettit's recipes have influenced craft practices in western North Carolina.\nThe book, dedicated to the memory of Katherine Pettit, quotes a memorial tablet in the Pine Mountain Settlement School Chapel:\nKatherine Pettit, 1869 - 1936, pioneer and trail-breaker. Forty years she spent creating opportunity for mountain children here and elsewhere. In life, she ever refused praise. In death, she is too great for it.\n\n"}

He has been chief executive of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile since 8 August 2011. Following the election, at the request of the 14th Dalai Lama, the Tibetan parliament-in-exile amended the organisation's bylaws to remove the Dalai Lama's role as ceremonial head of state, making Lobsang Sangay its highest leader. In 2012, to reflect this change, Lobsang Sangay's title as chief executive was changed from \"kalön tripa\" (\"prime minister\") to \"sikyong\" (\"ruler\" or \"regent\"). Sangay holds American citizenship.\n\nSangay was born in a refugee community in Darjeeling, India in 1968, with a typical Shichak (settlement) background amidst fields, cows and chickens, fetching wood in the forest and helping his parents' small business, including selling winter sweaters. After graduating from the Tibetan school in Darjeeling, Sangay received his B.A. (Hons) and LL.B. degrees from the University of Delhi in India. In 1995, the then Kashag offered a Fulbright Scholarship spot to him at Harvard Law School for his role in Chushi Gangdruk affairs, where he subsequently received his LL.M. degree the same year. Sangay spent 15 years at Harvard University. \n\nIn 2003, Sangay organized five conferences between Chinese and Tibetan scholars, including a meeting between the Dalai Lama and thirty-five Chinese scholars at Harvard University.\n\nIn 2004, he became the first Tibetan to earn a S.J.D. degree from Harvard Law School and was a recipient of the 2004 Yong K. Kim' 95 Prize of excellence for his dissertation \"Democracy in Distress: Is Exile Polity a Remedy? A Case Study of Tibet's Government-in-exile\". In 2006, Sangay was selected as one of the twenty-four Young Leaders of Asia by the Asia Society, a global organization working to strengthen relationships and promote understanding among the people, leaders and institutions of Asia and the United States. Funded by Hao Ran foundation, Sangay was a Senior Fellow at the East Asian Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School through 2011. He is an expert in Tibetan law and international human rights law.\n\nOn 10 March 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama proposed changes to the exile charter to remove his position of authority within the organisation and devolve his political power to the elected leader, thus making the Kalön Tripa (or Chief Minister) the highest-ranking officeholder. These changes were ratified on 29 May 2011,[6] even though, according to Sangay, there was \"a high level of anxiety among Tibetans\" over the Dalai Lama's decision to relinquish his own political authority.\nOn 27 April 2011 Sangay was elected Kalön Tripa of the Tibetan Government in Exile. Sangay won 55% of the votes, defeating Tenzin Tethong (37.4%) and Tashi Wangdi (6.4%). 83,400 Tibetans were eligible to vote and 49,000 ballots were cast. On 8 August 2011, Sangay took the oath of office, succeeding Lobsang Tenzin as Kalön Tripa. In a statement at the time, the Dalai Lama referred to Lobsang Sangay as \"Sikyong\"; and the title was officially changed from \"Kalön Tripa\" to Sikyong in September 2012.\n\nIn his role as Sikyong, Sangay has emphasized the importance of seeking a peaceful, non-violent resolution of the Tibet issue. He has supported the Dalai Lama's call for a so-called \"Middle Way\" approach \"that would provide for genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of Chinese constitution.\" Noting that China has established \"one country, two systems\" mechanisms in Hong Kong and Macau, he has argued that it makes no sense for China to continue to resist a similar solution for Tibet, which, he emphasizes, would be a \"win-win\" result.\n\nIn February 2013, he gave the first annual lecture of the Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondence. Expressing concern about the possible ripple effects of recent acts of armed rebellion in west Asia, he called for the international community to strengthen its endorsement of non-violent approaches to oppression. \"If non-violence is the right thing to do,\" he emphasized, \"we ought to be supported by the international community.\" Noting the media attention given to armed Syrian \"freedom fighters,\" he said: \"Tibetans have been democratic and non-violent for the last so many decades, how come we don't receive similar support and attention?\"\n\nSangay made a statement on 10 March 2013, the 54th anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day, in which he paid tribute to the \"yearning for freedom\" that inspired \"the epochal events of March 10, 1959,\" and dedicated the anniversary of those events \"to all the self-immolators and those who have died for Tibet.\" He also restated his dedication to the \"Middle Way Approach,\" expressing hope that a \"speedy resolution\" by China of the Tibet issue could \"serve as a model for other freedom struggles\" and \"be a catalyst for moderation of China.\"\n\nIn January 2017, outgoing US ambassador to India, Richard Verma, hosted Lobsang Sangay for a dinner along with an Indian minister and Richard Gere, an event that angered China.\n\nSangay has been married for 13 years to Kesang Yangdon Shakchang, whose parents were from the Lhokha and Phare area. They have a three-year-old daughter.\n\nHis father died in 2004.\n\nLobsang Sangay holds a United States passport, which means he holds American citizenship.\n\nSangay was awarded Presidential Medal award by Salisbury U, Maryland, USA on 13 October 2015.\n\nHe received the Gold Medal of the College Historical Society of Trinity College Dublin for Outstanding Contribution to Public Discourse by the Auditor of the Society, Ms Ursula Ni Choill.\n\nOn 7 November 2017, the Kashag (the CTA's executive, which Sangay heads) dismissed a long-serving Tibetan diplomat, Mr. Penpa Tsering, from the important post of Representative at the Office of Tibet in Washington DC. The former education minister, Ngodup Tsering was appointed to take the position effective 1 December 2017. No clear justification for the dismissal and replacement was initially provided by the Kashag. On 18 November 2017 the Kashag released a 10-point statement of clarification detailing their reasons for dismissing Penpa Tsering. A New York-based Tibetan man writing under the pseudonym \"Mila Rangzen\" called for a mass protest against the Tibetan exile government on 27 November 2017 to demand justice for the ousted diplomat. The settlement officer of Dharamsala released a statement urging peace in the streets. Nevertheless, on 27 November 2017, a protest took place in Dharamsala near the CTA offices.\n\nSikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay addressed an audience at Samast Bharat Excellence Award, 2018 on May 24, 2018 at Devdar hotel in Khanyara, Dharamshala.\n\n\n\n"}

It is held annually during a weekend in mid-January over a period of two days. Since the test is held in the middle of winter, snow can delay the exam in some regions, but typically the test starts and ends near the same exact time throughout the entire nation.\n\nThe Center Test has become something of a national phenomenon in Japan, with television coverage and newspapers publishing test questions. To many test-takers in Japan, the test is the difference between college entrance and one year's study for the next year's exams as a \"rōnin\". Since the test is only administered annually and entrance to top-ranked universities and colleges is so competitive in Japan, the test has become the subject of scrutiny by many. In addition, rules for tardiness and absences are extremely strict and always results in the forfeit of taking the exams as there are no \"makeup\" sessions or re-takes offered except in cases such as delays caused by broken train signals.\n\nThe test is administered by National Center for University Entrance Examinations, an Independent Administrative Institution (IAI). The National Center Test superseded the Common first-stage exam (共通一次, \"kyōtsū ichiji\"), which was administered from 1979 to 1989, letting private universities use the test scores as a criterion for admissions decisions.\n\nIn 2012, the test was held on 14 and 15 January, with around 555,500 students participating (down by 3,400 students from 2011). The test was held at 709 locations across the country and will be used by 835 public universities, private universities and junior colleges to grade applicants.\n\nIn 2014, on 19 and 20 January, 560,672 students participated at 693 centers.\n\n\"As in previous years, there were a few glitches. Heavy snow made some students late in the Hokuriku region, while a disruption to the JR Tokaido shinkansen caused some students to miss the tests in Shizuoka, TBS reported. Trouble was also reported with audio-visual devices for English exam takers in some centers.\"\n\nThe official name in Japanese is , but this designation is rarely used. It is often called , or simply by test-takers and teachers.\n\nSome universities decide on successful candidates using only the National Center Test, but most prestigious universities require the candidate to take another, institution-specific exam, which is often more difficult than the National Center Test.\n\nThe function of the Center Test depends on the institution, but most can be categorised into the following three:\n\nBecause candidates do not know their Center Test scores before applying to universities, most write their answers on the question sheets (which can be taken home) and check their answers using rubrics published by cram schools.\n\nA number of cram schools and other companies have services to which candidates can send their scores and learn their overall position relative to other users of the service, called . Candidates can use this information to see how they fared as compared with other test-takers and make their final application decisions (in Japan, candidates may be unable to apply to all their desired universities, such as in the United States, mainly because the secondary exams are scheduled on or near the same day).\n\nThere are separate tests for each subject, and each is multiple choice. The tests follow the curriculum guidelines published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.\n\nThere are a total of 29 tests in six subjects. Candidates take the subjects specified by their university. As an exception, however, candidates for the English (written) exam must take the English (listening).\n\nIn 2013, the first day of exams was held on January 18.\n\n\nIn 2013, the second day of exams was held on January 19.\n\n\nA listening exam was introduced in 2006 for candidates of the English (written) exam. An IC player was handed out to all candidates of the exam, and a whole 30 minutes of testing time was devoted to the explanation of usage of this device.\n\nThere was some controversy surrounding the introduction of this exam, and critics doubted the reliability of this device. In 2006, there were 497 (about 0.09%) cases in which candidates had to be given re-tests because of device failure.\n\nSince the IC players could be taken home, candidates around Japan disassembled the devices at home, finding that the players used Sony's Memory Stick for storage of the exam. Although no note of the manufacturer was made in either the media or on the device itself, the use of this storage format led most to believe that Sony was the manufacturer.\n\nThe memory stick from a sample device provided to an examination supervisor prior to the 2007 examinations, containing a full sample audio test, contained four files with the .bin file extension. A cursory attempt to extract the content of these files failed and changing the file extension to common audio formats, such as .wav, .mp3, and .wma also did not result in playable files. The total size of all four files was 4.63MB, and the total listening time of 30 minutes makes it obvious that the audio tracks are highly compressed.\n\nAdditionally, the non-intuitive sequence of buttons needed to operate the player raises concern over the possibility of candidates having difficulty operating the player under test conditions. The inability to stop and restart the audio tracks seems probably due to a wish to ensure that all candidates complete all the listening within the test period. Of even more concern is that the memory stick on the sample player was exposed and could be removed by candidates, leaving open the possibility that candidates may inadvertently remove the memory stick during the test and render the player inoperable.\n\n"}
{"id": "1531060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1531060", "title": "National Middle School Science Bowl", "text": "National Middle School Science Bowl\n\nThe National Middle School Science Bowl is a middle school academic competition, similar to Quiz Bowl, held in the United States. Two teams of four students each compete to answer various science-related questions. In order to determine which student has the right to answer the question, a buzzer system (or \"lockout system\") is used, similar to those seen on popular television game shows such as \"Jeopardy!\". The National Middle School Science Bowl (\" NMSSB\") has been organized and sponsored by the United States Department of Energy since the competition's inception in 2002.\n\nQuestions are asked in the categories of Physical Science, Life Science, Earth and Space Science, Energy, and Mathematics. Although they are not subcategorized, the questions fall into the subcategories of Chemistry, Algebra, Computer Science, Biology, Physics, Astronomy, Geometry, and Current Events. The newest addition was a category specially made for the 2006 National competition: a group of about 5 questions asked through graphics and models projected onto computer screens and as hard copies distributed to competing teams. These were only used in semi-finals and championship rounds.\n\nBefore the 2010 year, there was no Energy category, and Earth and Space Science was called Earth Science. The General Science category was dropped in 2017.\n\nEach year, in late April or early May, the National Science Bowl competition is held in Chevy Chase, Maryland in the National 4-H Youth Conference Center.\n\nThe winning team of each regional Science Bowl competition is invited to participate in the National Science Bowl all expenses paid. There are a number of regional competitions all over the United States; the exact amount changes from year to year.\n\nTypically, any middle school that meets the eligibility rules of the National Middle School Science Bowl competition is permitted to register for any regional competition in the country, but no middle school or student group may compete in multiple regionals. In addition, some regional competitions permit schools to register up to three teams. Teams composed entirely of homeschooled students are also permitted to enter.\n\nThis section is concerned with the rules of the national competition. The rules of regional competitions vary greatly. There are very few prescribed rules for regional competitions. Some regionals are run nearly identically to the national competition, while others use variations of the rules or different methods of scoring.\n\nA team consists of four or five students from a single middle school (unless the team is composed entirely of home schooled students). Only four students play at any one time, while the fifth is designated as the \"alternate.\" Substitutions may be made during the two-minute \"halftime\" and between rounds.\n\nTwo teams compete against each other in each match. Each match has exactly 25 questions (that is, 25 toss-ups and 25 bonuses in corresponding categories). The match is over when all the toss-up questions have been read, or after two eight-minute halves have elapsed (ten-minute at the national competition), whichever occurs first. The team with the most points at this time is the winner.\n\nEvery match begins with a toss-up question. The moderator announces the subject of the question (see \"Subject Areas\" above), as well as its type (Multiple Choice or Short Answer). Once the moderator completes the reading of the question, students have five seconds to buzz in and give an answer. Students may buzz in at any time after the category has been read — there is no need to wait for the moderator to finish. However, there is a penalty for interrupting the moderator and giving an incorrect answer. Once a student from a team has buzzed in, that team may not buzz in again on that question. Conferring between members of a team is not allowed on toss-up questions; if conferring occurs on a question, the team is disqualified from answering that question. The rules regarding conferring are typically very strict: excessive noise, eye contact, or even noticeable shifts in position can be considered conferring, as they convey information to teammates.\n\nThe moderator rules an answer given by a student correct or incorrect. On short answer questions, if the answer given differs from the official one, the moderator uses his or her judgment to make a ruling (which is subject to challenge by the competitors). On multiple-choice questions, the answer given by the student is only correct if it matches the official answer \"exactly\". Alternatively, the student may give the letter choice that corresponds to the correct answer. The letters W, X, Y and Z are used in lieu of A, B, C and D to avoid confusion between similar-sounding letters.\n\nThe decision to require multiple-choice answers to be exact has been a controversial one, but experience has shown that it is the best way to avoid complicated disputes during matches.\n\nIf a student answers a toss-up question correctly, that student's team receives a bonus question. The bonus question is always in the same category as the corresponding toss-up question. Since \"only\" that team has the opportunity to answer the bonus question, there is no need to buzz in to answer it. After the moderator finishes reading the question, the team has twenty seconds to answer. Conferring between team members is permitted, but the designated team captain must give the team's final answer. Teams are given a 5-second warning after 15 seconds of the time allotted have elapsed.\n\nEven if the clock runs out (either for the half or the round), a team that has correctly responded to a toss-up before the expiration of time still receives a bonus. The moderator/scientific judge ignores the timer and proceeds to read the question in its entirety, and the team receives the full 20 seconds of allotted response time. The half/round is completed as soon as the team's answer has been given and no more questions are read to either team.\n\nThe same rules apply to the judging of responses to bonus questions as apply to responses to toss-up questions. Once the team's answer has been ruled right or wrong, the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.\n\nIf neither team answers the toss-up question correctly, the bonus question is not read, and the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.\n\nThe scoring at NMSB is similar to scoring for Quiz Bowl, although with different numbers.\n\nCorrect responses to toss-up questions are worth 4 points each, and correct responses to bonus questions are worth 10 points each.\n\nIf a student buzzes in on a toss-up question before the moderator has completely read the question (\"interrupting\" the question) and responds \"incorrectly\", then 4 points are awarded to the opposing team, and the question is re-read in its entirety so that the opposing team has an opportunity to buzz in.\n\nNote the difference between interrupt scoring in Science Bowl and in Quiz Bowl: the interrupt penalty in Quiz Bowl is -5 to the interrupting team, while in Science Bowl it is +4 to the non-interrupting team.\n\nAlso, if a team \"blurts\" (shouts out the answer after buzzing but without recognition), the question is treated as an incorrect interrupt. If the judges rule that a team has conferred amongst themselves before buzzing in on a toss-up, that team is disqualified from answering the question and no points are awarded to either side.\n\nThis section is concerned with the format of the national competition only. As is the case with competition rules, the competition format varies greatly among the different regional competitions.\n\nThe national competition always consists of two stages: round robin and double elimination.\n\nAll competing teams are randomly arranged into several round robin groups of six teams each. Every team plays every other team in its group once, receiving 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, or zero points for a loss. The top 16 teams across all divisions make it into double elimination; however, it is done so that the same number of teams (or as close as possible to this) in each division make double elimination.\n\nIn the event that two or more teams are tied for one of the top two spots in a round robin group, there are several tiebreak procedures, applied in the following order:\n\n\nIf a tie still exists after the third tiebreak step, the third step is reapplied until the tie is resolved.\n\nApproximately 16 teams advance from the round robin (depending on the number of round robin divisions). The competition then proceeds like a typical double elimination tournament bracket. Unlike in the round robin, a match in double elimination cannot be tied. If a match is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods of five questions each are played until the tie is broken.\n\nAs each team is eliminated from the original bracket, they proceed to the \"Challenger's Bracket\" for the second chance. By the end of the competition, this system produces a champion from each bracket. The two championship teams face off in the final round to determine the first and second place winners.\n\nSeveral companies and organizations sponsor the National Middle School Science Bowl competition, the most prominent being the United States Department of Energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory sponsors NMSB, and General Motors is also a regular sponsor of the event and has in recent years sponsored the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car competition held at NMSB, where teams compete to build the fastest or most powerful fuel cell-powered miniature car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the top 4 teams in both the academic competition and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car Competition were:\n\n\n\n\nThe top placing teams in the academic competition held in 2011 were:\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, there were two competitions: the academic competition and the solar car competition. There were two parts to the solar car competition: the actual race and the design document contest. 37 teams competed in the Nationals for the middle school.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, there were two competitions: the academic competition and the hydrogen fuel cell car competition.

For the first time this year, the fuel cell car competition was divided into three parts: the fuel cell car race, a presentation on hydrogen, and a design document/presentation to be shown to judges at the event.

The attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, and following the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration, the Tokugawa clan, formerly masters of the country with revenues of over eight million \"koku,\" were reduced to 700,000 \"koku\", spread across the provinces of Suruga, Tōtōmi and Mikawa, with the head of the clan, Tokugawa Iesato, moving to reside at Numazu. At this time, a group of \"hatamoto,\" led by Ebara Soroku, Abe Kuninosuke and Yatabori Keizō returned from studies in the Netherlands, and decided to establish a military academy along western lines within the grounds of Numazu Castle in December 1868.\n\nThe curriculum of the academy included English and French language and conversation, physics and chemistry, geography, astronomy, world history and economic theory. The curriculum was also weighed towards mathematics, particularly geometry and trigonometry, where were regarded as essential military subjects due to their usage in navigation, artillery targeting and surveying. The first head of the academy was Nishi Amane, who was a driving force behind the creation and elementary school associated with the military academy, which is now regarded as Japan’s first western-style elementary school.\n\nIn 1869, the first Japanese textbook on military engineering was published by the Numazu Military Academy.\n\nOn November 12, 1871 the academy came under the direct control of the Ministry of War and in 1872, it was closed, and moved to Tokyo, where it was merged with the new Imperial Japanese Army Academy.\n\nAlthough in existence for only four years, its 210 academy graduates and 150 elementary school graduates included many who went on to serve as generals in the Imperial Japanese Army, admirals in the Imperial Japanese Navy or as noted educators or politicians. Its elementary school served as a model for other elementary schools which were soon established throughout Japan.\n\nThe Numazu Military Academy was also the subject of the first film of director Tadashi Imai in 1939.\n\n\n"}

The association began when a group of primarily European counselors met and approached the National Association of College Admissions Counseling (NACAC) about the creation of an affiliate regional organization that would represent overseas counselors. OACAC became a chartered regional association.\n\nMembership is a privilege made available to eligible institutions, organizations, agencies and individuals as defined in the association’s Bylaws. OACAC is a not-for-profit organization (taxpayer ID 141-82-7265). The membership is made up of nearly 600 professionals from around the world who advise students as they make choices about pursuing postsecondary education.\n\nOACAC members can be primary and secondary school counselors, independent counselors, college admission and financial aid officers, enrollment managers, and organizations engaged in guiding students through the secondary to higher education transition process.\n\nThe conception of Overseas ACAC began with Gene Wallach, Counselor at the International School of Geneva. In the early 1970s, the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) was a small organization but colleges in the US were beginning to realize that students in ECIS schools were well qualified potential applicants. There was already a steady flow of students going to the US and recruitment staff from American universities were already visiting ECIS schools.\n\nAt the NACAC conference in St. Louis in the early 1980s a meeting was held to find a solution. \n\nAlthough there was continued interest and Frank Burtnett, the new Executive Director of NACAC attended an ECIS conference in Amsterdam to continue the dialogue, there seemed to be no solution to the difficulty posed by the NACAC by-laws denying membership to proprietary schools. The idea was on the point of being abandoned when a representative of the US State Department encouraged the members to continue and introduced them to Joyce Smith who was asked to help progress the issue.\n\nThe group continued to grow as more counselors from Europe began to attend NACAC conferences. At the NACAC National Conference in New York City a small group of international counselors met together to discuss common concerns. \n\nWith Joyce Smith’s strong support and encouragement, the project moved ahead and at the 1992 conference in Los Angeles, Regina Manley, President of NACAC that year, proposed the amendment admitting proprietary schools to NACAC with the condition that the schools were accredited.

{"id": "5829511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5829511", "title": "Peer mentoring", "text": "Peer mentoring\n\nPeer mentoring is a form of mentorship that usually takes place between a person who has lived through a specific experience (peer mentor) and a person who is new to that experience (the peer mentee). An example would be an experienced student being a peer mentor to a new student, the peer mentee, in a particular subject, or in a new school. Peer mentors are also used for health and lifestyle changes. For example, clients, or patients, with support from peers, may have one-on-one sessions that meet regularly to help them recover or rehabilitate. Peer mentoring provides individuals who have suffered from a specific life experience the chance to learn from those who have recovered, or rehabilitated, following such an experience. Peer mentors provide education, recreation and support opportunities to individuals. The peer mentor may challenge the mentee with new ideas, and encourage the mentee to move beyond the things that are most comfortable. Most peer mentors are picked for their sensibility, confidence, social skills and reliability.\n\nCritics of peer mentoring insist that little is known of the nature of peer mentoring relationships and that there are few consistent studies indicating the outcomes of peer mentoring beyond good feelings among peers and the development of friendships. Peer mentoring led by senior students may discourage diversity and prevent critical analysis of the higher education system.\n\nThe frequency with which peer mentors and mentees meet varies according to the particular mentoring program. Some pairs may make contact once a month, while others may meet 3-4 times per month or more. It is usually advised that mentors and mentees meet more often in the beginning of the relationship in order to establish a good foundation. Mentors and mentees may maintain contact through email, telephone or in-person meetings. Peer mentoring organizations may also set up social events for those participating in the program. These events provide good opportunities for increased social interaction between mentors and mentees.\n\nThe compatibility of mentor and mentee is a factor that should be taken into consideration when choosing pairs. Mentors and mentees may benefit from having similar backgrounds, interests and life experiences. Age, gender, ethnicity, language preferences, and education may be taken into consideration when pairing mentors with mentees.\n\nThe quality of the peer mentoring relationship is important for mentees to experience positive results. A mentor relationship is more successful when the mentor cares for the whole person and not just the academic or career side of a person. Successful mentors tend to be available, knowledgeable, educated in diversity issues, empathic, personable, encouraging, supportive, and passionate. Although this is not an exhaustive list of qualities, they have been shown to be important for successful mentoring relationships. It is important to keep qualities like this in mind when recruiting and training mentors.\n\nThe objectives of a peer mentoring program should be well-defined and measurable. The effectiveness of the program should be monitored to ensure that the objectives are being met. One way to monitor the effectiveness of a program is to administer evaluations to the mentors and mentees.\n\nPeer mentoring in education was promoted during the 1960s by educator and theorist Paulo Freire:\n\nPeer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life, however peer mentoring can occur at the grade school level, the undergraduate level, and the graduate school level. The goals of the program may vary according to the level, the educational institution or the discipline.\n\nPeer mentors in secondary schools aid in the transition of younger students from primary school to secondary school. They may assist mentees with their school work and study skills, peer pressure (such as pressure to use drugs or have sex), issues with attendance and behavior, and typical family problems. Youth mentors are persons for children or adolescents to spend time with, often to compensate for absent family members or an inadequate home environment. Mentoring programs for youth can be especially useful for students who are suffering from a lack of social support, and who therefore may be susceptible to delinquency.\n\nPeer mentors for undergraduates may assist newly admitted students with time management, study skills, organizational skills, curriculum planning, administrative issues, test preparation, term paper preparation, goal setting, and grade monitoring. Additionally, such mentors may provide other forms of social support for the student, such as friendship, networking, and aiding the student's adjustment to college life.\n\nA peer mentor at the graduate school level may assist new students in selecting an advisor, negotiating the advisor/advisee relationship, preparation for major examinations, publishing articles, searching for jobs, and adjusting to the rigors of graduate school life.\n\nPeer mentoring in higher education has enjoyed a good name and is seen favorably by both educational administrators and students. During the last decade, peer mentoring has expanded and is found in most colleges and universities, frequently as a means to outreach, retain, and recruit minority students.\nPeer mentoring is used extensively in higher education for several reasons:\n\nPeer mentoring may help new students adapt to a new academic environment faster. The relationship between the mentor and mentee gives the mentee a sense of being connected to the larger community where they may otherwise feel lost. Mentors are chosen because they are academically successful and because they possess good communication, social and leadership skills. As a consequence, mentors serve as positive role models for the students, guiding them towards academic and social success. Mentors provide support, advice, encouragement, and even friendship to students. Peer mentoring may improve student retention rates.\n\nMentors also stand to benefit from the mentor/mentee relationship. Mentors develop friendships through their participation in mentoring programs and usually derive satisfaction from helping a younger student, and possibly shaping his or her life in a positive way. Mentors may also be paid, and they may receive other benefits such as prioritized registration, course credit, and references.\n\nIn higher education tutorial settings, the benefits of peer mentoring programs also extend to class tutors. Using grounded theory techniques, Outhred and Chester found that five themes underlie their experiences: role exploration, sharing responsibility, regulation of the peer-tutored groups, harnessing the peer tutors’ role, and community.\n\nPeer mentoring programs usually target ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and women. This approach tends to be conceived out of the \"deficiency model\" where multi-ethnic students, women and students with disabilities are perceived as being in need of help and unlikely to succeed unless senior students or successful adults help them. One of the main criticisms of peer mentoring is the lack of research to show how peer mentoring relationships work, how they develop, and what their outcomes are. Also, the nature of being either a mentor or mentee and at the same time a peer can make the relationship a dual one where other identities also converge. Some peer mentoring programs promote assimilation among ethnic minority students because of the use of student role models who are perceived as successful in social and educational environments characterized by majority students. These role models then become the people that peer mentees strive to imitate or emulate. A more subtle criticism of peer mentoring refers to their lack of supervision and structure: most peer mentoring programs led by undergraduate students rarely have direct supervision of full-time university staff.\n\nGiven the fact that students are led by other students who serve as peer mentors, critics say that university staff may free themselves from their responsibility to listen and help first year students classified as peer mentees, the group with the largest attrition rate in higher education. Without extensive training and supervision, senior students who serve as mentors may offer unreliable guidance to peer mentees. There is little research on what happens within peer mentoring relationships. Maryann Jacobi, in an extensive meta-analysis of mentoring research, concludes by asking, \"Does mentoring help students succeed in college? If so, how? Both theoretical and empirical answers to these questions are lacking.” Stephanie Budge states:\n\nPeer mentoring in higher education usually focuses on social, academic, and cultural skills that can help students graduate from colleges and universities, and how the educational system works (e.g. how to apply for financial aid, how to register for classes, how to write papers, how to choose a major, etc.). The knowledge students receive usually comes from senior students who serve as peer mentors.\n\nAlthough peer mentoring programs are appealing to most people and seem easy to implement and develop, there is little research to suggest that peer mentoring gives the same results as classical mentoring.\n\nMorton-Cooper and Palmer distinguish between \"classical mentoring\" (also known as \"primary mentoring\") and \"contract or facilitated mentoring\". Classical mentoring is characterized as an informal, often spontaneous enabling relationship between an older mentor and a younger mentee, based on a shared wish to work together, usually for a long period, without financial compensation for the mentor.\n\nPeer mentoring differs from classical mentoring in two aspects. First, in peer mentoring mentors and mentees are close in age, experience, educational level, and they may also overlap in their personal identities, which are usually the criteria for matching, but this may leave junior students vulnerable to peer pressure and unsupervised rivalry. Second, peer mentoring programs are semi-structured planned programs with specific guidelines and frequently with a set number of meetings and activities within a predetermined amount of time. Students who enroll in peer mentoring programs tend to be matched mostly according to major, gender, language of preference, and ethnic background, and those students who share the largest number of similarities tend to become peers in the peer mentoring relationship. Little research is available to know what happens between peer mentors and peer mentees who have different characteristics.\n\nThe Handbook of Youth Mentoring provides the following definition of cross-age peer mentoring:\nCross-age mentoring can be distinguished from peer mentoring by the fact that the mentor is in a higher grade level and/or is older than the mentee, whereas in peer mentoring students of the same age are paired together based on varying levels of achievement. Karcher (2007) also notes:\n\nIn general, cross-age mentoring programs can involve a tutoring or teaching component, personal mentorship and guidance, or both, and they incorporate many of the advantages of other forms of peer mentorship. Because student mentors are closer in age, knowledge, authority and cognitive development than adult mentors, mentees often feel freer to express ideas, ask questions, and take risks. These similarities also make it easier for mentors to understand personal and academic problems that the mentee may be experiencing, and present solutions in a more understandable and relevant way. Furthermore, unlike same-age peer mentoring, cross-age programs can prevent feelings of inferiority on the part of the mentee when they are mentored or tutored by a student of the same age or status. Thus, mentors who are slightly older than their mentees can take advantage of the higher status provided by their age difference while enjoying increased compatibility with their students. The specific benefits of cross-age mentoring/tutoring are numerous, and are briefly described here in three main categories: increased academic achievement, improved interpersonal skills, and personal development.\n\nCross-age mentorship, and tutoring programs in particular, support the academic achievement and learning process of both the mentor and the mentee. Mentees benefit from increased personalized attention in a one-on-one setting and can work at their own pace. Sessions are customized for the mentee's individual questions, needs, and learning styles, and mentees gain a greater mastery of the material and concepts while developing creativity and critical thinking skills. The mentor may also gain a deeper understanding of the material or subject that they are teaching, as this relationship often encourages a deeper dedication to their own studies so that they may more effectively communicate what they’ve learned. The mentor gains a deeper sense of responsibility, dedication, and pride in being able to help a peer, while both students take pride in mutual accomplishments and successes. Ultimately, cross-age mentorship programs may increase retention and graduation rates, especially among minority students.\n\nIn addition to improved learning and transmission of information, the mentorship process allows both students to develop more effective interpersonal communication skills. Mentees learn how to effectively form and pose questions, seek advice, and practice active listening and concentration. Similarly, the mentors gain valuable practice in effective teaching strategies. This format fosters increased self-esteem, empathy and patience in both participants, potentially creating new friendships and breaking down social barriers for students struggling to adjust to a new academic setting. Often the mentor will serve as an important role-model, and can model academic skills and work habits as well as personal values (e.g. dedication to service, empathy, and internal motivation). This relationship can be pivotal for the success of new or underserved students in academia by providing an opportunity for peers to discuss academic issues, career choices, research ideas, and personal matters.\n\nCross-age mentoring programs require careful consideration of the goals, objectives and the available human, physical and financial resources in order to ultimately assess the progress made by the participants and the overall usefulness of the program. Frequent assessment is important as it gives valuable insight into how well the cross-age mentoring curriculum is organized and implemented, and provides positive reinforcement for both the mentor and mentee. Mentors should be pre-screened according to their academic proficiency and attitudes to ensure that they will be able to meet the needs of a mentee. Moreover, mentors will also benefit from ongoing training, supervision and psychological support by teachers, administrators, parents and other members of the community.\n\nBecause Sudbury schools are completely age-mixed from ages 4 thru 18, with no grades or age-segregated classrooms, it is common for students to engage in peer mentoring.\n\nOne established cross-age mentoring program is the Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program (VYP), which originated in San Antonio, Texas through the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA). In an effort to decrease truancy, the need for disciplinary actions and drop-out rates of students, this program paired up “at-risk” middle school students to tutor “at-risk” elementary school students, both primarily of Hispanic origin with limited English proficiency. In this case, the tutors who participated were not only rewarded by getting paid and receiving course credit, but also by receiving recognition for their service and by improving their own academic and tutoring skills through special tutoring classes. These VYP program benefits, in turn, resulted in a positive impact on school success and lowered the dropout rates of these tutors.\n\nThe Peer Mentor program at UMass Amherst offers undergraduate students the chance to be live-in, part-time staff members for freshman residents within residential life. This is a paid position. The Peer Mentor's \"job\" is to assist freshman students with their transition from high school to college. UMass Peer Mentors offers academic support within the first year hall and are responsible for connecting the residents to campus resources throughout the academic year. Peer mentors follow a curriculum that includes but are not limited to: assisting in New Student Orientation (NSO), academic mentoring (which includes references to tutoring centers, deans, and undergraduate advising), connecting faculty with the students, and hosting various academic success workshops.\n\nPeer mentoring can offer employees a valuable source of support and information in the workplace. Peer mentoring offers a low cost way to train new employees or to upgrade the skills of less experienced workers. Mentees may feel more comfortable learning from a peer than in a hierarchical setting. Mentors as well as mentees may also benefit from the bonds they form with colleagues. In 1978 Edgar Schein described multiple roles for successful mentors in the work setting. New employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.\n\nPeer mentoring has been shown to increase resistance to stress-related anxiety and depression in patients, or clients, affected by chronic illness or mental health issues. Mental health peer mentors and peer support groups help clients change their lifestyle and adhere to a more productive healthy lifestyle by adjusting habits and helping them realize helpful ways of coping and taking on personal responsibility. Peer mentors can also help patients prepare for medical and surgical procedures and adhere to treatment regimes. Peer mentoring has been implemented in programs to support survivors of traumatic brain injury, cancer patients, dialysis patients, diabetics persons with spinal cord injuries, and to reduce HIV transmission and increase adherence to treatment in HIV-positive IV drug users. Peer mentoring is also used in training health care workers.\n\nPeer mentoring has also been used to prevent gang violence in schoolchildren and teens, to improve the quality of child care among economically disadvantaged first-time mothers, and to improve performance in military recruits.\n\n\n\n"}

They are designed so they may be removed once the capacity situation abates, whether by a permanent addition to the school, another school being opened in the area, or a reduction in student population. Such buildings would be installed much like a mobile home, with utilities often being attached to a main building to provide light and heat for the room. Portable classrooms may also be used if permanent classrooms are uninhabitable, such as after a fire or during a major refurbishment.\n\nSometimes, the portable classrooms are meant to be long-lasting and are built as \"portapacks\". A portapack combines a series of portables and connects them with a hallway. Portapacks are usually separated from the main building but can connect to the school. In most cases, portapacks are accompanied with a few separate portables.\n\nPortable classrooms are also colloquially known as bungalows, t-shacks, trailers, terrapins, huts, t-buildings, portables, or relocatables. In the UK those built during 1945-50 were known as HORSA huts after the name of the Government's post-war building programme, \"Hutting Operation for the Raising of the School-leaving Age\". Others in the UK are often known as 'prattens' or 'Pratten huts' after the former Prattens company that supplied many of them after World War II.\n\nPortable classrooms are frequently criticized for presenting mold, moisture, comfort and unhealthy environment issues. \nHowever, when portable classrooms are properly set up and operated, experience has shown that they can present a very long useful life, low maintenance, and healthy, comfortable environments for all occupants.\n\nIn the United States, there are approximately 300,000 portable classrooms in use. About half of those are school-owned and of unknown age. The other half are owned by modular leasing companies and are between 5 and 6 years old on average.\n\nIf properly installed and maintained, a portable can have a useful life of approximately 30 to 50 years. Certain factors impact useful life, including capital improvements and the number of times a unit is relocated.\n\nA portable classroom can be any number of modular sections wide and typically has only a single level, but can be more than two stories high.\n\n"}

Historically, the best-documented use of such paintings was in the United States during World War I.\n\nDuring World War I, some military gunnery training was carried out indoors. While it is relatively simple to train gunners in range-finding (that is, estimating the correct distance for their shots) outdoors, it is difficult to train them in long-range gunnery indoors. To solve this problem, the British and U.S. militaries tested the use of large landscape paintings showing distant sites for range-finding and target-sighting in indoor gun ranges. These so-called range-finder paintings proved so successful that a program was organized in the United States to produce them in larger numbers. They were also used to teach soldiers how to draw military maps in the field and how to identify points of military importance such as zones of good cover.\n\nIn 1918, the Salmagundi Club in New York spearheaded the effort to produce range-finder paintings for the U.S. military, providing canvas and painting materials. The program resulted in dozens of landscape paintings of various French and Belgian sites that were roughly . Most showed towns and villages in the near or middle distance, along with other militarily important features such as roads, bridges, canals, fields, forests, and hills. \n\nThe painter Ernest L. Blumenschein helped to draft and organize artists across the United States for this effort, especially in his home town of Taos, New Mexico, and nearby Santa Fe. In Taos alone, 15 such range-finder paintings of landscapes in France were produced in 1918. Some of these were sent to Camp Cody in southern New Mexico and to Camp Funston in Kansas.\n\nArtists who participated besides Blumenschein included Gustave Baumann, O.E. Berninghaus, Harriet Blackstone, Paul Burlin, Ethel Coe, E. Irving Couse, W. Herbert Dunton, Leon Gaspard, Burt Harwood, Lee Hersch, J.T. Hunter, Sheldon Parsons, Bert Geer Phillips, J.H.

The main building of the airborne training block contain a paratroops complex, a flight school, and a dispatcher station. The block's capacity allows pilot training on all types of midget and small aircraft.\n\nAerodynamic complex building is intended for paratroopers training in vertical aerodynamic tunnel 5 meters in diameter. It is equipped with auditorium for 220 seats. This building is mainly engaged in training civilians and sport teams.\n\nThe whole academic process at the University is organized that the whole infrastructure of the University is engaged both for applied military as well as for sport civil directions.\n\nIn April 2016, the team composed of the Russian National Guard Troops \"Flying Squad\" members, who were trained at a special program developed by the University's instructors with the support from the Russian Geographic Society, held unique military tactical training in the Arctic. Under the guidance from the instructors, the team landed on the North Pole three times to practice different methods of special-purpose training in severe Arctic conditions over the course of three weeks. The trainees proved that they can fulfill tasks of any complexity in the extreme conditions in any part of the planet. This training provided methodological material and practical experience in relation to special operations drilling in the Polar conditions.\n\nIn 2015, Russian team, prepared by the training staff, demonstrated its skills by winning the title of winner at the Special Forces World Championship in Jordan. The competition held in Jordan welcomed 43 teams from 19 countries, including China, Iraq, USA, and Canada, who sent their top fighters to contest for the title.\n\nIn March 2017 the University's instructors team guided the production of the first combat buggies «Chaboz M-3» in Chechnya. The features of the vehicle include light construction, high cross-country ability and multifunctionality. Buggy is intended for transportation of troops and cargoes in heavy-going regions and off-road with high speed and high ride comfort. Thanks to these new vehicles forces in the course of special operations can quick strike militants' positions in forests, mountains and settlements and retreat immediately afterwards. Currently the buggies are used in training maneurves of troops in Russia, and some has been supplied to Syria.\n\nFor physical and military-patriotic upbringing of the youth, in 2017 an obstacle course «Heroes Race» was built in the University It was designed to be a sample of obstacle course for special forces training and is actively used for physical training and passing service targets by various special forces units of Russian Guard in Chechnya. The project became of great interest in the Caucasian Region, 2400 participants ran 10 kilometers overcoming 37 complicated obstacles on cross-country with crossing mountain river.\n\nIn May 2017 in Tactical City at the University was held V Open Championship of the Chechen Republic - a competition for various law enforcement structures of Russia.\n\nChampionship consisted of multiple disciplines and arranged close to real combat conditions, which aids all-round development of soldiers and improvement of their skills.

This work is a paid position within a specific DoD agency. Any changes to the original contract agreement made between the DoD and the award recipient may result in a longer duration of required employment. Multi-year recipients are also required to complete internships during the summers at their sponsoring facility at no additional compensation.\n\nIn the event that a recipient chooses to leave the program or fails to meet the program requirements, the recipient will be required to pay back in full all moneys that have been paid on their behalf to the DoD. At $25000-$38000 per year, plus orientation expenses, plus book and health insurance allowances, plus all tuition and fees, this amount can be very high. This payback amount is prorated depending on how long the recipient decides to stay in their post-graduation employment. As an example, if you are required to work for the government for two years and only complete one and want to leave the job at that time, you will be required to pay back approximately half of what was given to you during your Phase 1 educational time.

It also admits seminarians from the Society of African Missions and neighbouring countries.\n\nSince it was founded in 1988, the seminary has produced more than 500 priests.\n\nThe idea of setting up St. Paul’s was conceived in 1983 by the Bishops of the erstwhile Ecclesiastical Province of Cape Coast Diocese comprising the then Archdiocese and the dioceses of the southern belt of Ghana. The aim was to separate the philosophy department of St. Peter's Regional Seminary, Pedu, Cape Coast, from that of Theology. This was necessary as there was pressure on the facilities of St. Peter's at the time, due to increasing numbers of seminarians. There was also the need to initiate a spiritual year programme in response to the promptings of Pope John Paul II. The idea came to fruition when on January 15, 1988, the first batch of seminarians (48 young men) arrived to start the Spiritual Year Programme. Msgr. Rudolph Apietu was appointed the first Rector. Msgr. Michael Obosu became the first Spiritual Director. Sr. Charles Luanga, HDR, and Sr. Alexandrina, HDR, served as matrons.To begin the philosophy programmes, Frs. Stephen Acheampong, John Martin Darko, and Miachael Barima Apau joined the staff. Rev. John Martin Darko was later appointed the first Vice Rector. Frs. Augustine Abizi and Paul Bebodu commuted from Pedu as adjunct professors. Frs. Irvin Yangouru and Joseph Osei Bonsu also joined the staff from the University of Ghana. When in 1992 Msgr. Apietu’s tenure was over, Fr. Francis Abuah Quansah was appointed the 2nd Rector of the seminary. Ten years later, he was succeeded by the then vice rector, Fr.

The initial enrolment consisted of 28 students. It replaced the Benedict Community School, which had been in operation since 1976.\n\nBerne is a registered special school and founding member of the Association of Catholic Special School Services (ACSSS). It provides an education to those young people who are at risk of not completing their School Certificate (the basic level of qualification in New South Wales). Mainstream classes are unsuitable for most of the students because of behavioural, emotional, and familial reasons.\n\nThe John Berne School is owned and operated by the Marist Brothers, an order founded in France during the early 19th century by St Marcellin Champagnat.\n\nThe school caters for students who may be experiencing problems due to physical, psychological, emotional and/or familial reasons. They may also have learning difficulties and/or disorders. Their placement at Berne could be short term, where the aim is to work on the student’s behavioural or emotional issues in order to reintegrate them back into their mainstream school, or long term, where the aim is to continue to educate them through to the School Certificate.\n\nThe school’s culture has been designed to defuse a lot of the behavioural triggers the students were experiencing in mainstream schools. For example, there is no uniform and there is no set homework.\n\nThe student-teacher relationship is unusual compared to mainstream schools. Students address staff by their first name, and even eat meals together. All staff are expected to get involved in all school activities, such as camps, excursions and personal development activities.\n\nThere is a strong focus on reducing the derailing effects of learning difficulties and disorders by having small class sizes (of about five or six students per class), and by streaming students based on ability. The lower ability classes are purposefully even smaller, usually having only two or three students per teacher.\n\nThe school is unusual in its very high staff-to-student ratio. It is also distinctive in providing a number of special programs:\n\nIn 2006, the John Berne School received a \"Highly Commended National Achievement in School Improvement\" award from the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership.\n\nThe John Berne School has since 2010 operated a second campus, called \"Pete's Place School\", at Blacktown. Pete's Place operates in a different way from the main campus of the John Berne School: it has a smaller number of students (15 approximately) and the instruction, provided by three full-time teachers and one part-time teacher’s aide, is more individual.\n\n"}

An \"analysis of 14 years of hate crime data\" by the FBI found that gays and lesbians, or those perceived to be gay, \"are far more likely to be victims of a violent hate crime than any other minority group in the United States\". “As Americans become more accepting of LGBT people, the most extreme elements of the anti-gay movement are digging in their heels and continuing to defame gays and lesbians with falsehoods that grow more incendiary by the day,” said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report. “The leaders of this movement may deny it, but it seems clear that their demonization of gays and lesbians plays a role in fomenting the violence, hatred and bullying we’re seeing.” Because of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, nearly half of LGBTQ students have been physically assaulted at school. The campaign takes positive steps to counteract hateful and anti-gay speech that LGBTQ students experience in their daily lives in hopes to de-escalate the cycle of hate speech/harassment/bullying/physical threats and violence.\n\nThe campaign was created by the New York office of Arnold Worldwide, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas, and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). The campaign is the Advertising Council's first LGBT awareness campaign and is trying to achieve an ending to the use of what they consider offensive phrases such as \"that's so gay\". Television commercials for the campaign include singer Hilary Duff as well as comedian Wanda Sykes. In 2008 the campaign won the Ad Council's Gold Bell award for \"Best Public Service Advertising Campaign\" from the Ad Council.\n\nA U.S. government study, titled \"Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide\", published in 1989, found that LGBT youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people. This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to Minority Stress. Depression and drug use among LGBT people have both been shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed. Institutionalized and internalized homophobia may also lead LGBTQ youth to not accept themselves and have deep internal conflicts about their sexual orientation.\n\n\"Approximately 25 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students and university employees have been harassed due to their sexual orientation, as well as a third of those who identify as transgender, according to the study and reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education.\" \"LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say that they do not feel safe at school (22% vs. 7%) and 90% of LGBT students (vs. 62% of non-LGBT teens) have been harassed or assaulted during the past year.\" In addition, \"LGBQ students were more likely than heterosexual students to have seriously considered leaving their institution as a result of harassment and discrimination.\" Susan Rankin, a contributing author to the report in Miami, found that “Unequivocally, The 2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People demonstrates that LGBTQ students, faculty and staff experience a ‘chilly’ campus climate of harassment and far less than welcoming campus communities.\"\n\nHomophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to bullying. As seen in the nine LGBTQ youth suicides in September 2010, severe bullying can lead to extremities such as suicide. It does not always have to be physical, but it can be emotional, viral, sexual, and racial, too. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other verbal abuse. Viral, or cyber bullying, involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media networks. Sexual bullying is unwanted touching, lewd gestures or jokes, and racial bullying has to do with stereotypes and discrimination.\n\nBullying is often dismissed as a \"rite of passage\", but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. \"Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals\", and \"almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)\", according to GLSEN's \"Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation’s Schools\". These issues have become more mainstream in the 2000s (decade), and even more so in the months of September and October 2010 when a series of suicides got national attention. In August 2010 the US Department of Education (DOE) hosted the first-ever National Bullying Summit. President Barack Obama has posted an \"It Gets Better\" video on The White House website as part of the It Gets Better Project, it became the second most-viewed video on the White House YouTube channel.\n\n\"More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year,\" making it \"the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers.\" In 2004, 1,985 American adolescents under the age of twenty committed suicide, an increase of 18% from the previous year. Though it is impossible to know the exact suicide rate of LGBT youth because sexuality and gender minorities are often hidden and even unknown, particularly in this age group. Further research is currently being done to explain the prevalence of suicide among LGBT youths.\n\nKevin Jennings, who is openly gay and is the Assistant Deputy Secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools at the U.S. Department of Education, has experienced bullying himself at school and has hoped for this campaign for over ten years. The campaign aims to reduce homophobic slang among youth, and educate parents and teachers on how to create a safe space for LGBT teens. GLSEN and the Ad Council have reported that over half of all students have heard homophobic remarks being made often at school, and 9 out of 10 LGBT students have been harassed at school over the last year. The campaign encourages students to get involved by starting a Gay-Straight Alliance, educating their peers, and working to create a safer environment for LGBT students. This is the first campaign on GLBT issues since the Ad Council was founded in 1942. The campaign uses the slogan \"When you say ‘That’s so gay,’ do you realize what you say? Knock it off.\" Previously the council has run other anti-discrimination campaigns like \"A mind is a terrible thing to waste,” for the United Negro College Fund, and \"Expect the best from a girl and that’s what you’ll get\" to promote gender equality.\n\nGLSEN spent approximately $2 million dollars to produce the campaign, which was released along with GLSEN's \"2007 School Climate Survey\". It includes three television public service announcements (PSAs), six print PSAs and three radio PSAs. The ad was the first ever campaign by the Ad Council, \"which directs and coordinates public service campaigns on behalf of Madison Avenue and the media industry\", to address any GLBTQ issues. The campaign was done pro bono by the New York office of Arnold Worldwide.\n\nIn researching the possibility that public service directors, who decide which pro bono campaigns their media outlet will run, they found only a \"very small percentage\" who would not run the campaign but mainly due to their audience was much older. They also tested how to deliver the messages to \"tough and media savvy\" kids \"that speaks to young people in a tone they do not deem patronizing or condescending.\" Their goal became \"to show the situation in a new light [...] to point out this language can be hurtful and let the kids make their own decisions.\"\n\nAfter the first year of the campaign had been reached, the second harder-hitting phase addressing the consequences, \"sometimes life-or-death\", of anti-gay language was launched. The first phase focussed on showing the television PSAs to get young people to see how their language can be hurtful, the ads combined for \"more than $9 million worth of media exposure for the campaign's message since its launch in October 2008.\" The second phase will be more viral and enable people to embed banners and materials on websites and in their social media use. All the materials are downloadable from the campaign site. The Ad Council reports a high recognition of the television spots among teens (41% of teens aged 13–16 nationwide reporting that they have seen or heard at least one PSA) and a recent survey conducted by the Council shows \"significant shifts in key attitudes and behaviors regarding the use of anti-LGBTQ slurs.\" Another downloadable feature is a meter that tracks the occurrence of common LGBTQ slurs such as \"fag\" and \"dyke\" \"in real time—on the popular micro-blogging site Twitter.\"\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1985 and has since become the largest university in the country in terms of student enrollment and curriculum offered.\n\nUBD is ranked 100th in Asia by the 2019 QS Asia University Rankings\n, and 323rd in the world by the 2019 QS World University Rankings.\n\nUBD was established in 1985, opening its doors to the first intake of 176 students. Since then, UBD has seen an increase in the number of graduates, the introduction of new academic programmes, the enhancement of infrastructure and the development of graduate studies.\n\nThe university moved to its current location, Tungku Link, in 1995. There are nine academic faculties and seven research institutes covering the fields of Science, Health Sciences, Asian Studies, Policy Studies, Education, Business, Engineering, Biodiversity, Advanced Materials & Energy Sciences, Advanced Research, Applied Data Analytics, Islamic Studies, Leadership, Innovation & Advancement.\n\nUBD opened its doors to international students from its inception. Over the years, there has been an increase in diversity, with many students coming from East Asia (China and Japan), Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Today, UBD offers a range of programmes to enhance international relations, such as the Brunei-US Enrichment Programme for ASEAN and the Discovery Year programme, which encourages students to go abroad during the third year of their undergraduate programme.\n\nAdmissions to UBD is extremely competitive. Brunei had only 4 large universities that offer undergraduate and graduate studies, but 2 of them are religious universities, local applicants could only apply through online service known as \"HECAS\" (Higher Education Centralised Admission System) where the representatives of Ministry of Education and local universities to pick only qualified students that meet the requirements of points of specific exams such as General Cambridge Education A-Level Examinations.\n\n\nUBD currently offers five undergraduate degree programmes:\n\nUBD offers graduate degrees (Masters by coursework or by research and PhD) in the following disciplines:\n\nThe MRCGP (International) examinations were first established in the Institute of Medicine in 2005 after Brunei Darussalam was awarded host body status by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), UK.

{"id": "211917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211917", "title": "University of California, Santa Barbara", "text": "University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nThe University of California, Santa Barbara (commonly referred to as UC Santa Barbara or UCSB) is a public research university in Santa Barbara, California. It is one of the 10 campuses of the University of California system. It is considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the nation. Tracing its roots back to 1891 as an independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the University of California system in 1944 and is the third-oldest general-education campus in the system.\n\nUCSB is one of America's Public Ivy universities, a designation that recognizes top public research universities in the U.S. The university is a comprehensive doctoral university, and is organized into five colleges and schools offering 87 undergraduate degrees and 55 graduate degrees. UCSB was ranked 30th among \"National Universities\", fifth among U.S. public universities, and 37th among Best Global Universities by \"U.S. News & World Report\" 's 2019 rankings. The university was also ranked 48th worldwide for 2016-17 by the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\", and 45th worldwide by the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" in 2017.\n\nUC Santa Barbara is a high-activity research university with 10 national research centers, including the renowned Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Center for Control, Dynamical-Systems and Computation. Current UCSB faculty includes six Nobel Prize laureates, one Fields Medalist, 39 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 27 members of the National Academy of Engineering, and 34 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. UCSB was the No. 3 host on the ARPAnet and was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1995. The world-class faculty also includes two Academy and Emmy Award winners, and recipients of a Millennium Technology Prize, an IEEE Medal of Honor, a National Medal of Technology and Innovation and a Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics.\n\nThe UC Santa Barbara Gauchos compete in the Big West Conference of the NCAA Division I. The Gauchos have won NCAA national championships in men's soccer and men's water polo.\n\nUCSB traces its origins back to the Anna Blake School, which was founded in 1891, and offered training in home economics and industrial arts. The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School, which then became the Santa Barbara State College in 1921. \n\nIn 1944, intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara led by Thomas Storke and Pearl Chase persuaded the State Legislature, Gov. Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system. The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed in 1946 to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses. \n\nFrom 1944 to 1958, the school was known as Santa Barbara College of the University of California, before taking on its current name. When the vacated Marine Corps training station in Goleta was purchased for the rapidly growing college, Santa Barbara City College moved into the vacated State College buildings.\n\nOriginally, the regents envisioned a small, several thousand–student liberal arts college, a so-called \"Williams College of the West\", at Santa Barbara. Chronologically, UCSB is the third general-education campus of the University of California, after Berkeley and UCLA (the only other state campus to have been acquired by the UC system). The original campus the regents acquired in Santa Barbara was located on only of largely unusable land on a seaside mesa. The availability of a portion of the land used as Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara until 1946 on another seaside mesa in Goleta, which the regents could acquire for free from the federal government, led to that site becoming the Santa Barbara campus in 1949. \n\nOriginally, only 3000–3500 students were anticipated, but the post-WWII baby boom led to the designation of general campus in 1958, along with a name change from \"Santa Barbara College\" to \"University of California, Santa Barbara,\" and the discontinuation of the industrial arts program for which the state college was famous. A chancellor, Samuel B. Gould, was appointed in 1959. All of this change was done in accordance with the California Master Plan for Higher Education.\n\nIn 1959, UCSB professor Douwe Stuurman hosted the English writer Aldous Huxley as the university's first visiting professor. Huxley delivered a lectures series called \"The Human Situation\".\n\nIn the late '60s and early '70s, UCSB became nationally known as a hotbed of anti–Vietnam War activity. A bombing at the school's faculty club in 1969 killed the caretaker, Dover Sharp. In the spring 1970, multiple occasions of arson occurred, including a burning of the Bank of America branch building in the student community of Isla Vista, during which time one male student, Kevin Moran, was shot and killed by police. UCSB's anti-Vietnam activity impelled then-Gov. Ronald Reagan to impose a curfew and order the National Guard to enforce it. Armed guardsmen were a common sight on campus and in Isla Vista during this time.\n\nIn 1995, UCSB was elected to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities, with a membership consisting of 59 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.\n\nOn May 23, 2014, a killing spree occurred in Isla Vista, California, a community in close proximity of the campus. All six people killed during the rampage were students at UCSB. The murderer was a former Santa Barbara City College student who lived in Isla Vista.\n\n\nSanta Barbara State College was under the supervision of a president, but in 1944, when it became a campus of the University of California, the title of the chief executive was changed to provost. In September 1958, the Regents of the University of California established Santa Barbara as a general university campus, and the official title of the chief executive was changed to chancellor. UCSB's first provost was thus Clarence L. Phelps, while UCSB's first chancellor was Samuel B. Gould.\n\nUCSB is located on cliffs directly above the Pacific Ocean. UCSB's campus is completely autonomous from local government and has not been annexed by the city of Santa Barbara, and thus is not part of the city. While it appears closer to the recently formed city of Goleta, a parcel of the City of Santa Barbara that forms a strip of \"city\" through the ocean to the Santa Barbara airport, runs through the west entrance to the university campus. Although UCSB has a Santa Barbara mailing address, as do other unincorporated areas around the city, only this entry parcel is in the Santa Barbara city limits. The campus is divided into four parts: Main (East) Campus , which houses all academic units, plus the majority of undergraduate housing; Storke Campus; West Campus; and North Campus. The campuses surround the unincorporated community of Isla Vista.\n\nUCSB is one of a few universities in the United States with its own beach. The campus, bordered on two sides by the Pacific Ocean, has miles of coastline, its own lagoon, and the rocky extension, Goleta Point, which is also known as \"Campus Point\". The campus has numerous walking and bicycle paths across campus, around the lagoon and along the beach. It owns and manages Coal Oil Point nature preserve on the West Campus.\n\nMuch of the campus's early architecture was designed by famed architect William Pereira and his partner Charles Luckman, and made heavy use of custom tinted and patterned concrete block. This design element was carried over into many of the school's subsequent buildings.\n\nThe lagoon is a large body of water adjacent to the coastline, between San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls. It was created from a former tidal salt marsh flat, and is fed by a combination of runoff and ocean water used by the Marine Science Building's aquatic life tanks; thus it's a unique combination of fresh and salt water. Many of the older campus buildings are being replaced with newer facilities. \n\nThe UCSB Libraries, consisting of the Davidson Library and the Arts Library, hold more than three million bound volumes and millions of microforms, government documents, manuscripts, maps, satellite and aerial images, sound recordings, and other materials. Situated at the center of campus, the UCSB Library will break ground on a significant addition and renovation project in June 2013.\n\nCampbell Hall is the university's largest lecture hall with 862 seats. It's also the main venue for the UCSB Arts & Lectures series, which presents special performances, films, and lectures for the UCSB campus and Santa Barbara community.\n\nStorke Tower, completed in 1969, is the tallest building in Santa Barbara County. It can be seen from most places on campus, and it overlooks Storke Plaza. It is home to a five-octave, 61-bell carillon. KCSB 91.9 and the \"Daily Nexus\" have headquarters beneath Storke Tower.\n\nThe UCSB Family Vacation Center, founded in 1969, is a summer family camp located on campus that draws over 2,000 guests each summer. The staff of over 50 includes many UCSB students who have been extensively trained as camp counselors.\n\nThe university (itself termed a campus of the University of California) is divided into two physical campuses: West Campus and East Campus. The vast majority of university facilities, including all lecture halls and laboratories, are in the East Campus. The two campuses are connected by a large strip (known as the North and Storke Campuses) to the north which contain university housing and athletic fields. Thus, the university surrounds Isla Vista on three sides. West Campus, aside from a few buildings dedicated to faculty housing, has largely been leased out to private organizations, and includes a school for the disabled (part of the Devereux Foundation) and a large nature preserve, the Coal Oil Point Reserve. The largest sand dunes on the south-facing coast of the Santa Barbara Channel are located here.\n\nThe East Campus centers around two quadrangles, separated from each other by the main library and bus circle, and the life sciences buildings. In the East side of Campus, the Davidson Library was recently renovated. The Library construction finished November 2015 and opened to the school January 2016. Along the western quad are Storke Plaza and buildings housing the various arts, social sciences, and humanities departments. The Student Resource Building and the Events Center are also located along this quad. Surrounding the wider, park-like eastern quad are buildings housing the physical sciences departments and the College of Engineering. Directly to the south of, but not adjacent to, the eastern quad are the life sciences and psychology departments, as well as most of the on-campus housing. The southernmost section of the campus is dominated by the lagoon. The peninsula extending from the beach into the lagoon contains a labyrinth.\n\nUCSB is known for its extensive biking system. A recent survey says that 53% of UCSB students get around by cycling. Bicycles have exclusive right of way on a series of specifically designated paths throughout East Campus. Bicycle stands and lockers are ubiquitous. UCSB is unique among bicycle-heavy areas in that most travel is done within a small radius.\n\nUC Santa Barbara is a large, comprehensive, primarily residential doctoral university. The full-time, four-year undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and has an arts & sciences focus with high graduate coexistence. UCSB is organized into five colleges and schools offering 87 undergraduate degrees and 55 graduate degrees. The campus is the sixth-largest in the UC system by enrollment with 18,620 undergraduate and 3,065 graduate students. In 2015, UCSB was designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution.\n\nAdmission to UC Santa Barbara is rated as \"most selective\" by \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nUC Santa Barbara received 92,305 applications for admission to the Fall 2018 incoming freshman class; 29,782 were admitted, with an acceptance rate of 32.3%. Admitted freshmen had GPA and test scores of middle 25%–75% of 4.00-4.26 and SAT 640–780 (mathematics) and 630–720 (evidence-based reading and writing).\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation, UC Santa Barbara spent $236.5 million on research and development in fiscal 2013, ranking it 87th in the nation.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, UCSB was ranked fourth in terms of relative citation impact in the U.S. (behind MIT, Caltech, and Princeton University) according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nUCSB hosts 12 National Research Centers, including the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, the Southern California Earthquake Center, the UCSB Center for Spatial Studies, an affiliate of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, and the California Nanosystems Institute. Eight of these centers are supported by the National Science Foundation. UCSB is also home to Microsoft Station Q, a research group working on topological quantum computing where American mathematician and Fields Medalist Michael Freedman is the director.\n\nThe focus of the University of California is on research. Like all University of California campuses, UCSB prioritizes academic development over vocational learning. Undergraduate teaching is centered on lectures, with larger lecture classes having sections. Sections may be tutorial style, or they may be set up as seminars or discussions. For undergraduates, UCSB confers both B.A. and B.S. degrees. Music majors may pursue a Bachelor of Music degree. Graduate teaching involves seminar style classes and an emphasis on research and further study. UCSB confers M.A., M.S., and Ph.D degrees. Those studying music may pursue a MM or DMA degree. Students pursuing a career in education may receive a MEd or EdD degree. The university granted 5,812 bachelor's, 578 master's, and 354 Ph.D degrees in 2010–2011.\n\nUCSB is considered to be a \"Public Ivy\". The 2019 edition of \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked UC Santa Barbara as fifth best public university and tied for the 30th best university in the United States. UCSB also placed sixth among public universities in its list of colleges and universities that offer students the best education value. \"Money\" magazine ranked UC Santa Barbara 93rd in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2015 Best Colleges ranking. The Daily Beast ranked UC Santa Barbara 40th in the country out of the nearly 2000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking. In 2015, \"Kiplinger\" ranked UCSB 16th out of the top 100 best-value public colleges and universities in the nation, and third in California. UC Santa Barbara was ranked 17th in the United States by Payscale and CollegeNet's Social Mobility Index college rankings.\n\nThe \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" ranked UCSB 48th worldwide for 2016–17, while the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" (ARWU) in 2016 ranked UCSB 42nd in the world, 28th in the nation, and in 2015 tied for 17th worldwide in engineering.\n\nIn the United States National Research Council rankings of graduate programs, 10 UCSB departments were ranked in the top ten in the country: Materials, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Marine Science Institute, Geography, History, and Theater and Dance. Among U.S. university Materials Science and Engineering programs, UCSB was ranked first in each measure of a study by the National Research Council of the NAS\n\nThe Centre for Science and Technologies Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands ranked UCSB as the seventh-best research university in the world based on mean normalized citation score, and as the second best in the world based on the proportion of the publications to the top 10% most frequently cited.\n\n\"The Global Research Report: United States\" published by Thomson Reuters in November 2010 rated UCSB's research fourth nationally in citation impact.\n\nAmong U.S. university economics programs, in 2010 UCSB was ranked sixth for experimental economics, third for environmental economics, and 12th for cognitive and behavioral economics by RePEc.\n\n\"Washington Monthly\", whose ranking focuses on public service and research impact, named UCSB as the 17th best national university in 2016.\n\nIn the United States National Research Council rankings of graduate programs, 10 UCSB departments were ranked in the top ten in the country: Materials, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Marine Science Institute, Geography, History, and Theater and Dance.\n\n\"U.S. News & World Report\" 's 2016 rankings placed UCSB's graduate programs in Materials Engineering and Chemical Engineering the second and ninth best in the U.S., respectively; graduate school Physics was ranked 10th best, including the fifth-best program for Condensed Matter Physics, seventh-best program for Quantum Physics, seventh-best program for Elementary Particles/Field/String Theory, and eighth-best program for Cosmology/Relativity/Gravity. In terms of the social sciences, UCSB's graduate program in Sociology is ranked first for research in sex and gender, and the History department is ranked seventh for women's history.\n\nUCSB's Department of Communication was recognized as top in the nation based on data from the National Research Council's study. Several areas in UCSB's Department of Communication have been Ranked Best in Nation by the National Communication Association. Specifically, UCSB's Department of Communication has been ranked first in the nation for Interpersonal and Small Group Communication, first in the nation for Intercultural/International Communication, second in the nation Organizational Communication, fourth in the nation for Communication and Technology, and 17th in the nation for Mass Communication. \n\nUCSB's Department of Communication has been ranked third in the nation in terms of research productivity, according to a recent analysis of scholarly articles that have appeared in eight academic journals sponsored by the National Communication Association and the International Communication Association. In addition, UCSB's Department of Communication has been named one of the top high-impact departments in the nation.\n\nWebometrics ranked UCSB 87th worldwide in its July 2014 ranking. In 2015, \"QS World University Rankings\" ranked UCSB 129th in the world.\n\n\"Forbes\" magazine ranked the university 114th in the nation (and 50th best research university) in July 2016. This ranking focuses mainly on net positive financial impact, in contrast to other rankings, and generally ranks liberal arts colleges above most research universities.\n\nPayScale’s 2015-16 College Salary Report (ranking universities in terms of graduates' salary potential), UCSB came in first in computer science, seventh in engineering, 14th in Humanities, and 30th in Social Sciences.\n\nUCSB was ranked third in \"The Princeton Review\"'s 2015 list of top party schools.\n\nSanta Barbara is one of the ten major campuses affiliated with the University of California. The University of California is governed by a 26-member Board of Regents, 18 of which are appointed by the Governor of California to 12-year terms, seven serving as \"ex officio\" members, and a single student regent. The position of chancellor was created in 1952 to lead individual campuses. The Board of Regents appointed Henry T. Yang to be the fifth chancellor of the university in 1994.\n\n\nUC Santa Barbara has three colleges: the College of Letters & Science, the College of Engineering, and the College of Creative Studies. The College of Creative Studies offers students an alternative approach to education by supporting advanced, independent work in the arts, mathematics, and sciences. The campus also has two professional schools: the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, located in Bren Hall, and the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education.\n\nFounded in 1973, the Institute for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research (ISBER), originally the Community and Organization Research Institute (CORI), is the research unit for work in the social sciences. In 1990, it absorbed the Social Process Research Institute (SPRI), and its work now includes the humanities.\n\nIn February 2015, UCSB opened The Confucius Institute on campus, one of about 400 installments located around the world. It will be aimed at promoting the study of Chinese language, culture, history, science, politics, and economics.\n\nThe university runs on a quarter system. There are three terms in the normal academic year: fall, winter, and spring, as well as a summer term. At the beginning of each term, there are one to three days of pre-instructional activities, where faculty meet to discuss instructional plans. During this period, students acquaint themselves to the campus and have the opportunity to take placement tests. At the end of each term, one week is devoted to final exams and special academic activities. There are 146 days of instruction, with a minimum of 48 per term.\n\nUCSB is a politically active campus. For the 2008 presidential election, UCSB won a national college competition for student voter registration by registering 10,857 voters, or 51.5% of the student population. Over the years, many political parties and organizations have been known to be active on campus, such as the College Republicans, Campus Democrats, Green Party, Libertarians, NORML, and the Queer Student Union.\n\nThere are a variety of on campus centers offering social, recreational, religious, and preprofessional activities for students. The UCSB Multicultural Center puts on numerous activities every year to support students of color and promote awareness of diversity issues on campus. Other organizations and centers include \"The Daily Nexus\", a daily newspaper; La Cumbre yearbook; the school radio station, KCSB 91.9; \"The Bottom Line\", a weekly newspaper; and \"The Gaucho Free Press\", the campus's conservative magazine. \n\nThe UCSB Recreation Center also hosts a variety of activities, from adventure programs to ballroom dancing classes. Further, UCSB offers a space for UCSB's large Jewish population and a place for Jewish students to come together in a unique building in Isla Vista. Students socialize at the Arbor, the UCen, the Coral Tree Cafe, the Courtyard Cafe, and for a special lunch, the Faculty Club.\n\nUCSB is also known for its annual free music festival, Extravaganza. It is held at Harder Stadium in the spring and generally attracts around 8,000 people. Past performers have included Nas, T.I., E-40, Sublime, Run-D.M.C., The Pharcyde, Social Distortion, Jack Johnson, Drake, and Snoop Dogg, among many others.\n\nThe Nu chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive nonprofit social-service club, was installed here in 1939. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America.\n\nThere are eight residence halls at UCSB, seven of which are located at the main campus. One, Santa Catalina, is located near the entrance to West Campus north of Isla Vista.\n\nSanta Catalina has its own dining commons, Portola Dining Commons, as well as a heated swimming pool, two lounges, numerous study rooms, two recreational rooms, a gym, as well as tennis courts and an expansive lawn. Because Santa Catalina is nearly off-campus, it has its own campus police station, as well as housing offices and Res-Net support center.\n\nThe Main Campus residence halls are found in two different locations. On the east end of campus are the residence halls named after five of the Channel Islands: Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, San Miguel and San Nicolas. There are two dining commons located near the Channel Islands residence halls. The Ortega Dining Commons is located between San Miguel and the University Center (UCen), and the De La Guerra Dining Commons is located between Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and San Nicolas.\n\nThe two other residence halls, San Rafael and Manzanita Village, are located on the west side of campus and primarily house continuing and transfer students. The Carrillo Dining Commons is located in Manzanita Village, right next to San Rafael Hall. Manzanita Village was completed in 2002, and is the newest residence hall on campus.\nIn addition, the university also has four housing complexes for graduate students and their families: San Clemente Villages for single graduate students, Santa Ynez Apartments, El Dorado Apartments, Westgate Apartments, and family student housing: West Campus Apartments and the Storke Apartment complexes. There is also faculty housing at the West Campus Point and new construction underway at the North Campus. The Sierra Madre Villages, located by the West Campus Apartments, was completed in September 2015 and was the first residential complex certified as LEED platinum throughout the entire UC system. UC Santa Barbara is the only campus in the UC system with any \"LEED for Homes\" certifications.\n\nPrivate residence halls are also available to UCSB students. Tropicana Del Norte, located directly adjacent to the Main Campus, houses UCSB students in 51 furnished suites, and has an on-site dining hall and heated pool.\n\nStudents may also choose to rent housing in the bordering community of Isla Vista. An estimated average for rent costs is $500 to $800 a month to share a bedroom, and includes trash pickup and water utilities. Low-cost housing is limited, with the cheapest source being the Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative.\n\nOther sources of housing include the Greek system, and outlying communities (i.e., Goleta, Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, Montecito). Some students live in Isla Vista, which is immediately adjacent to campus. Since the early '60s, Isla Vista has had a reputation of being a party environment. UCSB is also affiliated with the Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative in Isla Vista, which seeks to provide low rent co-op housing regardless of gender, race, social, political, or religious affiliation, thereby influencing the community to eliminate prejudice and discrimination in the community.\n\nThere are a number of academic resources offered by the university, including a writing center, open computer labs, a machine shop, a career and counseling center, and drop-in academic advising.\n\nThe UCSB Recreation Center provides classes and facilities for students and faculty. The center has swimming pools, racquetball courts, a rock wall, and exercise machines. The University Center has facilities for meetings and presentations, and also contains a bookstore, restaurants, and a cashier.\n\nUCSB has a health clinic. Students with ailments or seeking medical assistance may consult a physician at the clinic. The clinic also offers basic healthcare, and provides emergency medicine and contraceptives. The university is the only UC campus with its own paramedic rescue unit. It's staffed by full-time professional paramedics and part-time undergraduate EMTs.\n\nSexInfo, which was started in 1976 by professors John and Janice Baldwin, is run by students doing advanced course work and research on sexuality through UCSB's Sociology Department. The site is dedicated to providing accurate information about sexuality in a way that is both informative and personal. SexInfo answers questions sent in by readers from all over the world, as well as regularly updates and posts articles on various topics related to human sexuality. This program helps students getting their degree in psychology.\n\nThe mascot of UCSB is the Gaucho and the school colors are blue and gold. UCSB's sports teams compete in the Big West Conference, with the exception of the men's water polo, men's and women's swimming, and the men's volleyball teams, which are in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. Santa Barbara is best known for its men's swimming and men's soccer teams. In 2006, UCSB won their first NCAA men's soccer title and its second overall NCAA championship (1979 water polo) in school history.\n\nWhile there are some 400 students in ICA, there are over 700 in club sports teams, including Alpine racing, cycling, fencing, field hockey, lacrosse, roller hockey, rugby, sailing, soccer, triathlon, ultimate frisbee, water ski, and rowing. Many of these teams are highly regarded and compete against Intercollegiate teams from across the U.S. For example, rowing has produced several national team members including nine-time National Rowing Team member Amy Fuller, winner of several Olympic and World Championship medals, and currently head of the UCLA Rowing Program. The UCSB cycling team has also produced several national team members, Olympians, and members of numerous U.S. and international professional teams.\n\nHundreds of students participate in a large intramural program consisting of badminton, basketball, bowling, flag football, golf, floor hockey, indoor and outdoor soccer, racquetball, squash, running, softball, tennis, table tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, inner-tube water polo, and kickball.\n\nSurfing also draws many students to UCSB. The on-campus beaches include a number of decent surfing sites, including \"Poles,\" \"Campus Point,\" \"Depressions\" and \"Sands\" and \"Devereaux Point\" on West Campus. Because Campus Beach actually faces south and east, and is shielded by the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, the surf is usually quite small. However, a large north or west swell can wrap in to create great waves that are typically very clean and good for surfing. UCSB has a surf team that competes in National Scholastic Surfing Association competitions and is generally considered one of the best in the nation. They continued their reputation by winning a record 14th national title at the college level in 2010's finals.\n\nCurrent UCSB faculty have received several prestigious awards, including six Nobel Prizes and a Fields Medal. In addition, there are 29 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 27 members of the National Academy of Engineering, and 31 members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences on the faculty.\n\n\nUC Santa Barbara alumni have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. Carol Greider, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2009), graduated from the College of Creative Studies with a B.A. in biology in 1983. Robert Ballard, oceonographer who discovered the RMS Titanic in 1985, graduated from UCSB in 1965 with a degree in chemistry and geology. \n\nActors who have studied at UCSB include Academy Award winner Michael Douglas, who received a B.A. in drama in 1968 and who is honorary president of the UCSB Alumni Association, and Gwyneth Paltrow, who studied anthropology before dropping out to act. \n\nFilmmakers who have studied at UCSB include Academy Award nominee Don Hertzfeldt, who received a B.A. in Film Studies in 1998; Gregg Araki, director of films like \"Mysterious Skin\" and \"The Doom Generation\", who got his B.A. from UCSB in 1982; Brad Silberling, director of films like \"Moonlight Mile\" and \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\"; and Gavin Garrison, who received a B.A. in Global Studies in 2007 and now produces the Emmy-nominated television show \"Whale Wars\". \n\nMusicians who have attended include Robby Krieger, guitarist in The Doors, singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, and electro-house musician Steve Aoki.

Brasler (born October 28, 1940, in St. Louis, Missouri) was, for half a century, the journalism adviser for the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools' school paper, The Midway, and yearbook, U-Highlights.\n\nBrasler grew up in Normandy, Missouri and attended Normandy High School, outside of St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Harris Teachers College and Junior College for two years, becoming managing editor of the campus newspaper his sophomore year. He proceeded to the University of Missouri School of Journalism]], where he was copy editor of the student newspaper the Maneater, earning a BJ degree there before taking a job at the Jewish Post and Opinion in St. Louis. He later earned a Masters in Language Arts at Northeastern Illinois University taking night and summer classes while still working six days and 80 hours a week. As a child in St. Louis, Brasler hung out at T.V. and radio stations as soon as he could ride streetcars alone and appeared on a children's radio show on KXLW in suburban Clayton. His mentor was the host of the show, who also taught kindergarten at his grade school. He originally planned a career in radio and television but at Normandy High decided he wanted to be a journalist and journalism teacher. He also had an extensive career as a singer, under the stage name Jim Andrews.\n\nIn 1996 the National Scholastic Press Association named a new high school journalism award after Brasler, the Brasler Prize, given to the most outstanding piece of work published in a high school newspaper every year. Recently the University of Missouri School of Journalism awarded him its prestigious Gold Medal for his highly vocal defense of student press rights and his history in scholastic journalism. Besides teaching journalism and advising publications for nearly half a century, Brasler has remained a working journalist. He also has written program notes for dozens of C.D. releases, edited several best-selling music books and music biographies, and wrote a soon-to-be-published autobiography and a biography for the singer Joni James. He formed a Joni James fan club in 1955 and still publishes the Joni James Newsletter, a full-color magazine. He is regarded as an expert on American popular music of the 20th century and has been consulted on numerous recording projects. He also is an expert on St. Louis County streetcar lines (his father was once a streetcar motorman) and has written numerous articles on them. In January 2015 he retired after 51 years at the University of Chicago Lab Schools to devote full-time to the publications he does for the Normandy Alumni Association in Normandy, Missouri; a magazine he does for the singer Joni James, a publication he started while in high school; and a monthly newsletter he does for a friend's transmission business, all of these projects for profit.\n"}
