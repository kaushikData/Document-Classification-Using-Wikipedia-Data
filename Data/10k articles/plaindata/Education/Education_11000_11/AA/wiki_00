The idea to purchase the satellite developed out of a meeting in Berlin of thirty people under the age of thirty, described by A Human Right's founder, Kosta Grammatis, as a \"do tank\" (as opposed to a think tank). A Human Right hopes that providing internet access to impoverished regions of the world would help to solve many of their problems, such as shortages of food, potable water, and health care. Grammatis believes that, \"People are ingenious. If you give people access to information, they can solve their own problems.\"\n\nInternet and phone access to citizens of countries whose government has shut down all communications is another benefit proposed by A Human Right. This was inspired by the 2011 Egyptian protests, where the government shut down internet and phone access to its citizens.\n\nThe goal of A Human Right is to have a satellite in geo-synchronous orbit over Africa, which would provide free internet access to African nations. A Human Right intends to pay for the operation of the satellite through buying and reselling high-speed bandwidth while providing low-bandwidth internet for free. They are also working on developing an open-source, low-cost modem as part of providing internet access to those who can't currently pay for it.\n\nSAex (South Atlantic Express) is a proposed submarine communications cable that will link South Africa and Angola to Brazil, with onward connectivity to the United States. The cable route, as originally planned, was to narrowly miss the remote island of Saint Helena, a British Overseas Territory.\n\nThe project was successful and in mid-2012 the cable's path was changed.\n\n"}

She was elected to the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in 1966 during the desegregation and integration period. Under her administration as president in 1970, Indianapolis developed their desegregation plan. She was honored as Woman of the Year in 1970 by Theta Sigma Phi for her service in implementing integration and for being the only woman to have served on the board. She also served on the Tax Review Board and Historic Landmarks Foundation. She had a lifelong commitment to education and has had numerous awards named in her honor.\n\nAnna Margaret Ross was born in November, 1913 in Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, Indiana to Linn Carnahan Ross and Gladys Gould Ross. She attended Jefferson High School in Lafayette before earning her Bachelor of Science at Purdue University in 1935. That same year on 14 August 1935, she married John Arthur Alexander. The two met at Purdue and her husband became an attorney with Krieg, DeVault, Alexander, and Capehart in Indianapolis. The couple made their home in Indianapolis and had two sons.\nAlexander organized the first mental health fund drive in Marion County, Indiana and spent six years on the Marion County Mental Health Board. She was concerned about reading levels and became involved in the school system, joining the Parent Teacher’s Associations of PS #80 and Broad Ripple High School. She was elected to the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in 1966 and served until 1970. Her final year, she was president. This was the period when Indianapolis’s public schools were desegregated, the teaching staff was integrated, and public busing began. Multiple lawsuits were filed and the school commissioners implemented the federal desegregation programs. The final plan which was adopted, involved phasing out the two mostly black high schools and redirecting the elementary graduates to other high schools. Crispus Attucks High School would close after 3 years and Shortridge High School would be turned into a Community College. Alexander confirmed that the plan, while addressing the lawsuit mandate, had been developed independently from the federal recommendations by the board over several months with consultations from citizens and the schools. Also during Alexander's tenure, hot lunches were implemented in all elementary schools in the school district and instructional TV was begun. She was honored at a banquet attended by the governor as the Theta Sigma Phi Woman of the Year in 1970 for her service as the only woman on the Indianapolis School Board.\n\nAlexander served on the Marion County Tax Review Board for three years in the early 1970s and served for nineteen years on the state's Historic Landmarks Foundation. Other organizations that Alexander was involved with included The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, Indiana Landmarks, Indiana State Symphony Society, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Mother’s March of Dimes for Polio, and St. Paul’s Episcopal Church. Alexander also was a long-term volunteer and donor at the Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, which gives out annual honors to volunteers, “Help & Hope Hero Awards,” named in her honor.\n\nAlexander died 16 February 1995. Purdue’s baseball facility was named in honor of Alexander and her husband when the new stadium was dedicated in 2013. Hillsdale College has an endowed chair in History and Political Science in her name.\n"}

Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in disabled sports, where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.\n\nAn increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology. Assistive technology devices can be simple, \"low-tech\", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple or advanced. Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games. More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities \"have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity\".\n\nAssistive devices can enable exercise and training, on top of enabling participation in a sport. Below are some of the assistive devices currently available for different impairments:\n\nSports that use assistive technology may include the following:\n\n\nMany of the sports listed above have attained international elite sport status, being included in the Paralympic Games.\n\nSome sports have developed with the goal of creating a challenge that players with a disability could enjoy. These sports require assistive technology for all players as part of the game. Some examples are: Sledge (sled) hockey; wheelchair basketball; adaptive sailing, with boats designed especially for sailors with disabilities; Nordic (cross-country) skiing with \"sit-ski\" buckets; and handcycling races.\n\nSport wheelchairs are designed for the requirements of specific sports. Power chairs can also be fitted with assistive devices that are temporary adaptations to the demands of a sport, such as a kick plate attached to a power chair for powerchair football (power soccer).\n\nLight-weight frames are a necessity for wheelchairs used in sports requiring sharp, fast turns and overall agility, such as tennis, basketball, and racing.\n\nChairs with reinforced frames and impact protection are required for contact sports, such as wheelchair rugby or basketball.\n\nRacing chairs are designed with bucket seats, angled wheels for improved stability, and a t-frame with a third wheel in front, allowing precision steering as well as improving balance. The athlete and wheelchair are viewed together by some sport researchers as a unified performance system. Improvements can be made to chairs by evaluating the chair and athlete separately or in performance conditions together. \nProsthetic devices come in a variety of designs suited to different athletic purposes. Prosthetic legs may be designed for rock climbing, running, or jumping. The technology is designed to attain goals such as greater gait efficiency when running. The technology is constantly improving, to meet the demands of athletes who set ever-higher sports challenges for themselves. South African athlete Oscar Pistorius, using energy-storing prosthetic legs, fought for the right to run against able-bodied athletes in the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and won the right to compete, although he did not meet the qualifying time required for the traditional able-bodied competitions.\nFunctional classification systems are used to evaluate and categorize athletes in elite sports, the classification determines the type and extent of assistive technology use by the athlete.\n\nOrganizations and associations at the national and international level support the development of adaptive sport and recreation, often through the use of assistive technology for players. These organizations are \"growing in number and scope\". \n\n"}

{"id": "30428029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30428029", "title": "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother", "text": "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\n\nBattle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a book by American author and lawyer Amy Chua that was published in 2011. It quickly popularized the concept and term \"tiger mother\" while also becoming the inspiration for the 2014-2015 Singaporean TV show \"Tiger Mum,\" the 2015 mainland Chinese drama \"Tiger Mom,\" and the 2017 Hong Kong series \"Tiger Mom Blues.\"\n\nThe complete blurb of the book reads: \"This is a story about a mother and two daughters. This was \"supposed\" to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures and a fleeting taste of glory.\"\n\nAn article published under the headline \"Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior\" in \"The Wall Street Journal\" on January 8, 2011, contained excerpts from her book, in which Chua describes her efforts to give her children what she describes as a traditional, strict \"Chinese\" upbringing. This piece was controversial. Many readers missed the supposed irony and self-deprecating humor in the title and the piece itself and instead believed that Chua was advocating the \"superiority\" of a particular, very strict, ethnically defined approach to parenting. In fact, Chua has stated that the book was not a \"how-to\" manual but a self-mocking memoir. In any case, Chua defines \"Chinese mother\" loosely to include parents of other ethnicities who practice traditional, strict child-rearing, while also acknowledging that \"Western parents come in all varieties\", and not all ethnically Chinese parents practice strict child-rearing.\n\nChua also reported that in one study of 48 Chinese immigrant mothers, the vast majority \"said that they believe their children can be 'the best' students, that 'academic achievement reflects successful parenting', and that if children did not excel at school then there was 'a problem' and parents 'were not doing their job'\". Chua contrasts them with the view she labels \"Western\"that a child's self-esteem is paramount.\n\nIn one extreme example, Chua mentioned that she had called one of her children \"garbage\", a translation of a term her own father called her on occasion in her family's native Hokkien dialect. Particularly controversial was the 'Little White Donkey' anecdote, where Chua described how she got her unwilling younger daughter to learn a very difficult piano piece. In Chua's words, \"I hauled Lulu's dollhouse to the car and told her I'd donate it to the Salvation Army piece by piece if she didn't have 'The Little White Donkey' perfect by the next day. When Lulu said, 'I thought you were going to the Salvation Army, why are you still here?' I threatened her with no lunch, no dinner, no Christmas or Hanukkah presents, no birthday parties for two, three, four years. When she still kept playing it wrong, I told her she was purposely working herself into a frenzy because she was secretly afraid she couldn't do it. I told her to stop being lazy, cowardly, self-indulgent and pathetic.\" They then \"work[ed] right through dinner\" without letting her daughter \"get up, not for water, not even for bathroom breaks\". The anecdote concludes by describing how her daughter was \"beaming\" after she finally mastered the piece and \"wanted to play [it] over and over\".\n\nChua uses the term \"Tiger Mother\" to describe a mother who is a strict disciplinarian.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" article generated a huge response, both positive and negative. Charles Murray argued that \"large numbers of talented children everywhere would profit from Chua's approach, and instead are frittering away their gifts—they're nice kids, not brats, but they are also self-indulgent and inclined to make excuses for themselves\". In a poll on the \"Wall Street Journal\" website regarding Chua's response to readers, two-thirds of respondents voted that the \"Demanding Eastern\" parenting model is better than the \"Permissive Western\" model. Allison Pearson wondered the following in The Daily Telegraph: \"Amy Chua's philosophy of child-rearing may be harsh and not for the fainthearted, but ask yourself this: is it really more cruel than the laissez-faire indifference and babysitting-by-TV which too often passes for parenting these days?\"\n\nAnnie Paul, writing for \"Time\", describes, \"[i]n the 2008 book \"A Nation of Wimps\", author Hara Estroff Marano, editor-at-large of \"Psychology Today\" magazine, marshals evidence supporting Chua's approach: \"Research demonstrates that children who are protected from grappling with difficult tasks don't develop what psychologists call 'mastery experiences'...Kids who have this well-earned sense of mastery are more optimistic and decisive; they've learned that they're capable of overcoming adversity and achieving goals\". Ann Hulbert of \"Slate\" remarked on Chua's \"shocking honesty about tactics. She has written the kind of exposé usually staged later by former prodigies themselves...[Chua] is a tiger who roars rather than purrs. That's because no child, she points out, naturally clamors for the 'tenacious practice, practice, practice' that mastery demands.\"\n\nMSNBC stated that the article \"reads alternately like a how-to guide, a satire or a lament\". MSNBC's critical response goes on to state that \"the article sounds so incredible to Western readers—and many Asian ones, too—that many people thought the whole thing was satire...[but] aspects of her essay resonated profoundly with many people, especially Chinese Americans—not necessarily in a good way\". In the \"Financial Times\", Isabel Berwick called the \"tiger mother\" approach to parenting \"the exact opposite of everything that the Western liberal holds dear\".\n\nDavid Brooks of \"The New York Times\", in an op-ed piece entitled \"Amy Chua is a 'Wimp'\", wrote that he believed Chua was \"coddling her children\" because \"[m]anaging status rivalries, negotiating group dynamics, understanding social norms, navigating the distinction between self and group—these and other social tests impose cognitive demands that blow away any intense tutoring session or a class at Yale\". \"The Washington Post\", while not as critical, did suggest that \"ending a parenting story when one child is only 15 seems premature\".\n\nOthers have noted that the \"Wall Street Journal\" article took excerpts only from the beginning of the book, and not from any of the later chapters in which Chua describes her retreat from what she calls \"Chinese\" parenting. Author Amy Gutman felt many have missed the point of Chua's book, which she described as \"coming of age\", and states the controversial examples shown in the book \"reflect where Chua started, not who she is today, and passing judgment on her based on them strikes me as a bit akin to passing judgment on Jane Austen's \"Emma\" for her churlish behavior to Miss Bates. Like Emma's, Chua's narrative has an arc. It's a coming-of-age story—where the one to come of age is the parent\".\n\nJon Carroll of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" felt the excerpts in the \"Wall Street Journal\" article failed to represent the content in Chua's book and states that \"the excerpt was chosen by the editors of the Journal and the publishers. The editors wanted to make a sensation; the publishers want to sell books\" but \"it does not tell the whole story.\" A spokeswoman for the \"Wall Street Journal\" told the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" that \"[w]e worked extensively with Amy's publisher, as we always do with book excerpts, and they signed off on the chosen extract in advance\". Chua maintains that the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"basically strung together the most controversial sections of the book. And I had no idea they'd put that kind of a title on it\".\n\nOn March 29, 2011, the \"Wall Street Journal\" organized an event called \"The Return of Tiger Mom\" in the New York Public Library. This event discussed different aspects of child-raising, in a more nuanced and sensible manner, compared to controversy which the book had previously provoked. Amy Chua's husband, Jed Rubenfeld, and their two daughters also attended the event. Rubenfeld, who has become known as \"Tiger Dad\", said that he doesn't see the Tiger Mom education method as a representative of Chinese education, but rather a more traditional old-fashioned style. He and Chua expressed a more liberal attitude compared with the \"Wall Street Journal\"'s article, while still stressing the importance of discipline in a child's early years.\n\nThe book was on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list from January 30 to April 10, 2011.\n\nChua has openly confronted criticism in print and during her book signings.\nIn a follow-up article in the \"Wall Street Journal\", Chua explains that \"my actual book is not a how-to guide; it's a memoir, the story of our family's journey in two cultures, and my own eventual transformation as a mother. Much of the book is about my decision to retreat from the strict 'Chinese' approach, after my younger daughter rebelled at thirteen\".\n\nIn an interview with Jezebel, Chua addresses why she believes the book has hit such a chord with parents: \"We parents, including me, are all so anxious about whether we're doing the right thing. You can never know the results. It's this latent anxiety.\" In a conversation with \"Die Zeit\", Chua says about her book: \"I would never burn the stuffed animals of my children—that was a hyperbole, an exaggeration. I have intensified many situations to clarify my position\". She adds that the book \"was therapy for me at the time of a great defeat\".\n\nOn January 17, 2011, an open letter from Chua's older daughter, Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld, to her mother was published in the \"New York Post\". Sophia's letter defends her parents' child-rearing methods and states that she and her sister were not oppressed by an \"evil mother\". She discusses some of the incidents that have been criticized as unduly harsh, and explains that they were not as bad as they sound out of context. She ends the letter saying, \"If I died tomorrow, I would die feeling I've lived my whole life at 110 percent. And for that, Tiger Mom, thank you.\"\n\nThe term and behavior of the \"Tiger Mother\" has been satirized in the online anthropomorphic animal comic strip series \"Kevin and Kell\" with the recurring characters Mei-Li Lee and her raising methods with her daughter Lin as well as in attitude, although it's been noted that she is not actually a tigress but a tabby cat who \"willed\" (assimilated) herself into becoming a tiger through sheer effort, and is married to a tiger.\n\n\"Bios for New York's Most Popular Tutors\", a humor article by Ryan Max Riley on CollegeHumor, explicitly satirizes Amy Chua's \"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\". Tiger mom is described in the article as \"the best known teacher\", and among many other accomplishments, \"her students achieve standardized test scores that range from perfect to perfect with less bruising and blood loss but the same amount of shame\". The \"students become so proficient at piano that they can embed hidden SOS messages in songs during concert performances\".\n\nThe term \"tiger mom\" or \"tiger mother\" has been used as a neologism used to describe a tough, disciplinarian mother due to the way Amy Chua describes bringing up her children in the strict, traditional Chinese way.\n\nIn a speech in January 2016, British Prime Minister David Cameron praised \"tiger mums\" as he laid out his strategy for tackling child poverty in the United Kingdom. In a speech he stated, \"No matter how clever you are, if you do not believe in continued hard work and concentration, and if you do not believe that you can return from failure, you will not fulfill your potential. It is what the Tiger Mothers' battle hymn is all about: work, try hard, believe you can succeed, get up and try again.\" The Prime Minister also criticized schools that have a culture where all children are rewarded prizes and insisted that \"children thrive on high expectations.\"\n\n\n"}

Competitors typically attempt to create a device that can keep a raw chicken egg intact when dropped from a height. Students are asked to build a device made from a limited or not limited amount of materials to support an egg when dropped from various heights.\n\nA variation of the egg drop competition is the naked egg drop, in which an exposed raw egg is dropped into a container below that must catch the egg and keep it from breaking. \n\nAnother common variation on the egg drop competition is the egg hurl competition, where the containers are hurled by a device such as a trebuchet or air cannon. This variation is often used by schools that lack tall structures from which to drop the containers. The egg hurl variation adds additional difficulties to the design of the container, since it is initially hurled at high speed and has to cope with horizontal as well as vertical velocities upon landing.\n\nOften schools work together to make larger competitions that pit more students against each other. One of the larger regional egg drop competitions is the Winston-Salem / Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition that takes place during Engineers Week (late February) each year. \n\nEgg drop is one of 18 events in the North Carolina Science Olympiad elementary competition.

It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human intelligence. In the evolutionary environment, life was static; there was essentially no economic growth and no innovation. Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple. Thus, our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy. While there were many implications of such an economy,one of the most important is that we evolved to be zero-sum thinkers. that is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms. This leads to fallacies such as dislike of international trade and immigration. Indeed, zero-sum thinking is probably the most important source of inefficient economic policies. \n"}

She was one of the first women to join Opus Dei, after meeting the founder Saint Josemaría Escrivá in 1944. She helped start Opus Dei in Mexico and also collaborated directly with Escriva in Rome. A serious heart condition eventually claimed her life in 1975. After a number of requests from people who knew her during her life, her cause of canonization opened on 3 November 2001. In mid-2017, Pope Francis declared that she had lived a life of heroic virtue and named her Venerable. The same Pope confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession (the healing of a cancer patient) in June 2018. Her beatification is to be held on 18 May 2019 in Madrid.\n\nGuadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri Fernández de Heredia was born in Pamplona on 12 December 1916 as the fourth of four children (and the only daughter) to Manuel Ortiz de Landázuri, a military officer, and Eulogia Fernández-Heredia. Her three elder siblings were Manuel, Eduardo, and Francisco, who died in childhood. Her brother Eduardo (who became a doctor and college professor) and his wife (the two married in 1941) have both been named as Servants of God.\n\nHer father's career in the armed forces meant the Ortiz de Landázuris moved from place to place each time he was sent on a new assignment. The Ortiz de Landázuri's moved to Tétouan in Morocco in 1927 after her father was sent there for further work. In 1932, they returned to Spain and lived in Madrid where her father was named Lieutenant Colonel), and Guadalupe finished high school at the Instituto Miguel de Cervantes. In June 1933, she enrolled in the Universidad Central de Madrid in chemical science and was just one of five women in a class of 70 students. Ortiz de Landázuri eventually pursued a doctorate since she wanted to teach chemistry at the university level.\n\nCrisis struck the nation with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s. When her father was taken prisoner and condemned to execution, Ortiz de Landázuri accompanied her brother, Eduardo, and their mother to bid a final farewell, just hours before his death. It was after this, in 1937, that she relocated with Eduardo and their mother to Valladolid where her elder brother Manuel resided; she remained there until the civil war ended, just a few months before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nShe returned to Madrid in 1939 where she began her career as a teacher. One day at Mass in 1944, she felt something that she interpreted as being a sign from God. Ortiz de Landázuri returned home to consult with a friend and expressed a desire to speak with a priest. That friend gave her the phone number of a well-known priest Saint Josemaría Escrivá and Ortiz de Landázuri met Escrivá for the first time on 25 January 1944. Shortly following this, Ortiz de Landázuri went on a spiritual retreat and on 19 March she sent a letter to Escrivá asking to be admitted to Opus Dei.\n\nOn 5 March 1950 - at Escrivá's invitation - she moved to Mexico to spread the message of Opus Dei. While there, Ortiz de Landázuri enrolled in a doctoral program in chemical sciences so she could continue what she had already started in Spain. In its capital she set up a student residence for university women, creating an environment conducive to serious study, healthy diversion, and friendship. She also helped establish the Montefalco School and other social projects aimed at improving opportunities for the local people. For example, together with a doctor friend, she created a mobile medical clinic that allowed them to go from house to house in poorer neighborhoods, providing both free medicine and medical tests.\n\nOrtiz de Landázuri relocated to Rome in 1956 in order to work with Escrivá in the governance of Opus Dei. Not long after her arrival, she noted pain in her chest which turned out to be a serious heart condition, and she returned to Madrid for an operation. After partially recovering, she continued with her academic work, now in Spain. During this time, she began a research project on insulating refracting materials from rice husks; she won the prize Juan de la Cierva for this project and finally completed and defended her doctoral thesis on 8 July 1965. She also worked at the Ramiro de Maeztu Institute and then at the Women's School for Industrial Sciences where she took on a leadership position that she held for the next decade. From 1968, she also took part in the planning and establishment of the Center of Studies and Research of Domestic Sciences. \n\nIn 1975, the doctors said it would be best for them to operate again, despite their being some risks. Ortiz de Landázuri left her Madrid home to check into the Clínica Universidad de Navarra where she was operated on 1 July. Though the surgery was successful, she developed a sudden failure in respiration which caused her death on 16 July at 6:30am; her mother died in the same clinic the next week on 23 July. Her remains were buried in Pamplona where she was born but were later transferred to Madrid on 5 October 2018.\n\nIn 2001 the Opus Dei prelate Javier Echevarría Rodríguez started the steps needed to launch the beatification process. The forum for the diocesan process for the cause was transferred on 30 March 2001 from the Pamplona-Tudela diocese to the Madrid archdiocese at which point the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 3 November issued the \"nihil obstat\" (no objections) edit to begin the cause and to title her as a Servant of God. Cardinal Antonio María Rouco Varela opened the diocesan process on 18 November and later closed it on 18 March 2005. From 2002 to 2003 there were 66 sessions held with 32 witnesses from Madrid being called to provide evidence and interrogatories while another week-long session in mid-2003 in Mexico saw 22 witnesses giving evidence in support of Landázuri's virtues in 37 sessions. The C.C.S. later received all the documents gathered during that process in 2005 (3008 pages in seven compiled volumes) and validated the process later on 17 February 2006. The postulation later compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2009 for evaluation.\n\nTheologians provided a positive vote to the cause on 7 June 2016 after having assessed the Positio's contents while the C.C.S. also provided their assent to the cause at their meeting held on 2 May 2017. Pope Francis titled Landázuri as Venerable on 4 May after determining that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue.\n\nLandázuri's beatification depended upon the confirmation of a singular miracle attributed to her intercession; it had to be a healing that science could not be able to explain. There was such a case that was reported in Barcelona and which a diocesan process that Cardinal Lluís Martínez Sistach presided over from 25 May 2007 until 16 January 2008 investigated. The C.C.S. validated this process on 24 October 2008 and a medical panel of experts later confirmed that the healing in question was indeed miraculous at their meeting held on 5 October 2017. The medical board also examined the diagnostic process of the ailment and the healing in just a few hours without treatment. The experts declared the occurrences not explicable from a scientific perspective. The postulation later drafted a Positio for the miracle which was submitted to the C.C.S. on 2 January 2018 before the theologians also issued their assent to the miracle on 1 March. The theologians determined the relationship between the healing and the invocation of Landázuri. The C.C.S. also confirmed the case on 5 June determining that it should be acknowledged as a miracle and passed to the pope for his approval. Pope Francis approved a decree recognizing this miracle on 8 June which allows for Landázuri to be beatified. The beatification will be held in Madrid at the Palacio Vistalegre on 18 May 2019.\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is Fr. Antonio Rodríguez de Rivera.\n\nThe miracle that led to Landázuri's beatification was the healing from basocellular carcinoma on the night of 28-29 November 2002 of Antonio Jesús Sedano Madrid from Barcelona.\n\n"}

In 1999, she added a section targeted to boys, initially known as \"The Boyfriend\".\n\nBoth Scarlet Letters and Scarleteen faced difficulty obtaining both traffic and financial support in their early years. In the 1990s, Scarleteen was often excluded by mainstream directories as too sexual, while pornographic sites also refused to provide it as a link for under-18 visitors.

{"id": "1765673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1765673", "title": "Intercultural communication principles", "text": "Intercultural communication principles\n\nInter-cultural communication principles guide the process of exchanging meaningful and unambiguous information across cultural boundaries, in a way that preserves mutual respect and minimises antagonism. For these purposes, culture is a shared system of symbols, beliefs, attitudes, values, expectations, and norms of behaviour. It refers to coherent groups of people whether resident wholly or partly within state territories, or existing without residence in any particular territory. Hence, these principles may have equal relevance when a tourist seeks help, where two well-established independent corporations attempt to merge their operations, and where politicians attempt to negotiate world peace. Two factors have raised the importance of this topic:\n\nPeople from different cultures encode and decode messages differently, increasing the chances of misunderstanding, so the safety-first consequence of recognizing cultural differences should be to assume that others' thoughts and actions are different. Such assumptions stem from potentially devastating ignorance and can lead to much frustration for members of both cultures. Entering a culture with this type of ethnocentrism, the assumption one's own culture is correct, is another byproduct of ignorance and cultural misunderstanding.\n\nSome cultural characteristics will be easy to identify: whether people are conscious of status or make displays of material wealth. However, many rights are assumed, values are implied, and needs are unspoken, (for safety, security, love, a sense of belonging to a group, self-esteem, and the ability to attain one's goals).\n\nFor example, issues of personal security, dignity, and control will be very different as between an able-bodied and a disabled person. Similarly, there may be problems of respect when a person from a rigidly class-based culture meets a meritocrat or if there is racism, sexism or religious intolerance in play. In such situations, identity is fundamental when disputing the proper role or \"place\" of the other, about who is in control of their lives, and how they present themselves to the outside world. The reality is more deeply rooted in power relationships, who is on top of the social, economic, and/or political hierarchy. Family members or longterm rivals may be obsessed with their mutual competition.\n\nCommunication is something that no one can escape and it comes in many forms. Whenever a person from one culture sends a message to be processed from a different culture, intercultural communication is present. It is important to recognize when it happens to able to make wise decisions as to how the communication takes place. Intercultural communication ethics incorporates learning about different goods, the discourse that arises from and shapes the texture of those goods, and practices that enable constructive conversation in a postmodern world of difference. In any ethical dilemma situation, hard choices must be made in considering the intent, the action, the means, the consequence, the end goal, the situation, and the embedded cultural contexts of the case. In an intercultural decision-making context, in particular, often difficult choices must be made between upholding one's own cultural beliefs and values and considering the values of the other culture. Acknowledging the different goods, values, and beliefs will help to interact with someone from a different culture. A knowledge of intercultural communication, and the ability to use it effectively, can help bridge cultural differences, mitigate problems, and assist in achieving more harmonious, productive relations. This is especially important in today's world where the market is global.\n\nPeople may misinterpret each other's motives. For example, one group may assume that they are simply exchanging information about what they believe, but the other believes that they are negotiating a change in behavior. That is most likely to arise when the parties are not completely honest with each other from the outset. Individuals may wish to protect their privacy, corporations may be concerned about industrial espionage, and politicians may be bound by requirements of secrecy in the national interest. Nevertheless, clarifying the purpose of the interaction is essential to eliminating confusion.\n\nIf time is not a factor and those interacting approach their meetings with good will and patience, effective communication is more likely. If the parties are under pressure (whether generated by external circumstances or internal needs), emotions may colour the exchange. Prejudice is a shortcut decision-making tool. In a crisis, fear and anger may trigger more aggressive tactics, particularly if the meeting is being staged under the gaze of the news media.\n\nIt is essential that people research the cultures and communication conventions of those whom they propose to meet to minimise the risk of making the elementary mistakes. It is also prudent to set a clear agenda so that everyone understands the nature and purpose of the interaction. When language skills are unequal, clarifying one's meaning in five ways will improve communication:\n\nIf it is not possible to learn the other's language, show some respect by learning a few words. In all important exchanges, a translator can convey the message.\n\nWhen writing, the choice of words represent the relationship between the reader and the writer so more thought, and care should be invested in the text since it may be thoroughly analysed by the recipient.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11048910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11048910", "title": "James T. Monroe", "text": "James T. Monroe\n\nJames T. Monroe is an American scholar. He is emeritus professor of Arabic and Comparative Literature at the University of California at Berkeley, focusing on Classical Arabic Literature and Hispano-Arabic Literature. His doctorate was from Harvard University. Professor Monroe \"works in the areas of lyric poetry, the Middle Ages, and East-West relations with particular interest in the importance of the Arab contribution to Spanish civilization.\"\n\n\nA survey of mostly academic studies of Islam and the Arabs. Monroe also reviews these works in terms of their literary origin and social context with regard to the evolving national consciousness of Spain, i.e., how the self-reflective nature of the issues addressed in these studies develops over the course of several centuries. Such a survey is particularly resonant with subtleties because of the seven hundred year presence of Arabic-speaking Muslim regimes in Spain, chiefly in the central and southern regions.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts:\n\n1. the Study of Arabic Grammar and Lexicography (covering scholarship of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Chapter I);\n\n2. the Study of Political History in Al-Andalus (regarding nineteenth century scholarship, Chapters II to V); and,\n\n3. the Study of the Cultural History of Al-Andalus (early and middle twentieth century scholarship, Chapters VI to X).\n\nAmong figures discussed: (III); (V); Julián Ribera y Tarragó (VI); Miguel Asín Palacios (VII); Emilio García Gómez and (VIII); Miguel de Unamuno, José Ortega y Gasset, Ramón Menéndez Pidal, and Américo Castro (X).\n\n\nA translation from Arabic, with introduction and notes by Monroe. Concerns the literary reflections and polemical writings with regard to an intra-Muslim ethnic conflict in al-Andalus (medieval Spain). Ibn Gharsiya [Ibn Garcia], a muladi poet (perhaps of Basque lineage), wrote his essay (\"risala\") during the 11th century. It contests the then current Arab claims of supremacy over Muslims of other or mixed ethnicity. Hence it echoes the earlier Shu'ubite movement in Iran, which had challenged the Arab ascendancy there several centuries before.\n\nA translation with introduction and notes by Monroe. The poet Ibn Shuhaid (992-1035) of al-Andalus wrote this fictional narration of a voyage to the land of the djinn. Although only fragments survive, it has been reconstructed to some extent; Monroe dates it to 1025-1027. Into his stories Ibn Shuhayd places his poetry (see below, Monroe's \"Hispano-Arabic Poetry\"). Probably following somewhat al-Hamadhani's earlier invention, it is marginally of the maqama genre (see below, Monroe's \"The art of Badī' az-Zamān\"). The \"Risālat\" is sometimes mentioned among possible influences on Dante's \"Divina Commedia\". Monroe notes that here Ibn Shuhaid \"developed a metaphysics into an aesthetics to account for the origin of beauty and the creative process in Arabic literature.\"\n\n\nPoems in Arabic script with English translation on facing page, as compiled by Monroe. In his sixty-page introduction Monroe seeks to situate the poets within the political and social environment, following poetry's fortunes over several centuries in the culture of al-Andalus. A poet's status varied: from being lauded and well patronized, to being religiously suspect and not welcome at the palace. Monroe also sheds light on the technical poetics of al-Andalus in terms general to Arabic literature.\n\nWorks by three dozen poets are translated, including: Ibn Shuhaid (992-1035), poet and author (see above, Monroe's \"Risalat\"); the well-known Ibn Hazm (994-1064), author of \"Tauq al-hamama\" [\"The Dove's Necklace\"], Ibn Hazm was also a Zahiri jurist and a philosopher-theologian; Ibn Zaydún (1003-1071), neoclassical poet; Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad (1040-1095), king of Seville, later deposed; Ibn Kafaja (1058-1139), nature poet; Ibn Baqi (died 1145 or 1150), muwashshaha poet; Al-Abyad (d.1130), muwashshaha poet, later crucified; Ibn Zuhr \"al-hafid\" (1113-1198), physician, muwashshaha poet; the great mystic and sufi shaykh Ibn 'Arabi (1165-1240); Ibn al-Khatib (1313-1374), vizier of Granada, historian, assassinated in Fez; Ibn Zamrak (1333-1393), whose poems are engraved on the walls of the Alhambra, later assassinated; and, Yusuf III, Sultan of Granada from 1408 until his death in 1417.\n\n\nAl-Hamadhani (d.1008) of Hamadhan or Hamadan (Ecbatana of ancient Iran) is credited with inventing the literary genre of \"maqamat\". This form employs a combination of poetry and prose, in which often a wandering vagabond makes his living on the gifts his listeners give him following his extemporaneous displays of rhetoric, erudition, or verse, often done with a trickster's touch. Al-Hamadhani has become known by the title \"Badi' az-Zaman\" or \"Badi'u 'l-Zaman\", \"wonder of the age\". See below, Monroe's translation of \"al-Maqamat al-Luzumiyah\", and above his translation of \"Risalat al-tawabi' \".\n\n\nThe authors discuss the medieval genres of \"muwashshahas\" and \"zajals\" as they are currently sung in North Africa (the \"Maghrib\"). Because this music was not written, the oral performances are a crucial source. The Muslims of Spain (\"al-Andalus\") were connected closely and directly with \"al-Maghrib\", i.e., with those who later continued the music traditions of Andalus following the Spanish \"reconquista\".\n\nThe book contains transliterated texts and translations of the verses, and about twenty pages of western musical notation of the \"songs\", as well as discussion of their performance. Also translated are two chapters on music from a medieval \"Maghribi\" encyclopedia in Arabic by Ahmad al-Tifasi. The mutual relation of the \"songs\" to European romance is also addressed, with views and examples of a 'west-east' influence/counter-influence. The authors note that evidence of a \"zealous guardianship of a vernerable tradition... makes it conceivable that the Andalusian music we hear today does not differ radically from what we might have heard in medieval Andalus.\"\n\n\nThe writer al-Saraqusti ibn al-Astarkuwi or al-Ashtarkuni (d.1143) here wrote in the genre \"maqamat\". Saraqusti's collection of stories follows \"maqamat\" format in which, e.g., a trickster story teller may relate his adventures (see above, Monroe's book \"The Art of Badi' az-Zaman\" by al-Hamadhani). This literary genre is said to have influenced such works as the Spanish \"Libro de buen amor\" by Juan Ruiz (circa 1330).\n\nTranslation by Monroe with a 108-page preliminary study. Therein Monroe discusses: What is Maqamat? - Life of the Author - Works of the Author - Analysis of Four Maqamat - Doubling and Duplicity [originality within the genre] - Literary Decadence and Artistic Excellence - Remarks on the Translation and Annotations. About Saraqusti's collection of Maqamat, Monroe (at 108) comments on the difficulty to render it into a foreign language, as it is \"a work studded with puns, rhymes, and \"double entendres\".\" Over fifty Maqamat are translated here. Monroe gives high praise for the \"baroque\" art of Saraqusti, although acknowledging that his ornamented style, with verse and contrivance, is now out of fashion. Saraqusti was an Arab of 12th century al-Andalus.\n\nMonroe (at 46-80) analyses four of the maqamat. In \"Maqamat 41 (The Berbers)\" the narrator Abu l-Gamr is a character who tells his own story, which includes contradictions and misinformation.

{"id": "9193341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9193341", "title": "LC-3", "text": "LC-3\n\nLittle Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language.\n\nIt features a relatively simple instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs, and is a theoretically viable target for a C compiler. The language is less complex than x86 assembly but has many features similar to those in more complex languages. These features make it useful for beginning instruction, so it is most often used to teach fundamentals of programming and computer architecture to computer science and computer engineering students.\n\nThe LC-3 was developed by Yale N. Patt at the University of Texas at Austin and Sanjay J. Patel at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Their specification of the instruction set, the overall architecture of the LC-3, and a hardware implementation can be found in the second edition of their textbook. Courses based on the LC-3 and Patt and Patel's book are offered in many computer engineering and computer science departments.\n\nThe LC-3 specifies a word size of 16 bits for its registers and uses a 16-bit addressable memory with a 2-location address space. The register file contains eight registers, referred to by number as R0 through R7. All of the registers are general-purpose in that they may be freely used by any of the instructions that can write to the register file, but in some contexts (such as translating from C code to LC-3 assembly) some of the registers are used for special purposes.\n\nInstructions are 16 bits wide and have 4-bit opcodes. The instruction set defines instructions for fifteen of the sixteen possible opcodes, though some instructions have more than one mode of operation. Individual instructions' execution is regulated by a state machine implemented with a control ROM and microsequencing unit.\n\nThe architecture supports the use of a keyboard and monitor to regulate input and output; this support is provided through memory mapped I/O abstractions. In simulation, these registers can be accessed directly, and the architectural specification describes their contents. Higher-level I/O support is also provided through the use of the TRAP instruction and a basic operating system. The operating system provides functions to read and echo characters from the keyboard, print individual characters to the monitor, print entire strings in both packed and unpacked forms, and halt the machine.\n\nAll data in the LC-3 is assumed to be stored in a two's complement representation; there is no separate support for unsigned arithmetic. The I/O devices operate on ASCII characters. The LC-3 has no native support for floating-point numbers.\n\nThe hardware implementation given in the Patt and Patel text is not pipelined or otherwise optimized, but it is certainly possible to create a fast implementation using more advanced concepts in computer architecture.\n\nThe LC-3 instruction set implements fifteen types of instructions, with a sixteenth opcode reserved for later use. The architecture is a load-store architecture; values in memory must be brought into the register file before they can be operated upon.\n\nArithmetic instructions available include addition, bitwise AND, and bitwise NOT, with the first two of these able to use both registers and sign-extended immediate values as operands. These operations are sufficient to implement a number of basic arithmetic operations, including subtraction (by negating values) and bitwise left shift (by using the addition instruction to multiply values by two). The LC-3 can also implement any bitwise logical function, because NOT and AND together are logically complete.\n\nMemory accesses can be performed by computing addresses based on the current value of the program counter (PC) or a register in the register file; additionally, the LC-3 provides indirect loads and stores, which use a piece of data in memory as an address to load data from or store data to. Values in memory must be brought into the register file before they can be used as part of an arithmetic or logical operation.\n\nThe LC-3 provides both conditional and unconditional control flow instructions. Conditional branches are based on the arithmetic sign (negative, zero, or positive) of the last piece of data written into the register file. Unconditional branches may move execution to a location given by a register value or a PC-relative offset. Three instructions (JSR, JSRR, and TRAP) support the notion of subroutine calls by storing the address of the code calling the subroutine into a register before changing the value of the program counter. The LC-3 does not support the direct arithmetic comparison of two values. Computing the difference of two register values requires finding the negated equivalence of one register value and then, adding the negated number to the positive value in the second register. The difference of the two registers would be stored in one of the 8 registers available for the user.\n\nBecause there is no room left in the LC-3 instruction set for dedicated port-mapped I/O instructions, hardware implementations typically reserve part of the memory map for memory-mapped I/O.\n\nWhile it has not been implemented on a physical chip, the LC-3 can be used in simulation on Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows environments. The simulation tools include an assembler with support for computerized offset computation with labels and the insertion of constants, strings, and blank memory locations into a block of assembly code. There is also a convention for using the C language on the LC-3. A sample assembler, compiler, and simulator are provided by McGraw-Hill.\n\nThe calling convention for C functions on the LC-3 is similar to that implemented by other systems, such as the x86 ISA. When running C programs, the architecture maintains a memory model that includes space for a call stack and dynamic memory allocation. In this model, four of the processor's eight general purpose registers take on special roles: R4 is used as a base register for loading and storing global data, R5 is used to point to the current function's area on the call stack, and R6 is used as a stack pointer. Additionally, R7 is usually reserved for storage of return addresses from function calls; the JSR, JSRR, and TRAP instructions automatically store return addresses in this register during their execution.\n\nWhen a C function is called under this model, the function's parameters are pushed onto the stack right to left. Space is then made on the stack for the return value of the function being called, the address of the instruction in the caller to return to, and the caller's value of R5. Local variables in the function being called are pushed onto the stack in the order that they are declared. Note that the LC-3 does not have native PUSH and POP instructions, so addition and memory storage instructions must be used separately to implement the stack.\n\nThe LC-3b ISA describes a modified version of the LC-3 that includes the following changes:\n\n\nThese changes make the hardware of the LC-3b slightly more complex than that of the LC-3. For example, the LC-3b needs a shifter (the LC-3 does not) and extra logic in its memory unit to properly handle loading and storing data of various sizes.\n\n\n"}

The game puts the player in the role of a new program director for a TV station. The player is in charge of selecting programming and earning advertising for the station, while simultaneously trying to marry Betty, an attractive woman working in the building.\n\nThe main interface of the game involves moving a thin man through a multistory building via mouse clicks. By clicking on various doors, the player's character can enter other locations, which are portrayed in cut scenes. Each day is timed, and after eight game hours the day of programming ends.\n\nFor each day, the player must program seven hours of television and provide an advertisement block for each of those programs. The game offers many options to fill programming, such as purchasing the rights to classic movies and shows, or by producing your own shows. However, programming must be regularly cycled, otherwise it gets stale with the audience and produces low ratings.\n\nAdvertising is also offered via contracts, which require certain rating marks to pay out. For example, a contract for Nike might pay better than one for a local business, but the Nike contract will require substantially more viewers. Access to more viewers can be achieved by buying more transmitters and satellites.\n\nThe player competes against two other television stations, run by computer-controlled program directors, in the same building. These program directors inhabit the same space and locations as the player, and they can directly influence the game by outbidding the player for certain movies or sabotaging programming lineups.\n\nThe eventual goal of the game is to win Betty's love. She is a cultural reporter who works on the top floor of the building. The other television station directors are also competing for Betty. Her affection rises when the player airs her culture program or buys her gifts, ranging from fur coats to diamond rings. Furthermore, Betty's love depends indirectly on the reputation the player has (which in turn depends on several factors such as ratings). Her affection level will never outrun the player's reputation level, so there is no use in simply pleasing her and neglecting the audience.\nUnfortunately cultural programs are not popular; airing only Betty's favorites will cause bankruptcy. The player has to balance his budget.\n\nThe game suffers from many translation issues, resulting from its origin as a game originally produced in Germany. Much of the in-game text features typos and Denglisch.\n\n\"Mad TV\" has a sequel, \"Mad TV 2\", which was only released in Germany. In 2001 \"Mad TV\" and also \"Mad TV 2\" were released as freely downloadable Freeware.\n\nThere are several attempts to remake \"Mad TV\" like \"TVTower\" (for Windows, Linux, Mac OS), \"Mad TV Online\" (as browser game) and \"mobileTV\" (for mobile devices). But a game similar to Mad TV called Empire TV Tycoon by Dreamsite Games was released in October 21, 2015.\n\n\n"}

The RealWorld-InWorld experience provides teams of students working initially with teachers/coaches the opportunity to solve NASA-inspired engineering problems and then to build solutions with university students and engineering mentors in a virtual reality setting. Teams consider real-world questions related to both the James Webb Space Telescope and the dextrous humanoid robot known as Robonaut 2, and then work to develop logistical solutions to the actual problems that researchers and scientists are solving today. RealWorld-InWorld is a joint education initiative of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA), USA TODAY Education, and LearniT-TeachiT.\n\nThe RealWorld-InWorld NASA Engineering Design Challenge builds on the successful SIGHT/INSIGHT design challenge developed by USA TODAY Education and NASA and the Virtual Exploration Sustainability Challenge (VESC) developed by NIA and NASA. Both education initiatives were based upon NASA themes and content for students in grade 7-12. They deepen students' understanding of STEM careers, project management, and NASA innovation.\n\nStudents will attempt to answer one of two questions regarding either the James Webb Space Telescope or Robonaut 2.\n\n\nRobonaut 2 is a highly dextrous anthropomorphic humanoid robot built and designed at NASA Johnson Space Center. Robonaut 2 is employed in situations where risk factors are too high and thus endanger human life. The development of Robonaut 2, and in the future, other dextrous humanoid robots, will enhance our capabilities for exploration and construction in space, by allowing us to send robots, with greater mobility than suited astronauts, to complete complicated missions or venture into environments not safe for humans. Robonaut 2 has the distinction of being the first of its kind (there are four similar robots) to not only go into space, but also perform tasks aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Robonaut 2, or R2, as it's commonly referred to as, is the first U.S. robot to board ISS. The value of being a \"dextrous humanoid\" robot as opposed to any other design, is that R2 can use the same tools we use and work beside us in the same spaces. This is incredibly efficient as there will be no need to create new tools to facilitate Robonaut 2's missions. For the development of R2, NASA is partnering with General Motors (GM) and Oceaneering Space Systems (OSS). These partnerships will aid in the acceleration of R2 as a new technology, and help the robot exceed human dexterity - to which it has not yet matched - and then be employed in both the aerospace and automotive industry.\n\nR2 improves on its predecessor, R1, in a number of ways. R2 moves four times faster than R1, is more compact, and has a higher level of dexterity and a deeper and wider range of sensing capabilities. R2 incorporates many advanced technologies including optimized overlapping dual arm dexterous workspace, series elastic joint technology, extended finger and thumb travel, miniaturized 6-axis load cells, redundant force sensing, ultra-high speed joint controllers, extreme neck travel, and high resolution camera and IR systems.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the next generation in deep space imaging systems. The James Webb Space Telescope seeks to provide a better understanding of the origins of the earth and life in the universe. This telescope is significant to future scientific breakthroughs and through the RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge students use the engineering design process to solve problems related to the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST, was named after former NASA Administrator James Webb. Webb ran the space agency from February 1961 until October 1968. He is considered to have made great contributions to space science which led to the JWST, the next-generation space telescope, which bears his name. Webb is most commonly linked to the Apollo Space Program. It is surprising, considering his vast accomplishments, that Webb was somewhat reluctant to accept the position as NASA administrator. He was not an engineer or scientist, but had held other notable positions in government and aerospace industry. President Kennedy believed Webb to be the best man for the position and convinced him that the position of NASA Administrator was a largely policy oriented position.\n\nAlthough President Kennedy had committed to landing a man on the moon before the end of the century, Webb believed the challenge to be important in many sectors, such as education and industry, rather than strictly political. Webb is credited with the great scientific productivity of the space agency during the 1960s. Many programs allowed Americans to discover new information about outer space with probes sent to Mars and Venus, while others prepared Americans to make the first steps on the Moon, with robotic exploration of the surface. By the time Webb retired in 1968, shortly before the moon landing in 1969, the agency had launched over 75 missions.\n\nWebb enhanced the role of scientists in the decision making of the agency. He also played an active role in creating a link between NASA and university education in America. Webb created the NASA University Program which helped establish space grants, provide fellowships to graduate students, and build scientific research laboratories at universities. This linkage between NASA and education continues today and is evidenced in the RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge. This challenge is focused on the telescope which bears the name of James Webb, the man that launched America into the successful era of space exploration that provided much understanding and scientific breakthrough.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled for launch in 2018. From its orbit of about 1 million miles from the Earth's surface the JWST will use infrared technology to peer into space, helping scientists make observations about the origins of the universe. The JWST will observe the history of the universe from the moments following the Big Bang through the formation of solar systems, including our own. It will study the origin of life supporting environments and the process of planetary formation.\n\nThe JWST is a collaborative effort between NASA,the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. The project is currently being managed by the NASA Goddard Space Center. The contracting company involved in the development is Northrup Grumman. After launch the telescope will be operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute. The project was formerly known as the \"Next Generation Space Telescope\" but was renamed after James Webb in 2002.\n\nThe goals of the JWST are grouped into four scientific themes:\n\nThe JWST is similar to its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, in some ways but in many ways it is different, allowing scientists to gain new prospective and understanding of the universe. The JWST \"views\" the universe in the infrared, whereas the Hubble views the universe in optical and ultra-violet. This combination of viewpoints allows scientists to put together a more complete picture of the universe. The mirror on the JWST is also much larger than the mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope allowing it to collect even more light and peer even farther back in time. Since light travels at a great speed, the farther away it has traveled from the greater amount of time has passed since its origination. The JWST will also orbit much farther away from earth than the Hubble. The Hubble resides very close to earth, whereas the JWST will reside much farther away than even the moon.\n\nTeachers/coaches and high-school-aged students\n\nWork cooperatively as engineers and scientists to explore and design solutions for one of two real-world problems related to either the James Webb Space Telescope or Robonaut 2. RealWorld Solutions are created in a face-to-face environment of small teams of high school students and coaches/teachers. Submitted final project solutions will be featured on the RealWorld-InWorld website and teams will receive recognition for their work. Only teams that submit their final RealWorld project solutions by January 27, 2012, are eligible to move into the InWorld phase.\n\nParticipating college students select teams of 3-5 high-school-aged students and their teacher/coach. Each team selects a participating engineering mentor. Many of the participants are also participants in NASA's INSPIRE program.\n\nWork in a 3D virtual environment using 21st Century tools to refine designs and to create 3D models of the Webb Telescope and Robonaut 2. Engineers from both distinct projects will visit and \"chat\" InWorld throughout the challenge. Unlike RealWorld, the InWorld Challenge is located in a virtual environment hosted within the NIA Universe virtual reality world. Teams create and build their solutions to the proposed problems within this virtual environment.\n\n"}

Stanley Hall (1844-1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern educational psychology. An American researcher, Oscar Chrisman, proposed the term \"pedology\" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of natural sciences. In 1909 Professor Kazimierz Twardowski organized a Pedological Society in Lviv, Austro-Hungary (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in Kraków. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in Brussels, Belgium, with attendants from 22 countries.\n\nWorld War I (1914-1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe.\n\nSince pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology. \n\nBowie State University in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a Bachelor's Degree in pedology. A 2014 document from the university refers to \"the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)\".\n\nIn Imperial Russia a prominent developer of the field was Aleksandr Nechayev (Александр Петрович Нечаев) in St. Petersburg, who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of Vladimir Bekhterev; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity.\n\nThis science was intensively pursued in 1920s-1930s in the Soviet Union.

{"id": "1704399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1704399", "title": "Paul Laffoley", "text": "Paul Laffoley\n\nPaul Laffoley (August 14, 1935 – November 16, 2015) was an American visionary artist and architect from Boston, Massachusetts, represented by Kent Fine Art in New York.\n\nPaul Laffoley, as one of America's foremost visionary artists, seemed to work in a perpetual present tense (there is no \"late\" or \"old age\" style for him). From a young age, spiritual productivity was measured by how deeply one's wisdom could be developed, and how broadly one's compassion could exert itself.\n\nPaul Laffoley was born on August 14, 1935 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to an Irish Catholic family. His father, Paul Laffoley, Sr., the president of the Cambridge Trust Company, was also a lawyer and taught classes at Harvard Business School. Although his father had been against him pursuing painting as a career, Laffoley was indoctrinated with his father's religious philosophical beliefs including aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism and what he called \"mind-physics\". Laffoley senior also instructed Paul that there was \"no gravity\" which was a source of great humor when Paul was given the assignment to explain in grade school.\n\nLaffoley wrote that his first spoken word was \"Constantinople\" at the age of six months. He did not speak again until he was four years old. He was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome testing both high and low academically. According to Laffoley, he attended the progressive Mary Lee Burbank School in Belmont, Massachusetts, where his draftsman's talent was ridiculed by his abstract expressionist teachers. After further studies at the Waldorf School, Laffoley would complete undergraduate studies at Brown University, graduating in 1961 with honors in classics, philosophy, and art history. As written by Paul in The Phenomenology of Revelation, he was given eight electroshock treatments after the termination of \"about a year of weekly sessions with a psychiatrist, who had treated me for a mild state of catatonia\" while at Brown in 1961.\n\nIn 1961, he enrolled at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he studied architecture because it consisted of diagrams that rendered objects in space with accuracy and precision. He also studied with the sculptor Mirko Basaldella at Harvard's Carpenter Center that he cited was an early influence. After one year, he was summarily grand juried out of the GSD by the faculty for being \"overly involved in his work\". By chance, Laffoley was given an issue of Progressive Architecture by his uncle with Frederick Kiesler on the cover. Laffoley felt Kiesler work was what he had been searching for, and after writing 17 letters, Laffoley came to New York and succeeded in apprenticing with Frederick Kiesler. While canvasing the art scene in New York, Laffoley would meet Andy Warhol, who offered him a place to sleep at his 87th Street fire station if he would report on late night television between 1 and 5 am. It was from watching these Indian Head Test Patterns along with his early exposure to a Hindu tutor that Laffoley would arrive at a format for his large scale paintings that would dominate his work for five decades.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1963, Paul would return to Boston from New York, and eventually established his first dedicated studio space at 36 Bromfield Street on Christmas Day, 1968. It was there that Paul's career would begin to \"connect\" with an early show at the Orson Welles Theater that was \"highjacked\" and taken to the Woodstock Music Festival for presentation by Dean Gitter without Paul's permission. In an effort to recover his work, Paul took the bus to Woodstock which lead to his exposure to the current countercultures of the day, and would be followed by numerous exhibition opportunities and curatorial projects that would lead to the creation of his Boston Visionary Cell (1971). The Boston Visionary Cell, which Paul Laffoley founded on the model of an artists’ guild, was a highly communal and curatorial undertaking. The charter of the Boston Visionary Cell underscores Laffoley’s thought processes “to develop and advance visionary art”.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, and evolved to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, perhaps similar to architectural monuments such as Stonehenge or the Cathedral of Notre Dame and their spiritual aura. Works such as Thanaton III (1989), The Orgone Motor (1983), and the Geochronmechane: The Time Machine from Earth (1990) would follow this concept.\n\nAfter the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001, Laffoley was one of a number of architects who, in 2002, submitted designs for the competition to plan the Freedom Tower. Laffoley took his inspiration from the work of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí. His conception was to plan a gigantic hotel in the style of Gaudí's Sagrada Família church in Barcelona.\n\nAfter the Austin Museum of Art organized a traveling survey of his career in 1999, Mr. Laffoley became something of a cult figure for curators around the world. The Palais de Tokyo in Paris devoted an entire room to his work in its 2009 exhibition \"Chasing Napoleon\", and several of his works were included in \"The Alternative Guide to the Universe\" at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2013. Other major shows include Premonitions of the Bauharoque at the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (publication), Secret Garden at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (publication) and the recent monograph entitled \"The Essential Paul Laffoley\" edited by Douglas Walla and published by the University of Chicago Press in Spring 2016.\nFollowing his formal education in the classics at Brown and architectural studies at Harvard, Laffoley would begin to assimilate and systematically cross-pollinate his related strands of intellectual inquiry. In a search for expanded opportunities, he went to New York in 1963 to work with the visionary artist and architect Frederick Kiesler, and was also recruited to view late-night TV for Andy Warhol in exchange for a place to sleep. Weekdays, Laffoley found employment with Emery Roth & Sons where he worked on the plans for the yet to be built World Trade Center Towers before being terminated upon his suggestion of bridges joining the two buildings.\n\nAt that time, Laffoley had been painting in the basement of his family home in Belmont on the weekends, completing his first fully mature vision: The Kali-Yuga: The End of the Universe at 424826 A.D. From this point forward, Laffoley began to formulate his unique trans-disciplinary approach to a new discipline combining, philosophy, science, architecture and spirituality to the practice of painting. Laffoley first began to organize his ideas in a format related to eastern mandalas, partially inspired by the late night patterns he watched for Warhol on late night television. This quickly developed into four general subcategories of paintings: operating systems, psychotronic devices, meta-energy, time travel, and lucid dreaming. Conceived of as \"structured singularities\", Laffoley never works in series, but rather approaches each project as a unique schematic. Working in a solitary lifestyle, each 73 ½ x 73 ½ inch canvas would take up to three years to paint and code. By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, a modern approach to trans-disciplinary enlightenment and its spiritual aura.\n\nFrom an early age, Laffoley manifested an obsessive interest in UFOs. He had seen the movie \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" 873 times. He explains that his obsessive interest in the film derives partly from a fascination with the architecture of the space ship in the film which, early on in his life, was subconscious. While he was still a child he made a vow to become an architect so that he could design flying saucers, although he did not become a registered architect until he was 50 years of age.\n\nPainted on large canvases, the majority of Paul Laffoley's paintings combine words and imagery to depict a spiritual architecture of explanation, tackling concepts like dimensionality, time travel through hacking relativity, connecting conceptual threads shared by philosophers through the millennia, and theories about the cosmic origins of mankind. As of 2010,\n\nLaffoley's writings as well as works of art were published in May 2016 by the University of Chicago Press in a new book entitled \"The Essential Paul Laffoley\" edited and texts by Douglas Walla, with further texts by Linda Dalywimple Henderson, Arielle Saiber and Steven Moskowitz.\n\nBritish writer Michael Bracewell, in his collection of essays entitled \"When Surface was Depth\" observed: \"If Laffoley's work within the Boston Visionary Cell can be said to have one principal preoccupation - a common denominator of his eclectic scholarship and practice - then that preoccupation would be to understand the process by which one goes from becoming to being.\" Bracewell has also written that, \"The Boston Visionary Cell, as a concretized manifestation of its inhabitant's work and preoccupations, describes the way in which a chaos of data - no less than a chaos of marble - can be sculpted by research to release the perfect forms within it.\"\n\nThe Estate of Paul Laffoley is represented by Kent Fine Art in New York.\n\nLaffoley died on November 16, 2015 in South Boston, Massachusetts, of congestive heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also a teacher at the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a co-founder of the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, and founder of the lithography studio the Fishy Whale Press.\n\nPoska was born to Lithuanian parents in Scotland in 1938. At age 10, he and his parents immigrated to the United States, and settled in Rockford, Illinois. After receiving degrees from Rockford College and Cranbrook Academy of Art, he became an instructor at Rockford College, then in 1963, moved to Milwaukee, where he taught at the Layton School of Art. When Layton closed, he co-founded the Milwaukee School of Art and Design and taught there.\n\nIn 1963, while attending Cranbrook, Poska was introduced to papermaking by Laurence Barker, the dean of the school's graphics department. In 1967, he purchased his first \"beater\", a machine that grinds rags and pulp in the initial step of producing handmade paper, and established his lithography studio the Fishy Whale Press. At the time, his lithography press was among the largest in the United States, using blocks of stone. Under the Fishy Whale imprint, Poska and artist John Doyle produced \"The Great Human Race\", a series of prints designed by Doyle that appear in the collections of a number of American museums. Poska continued to develop \"The Great Human Race\" as a perpetual art and philosophy project for over 30 years. He would go on to be recognized as a pioneer in the artistic medium of papermaking.\n\nBy 1984, Poska was a nationally known artist. That year, he received a commission to produce a long painting \"From Blue to Blue\", which was displayed on Main Street in Rockford before its installation in Milwaukee's Henry S. Reuss Federal Plaza Building. This piece was produced in sections high and long, and then assembled to complete the full installation.\n\nHis works are included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIn his later years, Poska became an outspoken activist for equality and common human rights, and was a frequent speaker at Rockford town hall meetings.

He was the first male ballet master, dancer, choreographer, producer, as well as the founder of a ballet academy in Iran.\n\nSarkis Djanbazian was born in Armavir, then part of the Russian Empire (now Armenia). As the \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" states, from early childhood, Djanbazian took an avid interest in the arts, especially in dance. After graduating from high school, he went to Leningrad (St. Petersburg at the time) to study dance. He graduated from Vaganova Dance Academy of Leningrad on 14 January 1936 and from Lesgaf University with a Masters of Arts degree on 15 November 1936. After graduation, he worked as a principal dancer, choreographer, and artistic director in Kirov Theatre in Leningrad until July 1938.\n\nAs the Russian Communist government exercised heavy political pressure on Armenians, Djanbazian left Russia for Iran in 1938, settling in Qazvin. There, he decided to found a dance school. However, upon being expelled after this proposal to the city council, he turned himself to the Armenian Church in Qazvin. With allowance of the Church's head priest, he was allowed to hold dance classes on the rooftop of the church, in the same year of 1938.\n\nDjanbazian left Qazvin for Tehran in 1942. There, he started to give dancing classes in the Armenian Kušeš high school after the lessons had ended, initially for some 150 students. His perseverance, energy, and tireless effort made him establish the Tehran Ballet School in 1942 in Tehran.\n\nDjanbazian staged many full stage ballets in Iran. As the \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" states, these included but are not limited to Alexander Pushkin’s “Fountain of Baghchehsarai” and “Dreams of Hafez,” and Reinhold Glière’s “Chinese Flower Girl,” and choreographed shorter ballets such as “Jealousy” (Ḥesādat), “Persian Miniature” (Miniātorhā-ye Irāni), “Anuš,” as well as several classical and traditional Persian dance pieces including “Gol-e gandom,” “Woodchopper” (Tabar-zan), “Sailors” (Malavānān), “Life and Death” (Zendegi va marg, widely known as “Snake Dance” or Raqṣ- mār), “Prayers in the mountains” (Raqṣ-e namāz), “Qāli-e Kermān,” and “Šālikāri”. As the \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" states, Djanbazian took a great deal of interest in Iranian culture, and tried tirelessly to incorporate Iranian themes and stories in his artistic work. Despite his lack of fluency in Persian, his interest in Persian literature led him, with the collaboration of Ehsan Yarshater, to the production and staging of “Rostam and Tahmina” ballet, based on a love story in the Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh. Over the course of his career, he collaborated with many artists and intellectuals of the time. He also served, in 1948, as the head of the faculty at the National Guard and Armed Forces Academy (Laškar-e gard-e šāhanšāhi), where he trained high-ranking officials of the country.\n\nAs the \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" lastly states, Djanbazian founded the Folk Dance and Song Ensemble (Goruh-e raqṣ o āvāz-e maḥalli) conducted by maestro Edik Hovespian in 1959. Later on, this ensemble continued their performances under the direction of maestro Hovik Gasparian at the second national dance festival in Iran in 1962. Sarkis Djanbazian died of heart attack at the age of fifty on 11 December 1963 in Tehran. His greatest concern was that his school might not continue after his death. The school remained open and instructors such as Yagāna Šāygān, ʿAbd-Allāh Nāẓemi, Yerjanik Djanbazian, and Zohra Amjadi taught there until Djanbazian’s daughter, Anna, returned home after the completion of her dance education in Russia. She took over the academy in 1972 and managed it until 1984, when she left Iran and continued her dance activities in the United States, at the Djanbazian Dance Company in La Crescenta, California.\n\nIn 1950, Djanbazian married Fleur Djanbazian; they had two children, Anna and Albert Djanbazian. Anna received her education in dance first under her father’s direction and then continued her training in Russia after her father died.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10105662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10105662", "title": "Textbooks in Israel", "text": "Textbooks in Israel\n\nTextbooks in Israel are published in Israel by the Ministry of Education of Israel and other educational institutions.\n\nIsrael's Compulsory Education Law provides free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 5 to 18, from the last year of kindergarten up to 12th grade.\n\nAn analysis of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP), now known as the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education, found that the legitimacy of the State of Israel as an independent Jewish state on the territory of the Land of Israel and the immigration of Jews to the country was never questioned. There was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war. Many books express the yearning for peace between Israel and the Arab countries.\n\nIn textbooks for state-run schools, there was an effort to remove stereotypes and educate towards tolerance. In some textbooks for the Orthodox Jewish community, the researchers found derogatory adjectives, prejudices, patronizing expressions and disrespect toward Arabs. The Arab leadership was portrayed as motivated by an eternal hatred independent of historical circumstances. In textbooks for every age, Israel's wars are described as justified wars of defense, and the Arabs held responsible for them. The Palestinian exodus is attributed to the fact that the Arabs fled from their homes. Only a few textbooks stated that some refugees were expelled by Israel or were forced to flee through threats. Some do not mention the Palestinian exodus at all.\n\nAccording to the report, Islam is described with respect in both the general the religious state-run educational streams. Many books elaborate in detail how Muhammad established Islam and explain its fundamentals in a factual, objective manner. Many books highlight positive aspects in Islam. The language is factual and devoid of offensive terms and stereotypes. Sites holy to both Jews and Muslims are not presented as exclusively Jewish and the Arabs' attachment to these sites is taught. The students are even taught about the Muslims affinity to Jerusalem, although, the focus is on the religious, rather than the political dimension. The CIMP report found that it was only in the ultra-orthodox stream that textbooks contained prejudice, patronizing expressions and disrespect to Arabs.\n\nThe report further stated that in textbooks of both the general state-run network and the religious state-run network, there was a genuine effort to remove stereotypes and to build a foundation for coexistence and mutual respect between the two peoples. There are many stories that describe friendships between Jews and Arabs in Islamic countries and in Israel even in times of war. There are stories of Jews helping Arabs in daily life and in war as well as stories of Arabs rescuing Jews from physical harm and helping Jews to maintain their religion and identity. In many literary anthologies there are stories about the daily life of Arabs written by Arab authors. Some stories deal with the tensions created by the transition from a traditional society with its values and customs, to a modern western society. In some books in the ultra-orthodox network relations between Arabs and Jews were portrayed in negative terms. The official list of textbooks referred to is not compulsory, but was an indication of the Ministry of Education's recommendations, as published in a memo signed by the Ministry's Director.\n\nCMIP states that no negative changes were noted in the new textbooks with regard to the image of the Arabs, the description of the conflict, the presentation of Islam, questions of war and peace and education to tolerance and conciliation. On the contrary, the positive trends noted in the earlier report were strengthened. The textbooks of the ultra-Orthodox schools continued to use language conveying an air of superiority.\n\nMaps of Israel included all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. Many textbooks showed maps of the Middle East on which only Israel's name appeared, with the territories of the surrounding Arab countries left blank.\n\nIn his 2004 article \"The Arab Image in Hebrew School Textbooks\", Dan Bar-Tal of Tel Aviv University studied 124 textbooks used in Israeli schools. He concluded that generations of Israeli Jews have been taught a negative and often delegitimizing view of Arabs. He claims Arabs are portrayed in these textbooks as primitive, inferior in comparison to Jews, violent, untrustworthy, fanatic, treacherous and aggressive. While history books in the elementary schools hardly mentioned Arabs, the high school textbooks that covered the Arab–Jewish conflict stereotyped Arabs negatively, as intransigent and uncompromising.\n\nNurit Peled-Elhanan, a professor of language and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, published \"Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education\", an account of her study of the contents of Israeli school books. She asserts that the books promote racism against and negative images of Arabs, and that they prepare young Israelis for their compulsory military service. After examining \"hundreds and hundreds\" of books, Peled-Elhanan claims she did not find one photograph that depicted an Arab as a \"normal person\". She has stated that the most important finding in the books she studied concerns the historical narrative of events in 1948, the year in which Israel fought a war to establish itself as an independent state. She claims that the killing of Palestinians is depicted as something that was necessary for the survival of the nascent Jewish state. \"It's not that the massacres are denied, they are represented in Israeli school books as something that in the long run was good for the Jewish state.\" \"[T]he Israeli version of events are stated as objective facts, while the Palestinian-Arab versions are stated as possibility, realized in openings such as 'According to the Arab version' ... [or] 'Dier [sic.] Yassin became a myth in the Palestinian narrative ... a horrifying negative image of the Jewish conqueror in the eyes of Israel's Arabs'.\n\nWith reference to previous studies of Israeli school textbooks, Peled-Elhanan states that, despite some signs of improvement in the 1990s, the more recent books do not ignore, but justify, issues such as the Nakba. For example, in all the books mentioning Deir Yassin, the massacre is justified because: \"the slaughter of friendly Palestinians brought about the flight of other Palestinians which enabled the establishment of a coherent Jewish state.\"\n\nShe also states that contrary to the hope of previous studies \"for 'the appearance of a new narrative in [Israeli] history textbooks' ... some of the most recent school books (2003–09) regress to the 'first generation' [1950s] accounts — when archival information was less accessible — and are, like them 'replete with bias, prejudice, errors, [and] misrepresentations'\" (\"Palestine in Israeli School Books\", p. 228).\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Israeli science textbook publishers had been instructed to remove details of \"human reproduction, pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases from science textbooks used in state religious junior high schools as well as from their teacher manuals\".\n\nAccording to a 2011 report by the Arab Cultural Association, Arabic textbooks provided to third grade to ninth grade students in Israeli schools contained at least 16,255 mistakes. The report was based on a study and examination of textbooks in all subjects by a committee, headed by Dr. Elias Atallah. Association director Dr. Rawda Atallah said the findings were not surprising, since they were similar to the findings of a previous study published in November 2009, which reported that more than 4,000 mistakes in language and syntax were found in textbooks for second grade students in Arab schools. Researchers also spoke about the way in which Arab students' cultural and national identities are covered. For example, while textbooks state that Jews and non-Jews live in the Galilee, the word \"Arab\" is never mentioned. Dr. George Mansour, who examined the history textbooks, reported that they ignored the presence of the Arab-Palestinian people in Israel and stressed the Promised Land of the Jewish people: \"There is a process of de-Palestinization, instilling of the Zionist narrative and minimizing of Arab culture,\" reported Dr. Mansour.\n\nIsrael has ordered the word Nakba to be removed from Israeli Arab textbooks. The term was introduced in books for use in Arab schools in 2007 when the Education Ministry was run by Yuli Tamir of the Labour party. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the ban by saying that the term was \"propaganda against Israel\".\n\n"}

Adopted by the Makiguchi family, he moved to Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, at the age of 14. Working his way through school, he graduated from Sapporo Normal School (today's Hokkaido University of Education). First employed as an assistant teacher at a primary school affiliated with his alma mater, he later taught high school and served as a dormitory superintendent.\n\nAlthough he was recognized as an able teacher, Makiguchi's uncompromising attitude toward authorities created problems. His clashes with officials of the Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen, and top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in his frequent transfers from one school to another. After moving to Tokyo, he served as principal in a succession of six primary schools, from 1913 to 1932.\n\nDuring those years, he devoted much consideration to the relationship between life and education, developing his theories on \"sōka\" or the creation of value, the happiness of the individual, the prosperity of society at large, and their interrelationships in practice.\n\nHis pioneering work \"Jinsei Chirigaku\" (\"A Geography of Human Life\"), published in 1903, predates the academic study of geography at the Imperial Universities of Kyoto and Tokyo in 1907 and 1911, respectively. Written between the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, the work presents human geography as a subject for both formal and nonformal learning to advance an understanding of cultural differences shaping and shaped by the relationship between human activity and its natural environment. While \"Japanese geographers of the time were chiefly concerned with describing the physical features of the earth,\" Makiguchi was arguably the first to discuss human geography as a system of knowledge correlating location theory and spatial distribution of human phenomena with economic, social and political geographies. In Makiguchi's words, \"it is through our spiritual interaction with the earth that the characteristics that we think of as human are ignited and nurtured within us.\" In this work, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an approach to international relations, writing that: \"The important thing is the setting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself but not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the betterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal benefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more harmonious community life.\"\n\nIn response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the Meiji government's adoption of the Imperial Rescript, Makiguchi published the first volume of \"Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei\" (\"The System of Value-Creation Pedagogy\") together with his close friend and disciple Jōsei Toda on November 18, 1930. The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of Sōka Gakkai. The four-volume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on education and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the state, as embodied in the Imperial Rescript on Education, Makiguchi proposed a student-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the learner.\n\nHe also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership of school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in school and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities at home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child. Makiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic learners into eager, self-directed students.\n\n\"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as the goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In value-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy life and develop the ability and attitude required to create value.\"\n\nIn 1928, Makiguchi and Jōsei Toda converted to Nichiren Buddhism. Makiguchi's encounter with this school of Buddhist thought took his life into an even deeper and broader dimension, resulting in the establishment of the Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai (Value-Creation Education Society), the predecessor of today's Soka Gakkai. In Nichiren's teachings Makiguchi found support for his theory of value-creation and a world view consistent with his aims of educational reform and social betterment centered on addressing the subjective realities of the individual. It can be said that Makiguchi created and developed a grassroots movement as the foundation of a lasting peace, an objective he perceived at the very heart of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nDuring World War II, he opposed Japan's military government's attempts to impose the doctrine of State Shinto through strict control of religions and thoughts inimical to its war effort. While there was some debate as to whether Makiguchi's actions were in direct opposition to the war, it is clear that \"his outspoken criticism of the prevailing belief system represents an implicit and explicit protest against an extreme abuse of the educational process for militarist purposes.\"\n\nIn 1943, due to his refusal to accept the talisman and support the war, he was arrested and imprisoned as a \"thought criminal\" together with Jōsei Toda and 20 senior leaders of Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai for violating the Peace Preservation Law revised in 1941 and under which tens of thousands were arrested. Yet, in spite of being subjected to harsh interrogations, he never retreated from his beliefs; the 72-year-old former principal continued to assert the value of freedom of religion as a fundamental human right. On November 18, 1944, he died in prison of extreme malnutrition. His remains were laid to rest at Taiseki-ji, the head temple of Nichiren Shōshū.\n\nMakiguchi is remembered to this day by members of the Soka Gakkai in Japan and the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) around the world. During morning and evening prayers, members take a moment to express gratitude to the first three presidents of Soka Gakkai: Tsunesaburō Makiguchi (president from 1930-1944), Jōsei Toda (president from 1951–1958), and Daisaku Ikeda (president from 1960–1979, honorary president from 1979 to the present and president of SGI from 1975 to the present).\n\nA secular network of Soka schools around the world, including several independent secondary schools, and two universities (Sōka University of Japan and Soka University of America) were established by Daisaku Ikeda based on Makiguchi's pedagogy.\n\nMakiguchi's value-creating system of education has attracted the attention of educators around the world. His \"Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei\" has been translated into English, Portuguese, French and Vietnamese. In Brazil, Makiguchi's theory of education based on value-creation has been sponsored in 55 schools and introduced in 1,103 classrooms to more than 340,000 students.\n\n\nIkeda, Daisaku. \"John Dewey and Tsunesaburo Makiguchi: Confluences of Thought and Action.\" 2001.
