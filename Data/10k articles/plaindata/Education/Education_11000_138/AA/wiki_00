It was the basis for the 826 National organization, which has centers on the United States with the same goal.\n\nNamed for its street address, 826 Valencia was founded in 2002 by author Dave Eggers and veteran teacher Nínive Calegari, who both have ties to the literary and educational community. 826 consists of a writing lab, a street-front student-friendly pirate supply store that partially funds the programs, and two satellite classrooms in nearby middle schools.\n\nOver 1,400 volunteers—including published authors, magazine founders, SAT-course instructors, and documentary filmmakers—have donated their time to work with thousands of students. These volunteers allow 826 Valencia to offer all of its services for free.\n\n826 Valencia opened a satellite location in the Tenderloin in 2016.\n\n826 Valencia's programming includes:\n\nIn-schools programs\n\nWorkshops\n\nField trips\n\nAfter-school tutoring\n\nStudent publishing\n\n826 Valencia runs San Francisco's \"only independent pirate supply store\". The store is the front entrance of the tutoring center and has the look and feel of an authentic pirate shop. It sells pirate clothing, eyepatches, compasses, spyglasses, pirate dice, skull flags, and secret treasures. It features handmade signs, scattered around the store, offering tongue-in-cheek wisdom, such as \"Uses for Lard\" (#5: \"Lard Fights\") and \"Guidelines for New Shipmates\" (#4: \"No forgetting to swab\"). Unsuspecting visitors are sometimes treated to surprise \"moppings.\"\n\nShoppers can also find back issues of \"McSweeney's Quarterly Concern\", books published by McSweeney's, and literary compilations written by 826 Valencia students. The books of student writing published by 826 Valencia include forewords, illustrations and interviews from public figures such as Former San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and actor Robin Williams.\n\nThe Pirate Supply Store was originally created through necessity. After being turned down for regular use of church basements and school facilities, the founders discovered an empty store on Valencia Street. City ordinances required businesses in that area of the city to be either retail or catering, so the Pirate Supply Store was opened in 2002 as the \"legitimate\" business front for the writing center. It also helps fund the tutoring program.\n\nDave Eggers commissioned cartoonist Chris Ware to design the mural for the facade of 826 Valencia's building. The mural depicts \"the parallel development of humans and their efforts at and motivations for communication, spoken and written.\" The 3.9m x 6m mural was applied by artisans to Ware’s specifications. Describing the work, Ware said \"I didn’t want it to make anyone 'feel good', especially in that typically muralistic 'hands across the water' sort of way,\"...\"I especially wanted it to be something that people living in the neighbourhood could look at day after day and hopefully not tire of too quickly. I really hoped whomever might happen to come across it would find something that showed a respect for their intelligence, and didn’t force-feed them any 'message'.\"\n\n826 Valencia has inspired a number of other projects across the US, known as 'chapters'. In late 2004, just before the founding of four new chapters, 826 National was launched as an umbrella organization that provides logistical support to its chapters.\n\nThere are now eight chapters that make up 826 National: 826 Valencia, 826NYC in Brooklyn, 826LA in Los Angeles, 826CHI in Chicago, 826michigan (serving Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Ypsilanti), 826 Boston in Boston, 826DC in Washington, DC, and most recently, 826 New Orleans. \n\n826 Valencia has also inspired similar projects in several countries:\n\nUnited States\n\nItaly\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAustralia\n\nSweden\n\nIreland\nAustria\n\nFrance\n\nNetherlands\n\nOther\n\nIn April 2010, as an extension of the 826 Valencia scholarship program, Eggers launched ScholarMatch, a nonprofit organization that connects donors with students to make college more affordable.\n\n"}

In University, the grade runs upon a letter-type grade similar to American schools. The letter grades can add up to different numbered averages, from 0.0 to 4.5. However, in Middle School, the grades are based on the characters of the Korean language, such as \"수\" meaning \"Outstanding\", or \"양\" meaning \"Needs Improvement\".\n\nAll Korean Secondary Schools traditionally used to have a five-point grading system, which was converted from the student's raw score in mid-terms and finals (out of 100).\n\nThis system is still used in South Korean Middle Schools.\n\n\nStudents are generally not held back in Korean schools. Thus a grade of 'E' is still a passing grade.\n\nIn October 2004, the ministry of education changed the High School academic grading system from absolute to relative evaluation.\n\nThe revised grading system provides for 9 ranks based on students' relative standing amongst all others taking the same class that semester.\n\nIn 2014, the High School academic grading system was changed to a five-point grading system.\n\nIn South Korea, depending on each school, the perfect score is represented as either 4.0, 4.3, or 4.5. The latter is the most commonly used system in the country. Some schools regard A+ and A0 as equal.\n\nMany universities use the following gradations:\n\n What has to be noted is that since high schools are not nationally normalized, this rank is considered relatively depending on what high school one has graduated. For example, most students in 'Specialized high schools': except for arts school(Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, Cheong Shim international academy, Seoul Science high school, Foreign language high school) show strong academic ability because students who are accepted are selected through competitive entrance exam. Thus, students who get rank 8 or 9 are definitely not considered as a same level student who get 8-9 from normal- state high school. Also meaning normal high school's rank 1 is considered lower than rank 1 from special high schools since its rigorosity and level of classes and course works required for students are different. And this can be proved by their college acceptance results. This system is also applied to grades in colleges too.(Ex. SKY university gpa 3.0 and Kang-won university gpa 3.0 is considered different )"}
{"id": "17757202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17757202", "title": "Academic grading in Sweden", "text": "Academic grading in Sweden\n\nThis article is about the grades that are used in Sweden.\n\nIn the Swedish \"grundskola\" [Kindergarten - Ninth grade] (primary/elementary and secondary/high school, officially called \"compulsory school\" by Skolverket), students are currently (December 2012) graded from the sixth grade and onward. Students can be graded:\n\nIf a student has not attended enough classes (e.g. due to sickness, late start, truancy), they will instead be marked with an *-, that gives the same points (0p) as an *F, despite not being an actual grade.\n\nA reform was taken into full effect on the beginning of the semester in 2011 which had students graded from the sixth grade, and the grade is more similar to the system of the upper secondary school (\"gymnasium\"), with grades F-A. According to Skolverket, the change is due to a lot of students (~10 %) failing in courses in Swedish, Swedish as a second language, English or mathematics in the 9th year.\n\nIn the \"gymnasium\" (three-year pre-university course, similar to the UK sixth form college, officially called \"upper secondary school\" by Skolverket, despite there being no such thing as a \"lower secondary school\"), the same grading system as the primary school was used until 2011, when it was changed to a six-degree system A-F (A being the highest and F for having failed). Grades are assigned based on individual achievements rather than relative performance. Formally, the grade should reflect the degree of attainment of stated learning outcomes and objectives.\n\nTo easily count an average grade for the student, every grade in its subject gives a certain amount of points. To later use the grades for entrance to a specific program of courses in the Gymnasium, or to the higher educational institutes as the Universities etcetera. To count the average, all the points of the seventeen best grades are count together to then be divided by 17, the number of grades a student can present. Thau the best possible grade, *A, is worth 20 points, the maximum score is 340 points (17 grades x 20 points [The grade of an *A] per grade), or an average score of 20 points, which only is made if the student can show the grade of an *A in all subjects he/she has read during the last semester.\n\nThis can be shown by the grade forms below;\n\n[Bild] Picture & Art= B (17.5)\n\n[Engelska] English= A (20)\n\n[Hemkunskap] Home economics= C (15)\n\n[Idrott] Physical education= B (17.5)\n\n[Matematik] Math= A (20)\n\n[Musik] Music= D (12.5)\n\n[Biologi] Biology= B (17.5)\n\n[Fysik] Physics= A (20)\n\n[Kemi] Chemistry= C (15)\n\n[Historia] History= B (17.5)\n\n[Samhällskunskap] Social studies= A (20)\n\n[Religionskunskap] Religious knowledge= A (20)\n\n[Geografi] Geography= B (17.5)\n\n[Träslöjd/Textilslöjd] Wood work/Needle work= E (10)\n\n[Svenska/Svenska som andraspråk] Swedish/Swedish as a second language= A (20)\n\n[Moderna språk] Foreign languages (French, Spanish, German)= B (17.5)\n\nWhich gives a sum of 277.5 points, or an average point of 17.34, which symbolizes the grade of a C, even if you could place it as a weak B (B-), when a B is represented of a grade point of 17.5 or higher. When this grade isn't really that much the grade is counted as the grade below, in this case a C, which is represented by 15 points or higher.\nIf the student has parents from, or was born in a foreign country, he or she has the right to get education in his or her native language and also gets a valid grade in that language. Because you can only file 16 grades this gives the student the opportunity to choose which subject not to count, possibly the worst. Depending on schools the students can study another subject (Technics, Languages etc.), where the same procedure is used to file only the allowed 16 grades.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2010, grades ranged from \"IG\", \"G\", \"VG\", to \"MVG\" (\"IG\" being failed). This was changed in the secondary school reforms of 2011, primarily to make the distinction of grades clearer and to make the grading of students fairer. The IG-MVG system was translated into a numerical GPA like number for application purposes etc., where MVG equaled 20.0, VG 15.0, G 10.0 and IG 0 and the highest achievable GPA thus being 20.0. This system is still (2013) in use for students who started their secondary school with these grades.\n\nUntil 1996 relative grades on the scale 1-5 were used, with 5 being the highest grade. The scale was intended to follow a normal distribution on a national level, with a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nUp until 1962 yet another scale was used:\n\n\nThough unused for over 40 years, this scale retains some cultural significance, and the standard law school grading scale used today is based on it (see below).\n\nOn university level the following standard grading scale has been defined:\n\n\nAs long as relative grading is not used, however, individual universities may choose to use any other scale. For example, in the fields of engineering and technology, the passing grades of VG and G are commonly replaced with 5, 4 and 3, whereas law schools consistently employ a scale of AB, Ba and B as passing grades. Further, a number of universities are currently in the process of transitioning to an ECTS based scale, with an A to F grading, pursuant to the Bologna process. Many universities (e.g. KTH and Stockholm University) finished the transition process in 2007 or 2008.\n\nPrior to transitioning to the Bologna Process, the private university Stockholm School of Economics (Sw. Handelshögskolan i Stockholm) adopted its own grading scale:\n\n\nwhere B corresponded to a >=85% score, MBG >= 70% and G >= 50%.\n\nAfter spring 2016 all new students enrolled at the Stockholm School of Economics follow a new grading scale:\n\n"}

All students at each school may compete but the team score is the sum of the best 3 or 5 top scores. Each contest consists of two parts: a written section (called \"shorts\") and a programming section. Written topics tested include \"what does this program do?\", digital electronics, Boolean algebra, computer numbering systems, recursive functions, data structures (primarily dealing with heaps, binary search trees, stacks, and queues), lisp programming, regular expressions and Finite State Automata, bit string flicking, graph theory, assembly programming and prefix/postfix/infix notation.\n\nThere are five divisions in ACSL: Elementary, Classroom, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. The Elementary Division is a non-programming competition for grades 3 - 6. It tests one topic per contest. The Classroom Division is a non-programming competition for all grades and consists of a 10 question test on 4 topics each contest. Junior Division is recommended for middle school students (no students above the ninth grade may compete in it). Intermediate and Senior Divisions are for secondary school students, Intermediate being easier and Senior being more difficult. At the All-Star Contest, the Junior teams consist of 5 members each while the Senior and Intermediate teams can consist of 3 or 5 members.

Traditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the copyright to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect author's rights, and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the open access movement, found this unsatisfactory, and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the author(s) retain the other rights themselves.\n\nEven if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author's future work, and allow the author to distribute a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called postprints. Some publishers, for example the American Physical Society, also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author's or employer's website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged. The rise of open access journals, in which the author retains the copyright but sometimes needs to pay a publication charge, such as the Public Library of Science family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.\n\nThe American Institute of Physics requires the transfer of copyright from the authors, but allows the authors to post and update an article: \n\n\"AIP Advances\" authors may make their work available according to the terms of the Creative Commons 3.0 Unported License.\n\nThe American Physical Society requires the transfer of copyright from the authors to the Society.\nIt allows the authors to:\nA citation and notice of the APS copyright must be included.\n\nThe Nature Publishing Group does not require the transfer of copyright from the authors.

Twelve dental schools were represented at the first meeting, with each member donating one guinea to cover expenses.

However, it was later decided in 2005 that it was necessary to change the name to \"Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools\" to reflect that not all members of the organisation were given the title ‘Dean’. 2008 saw a final name change to the \"Dental Schools Council\" to reflect the expertise at all levels within the dental schools, from not only the Heads and Deans but also other dedicated staff members including admissions tutors, administrators and students themselves.\n\nIn 2007, the UK Dental Schools Senior Officers Group was convened, fostering formal and regular dialogue on key issues between Dental Schools across the UK at Senior Administrator Level.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\n\nFrom 1882-1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and her government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian ministry of education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\n\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded. \n\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French. \n\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became minister of education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism.

The educational complex got initiated by a group of local teachers and professionals, led by Professor Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain. Teachers pioneered by Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain, and Angel Morales Barraza, Angel Ruiz Ojeda, Alfonso Gómez Pereira, Gabriel Moreno Lozano, Maximum Argout, Luis Torres Coto, Margarita Ruiz Diaz, Ildefonso Corella and Tiburcio Gómez Alatorre . Subsequently joined by others like Miguel Bargalló Ardévosol, Maria Luisa Bargalló, Guillermo Caballero Sosa, Julio Torres Coto, Froylan Esparza , Jose Alberich, Aurelio Magro, Antonio Blanco and González Atenogenes.\n\nIn 1960 the High School joined the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (UABC), thus giving birth to the University being implemented in the Coastal Zone, without losing its dependence from the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP). In 1961 a divergent movement arose that resulted in the first semester of a school year ending in June, resuming activities with a second semester starting in September, later in the same calendar year.\n\nIn 1971 the school adopted the name 'Lázaro Cárdenas', after the former Mexican president famous for, amongst other measures, the nationalization of the oil industry and largely improving and expanding education throughout the country, who had died on October 19, 1970.\n\nIn 1972 major changes set educational standards such as:\n\n'Sure, from this moment this is a federalized High School!' was the response given by the President of Mexico, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, to the pledge posed to him with a blanket by a large crowd of students on the night of December 2, 1973, at the school's 'Salvador Allende' Civic Plaza.\n\nWith the arrival of Professor Jesus Ruiz Barraza, a series of measures were taken which transformed the school from a small provincial one to a large high school . In 1972, within the context of educational reform set forth by president Echeverria's government, the school was incorporated into the 'National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education' classification (ANUIES), abandoning the two-year plan in use since 1946, and supplying a three-year high school education program providing real job training in various professional specialties.\n\nBefore 1972 classes where held only in the evening in limited-space premises known as High School 19. Due to the constantly growing demand of students seeking high school education, Barraza pointed to the need for a morning school shift. With limited resources additional classrooms were built, allowing enrollment to increase to just over 1,000 'preparatoria' students. President Echeverría granted the request and, in May 1972, a group of students invited the president, while visiting the city, to see the school's facilities.\n\nStudents and campus leaders were asking for laboratories, classrooms and sports fields and, most importantly the federalization of the school; President Echeverria fulfilled the request, and awarded two million pesos for the construction of an all-new building. From then onwards the school ceased to be funded by its students, and joined the federation.\n\nDuring another visit to Tijuana on 2 December 1973, President Echeverria inaugurated the new facilities and publicly declared the official federalization of the school.\n\nFrom that point, the school became a member institution of the Federal Education System thus receiving federal financial funding for its operations, staff, maintenance and expansion of facilities. The school's graduates have a statistically higher than average performance record in Tijuana and the state of Baja California, and Mexico, in general.\n\nThe school started offering a high school program for employed adults in a late shift in 1983.\n\n\nThe study program meets the requirements specified by the Secretary of Higher Secondary Education (SEMS), that regulates the Secretaria de Educación Pública (SEP]. These are spread in six semesters in which from the third one the student has access to undertake one of the ten specializing courses according to eleven different professional areas that the campus offers. These are:\n\n\nAuthorized to offer the IB Diploma Programme since November,1982.\nThe program is taught in Spanish. But students are also required to master the English language, on an 80% minimum ratio.\nStudents at this school usually enroll for the examinations of the IB of the call in May.\nThe International Baccalaureate (IB) aims to develop young caring, informed and eager for knowledge, who help to create a better and more peaceful world in the context of mutual understanding and intercultural respect.\n\nIn pursuit of this objective, the organization works with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programs of international education and demanding rigorous assessment.\nThese programs encourage students across the world to adopt an active attitude of lifelong learning, to be compassionate and understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.\nThe main objective of the IB program is to train internationally minded people, aware of the condition that unites human beings and the shared responsibility to ensure the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world.\n\nIn the last call, students enrolled in the following subjects: Biology SL English B HL, History HL, ITSG SL, Math Studies SL, Math SL Physics SL Spanish A1 HL and Theory of Knowledge TK.\n\nThis department has existed since 1972, so the civic and cultural activities are born with high school and have been strengthened and enriched through the years.\nHere are coordinated as follows:\nAll these will promote and organize multiple presentations in the city, the state and tour\nboth domestic and international.\n\nAll teams representing selective lead institution on behalf of the 'Jaguares', are proud to wear the shirt of the selections:\n\nSituated within the Centro Escolar Agua Caliente complex (next to where the original Casino once stood, later expropriated by President Lazaro Cardenas who mandated to convert the premises into an educational complex) to the southeast of the main city, it comprises more than 80 classrooms, multiple science laboratories and workshops, one of the most complete libraries in the state, as well as sports facilities and cultural entertainment venues such as a theater, an auditorium and athletic fields, these undoubtedly represent the congregation of this educational institution, with the civic plaza as the heart of this sanctuary of medium-high education, every day home to more than four thousand students fighting to proudly support their football team: the 'Jaguares'.\n"}
{"id": "447501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447501", "title": "Flashcard", "text": "Flashcard\n\nA flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information, as words or numbers, on either or both sides, used in classroom drills or in private study. One writes a question on a side and an answer overleaf. Flashcards can bear vocabulary, historical dates, formulae or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards are widely used as a learning drill to aid memorization. They are often associated with spaced repetition, i.e. reviewed at expanding time intervals.\n\nFlashcards can be virtual, as those used by flashcard software, or physical.\n\nFlashcards are an application of the testing effect − the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the information through testing with proper feedback.\n\nFlashcards exercise the mental process of active recall: given a prompt (the question), one produces the answer. Beyond the content of cards, which are collected in decks, there is the question of \"use\" – how does one use the cards, in particular, how frequently does one review (more finely, how does one \"schedule\" review) and how does one react to errors, either complete failures to recall or mistakes? Various systems have been developed, mostly based around spaced repetition – increasing the time intervals between reviews whenever a card is recalled correctly.\n\nPhysical flashcards are two-sided; in some context one wishes to correctly produce the opposite side on being presented with either side, such as in foreign language vocabulary; in other context one is content to go in only one direction, such as in producing a poem given its title or incipit (opening). For physical flashcards, one may either use a single card, flipping it according to the direction, or two parallel decks, such as one English-Japanese and one Japanese-English. They have a number of uses that can be very simple or very elaborate for the person to memorize.\n\nThere are various systems for using flashcards, many based around the principle of spaced repetition – reviewing information at increasing intervals. Manually managing interval length can add greatly to the overhead of using flashcards: the Leitner system is a simple spaced repetition system designed for paper flashcards, based on a small number of boxes and a simple algorithm, while the SuperMemo algorithms are more complicated, tracking each card individually, and designed for implementation by computer.\n\nPhysical flashcards are necessarily two-sided. A variant, found in electronic flashcards, is what is known as a three-sided card. This is a particular kind of asymmetric two-sided card; abstractly, such a card has three fields, Q, A, A*, where Q & A are reversed on flipping, but A* is always in the answer – the two \"sides\" are thus Q/A,A* and A/Q,A*. Concretely, these are most used for learning foreign vocabulary where the foreign pronunciation is not transparent from the foreign writing – in this case the Question is the native word, the Answer is the foreign word (written), and the pronunciation is always part of the answer (Answer*). This is particularly the case for Chinese characters, as in Chinese hanzi and Japanese kanji, but can also be used for other non-phonetic spellings, including English as a second language.\n\nAn English-speaking student learning the Chinese word 人 (rén, person):\nReverse:\nOr a French student learning the English word \"enough\" (\"assez\" in French). Due to the irregular pronunciation of the -ough, the IPA pronunciation is given along with the word itself.\nReverse:\n\nThe purpose of three-sided cards is to provide the benefits of two-sided cards – ease of authoring (enter data once to create two cards), synchronized updates (changes to one are reflected in the other), and spacing between opposite sides (so opposite sides of the same card are not tested too close together) – without the card needing to be symmetric.\n\nOne can generalize this principle to an arbitrary number of data fields associated with a single record, with each field representing a different aspect of a fact or bundle of facts.\n\nThere is a wide range of software (including open source and online services) available for creating and using virtual flashcards as an aid to learning.\n\nPaper flashcards have been used since at least the 19th century, with \"Reading Disentangled\" (1834), a set of phonics flashcards by English educator Favell Lee Mortimer being credited by some as the first flashcards. Previously, a single-sided hornbook had been used for early literacy education.\n\nThe Leitner system for scheduling flashcards was introduced by German scientific journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s, specifically his 1972 \"So lernt man lernen. Der Weg zum Erfolg (How to learn to learn),\" while the SuperMemo program and algorithm (specifically the SM-2 algorithm, which is the most popular in other programs) was introduced on December 13, 1987 by Polish researcher Piotr Woźniak.\n"}

{"id": "29298237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29298237", "title": "Jane Joseph", "text": "Jane Joseph\n\nJane Marian Joseph (31 May 1894 – 9 March 1929) was an English composer, arranger and music teacher. She was a pupil and later associate of the composer Gustav Holst, and was closely concerned in the organisation and management of various of the music festivals which Holst sponsored. Many of her works were composed for performance at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.\n\nHolst first observed Joseph's potential when he was teaching her composition at St Paul's Girls' School. She began to act as his amanuensis in 1914, when he was composing \"The Planets\", her special responsibility being the preparation of the score for the \"Neptune\" movement. She continued to assist Holst with transcriptions, arrangements and translations, and was his librettist for the choral ballet \"The Golden Goose\". During her short professional life she became an active member of the Society of Women Musicians, was the prime mover behind the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and helped to found the Kensington Choral Society. She also taught music at a girls' school, where Holst's daughter Imogen was one of her pupils, and became a leading figure in the musical life of Morley College.\n\nMuch of Joseph's compositional oeuvre was never published and has been lost. Of her published works, two early short orchestral pieces, \"Morris Dance\" and \"Bergamask\" won considerable critical praise, although neither became part of the general orchestral repertory. Two choral works, \"A Festival Venite\" and \"A Hymn for Whitsuntide\" were admired during her lifetime, but seldom performed thereafter. Her carol \"A Little Childe There is Ibore\" was thought by Holst to be among the best of its kind. In the eight decades after her death there were no commercial recordings of Joseph's music, but there have been occasional broadcast performances.\n\nJane Joseph was born on 31 May 1894 at 23 Clanricarde Gardens, in the Notting Hill district of the Borough of Kensington, London, to a prosperous Jewish family. Her father, George Solomon Joseph (1844–1917), a solicitor in his family's firm, had married Henrietta, née Franklin (1861–1938) in 1880. Jane was their fourth child; the youngest of her three brothers was seven years older than her. George Joseph had a deep interest in music, which he passed on to his children; two sons, Frank (1881–1944) and Edwin (1887–1975), became competent string players, while Jane learned piano (she took her first examination at the age of seven) and later, double-bass. In time, Frank's musical children, with Jane and friends, formed the basis of a \"Josephs orchestra\" that performed concerts at Frank's home for many years.\n\nIn 1909 Joseph won a scholarship to St Paul's Girls' School (SPGS) in Hammersmith. The school had opened in 1904, as an offshoot of the long-established St Paul's School for boys. Its high mistress, Frances Ralph Gray, was a formidable figure with traditional views about female education, who nevertheless provided a lively and varied learning environment in which Joseph excelled. Apart from her academic successes, Joseph played double-bass in the school orchestra, gave an acclaimed piano performance of Bach's D minor keyboard concerto, began to compose, and won a prize for sight-reading. While at the school she composed \"The Carrion Crow\", a song setting which, in 1914, became her first published work. Outside music she supported the school's Literary Society, where she presented papers on Charlotte Brontë and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. She also won Honours in the examinations of the Royal Drawing Society.\n\nAmong the music teachers at SPGS, most significantly in terms of her musical development, Joseph encountered the emergent composer Gustav Holst, then little known, who taught her composition. After leaving the Royal College of Music in 1898 Holst had earned his living as an organist, and as a trombonist in various orchestras, while awaiting critical recognition as a composer. In 1903 he gave up his orchestral appointments to concentrate on composing, but found that he needed a regular income. He became a music teacher, initially at the James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich; in 1905 he was recommended to Frances Gray by Adine O'Neill, a former pupil of Clara Schumann, who taught piano at SPGS. He was first appointed on a part-time basis to teach singing, and later extended his activities to cover the school's wider music curriculum including conducting and composition. According to the composer Alan Gibbs, Joseph quickly came under Holst's spell, and adopted his principles as her own. Holst later described her as the best girl pupil he ever had: \"From the first she showed an individual attitude of mind and an eagerness to absorb all that was beautiful\".\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, at the age of 19, Joseph began studying Classics at Girton College, Cambridge. At that time, under Cambridge University regulations that were not fully repealed until 1948, women were ineligible to receive degrees, although they could sit the degree examinations, in Joseph's case the Classical Tripos. She soon found much in the university's life to divert her from her regular studies: debating, drama and, above all, music. In her first term she became a double-bass player in the Cambridge University Musical Society orchestra, under its conductor Cyril Rootham. She also sang alto in the society's choir, and may have participated in a performance of Berlioz's \"La damnation de Faust\" that was praised in the \"Cambridge Review\" of 17 June 1914. During vacations she continued her composition studies under Holst; in 1916 her \"Wassail Song\", a companion piece to \"The Carrion Crow\", was published. At Girton she wrote incidental music for a performance of W. B. Yeats's verse play \"The Countess Cathleen\", in which she acted the part of the First Dragon.\n\nFrom 1915 Joseph's association with Holst became closer. Overextended by his teaching duties and other commitments, Holst required assistance in the task of organising his music for publication and performance, and used a group of young women volunteers—his \"scribes\"—to make fair copies of his scores, write out instrumental or vocal parts, or prepare piano arrangements. In 1915 the composer was working on his largest and best-known work, the orchestral suite \"The Planets\", and invited Joseph, in her vacations, to join his scribes. Among these were Vally Lasker, a piano teacher from SPGS, and Nora Day, who had been a pupil with Joseph at the school and since 1913 had been teaching there. Joseph's main assignment for \"The Planets\" was to copy the \"Neptune\" movement, of which almost the entire original manuscript is written in her hand. For the rest of her career she remained one of Holst's most regular amanuenses, and he came to rely on her more than on any other. Her commitments to musical activities at Girton, combined with her work for Holst, had an adverse effect on her formal studies. In the 1916 Classical Tripos examinations she was awarded only a Class III pass, a disappointing result duly noted in her parting testimonial from the college.\n\nWhen Joseph left Girton, the First World War was at a critical state; the Battle of the Somme had begun on 1 July 1916. Joseph wanted to assist the war effort, and after considering work on the land or in a munitions factory, took up part-time welfare work in Islington. In the autumn of 1916 she began teaching at Eothen, a small private school for girls in Caterham, founded and run by the Misses Catharine and Winifred Pye. In 1917 Holst's ten-year-old daughter Imogen started at the school; soon, under Joseph's guidance the young pupil was composing her own music. Joseph extended her own musical activities by joining the orchestra at Morley College, where Holst was the director of music and where her brother Edwin had played the cello before the war. At first she played the double-bass, but later took French horn lessons, possibly from Adolph Borsdorf; later still, at very short notice, she taught herself the timpani part for a summer concert. By 1918 she was a member of the Morley committee that on 9 March organised and produced an opera burlesque, \"English Opera as She is Wrote\", in which English, Italian, German, French and Russian opera styles were parodied in successive scenes. The performance was a great success and was repeated at several venues. It may have inspired Holst to use parody in his own opera, \"The Perfect Fool\", which he began composing in 1918. In her spare time Joseph founded and ran a choir for Kensington nannies, which took part in local singing contests as the \"Linden Singers\".\n\nJoseph increased her teaching commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her role of the composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of \"The Planets\", on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: \"From the moment of Mars ... to the last sound of Neptune, it was a big thing that will last all our lives, I think\". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the apocryphal work \"The Acts of John\" from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's \"Hymn of Jesus\" (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's \"Mass for Three Voices\", and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for Samuel Wesley's \"Sing Aloud with Gladness\". This latter work was prepared for the 1917 Whitsun musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of Thaxted, in later years at assorted venues including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: \"Hymn\" for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, \"Barbara Noel's Morris\", which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.\n\nThe years 1917 and 1918 also brought personal sadness. On 22 October 1917 Joseph's father died from a heart attack. On 27 May the following year, just after the Whitsun festival, her brother William was killed in action on the western front; in September, Edwin was severely wounded in the final Allied offensive of the war. In his monograph on Joseph's life and music, the composer Alan Gibbs writes that \"there is no hint in Jane's letters of the effect these events had on her\". Gibbs quotes Duff Cooper, who wrote of those times: \"... if we wept—as weep we did—we wept in secret\".\n\nIn 1919, seeking to consolidate her musical career, Joseph joined the Society of Women Musicians (SWM), founded in 1911 by the violinist and musicologist Marion Scott and others to promote the interests of women in music. Scott was known to Joseph, having been leader of the Morley orchestra. Joseph became a member of the SWM's Composers' Sectional Committee, and occasionally gave lectures to the society on subjects such as \"The Necessity of Practical Experience for Composers\", and \"The Composer as Pupil\". In the summer of 1919 she took conducting lessons from Adrian Boult, whom she described as \"the most chinless man I have ever met\". The purpose of the lessons was to enable her to conduct her orchestral work \"Bergamask\", which was performed at the Coliseum Theatre under a scheme devised by Sir Oswald Stoll to showcase new British music. In that same summer she met Ralph Vaughan Williams, a close friend of Holst. She played him some of her music, probably a piano reduction of \"Bergamask\", and described him as \"a very appreciative critic\".\n\nTowards the end of 1918 Holst had asked Joseph to provide a libretto for his opera \"The Perfect Fool\", feeling that she might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It is not clear whether she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music \"The Sneezing Charm\"; the ballet, entitled \"A Magic Hour\", was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her \"Mirage\" cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.\n\nAt Eothen, Joseph continued to supervise Imogen Holst's musical education, aspects of which had earlier been causing Holst some concern. In a letter to his wife dated February 1919, written when he was serving as YMCA musical organiser for British troops stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean, Holst reported that \"I've had a very kind and wise letter from Jane about Imogen\". Whatever issues had troubled Holst were resolved satisfactorily, and Joseph became Imogen's theory teacher: \"Theory with Jane is \"ripping\"\", the young pupil enthused. In the summer term of 1920, with help from Joseph, Imogen devised and composed a \"Dance of Nymphs and Shepherds\" which was performed at the school on 9 July. At the beginning of 1921 Imogen started at SPGS; before becoming a boarder at Bute House (one of the school's residences for pupils), she stayed in the Joseph family home.\n\nThe Whitsun festivals, suspended during Holst's absence, resumed at Dulwich in 1920. Joseph's part in this event is unrecorded, but she made a major contribution to the following year's festivities, which began beside the Thames at Isleworth and concluded on Whit Monday at SPGS in the gardens of Bute House. For the Monday's celebrations Joseph devised a presentation of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, \"Dioclesian\". Writing of the occasion after Joseph's death, Holst recalled that she had woven Purcell's music and Thomas Betterton's text, both long neglected, \"into a delightful out-door pageant founded on a fairy story, complete with lost princess, dragon and princely hero\". Not satisfied with planning every aspect of the outdoor performance, Joseph prepared an indoors version of the entertainment, should the weather require this. The production was a great success, and was repeated that summer in Hyde Park and, in October 1921, at the Old Vic theatre. Throughout this considerable organisational task, Holst wrote, \"Jane gave the minimum of worry to each person concerned by giving herself the maximum of hard work and forethought\".\n\nIn November 1921 Joseph organised the Morley forces to perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary of the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The text was by Laurence Housman and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her \"Seven Two-Part Songs\" were performed at a SWM concert that included works by Ethel Smyth and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, \"A Hymn for Whitsuntide\" and \"A Festival Venite\" were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, Blackheath, with Holst conducting. After the \"Venite\" premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: \"Do you suppose for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong\". The \"Venite\" was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the \"Spectator\"s critic thought it a \"very notable addition to modern British music\". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.\n\nAs early as 1919, Joseph had written to her brother Edwin expressing concern about Holst's health. When following a physical breakdown in 1923 Holst gave up his duties at Morley College, Joseph wrote him a supportive letter congratulating him on his decision which would enable him to concentrate on composition. The following years were particularly fruitful for Holst, and Joseph assisted in many of the works he produced in the 1924–28 period. She helped him prepare the score for his \"Choral Symphony\", for which assistance he presented her with his original draft sketches, as a gesture of gratitude. Together with Lasker and Day she worked to prepare vocal and full scores for the opera \"At the Boar's Head\", and attended the rehearsals in March 1925. After the opera's premiere on 3 April she wrote to Holst with mildly critical comments on some of the singers, though with praise for the conductor, the young Malcolm Sargent. When Holst composed a short choral piece to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Oriana Madrigal Society, Joseph provided words which humorously reflected the conductor Kennedy Scott's working methods; the work was greatly appreciated by the choir. In that same year, 1925, she helped to found the Kensington Choral Society. By this time the Joseph home in Kensington, where Jane lived for her whole life, was becoming a recognised musical gathering-place; a visitor recalled meeting Vaughan Williams, Boult, and the harpist Sidonie Goossens there, among others.\n\nIn 1926 Joseph provided Holst with the libretto for his choral ballet \"The Golden Goose\", based on a story by the Brothers Grimm, and arranged its first performance at the 1926 Whitsun festival, held at the James Allen school. Joseph also assisted Holst and the librettist Steuart Wilson in the production of a second choral ballet, \"The Morning of the Year\"—the first work commissioned by the BBC's newly formed music department—which was performed at the Royal Albert Hall in March 1927. The Morley College Annual Report of 1927 recorded the formation of a folk dance club, and noted Joseph's \"skilful direction\" of the group. Her increasing interest in dance led her, that year, to join the English Folk Dance Society and the Kensington Dance Club.\n\nThe main feature of the 1928 Whitsun festival, held at Canterbury, was a religious drama, \"The Coming of Christ\", commissioned by George Bell, then Dean of Canterbury, and written by John Masefield. Holst provided the incidental music. In a photograph described by Gibbs, taken of the festival's organisers and performers, Joseph is sitting between Holst and Mrs Bell, \"taller than either, an efficient-looking lady in her early thirties, clearly of some importance to the festival\". This was Joseph's last Whitsun. Towards the end of the year her health began to fail; there is a mention in Holst's diary for 29 November 1928, \"Jane's concert 8.15\", but no indication is given of whether she was a performer. In February 1929 she paid off the final amount owing to the piano manufacturer C. Bechstein, for Morley's new piano for which she had been fundraising since 1926. On 9 March 1929 Joseph died at home, in Kensington, of kidney failure. After a private funeral she was buried in Willesden Jewish Cemetery.\n\nHolst was in Venice when the news of Joseph's death reached him; although Imogen records that he received it stoically, he was privately devastated. Joseph had, wrote Imogen, \"come nearest to his ideal of clear thinking and clear feeling\". In his own tribute, Holst drew attention to Joseph's \"infinite capacity for taking pains which amounts to genius\". No Whitsun festival was held in 1929, but in early July, at an open-air production of Holst's \"The Golden Goose\" at Warwick Castle, a special performance of his \"St Paul's Suite\" was played in Joseph's memory. On 5 December 1929, at a competitive music festival, Vaughan Williams conducted the choir in Joseph's \"Hymn for Whitsuntide\" while the audience stood in tribute. The same hymn was played at the first resumed Whitsun festival, at Chichester in May 1930. In July 1931 Holst included her music in a concert that he conducted at Chichester Cathedral, alongside works by William Byrd, Thomas Weelkes and Vaughan Williams. Over the course of the next few years Joseph's works were played at concerts and events organised by Morley College, the SWM, SPGS and the English Folk Dance Society. At Eothen a \"Jane Joseph Memorial Prize\" was established, and music scholarships were endowed in her name at Eothen and SPGS.\n\nA friend who expressed personal sadness on hearing of Joseph's death revealed another aspect of her character: \"England won't be the same without Jane. She was terribly difficult to get to know at all, and awfully lonely, I thought, in spite of all her friends—don't you think so?—but I can't imagine Music without her\".\n\nMuch of Joseph's music was written for performances at modest-scale events by amateur performers. As such it was never published, and over the years many works have been lost. The published works and the few others that survive, Gibbs believes, place Joseph in the category of \"progressive\" English composers. Although her first few compositions were mainly songs, she demonstrated early abilities as an orchestral composer. Gibbs finds in her two short pieces, \"Morris Dance\" (1917) (originally \"Barbara Noel's Morris\") and \"Bergamask\" (1919), three and five minutes respectively, a \"fine feeling for orchestral sound\". The \"Morris Dance\" has added sparkle from a glockenspiel, while \"Bergamask\" has a festive Italianate feel. The music writer Philip Scowcroft praises Joseph's confident handling of the sizeable orchestral forces required for the \"Morris Dance\", while the composer Havergal Brian, Holst's contemporary, found \"Bergamask\" \"exhilarating\" and \"full of promise\". Gibbs suggests that these two works presage Holst's late choral ballets, and comments: \"That these carefree pieces did not find a permanent place in the repertory is unfortunate\".\n\nIn Joseph's \"Mirage\" song cycle of 1921 (five songs with string quartet accompaniment), a Holstian influence is evident alongside her own distinctive compositional voice. Gibbs highlights the first in the cycle, \"Song\", which initially echoes \"To Varuna\" from Holst's \"Rig Veda\" hymns, but evolves into \"a different creation, distinguished by its own uncluttered quartet writing in which the viola has a special part to play\". The final song, \"Echo\", has as much in common with Brahms as with Holst. Joseph's \"Festival Venite\" from 1922 is an example of her use of the Modern Dorian mode (an ascending scale from D to the next D on the white piano keys), which became a feature of some of her later works. Scowcroft and Gibbs both point to Tudor influences in the \"Venite\" in which also, says Gibbs, \"the congenial influence of Vaughan Williams in melody and harmony is felt\". The orchestral score for this work lost, but an organ accompaniment has been devised. Joseph's unaccompanied choral \"Hymn for Whitsuntide\" also uses the Dorian Mode in what Holst described as a \"flawless little motet\"; this was first work of Joseph's to be broadcast, in 1968. A \"Short String Quartet\" in A minor was performed by the Winifred Smith Quartet in December 1922 and was accepted for publication by J.B. Cramer and Co. However, it was not published, and subsequently disappeared.\n\nJoseph's carol \"A Little Childe There is Ibore\", is a setting of a 15th-century poem for three female voices and piano or strings. Holst considered this \"the best of Jane's many carols, and perhaps the hardest to perform well.\" Written in alternate bars of five and seven beats, it was praised by Brian for its originality. It was eventually broadcast by the BBC on 21 December 1995. Brian was also an admirer of Joseph's many instructional piano pieces: \"pleasingly simple and unaffected\". These were published between 1920 and 1925; Gibbs writes that these pieces \"focus on technical aspects in tuneful and often modal contexts\", with occasional excursions into other forms such as chaconne and rondo.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

He taught school at a single-room schoolhouse in Columbia County, New York.\n\nJesse Merwin, a 19th-century schoolmaster in Kinderhook, New York, was described in a well-known longhand script letter by President Martin Van Buren, as the \"pattern\" for author Washington Irving's character of Ichabod Crane in his story, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\n\nAccording to a notation by Irving and a certification written in long hand by Martin Van Buren—who was friends with both the author and the schoolteacher—the 'pattern' (Van Buren's words) for the character of Ichabod Crane was based on the original Kinderhook schoolmaster named Jesse Merwin, whom Irving became friends with in Kinderhook, New York, in 1809. The two friends continued a pen-pal correspondence for thirty years. The Columbia County Historical Society (New York) owns the original Kinderhook Schoolhouse named after the Irving character based on Jesse Merwin, the town's first schoolteacher. The Kinderhook town school district (Ichabod Crane Central School District) is also named for the Irving character. Because a member of the Van Tassel family was a lieutenant alongside another man in Tarrytown, Samuel Youngs, according to an 1894 article in \"The New York Times\", \"it [was] claimed by many in that town (Tarrytown) that Samuel Youngs was the original from whom Irving drew his character of Ichabod Crane\". Author Gary Denis asserts that while the character of Ichabod Crane is loosely based on Kinderhook Schoolmaster, Jesse Merwin, it \"may possibly\" \"include elements\" from Samuel Youngs' life.\n\nAn early Irving biographer best known for his interpretation of Herman Melville as well as his two-volume biography on Irving, Professor of English at Yale University, Stanley Thomas Williams, also refers to Martin Van Buren's certificate, to quote here his two-volume work on Irving: \"...Ichabod Crane, Irving drew from the schoolmaster whom he knew in 1809.\"\n\nBy 1809 Merwin was teaching at a District School in Kinderhook, where he boarded at the home of Judge William Peter Van Ness. There he met another boarder, a twenty-six year old tutor and aspiring author named Washington Irving. Irving and Merwin went fishing and hunting together during that period and became lifelong friends.\n\nMerwin married Jane Van Dyke, the daughter of a wealthy Kinderhook farmer in 1808, and together they had eight sons and three daughters, including in 1834, Merwin named one of his sons 'Washington Irving Merwin' after his friend the author.\nMerwin died in Kinderhook on November 8, 1852.\n"}

In some instances, the sweater or jacket itself may also be awarded, especially for the initial award to a given individual.\n\nToday, in order to distinguish \"lettermen\" from other team participants, schools often establish a minimum level of participation in a team's events or a minimum level of performance in order for a letter to be awarded.\n\nA common threshold in American football and basketball is participation in a set level, often half, of all quarters in a season.\n\nIn individual sports such as tennis and golf, the threshold for lettering is generally participation in one half or sometimes two-thirds of all matches contested. Frequently, other members of the team who fail to meet requirements for a letter are awarded a certificate of participation or other award considered to be of lesser value than a letter.\n\nSome schools continue to base the awarding of letters according to performance, in team sports requiring a certain number of scores, steals, baskets or tackles, according to position and sport. In individual sports letters are often determined according to qualification for state meets or tournaments. Other schools award letters on a more subjective basis, with the head coach, usually with the input of other coaches and sometimes student team leaders who have already lettered, awarding letters for substantial improvement as well as significant performance on or off the field. This places much more emphasis on character, commitment and teamwork as well as, and often in place of, simply playing enough or meeting some other time or performance requirement. Sometimes in high schools academic performance in classes can also be an element. This philosophy gives more focus to developing and rewarding a well rounded and balanced player, where other methods focus strictly on athletic performance and on the field victories.\n\nThis term is not gender-specific; a qualifying participant in women's basketball or other women's sports is properly referred to as a letterman, as would be a qualifying female participant on a co-educational sports team.\n\nAn athlete who is awarded a letter (or letters in multiple sports) is said to have \"lettered\" when they receive their letter.\n\nIn recent years, some schools have expanded the concept of letterman beyond sports, providing letters for performance in performing arts, academics, or other school activities.\n\nA letter jacket is a baseball-styled jacket traditionally worn by high school and college students in the United States to represent school and team pride as well as to display personal awards earned in athletics, academics or activities. Letter jackets are also known as \"varsity jackets\" and \"baseball jackets\" in reference to their American origins.\n\nThe body (i.e., torso) is usually of boiled wool and the sleeves of leather with banded wrists and waistband. Letter jackets are usually produced in the school colors with the body of the jacket in the school's primary color and sleeves in the secondary color. Although sometimes, the colors of the jacket may be customized to a certain extent by the student. There could be cases where a student could change the color so much that it doesn't differentiate too much from school colors. \nThey usually feature a banded collar for men or a hood for women.\n\nThe letter jacket derives its name from the varsity letter chenille patch on its left breast, which is almost always the first letter or initials of the high school or college the jacket came from. The letter itself can also be custom fitted to the particular sport or activity (ex. Cross Country- a symbol or sign in the middle of the letter).\n\nThe name of the owner usually appears either in chenille (matching the letter) or is embroidered on the jacket itself. The owner's graduation year typically appears in matching chenille. Placement of the name and year of graduation depends on school traditions. The year is most often sewn on the right sleeve or just above the right pocket. The school logo and symbols representing the student's activities may also be ironed on to the jacket.\n\nLettermen who play on a championship team often receive a large patch commemorating their championship that is worn on the back of the jacket.\n\nLettermen who participate in a sport in which medals are awarded often sew the medals onto their jackets to display their accomplishments.\n\nVarsity jackets trace their origins to letter sweaters, first introduced by the Harvard University baseball team in 1865. The letter was usually quite large and centered (if the sweater was a pullover); stripes on one sleeve designated the number of letters won, with a star indicating a team captain.\n\nLetter jackets are almost never purchased before a student has earned a letter. In schools where only varsity letters are awarded this is usually the practice in a student's junior or senior year. Recently, however, many student athletes have been awarded letters during their sophomore and sometimes freshman year, leading to the need for a jacket much sooner. Still, the actual jacket isn't usually purchased until the sophomore year at least. In schools where junior varsity letters are awarded, the jacket may be purchased by junior varsity letter recipients, though the letter is placed just above the left pocket, leaving space for a future varsity letter.\n\nSome schools may award letter jackets to letter winners at the award ceremony, but more often the school only provides the letter. Some schools will have fund raising activities or other programs to provide jackets to students who cannot afford them.\n\nWhile it is commonly done, removing one's letter from the letter jacket upon graduation is not firmly held as protocol. Many graduates keep the letter on the jacket after graduation as a symbol of accomplishment and school pride and commitment, especially with college lettermen.\n\n"}

He is the former president of the University of California (2008-2013), former chancellor of the University of Texas System (2002–2008), and former president of the University of Minnesota (1997–2002).\n\nIn addition to his position as Chancellor at The University of Texas, Yudof held the Charles Alan Wright Chair in Federal Courts at the University of Texas School of Law. Previously, he was a faculty member and administrator at The University of Texas at Austin for 26 years, serving as dean of the School of Law from 1984 to 1994 and as the University’s executive vice president and provost from 1994 to 1997.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia to parents of Ukrainian Jewish descent, Yudof was raised in West Philadelphia. Yudof's father worked as an electrician. Yudof earned his B.A. \"cum laude\" in political science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965 and LL.B. \"cum laude\" from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in 1968.\n\nYudof joined the faculty of The University of Texas School of Law in 1971. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Michigan Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law.\n\nYudof is a recognized expert in the fields of constitutional law, freedom of expression, and education law. He was co-counsel for the plaintiffs in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case San Antonio v. Rodriguez, the landmark school finance lawsuit. He is the author of \"Gender Justice\" (with David L. Kirp and Marlene Franks), (Chicago Press, 1986; Paperback, 1987) and of \"When Government Speaks: Politics, Law, and Government Expression in America,\" (The University of California Press, 1983). Yudof became a member of the State Bar of Texas in 1980.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1994, Yudof served as dean of the University of Texas School of Law.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Yudof served as executive vice president and provost of the University of Texas at Austin. In that position, Yudof initiated many improvements to undergraduate education, including creating a freshman seminar program and Academy of Distinguished Teachers.\n\nOn July 1, 1997, Yudof took office as the 14th president of the University of Minnesota. In his first year as president, Yudof took advantage of a state budget surplus to fund construction projects, historic preservation, and academic priorities at the university. Yudof helped to establish freshman seminars. In 1999 the university moved from a quarter to semester system.\n\nThe university encountered scandal in 1999 after the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" reported that an academic counseling staffer at Minnesota claimed to have done coursework for many student-athletes on the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball program over the past five years, as well as several other NCAA rules violations by Minnesota basketball. Yudof oversaw self-imposed sanctions on the men's basketball program. Those sanctions included a $1.5 million buyout of the contract of head coach Clem Haskins, a postseason ban for the 1999–2000 season, and scholarship reductions. The scandal led to the resignations of men's athletic director Mark Dienhart and university vice president McKinley Boston. Members of the university board of regents praised Yudof for his handling of the scandal. By 2002, Yudof united men's and women's athletics at Minnesota under a single athletic director.\n\nIn 2002, a six-story apartment-style hall was built at the University of Minnesota and was named after Mark G. Yudof. It is referred to as Yudof or Yudof Hall.\n\nYudof became the ninth chancellor of the University of Texas System on August 1, 2002. Simultaneously, he was president emeritus at the University of Minnesota and Charles Alan Wright Chair in Federal Courts at the University of Texas School of Law. As University of Texas System chancellor, Yudof allowed individual campuses to set their own tuition rates. He resigned on June 15, 2008 to become President of the University of California system.\n\nIn March 2008, Yudof was selected as the next president of UC, to succeed Robert C. Dynes. He began his term on June 16, 2008.\n\nIn November 2009, \"TIME Magazine\" recognized Mark Yudof as one of the \"10 Best College Presidents\", citing his efforts to provide opportunity and access to a quality education for California residents with financial need whose family income is less than $60,000.\n\nIn January 2013, Yudof announced his plan to resign as president of the University of California, effective August 31, 2013.\n\nThe California budget crisis resulted in massive cuts to higher education by the California State Legislature and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Struggling to grapple with the ensuing crisis, California legislative leaders cut more than 20 percent from the UC budget in one year - the largest budgetary reduction in the history of the UC. In a July 9 \"Open Letter to UC alumni and friends,\" UC Regent Richard Blum; Russell Gould, then-chair; Sherry Lansing, then-vice chair; and UC president Yudof wrote, \n\"The UC model — providing universal access to a top-notch, low-cost education and research of the highest caliber — continues to be studied around the globe among those who would emulate its success. And yet, this model has been increasingly abandoned at home by a state government responsible for its core funding.\"\nAs state budgetary support declined dramatically, Yudof kicked off an online grassroots advocacy effort in order to make the case for the University of California. In 2008, Yudof became the first president of a major research university to organize advocacy efforts using email, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media components. Yudof called on all students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends to unite behind an aggressive push to make funding UC a state priority.\n\nIn 2009, Yudof further bolstered this effort through a campaign seeking to let legislators and the governor know how critical their support is in preserving the university's commitment to quality and student access.\n\nAlso in 2009, Yudof came under criticism for an interview that he gave to Deborah Solomon of the New York Times, Big Man on Campus, in which he joked about taking a pay cut from his salary of over $800,000 to $400,000 in exchange for the White House and Air Force One.\n\nIn February 2009, upon President Yudof's recommendation, the University of California Board of Regents unanimously approved a new financial aid plan intended to support college access for lower-income families and students. Under the policy, known as the \"Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan\", undergraduates who are in their first four years of attendance at UC—or two for transfer students—will receive enough scholarship and grant assistance to at least fully cover their systemwide UC fees if they have incomes below $80,000 and meet other basic eligibility requirements for need-based financial aid.\n\nIn October 2009, seeking to help keep the University of California accessible and affordable for California students, President Yudof announced an ambitious effort that aims to raise $1 billion for student support over the next four years. Through the fundraising effort, \"Project You Can\", all 10 UC campuses have committed to raise $1 billion in the aggregate over the next four years—doubling the amount of private support the system has raised for scholarships, fellowships and other gift aid in the previous five years. The UC Board of Regents endorsed the effort at its November 2009 meeting. Yudof made the Project You Can announcement at Sunnyside High School, which for 10 years has propelled promising students toward health careers through its Doctors Academy, a program sponsored by UCSF Fresno. Despite facing social and economic barriers — 87 percent of Sunnyside's students are eligible for free or reduced lunch — all Doctors Academy graduates have gone on to college, 43 percent of them at UC campuses.\n\nCiting increasingly unreliable funding provided to universities by state government, President Yudof called for the federal government to bolster its financial commitments to the nation’s universities and colleges in his paper titled \"Exploring a New Role for Federal Government in Higher Education\". In announcing the proposal, Yudof remarked:\n\nWe must find creative ways to expand the federal commitment to research and access into a new category: The nuts-and-bolts core funding that is vital to a robust university, allowing it to hire quality professors, equip laboratories and expand the physical plant.\n\nNew York Times columnist Bob Herbert visited the UC Berkeley campus and had this to say: \nThe problems at Berkeley are particularly acute because of the state’s drastic reduction of support. But colleges and universities across the country — public and private — are struggling because of the prolonged economic crisis and the pressure on state budgets. It will say a great deal about what kind of nation we’ve become if we let these most valuable assets slip into a period of decline.\n\nYudof is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Law Institute. In 1993, he and his wife, Judy, were the co-recipients of the Jewish National Fund Tree of Life Award. Judy Yudof served as the first female international president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 2002. In February 2010, Regents of the University of Texas System established the Mark G. and Judy G. Yudof Chair for the benefit of the University of Texas School of Law. In 2012, \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" named Yudof in its \"Forward 50\" list of influential Jewish Americans.\n"}

{"id": "5824904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5824904", "title": "Maturation and environmentalism", "text": "Maturation and environmentalism\n\nMaturation is a guiding notion in educational theory that argues children will develop their cognitive skills innately, with little influence from their environment. Environmentalism, closely related to behaviorism, is the opposite view, that children acquire cognitive skills and behaviors from their surroundings and environment.\n\nPsychologists have studied the development of infants through various topics and have found support for both maturation and environmentalism. Two of the most commonly studied topics are: i) infant crawling and ii) infant language learning. Psychologists have found evidence supporting both the maturation theory and environmentalism theory when investigating each of these topics.\n\nOne of the most common apparatus used by psychologists to study infant crawling is the visual cliff. This cliff was first used with different types of animals as well as infants to measure depth perception\".\" Organisms are placed on a raised glass board. Under the glass, material is placed to give the effect of a floor on one side of the apparatus. On the other side, the material is taken away to give the effect of a drop, and a deep side\".\" When infants are placed on this apparatus, psychologists can study whether or not these infants, or other animals, have gained the skills needed to understand that the visual drop is dangerous, or if they still cross the drop point. If young infants can avoid the experimental drop while crawling, researchers can assume that the aversion to cliffs is innately learned, not learned through crawling experience or teaching.\n\nIn one study, it was found that the age an infant begins crawling, and not the crawling experience of an infant, determined whether they would cross or avoid the visual cliff. The infants with a later crawling start date avoided the cliff significantly more than infants with an earlier crawling start date. These observations indicate that there is a biological time clock that is intuitively teaching infants about depth avoidance, rather than crawling experience teaching them about avoidance. These conclusions are consistent with maturation theory. In another study, psychologists found that the crawling experience negatively affected infants who could not yet walk and were placed in walkers on the virtual cliff. In this study too, the age when crawling began was a better indicator of whether the infant would avoid the cliff rather than his or her crawling experience. This lends evidence to the theory of maturation and innate age related steps in development, rather than external factors.\n\nStudies using a real water visual cliff found that infants with greater crawling experience had an easier time avoiding the cliff than those with less experience. A water cliff is a visual cliff with water in the deep end of the apparatus, and can measure an infant's potential perception of danger, as well as sensitivity to water\".\" The results indicating that crawling experience was a greater indicator of avoidance align with the environmentalism theory in that infants learn through experiences with their environment. Additionally, researchers have also observed that infants who have learnt avoidance through crawling carried this avoidance over to when they start walking, rather than having to relearn these skills. These carryover effects indicate that infants are learning and processing through interactions with their environment and can apply their learnings to other new situations.\n\nIt has also been observed that a mother's emotions, seen through facial expression, can sometimes regulate an infant's behavior. Infants were placed on a visual cliff with a clear drop, and were able to see their mothers' facial expressions. When the mothers expressed fear, fewer infants crossed the cliff, indicating that the mothers' expressions had an effect on their behavior, supporting the environmentalism theory. However, when infants were placed on a visual cliff with a hidden drop, many infants crossed regardless of their mothers' facial expressions. This lends credence to the maturation theory; infants innately understand crawling and do not take cues from their surroundings.\n\nWhile specific alphabets, grammar, and sounds might differ in different regions of the world, language is a universal form of communication within all societies, with all infants learning how to speak early in their lives. However, there has been much debate on how children acquire their language skills. More specifically, psychologists have argued about whether the skills of learning a language are innate within all humans, consistent with the maturation theory, or are learned through societal teaching practices, consistent with the theory of environmentalism.\n\nInfants are usually thought to be quick language learners, as people believe that children have implicit abilities to learn languages, whereas adults learning a language must use explicit instruction to obtain proficiency. However, it was found that if given explicit instructions, both children and adults learn new languages effectively. This finding endorse the reasoning that children have inherent abilities to learn languages that are not influenced by the environment. However, these inherent abilities to learn languages can be developed into even stronger skills with help from the environment.\n\nOne way to examine the potential effect of the environment on the language abilities of children is to study the effects of day care environments on language learning skills. If young children spend a significant portion of their formative years in day care, and if the environment influences their ability to learn language, then there should be a correlation between the quality of day care and language abilities. Psychologists studying this relationship found that the quality of day cares, as well as the language skills of the day care providers are large predictors of children's' language ability. Children in higher quality day care locations had much stronger language abilities. This evidence strongly supports the environmental theory that argues factors in a child's environment affect their development and language abilities. Additionally, the longer an infant or child experiences better care during their formative years, the stronger its language skills will be. Parent's responsiveness to children can also help facilitate language and vocabulary growth.\n\nIn children with language development problems and behavioral disorders, parent behavioral interventions and speech therapy interventions have also been shown to significantly improve language development in young children. Parental influence can change and dictate young children language skills, an improvement that would not be seen from just internal maturation factors alone.\n"}

The wooden shield, which is presented to the winning school, was donated in by Dr Patrick F. McEvedy to promote the spirit of athletic competition between the participating colleges. An old boy of St Patrick's College, Wellington, Dr McEvedy went on to represent England in rugby union. \n\nThe 2018 competition was won by Wellington College on Tuesday 6 March at Newtown Park, winning 4 titles in a row, and marking their 52nd McEvedy victory, out of 94 meetings.\n\nThe shield was donated by Patrick Francis McEvedy (1880-1935) in 1922. McEvedy attended St Patrick's, Wellington, from 1895 to 1898, before going to Guy's Hospital in London to train as a doctor. He toured New Zealand in 1904 with Bedell-Sivwright's British team and again in 1908 with the Anglo-Welsh team. He later returned to Wellington and was Wellington Rugby Football Union President 1931-1933 and NZRFU President 1934-1935.\n\nThe competition features fourteen track and field events across four age groups - under 14 years, under 15 years, under 16 years, under 17 and over 17\nyears. For each event in each age group, four points are awarded for first place, three points for second place, two points for third place and one point for fourth place.\n\n100 metres, 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, 1500 metres, and 3000 metres, 80 metre hurdles, 100 metre hurdles, 110 metre hurdles and 4 x 100 metres relay.\n\nHigh jump, long jump, triple jump, javelin, discus and shot put.\n\nWellington College and St. Patrick's College, Wellington are the only schools that remain from the original competition in 1922, with Rongotai College first competing in 1928 and St Patrick's College, Silverstream taking part in the school's first year of existence, 1931.\n\nOver the years there have been a number of schools that have taken part in the competition, including Hutt Valley High School, Scots College and Wairarapa High School (which shared the Shield in 1925 with Wellington College, and won outright in 1927). In the early 1980s it was decided that only the four traditional boys' schools would be able to compete. \n\nIn 2009, Scots College's attempt to rejoin the McEvedy Shield was unsuccessful.\n\nThe competition is held at Newtown Park, Newtown. Held during school hours, the entire student body of each school assembles to support its team. Because of the large number of spectators, the schools take turns sitting in the main stand. Each year two schools watch from the surrounding grass banks.\n\nIt has previously been held at the Basin Reserve, Athletic Park and on the St Patrick's College grounds at Silverstream.\n\nWellington College is the current shield holder. Their 2018 victory was their 52nd win of the McEvedy Shield, the most wins out of any school. Wellington College holds the record for the greatest point differential between first and second place, beating second place St Pats Town by 95 points in 2017. \n\nSt Patrick's College, Wellington has won the McEvedy Shield 20 times, second to Wellington College. The College has won the Shield for five years out of the last eight years, including a triple-crown from 2012 to 2014 (exceptions were when Wellington College won in 2009, 2011 and 2015).\n\nSt Patrick's College, Silverstream has won the Shield 14 times, and holds the record for the most consecutive Shield victories, winning six years in a row (1968 to 1973).\n\nRongotai College has triumphed seven times with their last shield win being in 1989.

MTNA offers a wide range of member resources, from leadership, teaching and personal health support, to insurance, financial and legal services. It also comprises two subsidiaries, the MTNA Professional Certification Program, and the MTNA Foundation Fund, which supports a variety of programs that include music competitions and commissioning of composers. MTNA was founded in 1876, and is registered as a 501(c)(3) organization in Ohio, with headquarters located in Cincinnati.\n\nMusic Teachers National Association is an American organization founded in 1876 by Theodore Presser, who was both a musician and publisher. MTNA is credited in helping to establish an international pitch scale in 1883 as well as promoting international copyright law and giving official recognition to the American composer. In 1967, MTNA approved the program for qualified teachers. MTNA is also known for commissioning compositions by American composers and presenting the annual Distinguished Composer of the Year Award. The association also hold annual competitions for young musicians at the local, state, and national level. Currently, the organization had approximately 22,000 members, including teachers, performers, and composers, and more that 500 local affiliates. The official journal of the MTNA, \"American Music Teacher\", was first published in 1951.\n\nMTNA's purpose is to advance the benefit of studying music and music making to society and to support the professionalism of music teachers. MTNA maintains two subsidiary programs: MTNA Professional Certification Program and the MTNA Foundation Fund. The Professional Certification Program exists to improve the quality of professionalism in applied music teaching and assists the public in identifying proficient music teachers in their communities. The MTNA Foundation Fund supports programs that financially assist teachers and students with educational objectives while supplying an opportunity for individual and corporate support of MTNA and its programs.\n\nAs an association of music teachers, MTNA's mission is to elevate the professional level and develop the standing of all its members. MTNA is responsible for disseminating many publications, including books, journals, and pamphlets that have greatly impacted the profession of teaching music. MTNA also perpetually seeks newly published music and other teaching materials to raise awareness among its members.\n\nAccording to MTNA, \"The National Certification Plan is one of the highest importance to the professional welfare of the music teacher, and it provides a means of measuring and recognizing his or her professional growth. It represents almost a century of consultation and deliberation on the part of America's musical leaders.\"\n\nThe independent music teachers forum of MTNA was the first established in 1972, at the MTNA Convention in Portland, Oregon. After this initial meeting, IMTF organized different committees on the local and state levels. Its purpose was \"To investigate the role of the full time independent teacher in American society today: the problems, advantages, and practices of this group, with the goal of establishing a true profession in this decade.\"\n\nMultiple forums now exist through MTNA. They provide an environment for open discussion and the expression of ideas. These forums meet annually at the MTNA conference. These forums include:\n\n\nFirst awarded in 1969, the terms of the Distinguished Composer of the Year Award state that an MTNA-affiliated state music teachers association could commission any composer of their choice to compose a work for their state convention. Recording and scores of these works could then be sent to the national headquarters in Cincinnati. From these commissions, one composer is selected each year by a panel of judges to receive the \"Distinguished Composer Award,\" otherwise known as the \"Composer of the Year\" award.\n\nPrevious winners include:\n\n\nThe MTNA National Conference, which is held annually, brings together the constituents of the MTNA membership. National competitions highlights the performances of students in all instrument areas, including composition. The national conferences also include master classes, technology and informational sessions, pedagogy sessions, and evening concerts. Members have the opportunity to participate in the national conference by submitting proposals and papers for presentation.\n\nDuring the Chicago convention of 1948, the MTNA Executive Committee established the divisional organizations. Each state was assigned to a particular division, even though the state in question, at the time, may not have had an organized chapter of the MTNA. The Current Divisions are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll fifty states and the District of Columbia have affiliations with MTNA.

Adsit (pen name, Probus; May 21, 1825 – April 27, 1902) was an American art lecturer, art educator, and writer. A graduate of Ingham University, she contributed for half a century to art literature.\n\nAdsit was the first woman to enter the insurance field in the United States, and, as far as was known, in the world. She was possessed of an unusual combination: great literary ability and excellent business sense. At the age of 13, she assumed charge of her own affairs and her future education. Some of her early writings aroused great antagonism, and her identity was withheld by her editor and not until many years later did she acknowledge their authorship. On the death of her husband, Charles Davenport Adsit, of Buffalo, New York in 1873, the widow assumed entire charge of his business and general insurance agency. After a most successful career in this line, she sold the business and resumed her writing. She contributed to the London \"Art Journal\", writing an interesting series of articles for them on \"The Black and White in Art\" or \"Etching and Engraving.\" This brought demands for lectures and parlor talks on art, and she began a course of classes for study. For many years, she delivered these lectures in the principal cities of the U.S. and her name was prominently connected with art education both in the U.S. and abroad.\nNancy H. Warren was born in Palermo, New York, May 21, 1825. She was of New England Puritans lineage, and was descended from the Mayflower Robinsons on the mother's side, and from the patriotic Warrens of Massachusetts on the father's side, her father being a clergyman and missionary. Her early life was a discipline in self-dependence, which aided and stimulated the development of an inherited force of character, enabling her to combat and conquer adverse conditions, overcome obstacles and from childhood mark out for herself and pursue steadily a career that achieved success. At the age of 13, she assumed entire charge of herself and her fortunes. The expenses of collegiate study in Ingham University were met by teaching and journalism.\n\nAdsit was a regular contributor to the columns of the New York City \"Baptist Register\", the \"Boston Recorder\", the \"New-York Tribune\" and the \"Western Literary Messenger\". Her earlier work was mostly in the line of poetic effusions and several series of \"lay sermons\" under the signature of \"Probus.\" These sermons aroused intense antagonism in clerical circles, on account of their latitudinarianism on theologic questions. Heated and prolonged discussions followed each publication. \"Probus,\" the unknown, was adjudged by a general council \"guilty of heresy,\" and the sermons were denounced and condemned. The series was completed, however, and her identity was held between herself and the editor, and not until many years later, by her own voluntary confession, was the writer identified. Meanwhile, the thought of the clergy, as of the world at large, had broadened, and the sermons were no longer under proscription.\n\nShe married Charles Davenport Adsit, of Buffalo, December 13, 1862. Her home during the next three years was at 11 North Division street, in that city. Alternating literary, charitable and church work with her domestic duties, she developed an ideal home. They removed to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1865, where the husband died in 1873, leaving his widow charged with large responsibilities. Adsit immediately assumed the entire charge and management of a general insurance agency. She was the first woman in general insurance in the U.S., and, so far as is known, in the world. Protests from family friends and jealous antagonisms on the part of business competitors met her at the threshold of the work, but she won public favor as she gave assurance of ability, until the work was crowned with such success as to leave no cause for its further prosecution. Accordingly, Adsit sold the business, with her good will, and resumed writing. Her range of work reached from the political questions of the day to science and art. Her contributions to the London \"Art Journal\" for many years brought a request for a series of articles on the \"White and Black in Art,\" or \"Etching and Engraving.\" Finding no satisfactory data for thorough investigation in books, she visited the studios of artists as well as the workshops of engravers, gathering at firsthand the necessary information, even to the practical use of the tools of each craft. An entire year was consumed in this preparatory work.\n\nMonths before the articles were completed the demand for parlor conversation on the topics which so absorbed her induced Adsit to open her home to groups of ladies and gentlemen, who cared to take up the study in earnest. The field of her labor gradually broadened, and from 1880, she gave lecture courses in nearly all the principal cities of the U.S.. Her name became prominently identified with art education, both in the U.S. and abroad. While Adsit disclaimed being an artist, she was a competent and thorough critic and elucidator of art. Her criticisms of prints, especially, were sought by connoisseurs and collectors. The secret of her success lay in the fact that her work was simply the expression of her own personality, including an abounding enthusiasm which carried her audiences. In a report of its Wisconsin secretary to the Association for the Advancement of Women, of which Adsit is one of the vice-presidents, the writer said: \"To Mrs. C. D. Adsit's work is due, directly or indirectly, most of the art interest in our State as well as the entire West.\" Her own adverse experiences quickened and enlarged her sympathies toward all working women, to whom she gave not only wholesome advice, but also substantial aid. Her home in Milwaukee was a center of art and of social interchange. She died April 27, 1902, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was buried at Forest Home Cemetery, Milwaukee.\n\n"}

{"id": "1090018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090018", "title": "Newton's cradle", "text": "Newton's cradle\n\nNewton’s cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the still nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir Isaac Newton. It is also known as Newton's balls or Executive Ball Clicker.\nA typical Newton's cradle consists of a series of identically sized metal balls suspended in a metal frame so that they are just touching each other at rest. Each ball is attached to the frame by two wires of equal length angled away from each other. This restricts the pendulums' movements to the same plane.\n\nWhen one of the end balls (\"the first\") is pulled sideways, the attached string makes it follow an upward arc. When it is let go, it strikes the second ball and comes to nearly a dead stop. The ball on the opposite side acquires most of the velocity of the first ball and swings in an arc almost as high as the release height of the first ball. This shows that the last ball receives most of the energy and momentum of the first ball. The impact produces a compression wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. Any efficiently elastic material such as steel does this, as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat. There are slight movements in all the balls after the initial strike but the last ball receives most of the initial energy from the drop of the first ball. When two (or three) balls are dropped, the two (or three) balls on the opposite side swing out. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. However, if the colliding balls behave as described above with the same mass possessing the same velocity before and after the collisions, then any function of mass and velocity is conserved in such an event.\n\nNewton's cradle can be modeled with simple physics and minor errors if you incorrectly assume the balls always collide in pairs. If one ball strikes four stationary balls that are already touching, the simplification can't explain the resulting movements in all five balls, which are not due to friction losses. For example, in a real Newton's cradle the fourth has some movement and the first ball has a slight reverse movement. All the animations in this article show idealized action (simple solution) that only occurs if the balls are not touching initially and only collide in pairs.\n\nThe conservation of momentum (mass × velocity) and kinetic energy (0.5 × mass × velocity^2) can be used to find the resulting velocities for two colliding perfectly elastic objects. These two equations are used to determine the resulting velocities of the two objects. For the case of two balls constrained to a straight path by the strings in the cradle, the velocities are a single number instead of a 3D vector for 3D space, so the math requires only two equations to solve for two unknowns. When the two objects weigh the same, the solution is simple: the moving object stops relative to the stationary one and the stationary one picks up all the other's initial velocity. This assumes perfectly elastic objects, so we do not need to account for heat and sound energy losses.\n\nSteel does not compress much, but its elasticity is very efficient, so it does not cause much waste heat. The simple effect from two same-weight efficiently elastic colliding objects constrained to a straight path is the basis of the interesting effect seen in the cradle, and gives an approximate solution to all its action.\n\nFor a sequence of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls, and the action is as follows: The first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the second ball striking the third ball) transfers all its velocity to the third ball and stops. The third ball then transfers the velocity to the fourth ball and stops, and then the fourth to the fifth ball. Right behind this sequence is the first ball transferring its velocity to the second ball that just stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the fourth ball right behind the fifth ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls. If they are simply touching when they strike the third ball, precision requires the more complete solution below.\n\nThe interesting effect of the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball can be seen in sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a straight line. The effect can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium. If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act like a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle's balls to a straight line. For example, lithotripsy shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm to burst kidney stones. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike.\n\nFor the simple solution to precisely predict the action, no pair in the midst of colliding may touch a third ball, because the presence of the third ball effectively makes the struck ball appear heavier. Applying the two conservation equations to solve the final velocities of three or more balls in a single collision results in many possible solutions, so these two principles are not enough to determine resulting action.\n\nEven when there is a small initial separation, a third ball may become involved in the collision if the initial separation is not large enough. When this occurs, the complete solution method described below must be used.\n\nSmall steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30 µm in a small Newton's cradle). The small, stiff compressions mean they occur rapidly, less than 200 microseconds, so steel balls are more likely to complete a collision before touching a nearby third ball. Softer elastic balls require a larger separation to maximize the effect from pair-wise collisions.\n\nA cradle that best follows the simple solution needs to have an initial separation between the balls that is at least twice the distance that the surface of balls compresses, but most do not. This section describes the action when the initial separation is not enough and in subsequent collisions that involve more than 2 balls even when there is an initial separation. This solution simplifies to the simple solution when only 2 balls touch during a collision. It applies to all perfectly elastic identical balls that have no energy losses due to friction and can be approximated by materials such as steel, glass, plastic, and rubber.\n\nFor two balls colliding, only the two equations for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously colliding elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the colliding surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome. For example, five balls have four colliding points and scaling (dividing) three of them by the fourth gives the three extra variables needed to solve for all five post-collision velocities.\n\nNewtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and stationary action are the different ways of mathematically expressing classical mechanics. They describe the same physics, but must be solved by different methods. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. Newton's law has been used in research papers. It is applied to each ball and the sum of forces is made equal to zero. So there are five equations, one for each ball—and five unknowns, one for each velocity. If the balls are identical, the absolute compressibility of the surfaces becomes irrelevant, because it can be divided out of both sides of all five equations, producing zero.\n\nDetermining the velocities for the case of one ball striking four initially-touching balls is found by modeling the balls as weights with non-traditional springs on their colliding surfaces. Most materials like steel that are efficiently elastic approximately follow Hooke's force law for springs, formula_1, but because the area of contact for a sphere increases as the force increases, colliding elastic balls follow Hertz's adjustment to Hooke's law, formula_2. This and Newton's law for motion (formula_3) are applied to each ball, giving five simple but interdependent differential equations that are solved numerically. When the fifth ball begins accelerating, it is receiving momentum and energy from the third and fourth balls through the spring action of their compressed surfaces. For identical elastic balls of any type with initially touching balls the action is the same for the first strike, except the time to complete a collision increases in softer materials. 40% to 50% of the kinetic energy of the initial ball from a single-ball strike is stored in the ball surfaces as potential energy for most of the collision process. 13% of the initial velocity is imparted to the fourth ball (which can be seen as a 3.3 degree movement if the fifth ball moves out 25 degrees) and there is a slight reverse velocity in the first three balls, the first ball having the largest at −7% of the initial velocity. This separates the balls, but they come back together just before as the fifth ball returns. This is due to the pendulum phenomenon of different small angle disturbances having approximately the same time to return to the center. When balls are \"touching\" in subsequent collisions is complex, but still determinable by this method, especially if friction losses is included and the pendulum timing is calculated exactly instead of relying on the small angle approximation.\n\nThe differential equations with the initial separations are needed if there is less than 10 µm separation (less than width of a human hair) when using 100 gram steel balls with an initial 1 m/s strike speed.\n\nThe Hertzian differential equations predict that if two balls strike three, the fifth and fourth balls will leave with velocities of 1.14 and 0.80 times the initial velocity. This is 2.03 times more kinetic energy in the fifth ball than the fourth ball, which means the fifth ball would swing twice as high in the vertically direction as the fourth ball. But in a real Newton's cradle the fourth ball swings out as far as the fifth ball. To explain the difference between theory and experiment, the two striking balls must have at least ≈10 µm separation (given steel, 100 g, and 1 m/s). This shows that in the common case of steel balls, unnoticed separations can be important and must be included in the Hertzian differential equations, or the simple solution gives a more accurate result.\n\nThe forces in the Hertzian solution above were assumed to propagate in the balls immediately, which is not the case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of a material builds up to form a pressure wave. Pressure waves (aka sound) in steel travel about 5 cm in 10 microseconds, which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The pressure waves reflect back and forth through all 5 balls about 10 times, although dispersing to less of a wave front with more reflections. This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.\n\nIdentically-shaped balls help the pressure waves converge on the contact point of the last ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backwards to reflect off the opposite side of the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off the opposite side of the last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the second ball. Then the reverberations reflect off the contact point between the second and third balls, but still converge at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected—but it's less of a wave front with each reflection.\n\nUsing different types of material does not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic. The size of the spheres doesn't change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, is be lost as heat, because the elastic limit increases as radius but the energy had to be absorbed and released increases as radius. Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.\n\nThis discussion has neglected energy losses from heat generated in the balls from non-perfect elasticity, friction in the strings, friction from air resistance, and sound generated from the clank of the vibrating balls. The energy losses are the reason the balls eventually come to a stop, but they are not the primary or initial cause of the action to become more disorderly, away from the ideal action of only one ball moving at any instant. The increase in the non-ideal action is caused by collisions that involve more than two balls at a time, effectively making the struck ball appear heavier. The size of the steel balls is limited because the collisions may exceed the elastic limit of the steel, deforming it and causing heat losses.\n\nThe most common application is that of a desktop executive toy. Another use is as an educational physics demonstration, as an example of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.\n\nA similar principle, the propagation of waves in solids, was used in the Constantinesco Synchronization gear system for propeller / gun synchronizers on early fighter aircraft.\n\nChristiaan Huygens used pendulums to study collisions. His work, \"De Motu Corporum ex Percussione\" (On the Motion of Bodies by Collision) published posthumously in 1703, contains a version of Newton's first law and discusses the collision of suspended bodies including two bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.\n\nThe principle demonstrated by the device, the law of impacts between bodies, was first demonstrated by the French physicist Abbé Mariotte in the 17th century. Newton acknowledged Mariotte's work, among that of others, in his \"Principia\".\n\nThere is much confusion over the origins of the modern Newton's cradle. Marius J. Morin has been credited as being the first to name and make this popular executive toy. However, in early 1967, an English actor, Simon Prebble, coined the name \"Newton's cradle\" (now used generically) for the wooden version manufactured by his company, Scientific Demonstrations Ltd. After some initial resistance from retailers, they were first sold by Harrods of London, thus creating the start of an enduring market for executive toys. Later a very successful chrome design for the Carnaby Street store Gear was created by the sculptor and future film director Richard Loncraine.\n\nThe largest cradle device in the world was designed by \"MythBusters\" and consisted of five one-ton concrete and steel rebar-filled buoys suspended from a steel truss. The buoys also had a steel plate inserted in between their two halves to act as a \"contact point\" for transferring the energy; this cradle device did not function well because concrete is not elastic so most of the energy was lost to a heat buildup in the concrete. A smaller scale version constructed by them consists of five chrome steel ball bearings, each weighing , and is nearly as efficient as a desktop model.\n\nThe cradle device with the largest diameter collision balls on public display was visible for more than a year in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the retail store American Science and Surplus (see photo). Each ball was an inflatable exercise ball in diameter (encased in steel rings), and was supported from the ceiling using extremely strong magnets. It was dismantled in early August 2010 due to maintenance concerns.\n\nNewton's cradle has been used more than 20 times in movies, often as a trope on the desk of a lead villain such as Paul Newman's role in \"The Hudsucker Proxy\", Magneto in \"X-Men\", and the Kryptonians in \"Superman II\". It was used to represent the unyielding position of the NFL towards head injuries in \"Concussion\". It has also been used as a relaxing diversion on the desk of lead intelligent/anxious/sensitive characters such as Henry Winkler's role in \"Night Shift\", Dustin Hoffman's role in \"Straw Dogs\", and Gwyneth Paltrow's role in \"Iron Man 2\". It was featured more prominently as a series of clay pots in \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\", and as a row of 1968 Eero Aarnio bubble chairs with scantily-clad women in them in \"Gamer\". In \"Storks\", Hunter the CEO of Cornerstore has one not with balls, but with little birds.\n\nIn 2017, an episode of the \"Omnibus\" podcast, featuring \"Jeopardy!\" champion Ken Jennings and musician John Roderick, focused on the history of Newton's Cradle. Newton's cradle is also featured on the desk of Deputy White House Communications Director Sam Seaborn in \"The West Wing\".\n\nJefferson Airplane (1968) on the album \"Crown of Creation\" used the cradle as a rhythm device to create polyrhythms on an instrumental track.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20901387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20901387", "title": "Polytechnic (United Kingdom)", "text": "Polytechnic (United Kingdom)\n\nA polytechnic () was a tertiary education teaching institution in England, Wales and Northern Ireland offering higher diplomas, undergraduate degree and post graduate education (masters and PhDs) that was governed and administered at the national level by the Council for National Academic Awards. At the outset the focus of Polytechnics was on STEM subjects with a special emphasis on engineering. After the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 they became independent universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The comparable institutions in Scotland were collectively referred to as Central Institutions. Like polytechnics or technological universities (institute of technology) in other countries, their aim was to teach both purely academic and professional vocational degrees (engineering, computer science, law, architecture, management, business, accounting, journalism, town planning) etc. Their original focus was applied education for professional work and their original roots concentrated on advanced engineering and applied science (STEM subjects), though soon after being founded they also created departments concerned with the humanities. The polytechnic legacy was to advance and excel in undergraduate and post graduate degrees in engineering and technology (STEM) education that now form a core faculty at most universities in the UK. While many former polytechnics have advanced their research focus many have stayed true to their original ethos by focusing on teaching for professional practice.\n\nThe division between universities and polytechnics was known as the Binary Divide in UK higher education.\n\nSome polytechnics trace their history back to the early 19th century. The London Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster) emerged from the Royal Polytechnic Institution which was founded at Regent Street, London in 1838. The establishment of the polytechnic was a reaction to the rise of industrial power and technical education in France, Germany and the USA. Degrees at the London Polytechnic were validated by the University of London. The first British institution to use the name \"polytechnic\" was the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, which it still retains, together with the affectionate nickname \"The Poly\".\n\nMost polytechnics were formed in the expansion of higher education in the 1960s, Academic degrees in polytechnics were validated by the UK Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) from 1965 to 1992. The CNAA was chartered by the British government to validate and award degrees and maintain national quality assurance standards. The CNAA subject boards from their inception were from the universities. A CNAA degree was formally recognised as equivalent to a university degree and the courses were under strict scrutiny by assessors external to the polytechnics.\n\nSub-degree courses at these institutions were validated by the Business & Technology Education Council (BTEC).\n\nSome polytechnics were often seen as ranking below universities in the provision of higher education because they lacked degree-awarding powers, concentrated on applied science and engineering education and produced less research than the universities, and because the qualifications necessary to gain a place in one were sometimes lower than for a university (the failure rate in the first year of undergraduate courses was high due to a rigorous filtering process). However, in terms of an undergraduate education this was a misconception since many polytechnics offered academic degrees validated by the CNAA from bachelor's and master's degree to PhD research degrees. Also professional degrees in, for instance, engineering, town planning, law, and architecture were rigorously validated by various professional institutions. Many polytechnics argued that a CNAA degree was superior to many university degrees especially in engineering, due to the external independent validation process employed by the CNAA, the oversight of the engineering institutions, and innovations such as sandwich degrees. Such innovations made a polytechnic education more relevant for professional work in applying science and advanced technology in industry.\n\nIn UK culture an engineering, applied science and technological education tended to be looked down upon socially. Industries and activities such as \"manufacturing\" and \"engineering\" were perceived to be things of the past, boring and \"dirty\". This connection to polytechnics did not help their cause in terms of achieving status in the public eye. This attitude and influence led to an expansion of the more popular subjects in the \"creative\" industries such as fashion, arts and design, media studies, journalism, film studies, and sports management. This social influence caused many polytechnics to change their faculty of \"Engineering\" to faculty of \"Design and Technology\"\n\nFor many years a central admissions system for polytechnics was not seen as necessary. However, a large increase in applications resulted from funding cuts to universities in the early 1980s. The Polytechnics Central Admissions System was introduced and handled the years of entry from 1986 to 1992.\n\nUnder the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 they became fully fledged universities. After 1992, the former polytechnics (\"new universities\") awarded their own degrees. Most sub-degree BTEC qualifications have been phased out of the new universities and transferred to colleges of further education.\n\nThe polytechnics changed their names when they gained university status. Some simply dropped \"polytechnic\" and added \"university\" to their titles. For example, the Huddersfield Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield. However, this was often not possible as there was another university with the name. One alternative title was \"Metropolitan University\", because the institution was situated in a city or other large metropolitan area. Examples are Manchester Metropolitan University and London Metropolitan University. These titles are often shortened to \"Met\" (Man Met, London Met) or an acronym (MMU, LMU). Others adopted a name which reflects the local area, such as Nottingham Trent University (named after the River Trent which flows through Nottingham) and Sheffield Hallam University (\"Hallam\" refers to the area of South Yorkshire in which much of Sheffield is situated). Ulster Polytechnic remains the only polytechnic to unite with a university; this occurred in 1984.\n\nThe last degree-awarding institution to hold on to the name \"polytechnic\" after 1992 was Anglia Polytechnic University (which had only attained polytechnic status the previous year). The word was soon identified as being off-putting to potential students, and the university became known as Anglia Ruskin University from 2005. The name \"polytechnic\" (École Polytechnique) in continental Europe and the USA (MIT) are viewed and styled as globally elite universities specializing in STEM education where science, engineering and engineers are premier forward looking strategic professions. This is in stark contrast to the culture and social identity of engineers in the UK.\n\nAt their peak there were over thirty polytechnics in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the English ones being primarily located in urban areas large enough to support industry or commerce, from which they usually took the city name. \nThese are now universities.\n\nIn England, there are:\nIn addition, Wales has\n\nand Northern Ireland has:\n\nIn Scotland there were comparable Higher Education institutions called Central Institutions but these very rarely used the designation \"Polytechnic\" in their titles; these also converted into universities.\n\n"}

{"id": "2241788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241788", "title": "Stagecast Creator", "text": "Stagecast Creator\n\nStagecast Creator is a visual programming language intended for use in teaching programming to children. It is based on the programming by demonstration concept, where rules are created by giving examples of what actions should take place in a given situation. It can be used to construct simulations, animations and games, which run under Java on any suitable platform.\n\nWhat is today known as Creator originally started as a project by Allen Cypher and David Canfield Smith in Apple's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) known as KidSim. As the name implies, it was intended to allow kids to construct their own simulations, reducing the programming task to something that anyone could handle. Programming in Creator uses graphical rewrite rules augmented with non-graphical tests and actions.\n\nIn 1994, Kurt Schmucker became the project manager, and under him, the project was renamed Cocoa, and expanded to include a Netscape plug-in. It was also repositioned as \"Internet Authoring for Kids\", as the Internet was becoming increasingly accessible. The project was officially announced on May 13, 1996. There were three releases:\n\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he began dismantling a number of non-productive departments. One of these was the ATG. Larry Tesler, Cypher, and Smith, left to form Stagecast Software after retaining the rights to the Cocoa system.\n\nApple went on to reuse the Cocoa name for the entirely unrelated Cocoa application framework, which had originated as OpenStep. Apparently due to time constraints—it was easier to reuse an already-registered name than to register a new term.\n\nCreator is based on the idea of independent \"characters\" that have a graphical appearance and non-graphical properties. Each character has a list of rules that determine how it behaves. The rules are created \"by demonstrating\" what the character does in a specific situation. Each graphical rewrite rule is a \"before / after\" rule, stating that when the \"before\" conditions of the rule are met, the \"after\" actions of the rule are performed.\n\nFor a simple example, let's consider a simulation showing a character walking across a field, jumping over any rocks it encounters. Such a simulation would start with the construction of the playfield, in this case a line of icons representing the grass and a few rocks. A character is then placed on the playfield and double-clicked to open a rule editor. The rule editor will start by displaying the current conditions, that is, the character is standing on the grass. Below is an area to place the various \"after\" conditions, in this case the user drags open the default grid to two spaces, drags the character into the new grid cell, say to the right, and closes the rule editor.\n\nIf the simulation is started at this point, the character will start walking across the playfield to the right until it reaches the first rock. Since there is no rule showing what should happen when a rock is to the character's right, the character simply stops. At this point the rule editor is opened again, but now it shows the new condition that applies, the character is to the left of a rock. The actions in this case would be two steps, the first showing the character moving up and to the right, the next down and to the right. When the simulation is re-run, the character will walk to the right, and then \"jump\" over the rocks. In this case the character will now stop moving when it reaches the side of the screen, and a new rule could be added at that point to \"wrap around\" to the left side again.\n\nAdditional rules can be added \"on the fly\" to flesh out the simulation. In this example additional rules would likely be added to allow the conditions to apply no matter which direction the character is walking, duplicating the existing set of two rules for movement to the left, and up and down. To make the simulation interactive, the \"automatic movement\" rules can be removed, and replaced by ones that move only when the cursor keys are held down, and jump only if the user presses space. Now the simulation becomes a simple game.\n\nMany new features were added to the system during its evolution from KidSim/Cocoa to Creator. These include the introduction of 'jars' as a means of object classification, a new z-variable that allows Creator to simulate a 3-D space (as a stack of 2-D sheets), the ability to control more than one character at a time, and the option to redraw the screen only after all moves in a turn have been made.\n\nIn order to ensure Creator's cross-platform compatibility, the entire system was ported to the Java programming language. As Cocoa, the system was a Mac-only product and included an 'Autoplayer' functionality that allowed a Cocoa simulation to be run as a stand-alone program on any Mac. With the port to Java, Creator simulations can be posted on a Web page and run as an applet.\n\n\n"}

Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cited TIE as \"one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice\". TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.\n\nThe idea of a high-impact child-centred performance for a specifically targeted school audience became hugely popular. Due to small audiences students can be encouraged to participate through work in-role and through debate. Student experimentation can be supported with resource materials and training or support for the students by teachers.\n\nEducation is becoming like rote learning. The education the students are getting is not being applied creatively in any area. Contrary to this 'rote' education, TIE presents a different approach including discussions, contributions and creativity through performance. It fulfils all types of learning and enhances the development process.\n\nIn the last twenty years many books have appeared describing drama and theatre activities with children. These various labels are indicative of the range of the work and of the possible confusions that can arise. Some of the main areas of work are:\n\nDrama in Education\nIn the school curriculum, this is both a method and a subject. As a curriculum subject it uses various dramatic elements, and acting out. In many Secondary schools drama is now a separate department. In some Primary schools it is used as a method to teach a number of subjects.\n\nTheatre in Education\nA professional team of trained and experienced actor/teachers, who prepare relevant material/project/experiment to be presented in schools often involving more than one visit. These programmes are usually devised and researched by the team/teachers and are for small groups of one or two classes of a specific age. The aim of the programmes is essentially educational, and uses theatre, drama in education and teaching techniques for educational purposes. \nThis work provides an educational aid, resource and stimulus for both teachers and pupils, but to do so it may vary from place to place, total participation sessions to performance and discussion. Theatre in Education can be considered as a method of work used by some companies all the time, and by others only occasionally. Many companies who use this method of work have, as their starting point, a strong left-wing or didactic approach to their subject matter, and they cannot be considered as mere tools of the education system. Rather, they act as outside questioners, looking at ideas and values in society.\n\nThese are the following characteristics of TIE\n\nTIE can create different kinds of productions:\n\nThe Role of Teacher \n\nAs an alternative to knowledge dissemination, memory-based teaching, Drama games and fun during lessons leads to better engagement. Instead of simply lecturing, the teacher in the TIE setting can become a conceptual artist who moulds knowledge, feelings, thoughts, sensations and experience into an active and activating educational process. This is not about an artist in a traditional way. It’s more a way of thinking, perception of the world and its needs in right - brained way as non-linear, practical, intuitive, and holistic. \nThe personality of a teacher influences the use of drama in lessons. According to Barucha, teacher types fall into four quadrants (see Figure 1). Barucha differentiates two dimensions depending on the teacher’s behaviour, perception, values and attitudes: the interactivity level and the level of logical/emphatic thinking. Both dimensions operate on a whole scale in between the extreme values. \nThe Role of Student\n\nIn this methodology the student need to understand that the role of the teacher changes. In TIE the student himself takes the initiative and responsibility. TIE demands much greater independence of thinking. In this process of structured learning, drama rehearsals require full dedication. Due to this and closer interpersonal interaction, the process can lead to more clashes compared to traditional class teaching. There are several issues apart from memory training, courage to act, and the ability to emerge from the shell that each of us adopts at work or at school, there can be language difficulties, stage fright, newness in being expected to adopt a role, confidence etc.\n\nSummarizing the main requirements and preconditions as follows: -\n\nThis are some theatre games.\n\n1) Alphabet conversation\n\nHaving a group of student, start a conversation one by one where each sentence begins with the next letter of the alphabet. Giving a situation before you begin will help the student. Students can also use sounds to start a sentence, for example “Mmmm” or “tut-tut”. This game can be played in pairs or small groups. Here is an example:\nA: Anyone seen my cat?\n\nB: Black one, with funny eyes?\n\nA: Can’t say I remember.\n\nB: Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what it looks like?\n\nA: Every cat looks the same to me.\n\nB: Fortunately, I found one yesterday\n\nA: Gee, that’s great…\n\n\n2) People poems\n\nDivide the class into small group of four or five. To each group give a topic/word –e.g. “Time”. Now each person in an each group as to write down or remembers some words associated with the theme, e.g.- slow, fast, boredom, quickly and centuries. Now every group has to make an object out of the members, linked to the theme (such as a clock). Ideally the group object should move. \nNext every group has to bring the object to life and works out a way of bringing in some or all of their words-linked to their movements. And at the end they show the resulting people poem to the rest of the class, who can try and guess the theme.\nThemes can include: \n\nThese are some benefits of TIE\n\n\n"}
