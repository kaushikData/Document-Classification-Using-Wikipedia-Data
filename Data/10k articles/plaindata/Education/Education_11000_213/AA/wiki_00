It is based in Manila, Philippines and currently networks 102 member institutions and schools in 16 countries. It also acts as an accreditation agency for theological education in the South East Asian region.\n\nATESEA publishes the \"Asia Journal of Theology\", provides accreditation services, operates the South East Asia Graduate School of Theology, and promotes faculty development, theological renewal and contextualization in the light of the \"Critical Asian Principle\", while coordinating regional planning in Christian theological education.\n\nATESEA has recently come up with their new 'Guidelines for Doing Theology in Asia'.\n\nATESEA is a full member of the World Conference of Associations of Theological Institutions (WOCATI) by which the association is networked with other regional associations and accreditation agencies for theological education worldwide like the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS), the American Theological Library Association (ATLA) and the Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College (BTESS) in India.\n\nThe aims of the ATESEA according to Section II of the association's constitution are as follows:\n\n\nATESEA was established as the Association of Theological Schools in South East Asia in 1957 in Singapore with 16 schools as founding members. The first full meeting was held in 1959 under the leadership of Benjamin I. Guansing of the Philippines and John R. Fleming was elected as the first executive director. The secretariat and offices of ATESEA was in Singapore from 1959 to 1974. In June 1974, ATESEA moved to Manila, Philippines when Emerito P. Nacpil was elected the executive director. It was again relocated to Singapore in 1981.\n\nIn 1981, the name of the association was changed to the current title and continued to expand its scope of operations to include the conducting of theological study institutes in disciplines of the theological spectrum such as the improvement of the management and administration of schools, the search for a new spirituality in Christian formation, the encouragement of the experiments in innovative or alternative patterns of theological education, the promotion of closer relationship between seminary and church, the search for a more adequate understanding of excellence in theological education and the development of Asian perspective and insights in Christian theology. It has also facilitated faculty exchange among its member schools and institutions.\n\nIn 1998, the secretariat and offices was again relocated to Manila; it has remained there to date.\n\nATESEA runs an Accreditation Commission which provides accreditation for tertiary institutes of theology and seminaries. The commission is composed of the Executive Committee of ATESEA plus two people elected by the association, normally chosen from the Graduated School Senate.\n\nAccreditation by ATESEA does not necessarily mean that the member institutions are granted accreditation by the education regulatory bodies of the countries where the institutions are. Many countries in the South East Asian region do not have a formal accreditation process for Christian theological education. In countries where such processes exist like Australia and Indonesia, ATESEA accredited institutions have also been accredited by the respective national and regional accreditation agencies.\n\nATESEA has a two-tier membership: regular and affiliate. The former is open to institutions engaged in the provision of training for the Christian ministry in South East Asia and the latter open to institutions involved in theological education in South East Asia, such as research and study centers, lay training institutes, and Theological Education by Extension centers.\n\nATESEA has 102 member institutions in Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nA full list of ATESEA's member institutions can be found at Member Institutions ATESEA's website.\n\n\n\n"}

Since its foundation in 1967 it has been attended by over 100,000 students. The legal head office is located at La Maddalena and the base of operations is situated on the island of Caprera, on the Maddalena archipelago. CVC is a non-profit organisation and a member of the ISSA (International Sailing School Association).\n\nThe school was founded in 1967 based upon the ideas of Vittorio di Sambuy and Marco Notarbartolo di Sciara, who was, at the time, president of Milan’s section of the Italian Navy League. The two authors of the idea were granted the land where the center of the Admiral Alessandro Michelagnoli, at the time Commander in Chief of the Italian Navy, was built. Franco Brambilla, president of the Touring Club Italiano, joined the association guaranteeing the organizational and administrative support of the Touring Club. Finally, Guido Colnaghi, who represented the French association École des Glénans in Italy, shaped the teaching spirit and approach that distinguishes the character of the CVC. The two founding members, Milan’s section of the Italian Navy League and the Touring Club, were then joined by the Students Association in 1975.\n\nThe Centro Velico Caprera, school of sea and sailing, has as its main objective the knowledge and education of the sail training’s basis through practice and experimentation to ensure a safe growth. Another goal is to transmit the fundamentals of maritime consciousness, essential for later offshore sailing. For this reason, life’s organization both on base and on the boats is modeled to transmit to the students the life of a crew. There are three levels of courses:\n\n\nThe CVC is located in the southwest part of the island of Caprera, between Punta Coda and the gulf of Porto Palma, and is composed of 3 separate bases. On the side of Punta Coda, the beginner level base consists of military buildings used as dormitories, classrooms, and a canteen. The second base is at the foot of the Fico Mountain, and hosts the students of the 2nd level. The third base, located on the western end of Porto Palma, hosts all students taking courses on cabin cruisers. Furthermore, the CVC staff operates a carpentry, a mechanical workshop and a sail repairing facility.\n\nA typical day at CVC is planned on a tight schedule that all members of the community must respect. Every day students alternate between practical and theoretical lessons, with meals in between. Once a week every student gives his contribute to the school by cleaning the base and helping the cook and the Chief of Operations, who is in charge of the kitchen.\n\nThe instructors at CVC are all volunteers who are chosen among the school’s best students.

It was founded in 1989 and named after Chiang Ching-kuo, leader of the Republic of China from 1972 to 1988. The foundation also has a regional office in McLean, Virginia in the United States.\n\nThe Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange was founded in 1989 by officials of the Kuomintang, the ruling party of the Republic of China. The stated motivation for the foundation stems from professors of Chinese descent at American universities becoming concerned about the decline of programs of Chinese studies at colleges and universities overseas, and their desire to reverse this situation. Chiang Ching-kuo is said to have favored creation of the foundation, and it was created as a living memorial to him. The foundation was patterned after the Fulbright Program in the United States.\n\nThe foundation's original endowment was US$86 million, consisting of $53 million from the Republic of China Ministry of Education and $33 million from private donors. The foundation then operates using the interest generated from this endowment, which as of 2004 was $3.4 million for a year. The foundation is governed by a board, consisting of prominent government officials, academics, people in industry, and assorted other citizens. As of 2011, the board had 19 members; its chair was Kao-wen Mao, and notable members included former Taiwan Province governor James Soong, Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, former Chinese University of Hong Kong Vice-Chancellor Lawrence Lau, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Frederick F. Chien. The Ministry of Education continues to have a strong voice in foundation decisions.\n\nThe foundation's principal goals are to foster the overseas study of Chinese culture and society, to support international scholarly exchange, to promote widespread attention to and understanding of Taiwan, and to promote academic dialogue on global issues.\nThe foundation organizes its grants by four geographical areas: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and domestic (Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao); historically, most of its activity has been with those in the United States.\n\nIn its first seven years of operation, the foundation spent $23 million on American scholarship. By 2001, many Western academics who were specialists in China were getting research funds from the foundation. By 2004, the foundation had supported nearly 2,000 projects overall.\n\nThe Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation provides research grants, fellowship grants, grants for conferences, seminars, and workshops, publication subsidies, doctoral fellowships (including for Taiwanese students abroad), and travel grants and visiting fellowships. In some cases, research that focuses on Taiwan's recent social, cultural, economic, or political development is encouraged, as are collaborative projects with scholars in Taiwan.\n\nGrants from the foundation have sometimes proven controversial. In 1996, the University of California, Berkeley was offered $3 million for a new center to study ancient Chinese cultures, but the offer was dependent upon the university commemorating both the foundation and Chiang Ching-kuo. This brought about opposition to the proposed funding by students and scholars who objected to the history of political repression during the earlier years of Chiang's regime, who thought it would damage Berkeley's reputation and put Berkeley under undue control by the foundation, and who feared it would harm the university's research and exchange student dealings with the People's Republic of China. The director of the US office of the foundation said in response that political aspects are not a factor in the foundation's funding decisions. The university decided to name the program, but not the center, after Chiang and the foundation, causing the foundation to suspend the offer.\n\nIn the end, two centers for Sinological research were set up: The Chiang Ching-kuo International Sinological Center at Charles University (CCK-ISC) was established in 1997 at Charles University in Prague, and the Chiang Ching-kuo Center for Chinese Cultural and Institutional History was established in 1999 in conjunction with the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University in New York.\n\nPolitical complexities have also extended to scholars working in the People's Republic, who have worried that getting research funds from the foundation or other sources in Taiwan would lead to them being suspected as spying for or otherwise colluding with Taiwan.\n\n\n"}

Negotiations between China and Germany started in 1994, and in the following year the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) was assigned the realization of this project.\n\nThe Shanghai \"Chinesisch-Deutsches Hochschulkolleg\" or CDHK, as the college for postgraduate studies is called for short, was finally opened in February 1998. On October 7, 2002, the college moved into new modern building in Chifeng Lu.\n\nAs an institute at Tongji University, the CDHK today offers bilingual master studies in the following fields:\n\nAccording to German educational standards, the curriculum is oriented towards broad knowledge and practical experience. Thus, the CDHK is able to train junior staff with both leadership qualities and experience in two cultures for the benefit of Chinese and German companies in China.\n\nThe postgraduate studies at CDHK take three years and start with intensive German language training in the first semester. From the second to the third semester students proceed their language studies in addition to their respective field studies and will attend a language test. As an end of the German language training course, all the students are obliged to take a middle-level German test and received a German language certificate issued by German College of Tongji University.\n\nThe students attend classes of Chinese professors who themselves have studied in Germany for a considerable time or finished their PhD at a German university. Moreover, each semester CDHK invites German tutors for one or two weeks to hold German language lectures in their respective fields. Basically all the courses are co-conducted by Chinese and German Professors.\n\nIn the fourth semester students have the chance to go to Germany for an internship in a company and/or study at one of its partner universities. In the later case, students must have passed TestDAF, a German language test, with at least a score of 16(on a 20 scale). In electro technics there even is the chance to prepare for an international final degree at the Technical University of Munich, the so-called \"double master\" program. In the year of 2008, this \"double master \" program was extended to the students of mechanical engineering with the partner university of Ruhr-University Bochum This program is sponsored partially by DAAD. Several graduates already work on their PhD either in Germany or China.\n\nThe Chinese-German College for Postgraduate Studies is sponsored by Tongji-University and the DAAD as well as by numerous companies that have among others donated eighteen chairs and support the project by presentation, visits and contacts. It is the first educational joint-venture of this dimension, enjoying the support of both governments, and has the advantage of the close cooperation with its entrepreneurial sponsors.\n\n\n"}

We can, however, seek to obtain some form of consensus, with others, of what is real. We can use this consensus as a pragmatic guide, either on the assumption that it seems to approximate some kind of valid reality, or simply because it is more \"practical\" than perceived alternatives. Consensus reality therefore refers to the agreed-upon concepts of reality which people in the world, or a culture or group, believe are real (or treat as real), usually based upon their common experiences as they believe them to be; anyone who does not agree with these is sometimes stated to be \"in effect... living in a different world.\"\n\nThroughout history this has also raised a social question as to the effects of a society in which all individuals do not agree upon the same reality.\n\nChildren have sometimes been described or viewed as \"inexperience[d] with consensus reality,\" though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.\n\nIn considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the realist approach, in which there is a single, objective, overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the perceptions of any given individual, and the idealistic approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own \"experience\" of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.\n\nConsensus reality may be understood by studying socially constructed reality, a subject within the sociology of knowledge. (Read page three of \"The Social Construction of Reality\" by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann.)\n\nConsider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of science alone, for explaining life and the universe.\n\nIn societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality, while the religious worldview would remain the non-consensus (or alternative) reality in a predominantly secular society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone.\n\nIn this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different world views, with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as science, slavery, and human sacrifice may differ in direct consequence because of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.\n\nSome idealists (subjective idealists) hold the view that there isn't one particular way things are, but rather that each person's personal reality is unique. Such idealists have the world view which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.\n\nMaterialists may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one reality. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered delusional.\n\nThe connotation of the term \"consensus reality\" is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by idealist, surrealist and other anti-realist theorists opposing or hostile to this \"reality,\" with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase \"consensus reality\" may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.\n\nSingers, painters, writers, theorists and other individuals employing a number of means of action have attempted to oppose or undermine consensus reality while others have declared that they are \"ignoring\" it. For example, Salvador Dalí intended by his paranoiac-critical method to \"systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality\".\n"}

Traditionally, a student committee is created within the school and would organize the event in collaboration with select teachers, though debs planning companies have in recent years been responsible for the majority of the work.\n\nDebs usually take place after the Leaving Certificate exam is over and some even after the Leaving Certificate results are released. Each secondary school would host their own ball. Most schools would have their debs in Autumn but some choose to begin their final year of school with the debs. Some schools even have a smaller ball before the debs, known as the \"pre-debs\" which would be held in January/February or even as late as May.\n\nStudents may worry about being invited or finding a date but many attend with friends or in a group, not worrying about the dating aspect. It is not uncommon for students to not go with their boyfriend/girlfriend and instead go with a friend. Whether the female asks the male, or vice versa, is irrelevant. Men are usually attired in dinner jackets with bow ties and women usually wear formal gowns or dresses adorned with a corsage given to them by their date, formal attire is not required for entrance it is tradition to wear suits or dresses. It is customary for men to purchase an orchid or a bouquet of flowers or a box of chocolates to give to their dates. \n\nThe debs is usually held at a hotel or other large function room. The debs usually, though not always, is a formal dinner, followed by music consisting of pop, dance, rock music and even traditional Irish music. Alcohol is almost always served. Traditionally there is a photographer present, who will take individual shots of each couple, several throughout the night, the dancing and whatever speeches occur. It is not uncommon for the event to last all night, hence attendees do not to return home until the following morning, often going for breakfast together.

{"id": "24449588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24449588", "title": "Dissenting academies", "text": "Dissenting academies\n\nThe dissenting academies were schools, colleges and seminaries (often institutions with aspects of all three) run by English Dissenters, that is, those who did not conform to the Church of England. They formed a significant part of England’s educational systems from the mid-seventeenth to nineteenth centuries.\n\nAfter the Uniformity Act 1662, for about two centuries, it was difficult for any but practising members of the Church of England to gain degrees from the old English universities, at Cambridge and Oxford. The University of Oxford, in particular, required – until the Oxford University Act 1854 – a religious test on admission that was comparable to that for joining the Church. The situation at the University of Cambridge was that a statutory test was required to take a bachelor's degree.\n\nEnglish Dissenters in this context were Nonconformist Protestants who could not in good conscience subscribe (i.e. conform) to the beliefs of the Church of England. As they were debarred from taking degrees in the only two English universities, many of them attended the dissenting academies. If they could afford it, they completed their education at the universities of Leyden, Utrecht, Glasgow or Edinburgh, the last, particularly, those who were studying medicine or law. Many students attending Utrecht were supported by the Presbyterian Fund.\n\nWhile the religious reasons mattered most, the geography of university education also was a factor. The plans for a Durham College of Oliver Cromwell provided an attempt to break the educational monopoly of Oxbridge, and while it failed because of the political change in 1660, the founder of Rathmell Academy was Richard Frankland, who may have been involved in the Durham College project. Almost as soon as dissenting academies began to appear, Frankland was backed by those who wished to see an independent university-standard education available in the north of England.\n\nTutors in the academies were initially drawn from the ejected ministers of 1662, who had left the Church of England after the passing of the Uniformity Act, and many of whom had English university degrees. After that generation, some tutors did not have those academic credentials to support their reputations, although in many cases other universities, particularly the Scottish institutions that were sympathetic to their Presbyterian views, awarded them honorary doctorates.\n\nThere were several sources of funding. Some of these funds gave their trustees the option of sending young men either to dissenting academies, or to universities abroad. An academy, to attract such students, had to offer a course of instruction approved of by the Board for its purposes. Funding might be central or local, and there could be doctrinal as well as practical reasons why a given academy was sent students with financial support.\n\nThe Common Fund Board, founded in 1689, gave scholarships to Presbyterian and Congregational candidates for the ministry; its successor, the Presbyterian Fund Board, continued into the middle of the nineteenth century. An education at a dissenting academy was not the only option for the Fund Board, since a candidate could also be sponsored at a Scottish university, or elsewhere. A gap opened up between the Presbyterians and Congregationalists, as the Independents started to be called, for reasons of doctrine.\n\nThe Independent or Congregational Fund Board was established in 1695 to assist poor ministers, and to give young men who had already received a classical education, the theological and other training preparatory to the Christian ministry. An early sign of the division between Presbyterians and Independents was the fate of the Rathmell Academy after the death of Frankland in 1698: it migrated to Manchester under John Chorlton, while another academy under Timothy Jollie, an Independent, operated at Attercliffe (one of the locations of Frankland's migratory academy) from the 1690s onwards.\n\nIn 1730, the King's Head Society was founded by laymen in London (after the pub behind the Royal Exchange at which they met) who were dissatisfied with the management of the Congregational Fund Board. The chief point of objection was the Academies' rule which limited students to those who had already passed through a classical training, including the demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts. The King's Head Society resolved to found an academy where young men without a general classical education would receive it during their first two years and could then proceed to the usual classical-theological course.\n\nThe Coward Trust from 1743 funded Daventry Academy and a London academy under David Jennings, but was distinct from the ordinary Congregational funding.\n\nThe letter of the law could make the running of a dissenting academy difficult or impossible. In the general framework according to which schools must be licensed by the bishop, and ministers (who made up most of the teaching staff) could be in legal trouble for the activities that held together their congregations, some academies simply shut down. For a short period (1714 to 1719) the Schism Act was in force, and aimed precisely to do that; but the troubles of the academies were mostly before this legislation.\n\nProceedings in ecclesiastical courts were quite common in the 17th century, for example in the case of the tutor Benjamin Robinson. The degree of religious toleration in the later half of the seventeenth century varied considerably according to laws passed by Parliament, and also in line with the public mood. Some academies, such as that of John Shuttlewood, operated in remote areas of the countryside, and some tutors were required to leave towns where they had previously performed their ministry, for example under the Five Mile Act. The Toleration Act of 1689 under the reign of William III and Mary II did not mention the dissenters' academies, and proceedings continued against dissenting tutors throughout the 1690s. There were also cases of actions against dissenting grammar schools, for example the proceedings against Isaac Gilling in the 1710s. In 1723 the \"regium donum\", initially a grant to support Irish Presbyterians, became a national subsidy, and subsequently dissenting academies were more generally accepted.\n\nSeveral early academies became associated with particular theological positions. Richard Frankland of Rathmell Academy and Timothy Jollie of Attercliffe, founders of two of the most celebrated early academies, opposed any departure from Calvinist theology. It was rumoured that Jollie even forbade mathematics ‘as tending to scepticism and infidelity', although several of his students later became extremely proficient in the mathematics. Some academies were more broadminded in their teaching methodology, and in their attitudes towards possible methods of church governance. Indeed, several students at dissenting academies later became Anglicans. The dissenters themselves argued that their academies had stricter discipline than the universities, and were perceived by many to have promoted a more contemporary curriculum based on the practical sciences and modern history. In some of the larger academies French and High Dutch (German) were taught. The tutors and the students of the dissenting academies contributed in fundamental ways to the development of ideas, notably in the fields of theology, philosophy, literature, and science.\n\nThese academies were funded partly by fees for tuition and lodging, as many of them were run in large houses as boarding establishments. They were also funded by philanthropic Dissenters such as William Coward (1647–1738), whose \"will set up a trust fund ‘for the education and training up of young men … to qualify them for the ministry of the gospel among the Protestant Dissenters’, thus continuing the financial support he had given to such students in his lifetime\". Sometimes this funding was organised along the lines of subscribers.\n\nThe Independent or Congregational Fund Board was established in 1695 (i) to assist poor ministers, (2) to give young men who had already received a classical education, the theological and other training preparatory to the Christian ministry.\n\nIn 1730, the King's Head Society was founded by laymen in London who were dissatisfied with the management of the Fund Academies. The chief point of objection was the Fund Academies rule which limited its students to those who had already passed through a classical training. The founder of the King's Head Society resolved to found an academy with a six years' course, where young men, without a general classical education, would receive it during the first two years and could then proceed to the usual classical-theological course.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the academies’ original purpose to provide a higher education was largely superseded by the founding of the University of London and the provincial universities, which were open to dissenters, and by the reform of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nNewington Green, in those days a village north of London, had several academies. Charles Morton (1626–1698), the educator and minister who ended his career as vice-president of Harvard College, ran an influential academy; the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" judges Morton's \"probably the most impressive of the dissenting academies [prior to 1685], enrolling as many as fifty pupils at a time\". The \"ODNB\" goes on to describe its advanced and varied curriculum (religion, classics, history, geography, mathematics, natural science, politics, and modern languages) and a well-equipped laboratory, and even \"a bowling green for recreation\". Lectures were given in English, not Latin, and Daniel Defoe, one of Morton's students, praised its attention to the mother tongue. Samuel Wesley the elder, a contemporary of Defoe's, described his teacher \"as universal in his learning\", although he also attacked the academy on uncertain grounds for promoting king-killing doctrines. Rev. James Burgh, author of \"The Dignity of Human Nature\" and \"Thoughts on Education\", opened his dissenting academy there in 1750. (His widow acted as a \"fairy godmother\" in helping the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft move her fledgling boarding school for girls from Islington to the Green in 1784, finding her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it.) Anna Laetitia Barbauld, so closely associated with other leading dissenting academies, chose to spend the latter third of her life in Newington Green.\n\nHomerton College, Cambridge started life as the dissenting academy Independent College, Homerton, then another village north of London.\n\nThe Tewkesbury Academy, set up by Samuel Jones, had as its students both dissenters such as Samuel Chandler and those who became significant establishment figures such as Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Secker and Joseph Butler.\n\nSheriffhales Academy, Shropshire (1663–1697) under the Rev. John Woodhouse.\n\nRev. Philip Doddridge D.D. was chosen in 1723 to conduct the academy being newly established at Market Harborough. It moved many times, and was known as Northampton Academy, Doddridge died in 1751 and the academy continued. and is probably best known as Daventry Academy, which Joseph Priestley attended. The academy ended up in London under the name of Coward College, as it was largely supported by the bequest of William Coward who died 1738. The college was one of three that amalgamated in 1850 into New College London. Hugh Farmer was educated at this college in its earlier days.\n\nShrewsbury Academy was started by James Owen in 1702. Owen died 1706 and his place was filled by Samuel Benion, M.D. The academy continued to until Benion's death in 1708.\n\nWarrington Academy, known as “the Athens of the North” for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere, led eventually, via Manchester and York, to Harris Manchester College, Oxford. In 1757 the Rev. John Seddon, a young minister in Warrington, established the academy. Among the tutors were Joseph Priestley (1761–67) and Johann Reinhold Forster, a German scholar and naturalist. Forster went with Captain Cook in his second voyage round the world.\n\nRathmell Academy, which had half a dozen homes, was set up by Richard Frankland in 1670. The school moved to Attercliffe, a suburb of Sheffield, Yorkshire, leaving it at the end of July 1689, in consequence of the death of his favourite son, and returning to Rathmell. His pupil Timothy Jollie, independent minister at Sheffield, began Attercliffe Academy, on a more restricted principle than Frankland's, apparently excluding mathematics \"as tending to scepticism\".\n\n\n"}

Until 1947, only elementary schools were compulsory. Immediately before and during World War II, state education was used as a propaganda tool by the Japanese fascist government.\n\nToday virtually all elementary education takes place in public schools. Tuition to these schools is free, although families have to pay for school lunches, supplies, and non-school expenses such as extra books or lessons.\n\nLess than 1% of the schools are private, partly because of the latter's expense. Some private elementary schools are prestigious, and they serve as a first step to higher-level private schools with which they are affiliated and thence to a university. Competition to enter some of these \"ladder schools\" is quite intense.\n\nElementary school classes are large, typically between thirty and forty students each. Students are usually organized into small work groups, which have both academic and disciplinary functions.\n\nThe ministry's Course of Study for Elementary Schools is composed of a wide variety of subjects both academic and nonacademic.\n\nAcademic subjects include Japanese language, social studies, arithmetic, and science. Japanese language is an emphasized subject due to the complexity of the written language and the diversity of its spoken forms in formal speech to seniors (keigo). The English Language is taught at some schools especially in the higher grades; it is now mandatory at 5th and 6th grade from 2011, as in 2002 TOEFL scores in Japan were the worst in Asia after North Korea.\n\nNonacademic subjects taught include art (including Japanese calligraphy) and handicrafts, music, haiku or Japanese traditional poetry, homemaking, physical education, and moral education. Children also take part in \"special activities,\" scheduled time each week to take care of class business, plan for field trips and ceremonies, and similar tasks.\n\n\"Information technology is increasingly being used to enhance education, and most schools have access to the Internet.\" There is a system of educational television and radio, and almost all elementary schools use programs prepared by the School Education Division of Japan's ex Broadcasting Corporation (Nippon Hoso Kyokai—NHK).\n\nBoth Japanese elementary and middle schools begin around 7:50 AM, with lessons starting at 8:30 AM. Japanese schools do not have school buses, both because of the small size of most school districts and because of the availability of public transportation.\n\nThe first fifteen minutes of each day is set aside for either a schoolwide assembly (on Monday mornings) or attendance and announcements in homeroom.\n\nClasses are between 40 and 45 minutes each, with a break of 5 to 10 minutes in-between.\n\nAfter four morning classes, at about 12:30 PM, students are sent to pick up their homeroom's lunches from the school kitchens. Lunches are typically served in bento boxes, with small portions of a variety of freshly prepared foods.\n\nThese include \"a whole range of meats, fishes, vegetables, and sea plants. A typical meal consists of stew or curry, boiled vegetables, a sandwich, and salad. Milk is served with each meal. Usually, there is also dessert, such as gelatin, ice cream, and fruit.\"\n\nBecause there are relatively few cafeterias in elementary schools, meals are taken in the classroom with the teacher, providing another informal opportunity for teaching nutrition, health, good eating habits and social behavior. All students eat the same lunch, and are assigned to shifts for serving lunch to their homeroom. Lunch lasts about 40 minutes.\n\nIn some lower elementary school, classes are over after lunch and children are allowed to go home. Upper elementary students in those schools have one more class after lunch. However, other schools have a 5 or 6 classes per day, with only the youngest students not having a sixth period. Some schools allow for a 20-minute recess in-between, which is sometimes used for cleaning the classrooms: sweeping, mopping, throwing away trash, etc. Students then usually leave school around three o'clock.\n\nAfter-school clubs like sports and English club are offered at elementary schools, but unlike middle and high school clubs these usually meet only once a week.\n\nJapanese elementary schooling is seen as effective, but not without some problems, notably increasing absenteeism and school refusal and a troublesome amount of bullying (77,630 reported cases in 2010 throughout the school system) In addition, special provision for the young children returning to Japan from long periods spent overseas is an issue. The government also is concerned with the education of Japanese children residing abroad. However, in most urban centers there are at least private international schools which can accommodate such returnees.\n\nA new course of study was established in 1989, partly as a result of the education reform movement of the 1980s and partly because of ongoing curriculum review. Important changes scheduled were an increased number of hours devoted to Japanese language, the replacement of the social sciences course with a daily life course- -instruction for children on proper interaction with the society and environment around them—and an increased emphasis on moral education. New emphasis also was to be given in the curriculum to the national flag and the Japanese national anthem. The ministry suggested that the flag be flown and the national anthem sung at important school ceremonies. Because neither the flag nor the anthem had been legally designated as national symbols, and because of the nationalistic wartime associations the two had in the minds of some citizens, this suggestion was greeted with opposition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9506106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9506106", "title": "European History Network", "text": "European History Network\n\nThe European History Network has run a number of projects under the banner of the Creating Links and Overviews for a New History Agenda (CLIOH) since 1988, including CLIOH, CLIOHnet and CLIOHnet2. Both CLIOHRES and CLIOH-WORLD are currently in operation as of December 2011. It was initially founded as the ECTS History Network, a pilot project of the ECTS.\n\nCLIOH-WORLD is an award-winning International Academic Erasmus Network. It is supported by the European Commission, DG Education and Culture, under the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013, for the period October 2008 to September 2011. It aims to increase critical understanding—on the part of European students and citizens in general—of Europe’s past, present and future and its role in the wider world. It offers a vision of an inclusive European citizenship and produces free educational materials and reflections for learners of all ages.\n\nIt builds on the efforts of previous European History Network projects (CLIOH, CLIOHnet, CLIOHnet2, CLIOHRES) to improve the understanding of national histories as they are studied, taught and learned in European universities. These projects have linked national historical narratives, and prepared tools and materials to structure history programs. These help make learners aware of how national historical viewpoints have been created, and how and why they may contrast with the beliefs and understandings about history in neighboring countries.\n\nCLIOH-WORLD is using its consolidated experience and methodology to develop the learning and teaching of European Union history, including European integration and expansion, and to encourage awareness and understanding of the links between European history and the histories of other continents. CLIOH-WORLD has five working groups:\n\nWhy is there a need for the History of EU and European Integration?\n\nHistory is an important tool not only for increasing knowledge of the human past, but also for enhancing the awareness and the identity of human social and political communities, of which the European Union is one. In order to achieve a better understanding of what the European Union is and what it means to be a European citizen it is essential to improve the knowledge and understanding of both the history of the European integration process and the history of the European Union itself. Universities are an important place where students can acquire such essential knowledge and awareness in a mature way.\n\nEuropean Union History is not the same as the History of European Integration and vice versa: the two terms cover different aspects of European History. The main focus of the History of the European Union is on the history of a very dense kind of European Integration, centred on institutionalised forms of integration and on the member states of the European Union.\n\nOn the contrary, the History of European Integration also covers aspects of integration that go beyond the European Union. Moreover, to reach a mature comprehension of the complex political, social, economic and juridical framework in which the EU has been conceived and built, it is important to broaden our view back in history before 1945 and World War II. One of the most obvious tools of analysis that history offers is ‘historical perspective’, the diachronic dimension that provides important insights into present-day phenomena. The understanding of long term aspects, events and processes, is also vital in building a critically aware European citizenship.\n\nThe task of the Working Group is to increase both knowledge and understanding of the European integration process and the history of the European Union. In order to reach such important goals the group has decided to map the current situation and to produce and disseminate Guidelines and Reference points for Higher Education programmes in Europe. Our findings are offered freely as information, ideas and recommendations. The tools produced by the group can be adopted by or may simply inspire those who face the need to (re)design history programmes.\n\nThe Role of History of EU and European Integration on European Universities: the Mapping Results\n\nThe Working Group undertook an extensive survey of the current state of European Union and European Integration History learning and teaching, through detailed mapping of selected countries (Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK), and supplemented this with further sample-based mapping of other countries in Europe (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Malta, Romania) and beyond Europe (Japan). On this basis the Group feels confident that it has produced a reasonably representative basis on which to assess the field.\n\nAlthough the mapping covered a broad and diverse range of countries and institutions, a number of common points were evident. In particular, it was striking that there is very little learning/teaching specifically dedicated to the history of the European Union or European integration. Courses devoted to these subjects are overwhelmingly oriented towards political science, legal or linguistic studies. Where there was evidence of a historical approach to the subject it tended to be framed within either national histories (the relations between one state and the rest of Europe) or included in general histories of Europe, wherein the history of the EU and of European integration was treated either as a discrete part of the whole or implicitly (rather than explicitly) embedded in studies of post-1945 west European political and economic development.\n\nThe difficulty of identifying historical approaches to the subject underlined the problems of defining what that history is, however. There are a number of issues that make a neat definition of European Union history and the history of European integration problematic. These are principally chronological and thematic. If we seek to add a historical dimension to existing institutional studies of the European Union and of European integration, for example, questions arise about cultural and historical connections (what might be termed ‘European-ness’) which in turn open up problems of periodisation (specifically, whether an exclusively post-1945 focus is adequate, but if not how should the chronological parameters be defined?).\n\nThe importance of history in programmes of European Studies is in fact not very pronounced, although history is often mentioned in the programme descriptions. Even where European Union history is reasonably well covered, it is usually as one optional module, a fact which raises issues about coherence, or the importance of thinking about what that History is. Although dealing with “Europe” is quite popular in European academic institutions and many universities and departments offer courses on “European history” or the history of European regions, an explicit focus on European History or the history of European integration is not very widespread.\n\n“European history” is often seen as history that happened in Europe or parts of it, not in a comparative way that contrasts or connects different structures and addresses the process of European integration. With these problems and questions in mind, it was possible to return to the original mapping results with a view to identifying ‘interesting’ practice that might illuminate some of these issues and how they had been addressed, and allow the Group to move towards a more meaningful interpretation of what constitutes European Union history and the history of European integration. It is these results that are to be used to inform the development of guidelines framed within the language and methodology of Tuning.\n\nWhat can we learn from examples of good and interesting practice?\n\nExamples of good and interesting practice can be found in all of the countries that were mapped in detail. These examples can be found on several levels.\n1.) On the level of programmes it is seen as good practice if courses on European Union history and the history of European integration are a – preferably compulsory – part of programmes of European studies or European history.\n\n2.) Courses are seen as good and interesting practice if they cover European Union history and history of European integration in a way that goes beyond an institutional history of the European Union and its organisations. Some selected examples will illustrate these examples of good and interesting practice. At the beginning of the Masters programme “Sociology – European societies“ (Freie Universität Berlin [DE]) there is a module that deals with “the process of political integration in Europe and the development of European societies after 1945”.\n\nThe link between European integration and the development of societies broadens the horizon of the history of European integration. Critical views on the process of integration are also presented in a lecture series forming part of the Master of European Studies (MES) offered by the Europa-Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt on Oder (DE). What is interesting in this example is also the interior multi-disciplinary approach, also used in other courses such as “Interdisciplinary Analysis of EU“ (in the “Integrated Studies of Europe” Programme, Universität Bremen [DE] ).\n\nHere topics such as cultural pluralism and “European identity” or the transformation of the welfare state and “social Europe” are dealt with. The latter topic is the main focus of the Master in European Union Studies offered at Paris-Lodron Universität, Salzburg (AT). Here, courses on social and economic history in the longue durée (18th – 21st centuries) and courses that put EU integration in a pan-European and global framework can be seen as examples of good practice. That is also the case in a course on “Transnational History” at St Andrews (UK) that deals with the interconnections between European societies and non-European regions from the 18th century. That the history of integration after 1945 is very much affected by historical events that happened before 1945 is dealt with in a course on “European History since 1945” (University College, University of London [UK])\n\nThere particular attention is paid to the impact of experiences and memories of war, occupation, resistance and the holocaust in the period after 1945. Also the programme in European Studies (M.E.S.) at the University of Vienna, Austria, offers compulsory courses on “Plans for Europe in a historical context before 1945” and “Basics of European integration politics on a historical foundation”. A comparative and transnational approach to the idea of Europe in a long durée perspective is pursued in the second cycle programme in “European Historical Studies” at the University of Évora (Portugal).\n\nEmphasis on the above-mentioned aspect of “European-ness” can be seen in several courses, such as “Culture and Identities in a Contested Continent” (Open University, UK). Here, Europe is defined as a contested and a dynamic space, rather than as a fixed geographical entity. Ideas and concepts of Europe are also part of the programmes on the European Union and European integration at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) that are mainly taught from a historical perspective.\n\nThe Faculty of Humanities (Letters) of the University of Coimbra emerges as an example of interesting practice due to the strong presence of the subject across a range of scopes and levels: from a single course unit on EU history compulsory for history students to first and second cycle programmes on European Studies where History is one of the five major fields of research. It can be considered good practice to offer joint studies that stress a broad transnational perspective. The University of Coimbra is – as one example among many – a member of a network of Universities that, with the support of the European Commission, organises a Master in European Studies: “The Process of Building Europe“.\n\nGood practice in EU and European Integration history\n\nAs the group mapped the situation and took a deeper look at examples of good and interesting practice, several factors emerged that – by integrating historical approaches – are useful for improving learning and teaching of European Union and European integration history:\n\n\nWhat should we know, understand and be able to do? Key Competences in EU-history and the History of European Integration\n\nAccording to the Tuning Educational Structures in Europe project, the objective of single course modules and degree programmes is to develop “competences”, in the broadest sense, in the learner. In substance the central element in organising the learning process is what the person involved will know, understand and be able to do at the end of it.\n\nAttitude too, in this case the historical mind-set or approach, is fundamental. Using the Tuning results of the History Subject Area Group as a starting point, we have examined in depth a number of key competences to be developed in studies in the area of the History of the European Union and European Integration. These may be exemplified by the following:\n\nA critical awareness of the relationship between current events in the EU and processes in the past and awareness of differences in historiographical outlooks in various periods and contexts\n\nLearners should be aware that EU history does not start with European integration in the form of the European communities after 1945 and that processes and structures going further back than 1945 strongly influence the present situation in the EU and the perception of the EU by its inhabitants. Learners should be aware that current events are often seen through an inherited perspective that is historically based in national and regional frameworks.\n\nKnowledge of the history of Europe is necessary to be able to interpret the different perceptions of current events in various European nations and regions. The knowledge that the learners should acquire in order to be aware of a relationship between current events and processes in the past is not primarily based on simple facts and dates but also on a knowledge of basic structures, the economic and social situation, demography, religion and political systems.\n\nLearners should also be able to identify the role of national or regional myths and interpret the often “invented“ significance of certain historical events in the context of the “identities” forged by European nations and their instrumental use and propagation in national/nationalistic historiography.\n\nAbility to place events and structures in historical perspective\n\nWhile a literal interpretation of European Union history – its institutional history / development since 1945 – can be reasonably easily defined and adds to legal and political science approaches, it is important that students also develop an appreciation of European history that predates World War II. Students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the complex and contested historical origins of the European Union and be able to justify their chosen definition of what constitutes EU history.\n\nThis will require them to understand the complementary and divergent natures of specific (e.g. local or national) histories within the EU (to examine the EU as [more than] the sum of its parts) as well as external perspectives on the EU. They should, therefore, demonstrate an understanding of the multiplicity of EU histories defined both chronologically and geographically. By examining the internal and external histories of the EU, students will be able to define “EU history” and its place in world history.\n\nAbility to define suitable research topics to contribute to historiographical knowledge and debate\n\nThe learner should be able to identify a number of significant studies relating to the history of European integration and cooperation during the 20th and the 21st centuries, including for example the concrete acts regarding it, the ideas surrounding it and the obstacles to it; to connect these works with the historical and political context in which they were produced; and to define the position of the author with respect to the historical, political, methodological and theoretical questions addressed.\n\nThe learner should be able, on this basis, to pose new questions for research having the potential to advance knowledge and debate, of a complexity appropriate to the level of study. The learner should be able to elaborate a research plan, organised around bibliography, documents and other sources (oral, written, material), as appropriate to address the questions posed and to revise (broaden, perfect) it in relation to his or her findings.\n\nAbility to identify and utilise appropriate sources of information for a research project\n\nThe European Union is sometimes compared to an onion (as a sphere) with concentric layers. This is because it has a horizontal synchronic geographical segmentation and a diachronic vertical periodization. Learners need to acquire competences that allow them to distinguish, compare and analyse different periods and spaces of European and European Union history. This will require competences in finding, classifying and using critically sources of information appropriate to the historical time period, geographical space or phenomena analysed.\n\nStudents should have at least a basic knowledge of the methodology of related disciplines and an ability to use this interdisciplinary methodological arsenal (e.g. International Relations theories, security studies, comparative political sociology and political science theory). Learners should be able to combine sources of different kinds (e.g. treaties, European Union law, the acquis communitaire [the body of EU law established until now], audiovisual materials, press releases, discourses, political programmes) and forms (written, electronic sources, official sites of EU administration), address them with critical awareness and analyse them in the appropriate historical, national, international or EU community context.\n\nInterdisciplinarity\n\nThe learner should be aware of and able to use tools of other human sciences as well as those of the various branches of historical research. This entails understanding that different kinds of history (e.g. economic, political, intellectual, cultural, social, institutional, legal, diplomatic, gender and religious history; history of international relations) as well as other human sciences (anthropology, literary criticism, history of language, art history, archaeology, law, sociology, philosophy) are indispensable tools for creating a critical awareness of the relationship between current events related to EU history and the processes of the past, a critical point in student competences.\n\nMoreover, the learner should understand and be critically aware that many of these different branches of history or human sciences may offer a specific focused viewpoint for analyzing the history of the EU in a more profound way. This kind of perspective allows the learner to perceive the differences between the various approaches to EU history and to European history in a broader sense, fostering critical awareness of the way many political discourses are founded on a specific historical view of Europe and its history.\n\nIn fact, many different approaches may be used, both in studying the European Union, and in studying European History, but not all of them are equally correct in terms of historical analysis and methodology: some are functional to particular political points of view and based on revisionist or nationalist perspectives. The history of the European Union is more than the sum of the histories of many different countries plus the history of the European Union itself. The EU, just like European citizenship and European identity, can be considered multi-layered or stratified. It is a complex system and requires a multi-faceted approach.\n\nMembers:\n\" Ewald Hiebl (University of Salzburg, AT), Luísa Trindade (University of Coimbra, PT) (co-leaders); David Brown (Strathclyde University, Glasgow, UK), Attila G.

History has embraced the opportunities presented by digitization and e- learning; it is now grasping the ever-greater possibilities offered and tackling the challenges that come with them. Indeed, history as discipline possesses the necessary tools, particularly in the vital area of source criticism, to evaluate and validate the vast amount of information made available through the new technologies.\n\nInterest in making archival materials and collections available has therefore been widely spread among historians. There are many university-based projects to digitise collections of archival materials, history journals are well represented in scholarly on- line source collections such as Project Muse and JSTOR, and discussion forums are a regular feature of history modules. The value of such developments for the scholar and student of history are evident.\n\nDigital collections reduce the need to travel to archives, search engines enable relevant material to be found more quickly, the availability of materials online reduces the pressure on paper resources in the library and enable more students to use the same materials simultaneously, and, lastly, e-learning tools provide the opportunity to extend the contact time between teachers and students, and amongst students themselves. E-learning also opens up apparently limitless possibilities for distance learning, allowing students across the globe to learn together online.\n\nThere are of course a number of problems associated with digitization and e-learning that have yet to be resolved or that must, at least, be acknowledged alongside the opportunities opened up. Digitization has proceeded unevenly, with, for example, a disproportionate representation of English-language materials, and it often reflects the same biases to be found in more traditional collections of materials: thus men tend to be more visible as historical protagonists than women.\n\nSearch engines can limit the unwary scholar to a narrow gaze, only identifying those documents which contain particular terms, while missing others with a more subtle relevance to a particular question, and plucking journal articles and primary materials from their context. In terms of e-learning, teachers and students have both expressed concerns about the extent to which online interaction compares favourably with a more traditional lesson in a classroom.\n\nThe importance of engaging with the digital world has been understood by all the CLIOH projects, not least the current CLIOHWORLD. CLIOHWORLD maintains a website to facilitate communication with its many members, and also to reach out to a much wider audience of scholars, teachers and students of history. Central to the CLIOHWORLD project is the dissemination of learning materials.\n\nThe project has already pioneered making available electronically resources for teaching which represent the latest scholarship on numerous key topics related to thematic and national histories. CLIOHWORLD’s current focus is on improving European citizens’ understanding of their own history, especially the history of integration, while placing Europe in a global context. It is not surprising that in order to achieve this, several of the working groups on the project have produced readers and online teaching guides dedicated to their particular fields, and that more are in preparation.\n\nTasks of the Working Group on Digitization\n\nThe tasks of the Working Group are threefold: to increase the visibility of CLIOHWORLD online; to map the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities; and to produce a report which explores the opportunities and challenges related to recent developments in digitization and e-learning.\n\n(1) Increasing visibility of CLIOHWORLD and associated projects\n\nOne of the wonders of the digital age has been the proliferation of resources online, but this presents the challenge of how to maintain a profile in what can often seem like a jungle of information. Our Working Group has made it a priority to raise the profile of CLIOHWORLD by giving it, and its sister organisation CLIOHRES, a presence on the ubiquitous Wikipedia and creating a CLIOHWORLD page on the increasingly popular social networking site Facebook.\n\nIt is particularly appropriate that CLIOHWORLD should be found on both these sites, for it ties in with the project’s aims to reach out across the continent, and now globally, to promote a critical understanding of European history, and to disseminate teaching materials to help learners of all ages study this topic. Links to the considerable resources on European history already available on the CLIOHWORLD website have been included on both pages. As mentioned above, many of the other Working Groups of CLIOHWORLD expect to produce online resources related to their particular themes and links to these can be added as appropriate to Wikipedia and Facebook.\n\n(2) Mapping the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities\n\nIt is easy to assume that engagement with digital and e-learning resources is universal and at the same level, yet many universities, and departments within them, are at different stages of taking advantage of the opportunities such resources offer. The Working Group is mapping the use of digital and e-learning resources in the universities of CLIOHWORLD partners using an online survey. We hope to identify what digital resources are being used by individuals and their colleagues to support their teaching; get a sense of the way in which e-learning tools are being utilised to facilitate and enhance student experience; and explore the extent to which such endeavours are supported at a departmental, faculty and institutional level.\n\nThe last issue addressed in the questionnaire is the challenges faced by teachers in making use of digital resources and e-learning tools. It is often assumed, for example, that young people are automatically computer literate and skilled in the use of search engines and digital resources, but it is often the case that they require training and support. Tied closely with this is our final question which addresses the issue of competencies.\n\nThe Tuning project has identified a number of key competencies which students of history can be expected to demonstrate. Three competences are related to the use of digital and e-learning resources: knowledge of and ability to use information retrieval tools, such as […] e-references; ability to use computer and internet resources for elaborating historical or related data; and ability to identify and utilise appropriately sources of information […] for research projects. We hope to identify the extent to which the competences listed are sufficient to enable a student to use digital materials and e-learning tools.\n\nOur initial results suggest that considerable numbers of university lecturers are making use of some digital resources and e-learning tools, but that not all resources available are used equally. Thus databases of sources are more popular than YouTube videos, and e-learning platforms are used more often than wikis and blogs. Many expressed concerns about the limited nature of training available to staff, which helps explain the disproportionate use of the least challenging digital and e-learning resources. The results from this questionnaire will feed into our third output which is a report.\n\n(3) Information gathering on digitization and e-learning\n\nThe field of digitization and e-learning is fast-moving and Working Group 3 aims to keep CLIOHWORLD abreast of those changes, as well as produce materials that can be used a guide for scholars, teachers and students. Thus, the group is working on a report which builds on and updates the research it conducted for CLIOHnet 2 and explores new developments in digitization and e-learning resources. Three main areas for further research have been identified:\n\n(a) Researching history\n\nDigital resources have transformed the experience of researching. Comparing the Gutenbergian book format and new digital formats increases our awareness of the opportunities offered and limitations imposed by both media and the experience of using them. As digital resources have increased, so too have digital research aids, like Zotero, and understanding their role and place in global historical research is vital.\n\nSuch tools are designed to facilitate the building of international virtual research groups and to enhance the individual researcher’s experience of online research. Questions remain, however, around the extent to which such tools improve scholarly enquiry. Do such tools represent a threat to the traditional historical skills associated with archival research? Similarly, the proliferation of online resources is changing the nature and role of archives and libraries, and it is useful to consider the consequences of these developments.\n\n(b) Publishing history\n\nJust as digitization is changing the nature of the archiving of primary materials, it is also influencing the publication of secondary materials. Journals are published online as a matter of course and projects to digitise books are underway in a number of guises. It is important to note though that while online journals are extremely popular amongst scholars, there is perhaps still some resistance to reading books online or using the new electronic book readers like Kindle. Other new methods for publishing historical material like Drupal, WordPress and so on also need to be discussed, for they raise wider questions about the effect of open-access publishing and the barriers to achieving this.\n\n(c) Teaching history\n\nDigital resources and e-learning tools have the potential to enhance teaching. Digital resources relieve pressure on more traditional sources and make available to students previously inaccessible documents and materials. Where digital resources are concerned, however, it is vital that teachers of history also equip students to deal with the challenges they pose. The, at times, lax checks and balances which govern online publishing mean that the unwary may use unreliable or poor quality materials in the place of more scholarly resources.\n\nUniversities are also increasingly aware of the opportunities for expanding their reach and recruitment using e-learning tools, with lectures being posted on YouTube and online courses being developed to enable distance learning. Even social networking sites like Facebook and virtual worlds like Second Life are proving to be of use to educational institutions, facilitating communication and, in the latter case, enabling the recreation of artefacts, battlegrounds and even cities of the past.\n\nThe Working Group has interviewed one teacher of history on her experiences of using Second Life as a teaching tool and will include details of this case study in the report. As the interview highlighted, questions remain, however, about the extent to which such online interaction is an adequate or satisfying replacement for traditional classroom based activities.\n\nMembers:\n\n\"Maria Paola Castiglioni (Grenoble II, FR), Dimitar Grigorov (Sofia, BG), Claire Langhamer (Sussex, UK) (co-chair), Tapio Onnela (Turku, FI) (co-chair), Carla Salvaterra (Bologna, IT), David Sephton (Primrose Publishing, UK), Katy Turton (Queen’s, Belfast, UK) (co-chair), Bertine Bouwman (Utrecht, NL)\"\n\nSixty universities and organizations from 29 countries participate in CLIOH-WORLD, meeting on a regular basis and developing links with European and World History associations in other continents.

It brings together historians, geographers, art historians, linguists, theologists, philologists, sociologists and philosophers in order to explore how differences, connections, conflicts and positive interaction have developed in the past and can develop in the future. It involves 180 research staff and doctoral students from 31 countries.\n\nCLIOHRES has six thematic working groups. They are:\n\n\nThe exact priorities, pathways and specific work-plan of the Thematic Working Group (TWG) of Cliohres responsible for work, gender and society will be defined by the Group and will follow the general scheme outlined. However, on the basis of previous planning, the agenda is to examine the different ways in which society has organized itself in different times and places, with respect to the organization of labor, the definition of gender roles, civic and family structures.\n\nThe ways these forms of organization have been or have not been exported to other parts of the world, the extent to which they define a kind of European-ness, or vice versa, the extent to which national, regional and chronological differences are significant within Europe will be examined as will the links with colonial society and with political and economic changes in the role of Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. The central methodological core around which this TWG will work sees the study of gender as a valuable tool for understanding social evolutions rather than as an end in itself.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "445913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445913", "title": "Higher Education Act 2004", "text": "Higher Education Act 2004\n\nThe Higher Education Act 2004 (c 8) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that introduced several changes to the higher education system in the United Kingdom, the most important and controversial being a major change to the funding of universities, and the operation of tuition fees, which affects England and Wales. University funding is a devolved matter for Northern Ireland and Scotland. After complex and controversial debates, the Higher Education Bill received Royal Assent on 1 July 2004.\n\nUntil 1998, all education in the United Kingdom was free up to and including university courses. However, shortly after coming to power, the Labour Party under Prime Minister Tony Blair abolished the student maintenance grant system and introduced an up-front fee fixed at just over £1,000 per year for all university students. Up to a quarter of this fee was waived for the poorest students, but many maintained that education should remain a free public service, and that the system would place students in unnecessary levels of debt. The government, however, insisted that fees were the best means of providing university funding. At the same time, they stated that their aim was to increase the proportion of students going on to Higher Education to 50% by 2010.\n\nIn the years that followed, it became clear that the original fixed fees of around £1,000 per year were still not providing enough funding, leading to proposals of what are often referred to as \"top-up fees\". The idea was that universities would be able to \"top up\" the fees to a level that more accurately reflected the funding they needed. However, widespread protests led the Labour Party to make a manifesto pledge at the 2001 general election not to introduce such a system.\n\nIn 2003, a new set of proposals was drafted, which were denounced by some as breaking that promise. Although the government tried to create a compromise that would raise the necessary funds in a fair way, the issue remained highly contentious. Despite vocal opposition within his own party, Tony Blair claimed that this proposal was the only way to secure the necessary funds, and the issue was seen as a key test of his leadership. The initial vote in the House of Commons, on 27 January 2004, came a day before the result of the Hutton Inquiry, and it was predicted that a bad result from one or both would lead to Blair's resignation as Prime Minister. The Bill was passed at the first vote, known as \"second reading\", by 316 votes to 311, with 71 Labour MPs voting against.\n\nThe Bill faced further opposition as it progressed through Parliament. There was some controversy regarding the appointment of mainly loyalist MPs to the Standing Committee assigned to review the Bill. Of the 16 Labour MPs on the committee, only one voted against the government at second reading, and one abstained, suggesting that little criticism was likely during this stage. It then returned to the floor of the Commons for the Report stage. The main opposition to the bill from Labour backbenchers concerned the \"variable\" or \"top-up\" fees, therefore an amendment tabled at Report stage to remove references to these variable fees appeared to have some chance of succeeding. In addition, some backbenchers were promised further concessions and changes to the Bill, and therefore voted in favour at the second reading. If these promises had been felt to have been broken, these members might well have vote against the Bill at \"third reading\".\n\nAdditionally, if the Bill had been successfully passed at third reading, it would have moved to the House of Lords, where the Government did not have a majority, and where for this particular Bill, the Salisbury Convention – according to which legislation included in the manifesto of the ruling party should not be opposed – would not have applied. This is because the policy was not included in the Labour party manifesto in 2001 – and some would argue it went against the line reading \"We will not introduce top-up fees and have legislated to prevent them\". Therefore, it is quite possible that the Lords would have rejected the bill outright, which would have meant that the government would have had to table the Bill again in the next session of Parliament, and would possibly have had to use the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 in order to force it through Parliament and gain Royal Assent. Alternatively, the Lords could have passed a \"wrecking amendment\" which would have needed to be reversed by the House of Commons.\n\nThe Act incorporates several key changes to the financial arrangements of higher education students, including many additional terms that were added to convince those who opposed earlier drafts. The changes took effect in 2006, and apply to England and Wales.\n\nThe principal argument in favour of a new funding system is that British universities are currently critically underfunded, and an increased level of fees will result in a cash injection and prevent them collapsing. Additionally, much is made of the need for British institutions to be internationally \"competitive\" in terms of quality and resources, and that this is impossible to achieve without a reform of their funding.\n\nA key player on this side of the argument is the Russell Group of Universities, who have argued that they should be able to charge much increased fees in order to differentiate themselves from smaller universities. This attitude has proved unpopular, as a two-tier system of this kind is widely seen as unnecessary and damaging. The levels called for by this group far exceed the maximum rate currently proposed.\n\nFurther to this argument, it is argued that since studies show that most graduates earn more during their career than non-graduates, it is logical that they should be the ones to pay for this opportunity, not the public at large. Critics, however, have suggested that if this is the case, they will pay more income tax anyway, and that this would be a fairer source of the money. Some have also pointed out that the country as a whole benefits from an increased level of expertise, and therefore it is in everyone's interests to pay for higher education.\n\nThe most common criticism of the proposals is that increasing tuition fees will increase the level of debt graduates will have when they leave. Organisations such as the National Union of Students have argued that students are already under too much financial pressure, and that this will make things worse, not better. Many students have had to take up part-time work in order to pay living costs while studying, and this has been shown to have an adverse effect on their results.\n\nAlthough the Bill removes the need to pay fees up front - meaning that students may have more spending money while studying - it will still leave them with a greater debt at the start of their careers. While it was predicted that people from poorer backgrounds may be put off from enrolling for a degree because of the measure, the number of young people engaged in higher education has actually risen, most markedly in those coming from poorer backgrounds.\n\nA second line of criticism is that the introduction of \"variable\" fees represents a step towards the privatisation of education, and makes degrees into products quite unnecessarily. Although not the intention of the legislation, there is likely to be a perceived trade-off between price and quality when choosing a degree. The strict limits imposed on fee levels limit this in practice, but the concept of competition remains. This is not, however, so relevant today as the vast majority of universities opt to charge the maximum £3,290 (2010 Entry).\n\nThe Higher Education Bill also includes several less well-known provisions:\n\nThe following orders have been made under this section:\n\n\n"}

In other nations, homeschooling remains illegal or restricted to specific conditions, as recorded by homeschooling international status and statistics.\n\nAccording to the US National Center for Education Statistics, about three percent of all children in the US were homeschooled in 2011-2012 school year. The study found that 83 percent were White, 5 percent were Black, 7 percent were Hispanic, and 2 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. As of 2016, there are about 1.7 million homeschooled students in the United States.\n\nOn average, homeschoolers score at or above the national average on standardized tests. Homeschool students have been accepted into many Ivy League universities.\n\nFor most of history and in different cultures, the education of children at home by family members was a common practice. Enlisting professional tutors was an option available only to the wealthy. Homeschooling declined in the 19th and 20th centuries with the enactment of compulsory attendance laws. But, it continued to be practiced in isolated communities. Homeschooling began a resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s with educational reformists dissatisfied with industrialized education.\n\nThe earliest public schools in modern Western culture were established during the reformation with the encouragement of Martin Luther in the German states of Gotha and Thuringia in 1524 and 1527. From the 1500s to 1800s the literacy rate increased until a majority of adults were literate; but, development of the literacy rate occurred before the implementation of compulsory attendance and universal education.\n\nHome education and apprenticeship continued to remain the main form of education until the 1830s. However, in the 18th century, the majority of people in Europe lacked formal education. Since the early 19th century, formal classroom schooling became the most common means of schooling throughout the developed countries.\n\nIn 1647, New England provided compulsory elementary education. Regional differences in schooling existed in colonial America. In the south, farms and plantations were so widely dispersed that community schools such as those in the more compact settlements of the north were impossible. In the middle colonies, the educational situation varied when comparing New York with New England.\n\nMost Native American tribal cultures traditionally used home education and apprenticeship to pass knowledge to children. Parents were supported by extended relatives and tribal leaders in the education of their children. The Native Americans vigorously resisted compulsory education in the United States.\n\nIn the 1960s, Rousas John Rushdoony began to advocate homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the secular nature of the public school system in the United States. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey, and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: \"Intellectual Schizophrenia\", \"The Messianic Character of American Education\", and \"The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum\". Rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in court cases. He frequently advocated the use of private schools.\n\nDuring this time, American educational professionals Raymond and Dorothy Moore began to research the academic validity of the rapidly growing Early Childhood Education movement. This research included independent studies by other researchers and a review of over 8,000 studies bearing on early childhood education and the physical and mental development of children.\n\nThey asserted that formal schooling before ages 8–12 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness, but also harmed children. The Moores published their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. The Moores presented evidence that childhood problems such as juvenile delinquency, nearsightedness, increased enrollment of students in special education classes and behavioral problems were the result of increasingly earlier enrollment of students. The Moores cited studies demonstrating that orphans who were given surrogate mothers were measurably more intelligent, with superior long-term effects – even though the mothers were \"mentally retarded teenagers\" – and that illiterate tribal mothers in Africa produced children who were socially and emotionally more advanced than typical western children, \"by western standards of measurement\".\n\nTheir primary assertion was that the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long-term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor corrected in an institutional setting afterward. Recognizing a necessity for early out-of-home care for some children, particularly special needs and impoverished children and children from exceptionally inferior homes, they maintained that the vast majority of children were far better situated at home, even with mediocre parents, than with the most gifted and motivated teachers in a school setting. They described the difference as follows: \"This is like saying, if you can help a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for \"all\" children – when obviously most children already have even more secure housing.\"\n\nLike Holt, the Moores embraced homeschooling after the publication of their first work, \"Better Late Than Early\", in 1975, and became important homeschool advocates and consultants with the publication of books such as \"Home Grown Kids\" (1981), and \"Homeschool Burnout\".\n\nSimultaneously, other authors published books questioning the premises and efficacy of compulsory schooling, including \"Deschooling Society\" by Ivan Illich in 1970 and \"No More Public School\" by Harold Bennet in 1972.\n\nIn 1976, Holt published \"Instead of Education; Ways to Help People Do Things Better\". In its conclusion, he called for a \"Children's Underground Railroad\" to help children escape compulsory schooling. In response, Holt was contacted by families from around the U.S. to tell him that they were educating their children at home. In 1977, after corresponding with a number of these families, Holt began producing \"Growing Without Schooling\", a newsletter dedicated to home education. Holt was nicknamed the \"father of home schooling.\" Holt later wrote a book about homeschooling, \"Teach Your Own\", in 1981.\n\nIn 1980, Holt said, \"I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were.\" One common theme in the homeschool philosophies of both Holt and that of the Moores is that home education should not attempt to bring the school construct into the home, or a view of education as an academic preliminary to life. They viewed home education as a natural, experiential aspect of life that occurs as the members of the family are involved with one another in daily living.\n\nParents commonly cite two main motivations for homeschooling their children: dissatisfaction with the local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, racism and lack of faith in the school's ability to cater to their children's special needs. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and to take advantage of the efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning. \n\nSome African-American families choose homeschool as a way of increasing their children's understanding of African-American history – such as the Jim Crow laws that resulted in their ancestors being beaten, killed, or sold for learning to read – and to limit the harm caused by the unintentional and sometimes subtle systemic racism that affects most American schools.\n\nSome parents have objections to the secular nature of public schools and homeschool in order to give their children a religious education. Use of a religious curriculum is common among these families. Recent sociological work suggests that an increasing number of parents are choosing homeschooling because of low academic quality at the local schools, or because of bullying or health problems.\n\nHomeschooling may also be a factor in the choice of parenting style. Homeschooling can be a matter of consistency for families living in isolated rural locations, for those temporarily abroad, and for those who travel frequently. Many young athletes, actors, and musicians are taught at home to accommodate their training and practice schedules more conveniently. Homeschooling can be about mentorship and apprenticeship, in which a tutor or teacher is with the child for many years and becomes more intimately acquainted with the child. Homeschooling increased in popularity in the United States during the 2000s; the percentage of children ages 5 through 17 who were homeschooled increased from 1.7% in 1999 to 3% in 2011/12.\n\nHomeschooling can be used a form of supplemental education and as a way of helping children learn under specific circumstances. The term may also refer to instruction in the home under the supervision of correspondence schools or umbrella schools. Some jurisdictions require adherence to an approved curriculum. A curriculum-free philosophy of homeschooling is sometimes called \"unschooling\", a term coined in 1977 by American educator and author John Holt in his magazine, \"Growing Without Schooling\". The term emphasizes the more spontaneous, less structured learning environment in which a child's interests drive his pursuit of knowledge. Some parents provide a liberal arts education using the trivium and quadrivium as the main models.\n\nHomeschools use a wide variety of methods and materials. Families choose different educational methods, which represent a variety of educational philosophies and paradigms. Some of the methods or learning environments used include Classical education (including Trivium, Quadrivium), Charlotte Mason education, Montessori method, Theory of multiple intelligences, Unschooling, Radical Unschooling, Waldorf education, School-at-home (curriculum choices from both secular and religious publishers), A Thomas Jefferson Education, unit studies, curriculum made up from private or small publishers, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, distance learning (both online and correspondence), dual enrollment in local schools or colleges, and curriculum provided by local schools and many others. Some of these approaches are used in private and public schools. Educational research and studies support the use of some of these methods. Unschooling, natural learning, Charlotte Mason Education, Montessori, Waldorf, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, unit studies are supported to varying degrees by research by constructivist learning theories and situated cognition theories. Elements of these theories may be found in the other methods as well.\n\nA student's education may be customized to support his or her learning level, style, and interests. It is not uncommon for a student to experience more than one approach as the family discovers what works best for their student. Many families use an eclectic approach, picking and choosing from various suppliers. For sources of curricula and books a study found that 78 percent utilized \"a public library\"; 77 percent used \"a homeschooling catalog, publisher, or individual specialist\"; 68 percent used \"retail bookstore or another store\"; 60 percent used \"an education publisher that was not affiliated with homeschooling.\" \"Approximately half\" used curriculum from \"a homeschooling organization\", 37 percent from a \"church, synagogue or other religious institution\" and 23 percent from \"their local public school or district.\" In 2003, 41 percent utilized some sort of distance learning, approximately 20 percent by \"television, video or radio\"; 19 percent via \"The Internet, e-mail, or the World Wide Web\"; and 15 percent taking a \"correspondence course by mail designed specifically for homeschoolers.\"\n\nIndividual governmental units, e.g. states and local districts, vary in official curriculum and attendance requirements.\n\nAs a subset of homeschooling, informal learning happens outside of the classroom, but has no traditional boundaries of education. Informal learning is an everyday form of learning through participation and creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning. The term is often combined with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. Informal learning differs from traditional learning since there are no expected objectives or outcomes. From the learner’s standpoint, the knowledge that they receive is not intentional. Anything from planting a garden to baking a cake or even talking to a technician at work about the installation of new software, can be considered informal learning. The individual is completing a task with different intentions, but ends up learning skills in the process. Children watching their tomato plants grow will not generate questions about photosynthesis but they will learn that their plants are growing with water and sunlight. This leads them to have a base understanding of complex scientific concepts without any background studying. The recent trend of homeschooling becoming less stigmatized has been in connection with the traditional waning of the idea that the state needs to be in primary and ultimate control over the education and upbringing of all children to create future adult citizens . This breeds an ever growing importance on the ideas and concepts that children learn outside of the traditional classroom setting, including Informal learning.\n\nDepending on the part of the world, informal learning can take on many different identities and has differing cultural importances. Many ways of organizing homeschooling draw on apprenticeship qualities and on non-western cultures. In South American indigenous culture, children learn irrigation and farming technique through play, advancing them not only in their own village and society, but also in their knowledge of realistic techniques that they will need to survive . In Western culture, children use informal learning in two main ways. The first as talked about, is through hands-on experience with new material. The second is asking questions to someone who has more experience than they have (i.e. parents, elders). Childrens inquisitive nature is their way of cementing the ideas they have learned through exposure informal learning. It is a more casual way of learning than traditional learning and serves the purpose of taking in information any which way they can. \n\nAll other approaches to homeschooling are subsumed under two basic categories: structured and unstructured homeschooling. Structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. This style attempts to imitate the structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. Unstructured homeschooling is any form of home education where parents do not construct a curriculum at all. Unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.\n\nIn a unit study approach, multiple subjects such as math, science, history, art, and geography, are studied in relation to a single topic. Unit studies are useful for teaching multiple grades simultaneously as the difficulty level can be adjusted for each student. An extended form of unit studies, Integrated Thematic Instruction utilizes one central theme integrated throughout the curriculum so that students finish a school year with a deep understanding of a certain broad subject or idea.\n\nAll-in-one homeschooling curricula (variously known as \"school-at-home\", \"the traditional approach\", \"school-in-a-box\" or \"The Structured Approach\"), are instructionist methods of teaching in which the curriculum and homework of the student are similar or identical to those used in a public or private school. Purchased as a grade level package or separately by subject, the package may contain all of the needed books, materials, tests, answer keys, and extensive teacher guides. These materials cover the same subject areas as public schools, allowing for an easy transition into the school system. These are among the more expensive options for homeschooling, but they require minimal preparation and are easy to use. Some localities provide the same materials used at local schools to homeschoolers. The purchase of a complete curriculum and their teaching/grading service from an accredited distance learning curriculum provider may allow students to obtain an accredited high school diploma.\n\n\"Natural learning\" refers to a type of learning-on-demand where children pursue knowledge based on their interests and parents take an active part in facilitating activities and experiences conducive to learning but do not rely heavily on textbooks or spend much time \"teaching\", looking instead for \"learning moments\" throughout their daily activities. Parents see their role as that of affirming through positive feedback and modeling the necessary skills, and the child's role as being responsible for asking and learning.\n\nThe term \"unschooling\" as coined by John Holt describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead. \"Unschooling\" does not indicate that the child is not being educated, but that the child is not being \"schooled\", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. Holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. Children at school learn from 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary teachers in a classroom of approximately 30. Kids have the opportunity of dedicated education at home with a ratio of 1 to 1. An unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education. Holt asserted that there is no specific body of knowledge that is, or should be, required of a child.\n\nBoth unschooling and natural learning advocates believe that children learn best by doing; a child may learn reading to further an interest about history or other cultures, or math skills by operating a small business or sharing in family finances. They may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.\n\nAnother prominent proponent of unschooling is John Taylor Gatto, author of Dumbing Us Down, The Exhausted School, A Different Kind of Teacher, and Weapons of Mass Instruction. Gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of \"state controlled consciousness\" and serves as a prime illustration of the total institution — a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free thinking or dissent.\n\nAutonomous learning is a school of education which sees learners as individuals who can and should be i.e. be responsible for their own learning climate.\n\nAutonomous education helps students develop their self-consciousness, vision, practicality and freedom of discussion. These attributes serve to aid the student in his/her independent learning. However, a student must not start their autonomous learning completely on their own. It is said, that by first having interaction with someone who has more knowledge in a subject, will speed up the student's learning, and hence allow them to learn more independently.\n\nSome degree of autonomous learning is popular with those who home educate their children. In true autonomous learning, the child usually gets to decide what projects they wish to tackle or what interests to pursue. In home education, this can be instead of or in addition to regular subjects like doing math or English.\n\nAccording to Home Education UK the autonomous education philosophy emerged from the epistemology of Karl Popper in \"The Myth of the Framework: In Defence of Science and Rationality\", which is developed in the debates, which seek to rebut the neo-Marxist social philosophy of convergence proposed by the Frankfurt School (e.g. Theodor W. Adorno, Jürgen Habermas, Max Horkheimer).\n\nA homeschool cooperative is a cooperative of families who homeschool their children. It provides an opportunity for children to learn from other parents who are more specialized in certain areas or subjects. Co-ops also provide social interaction. They may take lessons together or go on field trips. Some co-ops also offer events such as prom and graduation for homeschoolers.\n\nHomeschoolers are beginning to utilize Web 2.0 as a way to simulate homeschool cooperatives online. With social networks homeschoolers can chat, discuss threads in forums, share information and tips, and even participate in online classes via blackboard systems similar to those used by colleges.\n\nAccording to the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in 2004, \"Many studies over the last few years have established the academic excellence of homeschooled children.\" Homeschooling Achievement—a compilation of studies published by the HSLDA—supported the academic integrity of homeschooling. This booklet summarized a 1997 study by Ray and the 1999 Rudner study. The Rudner study noted two limitations of its own research: it is not necessarily representative of all homeschoolers and it is not a comparison with other schooling methods. Among the homeschooled students who took the tests, the average homeschooled student outperformed his public school peers by 30 to 37 percentile points across all subjects. The study also indicates that public school performance gaps between minorities and genders were virtually non-existent among the homeschooled students who took the tests.\n\nA study conducted in 2008 found that 11,739 homeschooled students, on average, scored 37 percentile points above public school students on standardized achievement tests. This is consistent with the 1999 Rudner study. However, Rudner said that these same students in public school may have scored just as well because of the dedicated parents they had. The Ray study also found that homeschooled students who had a certified teacher as a parent scored one percentile lower than homeschooled students who did not have a certified teacher as a parent. Another nationwide descriptive study conducted by Ray contained students ranging from ages 5–18 and he found that homeschoolers scored in at least the 80th percentile on their tests.\n\nIn 2011, a quasi-experimental study was conducted that included homeschooled and traditional public students between the ages of 5 and 10. It was discovered that the majority of the homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared to their counterparts. However, Martin-Chang also found that unschooling children ages 5–10 scored significantly below traditionally educated children, while academically oriented homeschooled children scored from one half grade level above to 4.5 grade levels above traditionally schooled children on standardized tests (n=37 home schooled children matched with children from the same socioeconomic and educational background).\n\nStudies have also examined the impact of homeschooling on students' GPAs. Cogan (2010) found that homeschooled students had higher high school GPAs (3.74) and transfer GPAs (3.65) than conventional students. Snyder (2013) provided corroborating evidence that homeschoolers were outperforming their peers in the areas of standardized tests and overall GPAs. Looking beyond high school, a study by the 1990 National Home Education Research Institute (as cited by Wichers, 2001) found that at least 33% of home schooled students attended a four-year college, and 17% attended a two-year college. This same study examined the students after one year, finding that that 17% pursued higher education. Thus, the data indicates that homeschooling can also prepare students for success in higher education.\n\nHomeschooled children may receive more individualized attention than students enrolled in traditional public schools. A 2011 study suggests that a structured environment could play a key role in homeschooler academic achievement. This means that parents were highly involved in their child's education and they were creating clear educational goals. In addition, these students were being offered organized lesson plans which are either self-made or purchased.\n\nA study conducted by Ray (2010), indicates that the higher the level of parents' income, the more likely the homeschooled child is able to achieve academic success.\n\nIn the 1970s, Raymond and Dorothy Moore conducted four federally funded analyses of more than 8,000 early childhood studies, from which they published their original findings in \"Better Late Than Early\", 1975. This was followed by \"School Can Wait\", a repackaging of these same findings designed specifically for educational professionals. They concluded that, \"where possible, children should be withheld from formal schooling until at least ages eight to ten.\" Their reason was that children \"are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, neurological development and cognition are ready\". They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of \"1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools – senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination – cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5) failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason.\" According to the Moores, \"early formal schooling is burning out our children. Teachers who attempt to cope with these youngsters also are burning out.\" Aside from academic performance, they think early formal schooling also destroys \"positive sociability\", encourages peer dependence, and discourages self-worth, optimism, respect for parents, and trust in peers. They believe this situation is particularly acute for boys because of their delay in maturity. The Moores cited a Smithsonian Report on the development of genius, indicating a requirement for \"1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance.\" Their analysis suggested that children need \"more of home and less of formal school\", \"more free exploration with... parents, and fewer limits of classroom and books\", and \"more old fashioned chores – children working with parents – and less attention to rivalry sports and amusements.\"\n\nAlong with positive school outcomes, homeschooled youth are also less likely to use and abuse illicit substances and are more likely to disapprove of using alcohol and marijuana.\n\nThere are claims that studies showing that homeschooled students do better on standardized tests do not compare with mandatory public-school testing.\n\nBy contrast, SAT and ACT tests are self-selected by homeschooled and formally schooled students alike. Some homeschoolers averaged higher scores on these college entrance tests in South Carolina. Other scores (1999 data) showed mixed results, for example showing higher levels for homeschoolers in English (homeschooled 23.4 vs national average 20.5) and reading (homeschooled 24.4 vs national average 21.4) on the ACT, but mixed scores in math (homeschooled 20.4 vs national average 20.7 on the ACT as opposed homeschooled 535 vs national average 511 on the 1999 SAT math).\n\nSome advocates of homeschooling and educational choice counter with an input-output theory, pointing out that home educators expend only an average of $500–$600 a year on each student (not counting the cost of the parents' time), in comparison to $9,000-$10,000 (including the cost of staff time) for each public school student in the United States, which suggests home-educated students would be especially dominant on tests if afforded access to an equal commitment of tax-funded educational resources.\n\nMany teachers and school districts oppose the idea of homeschooling. However, research has shown that homeschooled children often excel in many areas of academic endeavor. According to a study done on the homeschool movement, homeschoolers often achieve academic success and admission into elite universities. There is also evidence that most are remarkably well socialized. According to the National Home Education Research Institute president, Brian Ray, socialization is not a problem for homeschooling children, many of whom are involved in community sports, volunteer activities, book groups, or homeschool co-ops.\n\nUsing the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, John Taylor later found that, \"while half of the conventionally schooled children scored at or below the 50th percentile (in self-concept), only 10.3% of the home-schooling children did so.\" He further stated that \"the self-concept of home-schooling children is significantly higher statistically than that of children attending conventional school. This has implications in the areas of academic achievement and socialization which have been found to parallel self-concept. Regarding socialization, Taylor's results would mean that very few home-schooling children are socially deprived. He states that critics who speak out against homeschooling on the basis of social deprivation are actually addressing an area which favors homeschoolers.\n\nIn 2003, the National Home Education Research Institute conducted a survey of 7,300 U.S. adults who had been homeschooled (5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included:\n\nOpposition to homeschooling comes from some organizations of teachers and school districts. The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling.\n\nStanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich wrote in \"The Civic Perils of Homeschooling\" (2002) that homeschooling can probably result in biased students, as many homeschooling parents view the education of their children as a matter properly under their control and no one else's.\n\nGallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last 20 years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001. In 1988, when asked whether parents should have a right to choose homeschooling, 53 percent thought that they should, as revealed by another poll.\n\nHomeschooling is legal in some countries. Countries with the most prevalent home education movements include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile and the United States. Some countries have highly regulated home education programs as an extension of the compulsory school system; others, such as Sweden, Germany and most European countries have outlawed it entirely. Brazil has a law project in process. In other countries, while not restricted by law, homeschooling is not socially acceptable or considered desirable and is virtually non-existent.\n\nHome education or homeschooling, in Australia is much the same as elsewhere. Some reasons as to why people choose to homeschool is because it's a lifestyle choice, some people choose to home educate so that they can travel and spend quality time with their kids. Some children learn differently to the general crowd and can get bored or can struggle at school, where the teachers are unable to cater for the individuality of each child.\n\nHomeschooling requires government registration, with different requirements from state to state. Some home educators prefer to be regulated, but others question whether the government has any legitimate authority to oversee the choices parents make to raise and educate their children. Curricular help is offered by the Australian Government.\n\nMany organisations exist to help parents and teachers with home education. The HEA (Home Education Association) is one support organisation, having grown through local support networks. The HEA does not produce educational material, but offers support to families choosing to homeschool.\n\nHomeschooling in South America has not taken hold as it has in North American countries of Canada and the United States. In 1824, Brazil permitted home education to take the place of traditional education for nearly 70 years. In 1990, however, The Statute of Children and Adolescents, or the Estatuto da Criança e Adolescente, prohibited homeschooling and did not recognize it as a legitimate form of education. A resurgence in the homeschooling movement, however, has encouraged congressman Lincoln Portela to introduce a new bill that would allow children to be educated at home if parents followed state approved guidelines. The National Association of Home Education was founded in 2010 to achieve these goals. Rough estimates state that around 3,201 families are homeschooling in 2016.\n\nHomeschooling is legal in all provinces and territories in Canada and has been for 40 years. The Ontario Education Act, for example, states in Section 21(2)(a) that \"A person is excused from attendance at school if [...] the person is receiving education elsewhere\". Canada is known as having some of the most comprehensive legal protections for homeschooling parents in the Americas. Some provinces have implemented policies that require parents to notify school boards of their decision to homeschool. Every province requires parents to notify the school system of their intent to withdraw their child from the public school system and to begin home education. Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state. Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education. These policies, however, are not law; although Canadian legislators recognize the importance of state controls in the homeschooling environment, it is ultimately up to the parent to decide when and how to homeschool. Despite a positive environment that supports and encourages alternatives to traditional schooling, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of Canadian families were homeschooling in 2015. This number is probably inaccurate, however, as many parents do not report their decisions to homeschool.\n\nUnlike the United States, where homeschooling is largely a consequence of religious conviction, a study of 1,600 families in 2003 found that Canadians primarily choose to homeschool out of a desire to provide better education. For those children whose parents decided to homeschool out of a desire to better education, a 2003 study found statistical significance between traditionally schooled and homeschooled students scores on standardized tests of writing, reading, and mathematics. A more recent 2011 study found that style of home education (structured versus unstructured) was a more important predictor of standardized test performance than other traditional measures, such as income and parents' educational attainment. These findings are similar to findings in U.S. research on homeschooled children and the outcomes of homeschooling.\n\nOne technique that is specifically Canadian, specifically British Columbian, is the Distributed Learning approach to home education. Distributed Learning is an online program that is directed by a teacher that meets provincial standards for education. The program draws on public and private curricula. This is distinctive to British Columbia because it is the only province that has Distributed Learning policy. It is one of the most popular forms of home education.\n\nHomeschooling is legal in Israel, and requires acquiring a permission from the Ministry of Education. The permission involves a home visit from the person in charge of handing out the permissions, and writing a letter describing the motives, curriculum, daily routine and socialization of the children. Unschooling is legal, and the requirements are minimal. The reasons for homeschooling in Israel are very similar to those of the rest of the world, with the exception of religious motives, since religious schools are prevalent.\nThere is unclear information regarding the number of Homeschooling families, since not all families ask for permission, and many homeschool their children without enlisting. Estimates range between 500-1000 families.\n\nUp until 1920, homeschooling in Germany was seen as an acceptable practice under certain circumstances. With the rise of the Weimar Republic and the Nazi regime, homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country. The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. Homeschooling wouldn't become a public concept until the 1980s. In 1989, Helmut Stücher removed his children from the public school system to begin home schooling. Stücher and others who followed suit were fined, and some even lost child custody. It wasn't until the unification of Germany in 1990 that education law was reformed and homeschooling was allowed under strict observation and extreme circumstances. Today, however, homeschooling remains illegal.\n\nGermany has not endorsed homeschooling as other countries have. Its neighbors, Switzerland and Austria, have embraced the notion and are following similar paths as the United States and Canada.\n\nHome education was outlawed in South Africa before 1994, and families were jailed for not sending their children to school. With the acceptance of the South African constitution in 1994, home education was legalised per implication. This was acknowledged with promulgation of the SA Schools Act of 1996 in which home education is accommodated in art. 51. Since home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially. According to the census count of 2011, there were about 57 000 home learners in the country, putting South Africa in the top five countries in terms of number of home learners.\n\n"}

It is the developer of the Canvas learning management system, which is a comprehensive cloud-native software package that competes with such systems as Blackboard Learning System, Moodle, D2L and Sakai Project. Instructure also developed Canvas Network, a massive open online course (MOOC) platform.\n\nInstructure was founded in 2008 by two BYU graduate students, Brian Whitmer and Devlin Daley, with initial funding from Mozy founder Josh Coates (currently the CEO) and Epic Ventures.\n\nIn December 2010, the Utah Education Network (UEN), which represents a number of Utah colleges and universities, announced that Instructure would be replacing Blackboard as their preferred LMS. By January, 2013, Instructure's LMS platform was in use by more than 300 colleges, universities and K-12 districts, and the company's customer base had increased to more than 425 halfway through 2013 and 9 million users by the end of 2013.\n\nIn February 2011, Instructure announced that they were making their flagship product, Canvas, freely available under an AGPL license as open source software. Instructure's announcement received coverage in the press.\nIn February 2012, the company launched Canvas K-12.\n\nIn November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course market by launching Canvas Network.\n\nIn June 2013, Instructure secured $30 Million in Series D Funding, bringing their lifetime funding total to $50M. In February, 2015, Instructure raised another $40 Million in Series E Funding, raising their lifetime funding total to $90M. CEO Josh Coates described it as \"a pre-IPO round.\" On November 13, 2015, Instructure began trading as a publicly held company on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nInstructure Inc. was created in order to support the continued development of a new learning management system (LMS) originally named Instructure. Once incorporated, the founders changed the name of the software to Canvas. The Utah-based company tested the LMS at several local schools including Utah State University and Brigham Young University before officially launching Canvas. Canvas is now used by more than 3,000 universities, school districts, and institutions around the world.\n\nCanvas was built using Ruby on Rails as the web application framework backed by a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to provide a modern user interface. OAuth is used to provide limited access to a user's information on certain social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to allow for collaboration between sites. Canvas operates as a software as a service using Amazon Web Services in the \"Cloud\".\n\nIn 2011, Canvas launched their iOS app, and in 2013, their Android app, enabling mobile access to the Canvas learning platform. The apps were eventually split into Canvas Student and Canvas Teacher, separating features for students and instructors. In 2016, Canvas launched Canvas Parent, their mobile app for parents, for both iOS and Android, allowing parents of K–12 students stay informed on their children's assignments, grades and overall schooling.\n\nIn February 2012, Instructure launched Canvas K-12, an LMS platform designed for the specific needs of elementary and secondary schools. The LMS enrolls parents with their students to provide greater visibility into their children's learning experience and provides actionable analytics to teachers and administrators.\n\nIn November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course MOOC market by launching Canvas Network. Instructure's approach to MOOC has been to facilitate experimentation with pedagogy and new ways to use multimedia environments to change cognition and enhance the learning process. One example is \"Gender Through Comic Books,\" a MOOC taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Canvas Network that used lessons from pop culture to explore evolving social norms and other anthropological ideals.\n\nIn July 2013, Instructure partnered with Qualtrics, a Utah-based company, to survey MOOC participants on Instructure's Canvas Network about their motivations for enrolling in and completing these courses. The results suggested that educators rethink ways to fully leverage the online learning environment to make the educational experience more engaging and interesting.\n\nOn February 18, 2015, Instructure officially launched Bridge, their new cloud-based corporate LMS. This launch followed $40 million raised in Series E funding, led by Insight Venture Partners. EPIC Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated in the funding. This round raised their total lifetime funding to close to $90 million. At launch, Bridge served six corporate clients, including Oregon State University, which had also been using Instructure's Canvas LMS for their students.\n\n"}

In 1974, King Abdulaziz University was converted to a public university by a decision of the Council Ministers of Saudi Arabia under then-King Faisal's orders. In 2016, it was ranked the #1 Arab university by Times Higher Education.\n\nIn the year 1964, the idea of establishing a private university in the city of Jeddah was originally put forward by Mohamed Ali Hafez. In the same year, a preparatory committee of 6 members was formed, including Mohamed Ali Hafez and Muhammad Abu Bakr Bakhashab. Shortly after, then-Crown Prince Faisal officially approved the idea. In 1965, the university's executive committee was formed. In 1966, the KAU held a competition to design their logo. The winning design was submitted by Adbul-Halim Radwi, a local artist from Jeddah.\n\nIn the year 1967, King Abdulaziz University was officially established as a private university, with goals to spread higher education in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Prior to this date, there were no higher-education institutes in Jeddah. These goals were met through efforts of high-ranking businessmen and notable Saudi figures; and additionally with the help of King Faisal's encouragement and financial support. The university started its first academic year in 1968, with a relatively small number of students (68 male - 30 female). In 1969, the first faculty was established (Faculty of Economics and Administration). In 1970, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities was established.\n\nIn 1974, the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia decided to merge the university with the government; converting it to a public university. This major decision spurred the impressive transformation to where the university stands today. King Abdulaziz University has further witnessed tremendous quantitative and qualitative progress in terms of enrollment and diversity of academic programs. It is now recognized as a world-class university due to its international outreach and collaboration in research, innovation, accreditations and rankings. It does this while continuing to maintain its traditional commitment to delivering outstanding education and community service. , it had almost 31,000 students, of which 28% are international, and is considered to be one of the best universities in the Arab world.\n\nIn 2018, it was ranked the 1st Arab university by \"Times Higher Education\" due to very strong citation impact and highly international outlook. It also ranked no. 1 in percentage of total publications with international collaboration, according to \"US News\" rankings.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2014, King Abdulaziz University enacted a program to attract the international community and has welcomed nearly 150 researches or various disciplines. The university has developed international research partners, including in Morocco where it has developed a joint lunar research program with the Astronomic Observatory of Oukaïmeden. The university has 13 different research centers, predominantly in the fields of medicine (medical genomes and osteoperosis), environment and energy, climate change, and desalination.\n\nFounded in the 1970s by Sami Angawi, the research center on pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj Research Center) conducts a series of works around the religious event, notably on the aspects of logistics surrounding the pilgrimage.\n\nThese programs are accredited by ABET as Substantially Equivalent Programs since 2003.\n\nThe Faculty of Economics and Administration was the first college to be established in King Abdulaziz University, and until this day it is called \"The Base of Founder's University,\" referring to the founder of the country.\n\n\nIn 2015, FEA received its fourth international accreditation, the AACSB making it one of the top business colleges in the middle east and across the world.\n\nThe Faculty of Law was established in 2012 as it segregated from Faculty of Economics and Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her father met her mother, Nina Shakhetdinova, an Azerbaijanian, while he was stationed in the Caucasus. Nina died when Olga was very young. Olga's stepmother, who was also her former nurse, showed little interest in her, especially after the birth of her own daughter by Olga's father. When her father, Major General Komarov, died in 1881 Olga was placed in an orphanage for children of the nobility.\n\nShe married Boris Eduardovich Forsh, who had also been born into the family of a high-ranking military officer, in 1895. In the 1890s she studied at various art schools, most importantly in Kiev and St Petersburg, where she worked in the studio of Pavel Chistyakov.\n\nIn 1904 Boris Forsh resigned from the military in objection to his having to serve at the executions of political prisoners. He was deprived of his salary, and he and Olga moved to a farm in the Ukraine with their two children. Olga was also pregnant at the time. She later attributed the inspiration for her early stories to this extended period of living among the peasantry. Her first works of fiction were published in 1907. She continued drawing and painting, and worked as an art teacher at the Levitskaya School in Tsarskoye Selo in 1910-11, but she turned toward writing as time went by.\n\nOlga was interested in the fashionable ideas of the time, including Tolstoyanism, Theosophy and Buddhism, but was increasingly drawn to Socialism. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Olga and her husband became active supporters of the Bolsheviks. Olga's husband died of typhus while serving with the Red Army in Kiev. After his death she continued to dedicate herself to cultural work.\n\nShe devoted several novels to the history of revolutionary thought and the revolutionary movement in Russia. Among them are \"Palace and Prison\" (1924–25, also made into a film script), about the revolutionary Mikhail Stepanovich Beideman, \"The Fervid Workshop\" (1926), about the Revolution of 1905–07, and \"Pioneers of Freedom\" (1950–53), which deals with the Decembrists. She also wrote the three-part biographical novel \"Radishchev\", which comprises the books \"Jacobin Leaven\" (1932), \"The Landlady of Kazan\" (1934–35), and \"The Pernicious Book\" (1939). Her experimental play \"The Substitute Lecturer\" was published in 1930.\n\nThe fate of the creative individual under an oppressive regime is treated in the novel \"The Contemporaries\" (1926), which is about Nikolay Gogol and A.

The French education administration is building a new concept until June 2016 with the Direction du numérique pour l'éducation (DNE).\n\nOpen-Sankoré is the first feature-complete open-source interactive whiteboard. In contrast to other similar software, its file format is text-based and uses a W3C web standard, allowing to be displayed in a modern web browser and enabling lessons to be distributed online without additional software. Second, the software can be extended using W3C-compliant widgets, allowing user flexibility.\n\nThe French government has set up an Interministerial Delegation for Digital Education in Africa (DIENA) and a Public Interest Grouping for Digital Education in Africa (GIP ENA) in order to implement a multi-year program for developing digital education in many African partner countries. Open-Sankoré is one of the strategies of this group to try to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for education in Africa, an initiative of the United Nations.\n\n\n"}

He is remembered as the long-time director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and as founder of the International Writing Program (IWP), both at the University of Iowa.\n\nEngle has been mistakenly credited with having founded the Iowa Writers' Workshop (an honor that more appropriately belongs to his predecessor, Wilbur Schramm). Nonetheless, perhaps no one better helped to establish the reputation of the venerable writing program than Engle. During his tenure as director (1941–1965), he was responsible for luring some of the finest writers of the day to Iowa City. Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Robie Macauley, Kurt Vonnegut and many other prominent novelists and poets served as faculty under Engle. He increased enrollment and oversaw numerous students of future fame and influence, including Flannery O'Connor, Philip Levine, Mark Costello, Marvin Bell, Joe Nicholson, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Donald Justice, Raymond Carver, Douglas Kent Hall, Andre Dubus, and Robert Bly. During his tenure, Engle raised millions of dollars in support of the program whose shape and direction proved the model for the hundreds of writing programs that have followed.\n\nVonnegut described Engle in a 1967 letter in this fashion: \"The former head, Paul Engle, is still around, is a hayseed clown, a foxy grandpa, a terrific promoter, who, if you listen closely, talks like a man with a paper asshole.\"\n\nIn 1967, following his departure as director of the workshop, Engle and future second wife Nieh Hualing co-founded The University of Iowa's International Writing Program, which provided for dozens of published authors from around the world to visit Iowa City each year to write and collaborate. Engle left the Writer's Workshop permanently in 1969 to devote himself full-time to the international program. He sponsored and admitted many who would have been executed if they had remained home. Many Cambodians and Vietnamese writers owe him their lives.\n\nBorn Paul Hamilton Engle in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Thomas Allen, a livery stable owner, and Evelyn (Reinheiner) Engle, Engle grew up in the Wellington Heights section of Cedar Rapids. He graduated from Washington High School (Cedar Rapids, Iowa), and later attended Coe College (class of 1931), The University of Iowa, Columbia University, and Oxford University (where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar). As a student at Iowa, Engle was one of the earliest recipients of an advanced degree awarded for creative work: his first collection \"Worn Earth\", which went on to win the Yale Series of Younger Poets. His second book, \"American Song\" (1934), was given a rave front-page review in the New York Times Book Review and was even, briefly, a bestseller. From 1954 to 1959, Engle served as series editor for the O. Henry Prize.\n\nAt the time of his death (in Chicago's O'Hare Airport on his way to accept an award in Poland), Engle was the author of more than a dozen collections of poetry, a novel, a memoir, an opera libretto (for Philip Bezanson), and even a children's book. Engle wrote numerous articles and reviews for many of the largest periodicals of his day.\n\nHis papers are held at the University of Iowa and Coe College.\n\n\n\n\n\"NB: for further reference, Richard B. Weber (Library of the University of Iowa, 1966) has compiled a comprehensive bibliography entitled Paul Engle: A Checklist of books Paul Engle authored, as well as of publications he edited or to which he contributed.\"\n\n"}

It was first established during Soviet times by the edict of Uzbek government number 697 on 27 December of the year 1971 and by the edict of \"Ministry of Higher and Secondary Education Affairs\" number 27 on 21 January of the year 1972 under the base of automobile-road faculty at \"Tashkent Poly Technical Institute\". The first academic year at the institute started on 1 September 1972. \n\nTashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute's main building is located in the center of Tashkent, near to the metro station \"Oybek\" and next to the \"State Museum of Arts\" of Uzbekistan. The Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute is well known as one of the leading universities of Central Asia in fields of auto-constructing, automobile transports, road and airport construction. The campus of the university is fully supplied with modern rooms to hold classes, with rooms for experimental subjects and a techno park. \n\nThere are 3 academicians from \"Uzbek Academy of Sciences\", 4 representatives of Uzbek sciences, 38 doctors of sciences, who give their lectures at the university.\n\nThere are four faculties at the university and till 2006 the Tashkent Automobile and Road Construction Institute had a special faculty for gifted students. However, nowadays this faculty is closed, meanwhile gifted students are having the chance of studying at the libraries and scientific centers under the institute's administration. Lectures at the institute are mainly given in Uzbek and Russian languages, but gifted students are given chance to have lectures in English language. There are 4000 students who enter the institute every year, to obtain their bachelor's and master's degrees. \n\nThe campus of the institute also consists of big library with the 400 thousand books, scientific and literal materials. TARCI has its own polygraphing center and complex of dormitories. TARCI has created big scientific schools for its students which are created by the representative of science in Uzbekistan. \n\nThe main role in development of the TARCI plays cooperation with many international universities, local and global corporations. 450 successful graduates from TARCI, who graduated from TARCI between 1978 and 2004, are currently emplo in 25 foreign countries.\n\nNowadays, TARCI is training specialists in 11 branches of bachelor's degree and 17 branches for master's degree. 57 percent of all the teachers at institute have their scientific degrees.\n\nThere are 4 faculties currently acting at TARCI and they are: “Transport and Transport Communications Control Faculty”, “Road Construction Faculty”, “Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty”, “Auto mechanics Faculty”. All of the faculties are based on automobile and road constructing.\n\nThe main goal of the transport and transport communications faculty is covering high local demands for professionals on transports field. The dean of the faculty is Yuldasheva Saodat Arslanovna.\n\nThe history of this faculty is linked with the history of the institute, as it was created simultaneously with the TARCI in 1972. The head of the faculty was docent S.X. Xusnitdinov, who controlled the faculty till the year of 1979. In the first years there were 4 departments in the faculty, which were \"Automobile Roads Planning\", \"Exploitation of Automobile Roads\", \"Road Constructing Materials\", \"Road Constructing Machines\". When it was established there were 117 students engaged with the studies.\n\nIn 1979 it was renamed to \"Road Construction Faculty\". 1972–86 there were 7 departments, 1987–95 there were 12–14 departments, 1995–2000 there were 7 departments and currently there are 4 departments at the faculty. Currently, the dean of \"Road Construction Faculty\" is Salimova Barno Jamalovna.\n\nThe Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty is the oldest faculty of the institute, it was created even before the TARCI in 1943, under the \"Central Asian Industrial Institute\", which is now Tashkent State Technical University. However, initially it was established as the department in \"Mechanics Faculty\" and was called \"Automobiles\". First head of the department was G.A. Kuzminov.\n\nOn the base of this department \"Automobile Roads\" faculty was established in 1969. After creation of TARCI 1972 the faculty was given to the institute and was renamed to its current name, which is \"Automobile Transport Exploitation Faculty\". Nowadays the dean of the faculty is Xakimov Ravshan Muminovich. \n\nThe seven departments in the faculty are:\n\nGraduates are currently working at the big automobile concerns and holding of Republic Uzbekistan in leading positions. Graduates from the faculty may also work at automobile factories, in auto transport and auto repairing companies and at many other companies which are mainly focus on automobiles. \n\nThe Auto Mechanics Faculty is the youngest faculty of TARCI. It was established in 1993 after opening of automobile industry in Republic Uzbekistan with the name of \"Automobile utilization\". During the years of 1993 to 1995 it was controlled by docent D.R. Kulmuhamedov. However, interest among the applicants decreased rapidly and in order to save the faculty it was mixed with the faculty of \"Automobile Transports\" in 1995 and was renamed as \"Automobile Industry\". After 3 years it was reset in 1998 at the \"Auto Mechanics Faculty\". \n\nThere are 6 departments located in the faculty, and they are:\n\nThe faculty cooperates with some local and international universities which are: “Moscow Automobile Roads Institute”, “Transport Academy of Kyrgyzstan”, “Tashkent State Technical University\" and many others.

Conti which covers combat-related situations arising in the course of standard law enforcement. Together with \"Police Pistolcraft\", it forms the basis for the current pistol training program of the Massachusetts State Police and has been adopted by a range of other law enforcement jurisdictions.\n\n\"The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft\" describes a method of training and philosophy of pistolcraft developed by Michael E. Conti, an officer of the Massachusetts State police, and follows and expands Conti's 2007 book \"Police Pistolcraft\".\n\nConti joined the Massachusetts State Police in 1986 and as of 2009 is still a serving officer. During his career, he has held assignments ranging from uniformed patrol, high-crime area community policing, SWAT and special security details, and undercover narcotics and death investigations. Since 1991 he has acted as a professional trainer and holds instructor certifications in various use of force disciplines.\n\nIn January 2000, Conti was given the task of setting up and putting into operation a Firearms Training Unit (FTU) for the State Police. The unit was to be responsible for conducting yearly qualification courses of fire for department personnel, and for training academy recruits in firearms use. As part of his work in this role, Conti developed a new style of training which he describes as \"reality-based\", as he felt that the traditional sight-oriented and marksmanship-based approach that was until that time being used did not meet the needs of police officers on the street.\n\nThe new style of training emphasised Applegate-style target focused shooting, complemented by sight-focused precision shooting at appropriate distances. Conti constructed a purpose-built training facility at Massachusetts State Police headquarters to demonstrate his revised training program.\n\nIn 2007 Conti used this new training paradigm as the basis of his book \"Police Pistolcraft\". Following the publication of that book, a demand emerged for a text detailing the specific methods of the \"new paradigm,\" which led Conti to write \"The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft\". Conti is also the author of \"Beyond Pepper Spray: The Complete Guide to Chemical Agents, Delivery Systems, and Protective Masks\" (Paladin Press, 2002).\n\nThe training methods described in \"The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft\" are currently in use by the Massachusetts State Police, and the book and associated training philosophy has been adopted by law enforcement agencies in many other jurisdictions.\n\nThe critical reception among law enforcement reviewers has been generally positive.\n\nRalph Mroz of the Police Officers Safety Association, in a review at Officer.com, described the book as \"different... and necessary!\" He said the book was \"written by a consummate police training professional\" and went on to say, \"I recommend it as highly as I recommended (and continue to recommend) the earlier \"Police Pistolcraft\".\" Mroz singled out the \"frank discussion of the necessary relationship between a professional police officer and his/her skill with arms\" as \"as refreshing as it is unusual these days\".\n\nJohn Veit reviewed the book in a widely republished article on Law Officer Connect, where he praised the book, calling attention to its plain English language and conversational style. \"Some chapters read like a good novel and not a field manual,\" he said. \"They are filled with helpful and practical ways of carrying out the day to day tasks of an officer.\" He concluded, \"This book is a very good read, and promises to be a long standing and authoritative survival guide for police officers as well as others who have a handgun for self defense use.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Law Encorcement Firearms Instructors & Armorers Association reviewed the book for their publication \"The Case Head\". They said, \"The Officer's Guide is full of solid training information, photos and diagrams,\" and applauded Conti's style, saying, \"I could not help but notice how the reader is treated with respect. [...] This will be perfect for the officer who was looking for better firearms training but was unable to get it at their agency.\" They praised Conti's refusal to enter into a philosophical battle between point-shooting and aimed fire, saying, \"The New Paradigm takes the best of all worlds and rolls them into one program.\" The Association concluded by saying the book \"is highly recommended and will be a well used addition to every firearms instructor’s reference library. If you have adopted the New Paradigm, this book should be standard issue for every student you have.\"\n\n\"The Officer's Guide to Police Pistolcraft\" contains 424 pages, divided into 12 chapters and illustrated with 316 photos and diagrams. It sets out what the author calls \"the reality-based new paradigm of police firearms training,\" a program he claims to have developed in 2000 while serving as the Director of the Massachusetts State Police Firearms Training Unit. It contains helpful and practical advice about carrying out the day-to-day tasks of a law enforcement officer, and also deals with the obligations and responsibilities of \"the modern day warrior.\" It aims to provide specific detail on subjects covered in \"Police Pistolcraft\" and instruct on when a law enforcement officer should use their pistol, and how they should use it.\n\nThe book focuses on combat and specifically aims to prepare officers to know when to use their pistol and how to use it. The training system covers both sighted and point shooting techniques, drawing on systems of combat pistol shooting and training originating from such diverse sources as World War II and \"the dim and dark streets and back alleys of Shanghai.\"\n\nThe book's main emphasis is on pistol training that recognises the reality of day-to-day police operations, rather than the isolated competitive training previously in use.\n\nSpecific topics covered include safety, pistol handling and manipulation, basic skills and alternative shooting positions, pistol retention, mental preparation, low light, plainclothes considerations and left-hand shooter considerations. There is a section about the issues that female officers face in both uniformed and plain clothes assignments. An appendix covers revolvers, as the author feels many new recruits in modern law enforcement have never seen one.\n"}

His career spanned the disciplines of social work, social policy, psychology, education, public administration and social research.\n\nVinson's long and diverse career in social research, education, government services, prison reform, and community development, has included many projects on social disadvantage and young people. Vinson has also studied the impact of cumulative medico-social problems and life opportunities generally. The determinative influence of education (or life prospects) has remained a theme in this strand of his research, culminating in the recent publication of an influential study on the distribution of social disadvantage in Victoria and New South Wales.\nHis work as the Foundation Professor in Behavioural science within the University of Newcastle (NSW) in the 1970s followed research into connections between social factors, and pregnancy outcomes, including the health and progress of young children. At Newcastle, an important educational experience was his involvement in the development of the problem-based learning approach adopted for the new medical course. This approach incorporated many of the key elements of the educational approach considered as somewhat radical departures in the field of school education. Vinson also instigated the broadly based admission procedures adopted by the medical faculty.\n\nFollowing three years as Head of the NSW Department of Corrective Services (1979–81) during a period of intense penal reform, Vinson took up an appointment as Professor of Social Work at the University of New South Wales. Over subsequent years he has served as Head of School and Dean. He has twice been a Visiting Professor at the University of Stockholm and has observed the operation of Swedish social services, including early schooling. There have also been Visiting Professor appointments in the Netherlands and government consultancies in the South Pacific. In 1980 Vinson chaired a Commonwealth Government Inquiry into health and social services in the ACT.\n\nIn recent years Vinson has had an extensive involvement in assessing schemes to protect children exposed to the dangers of abuse. Some of these projects have included the evaluation of professional practices, including the co-operation of schools with government and non-government services. Others have dealt with the social contexts and environments in which abusive practices occur. This work has been published internationally in journals such as the \"British Journal of Social Work\" and \"Modern Medicine\" as well as within Australia by the Institute of Criminology and other authorities.\n\nOn Vinson's initiative, the UNSW School of Social Work, in partnership with the NSW Department of Housing, residents, and local community bodies, formed a community development centre on the Waterloo Housing Estate. Tony Vinson has had the title Professor Emeritus conferred on him by the University of New South Wales.\n\nThis purpose-built community centre in Mildura, named after Vinson is designed to co-locate agency programs Chances for Children, Reading Discovery, Learning for Life, The Portland House Project and the proposed Youth Engagement Program for Early years. It opened in 2008.\n\nThe Vinson Inquiry was commissioned by the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations in 2002 to consider the state of public education in New South Wales and provide recommendations for the future. The inquiry visited and conducted public hearings at schools and TAFE colleges throughout the state.\n\nThe recommendations of the inquiry caused controversy, in a large part due to its recommendation that the number of academically selective high schools and opportunity classes be significantly reduced. However, despite support for the report from the Education Minister John Watkins, most of the recommendations, including those on academically selective education, were not acted upon.\n\n\"Dropping off the Edge\": the distribution of disadvantage in Australia was the most comprehensive national study of its kind. The report, which is a joint project with Jesuit Social Services and Catholic Social Services Australia was written by Vinson, providing a picture of areas of entrenched disadvantage nationally. The report found that just 1.7 per cent of postcodes and communities across Australia accounted for more than seven times their share of top rank positions on the major factors that cause intergenerational poverty. Vinson said:\n\"Our findings demand recognition of a common pattern associated with inadequate education and training–unemployment, low income, poor health and 'making ends meet' by criminal means, resulting in high rates of convictions and imprisonment. Where these characteristics are concentrated there, too, we find high levels of confirmed child maltreatment.\"\n\nIn September 1986 Vinson released a report dealing with the sentencing of drug cases in the NSW District Court between 1980 and 1982, which purported to find that a particular judge had exercised leniency in dealing with clients of a particular solicitor. It was revealed later that Judge John Foord was the judge in question. He was stood down from the District Court in September 1986 and resigned on medical grounds later that year. One consequence of these and other events was the passing of the Judicial Officers Act 1986, establishing a formalised system of judicial accountability.\n\nOn 21 May 2008 Vinson was announced as a founding member of the Australian Social Inclusion Board, which brought together leaders from around the country to tackle disadvantage.\n\n\nVinson once wrote a jazz single which was aired on ABC radio.\n\nVinson was appointed a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day honours list 2008 for service to social welfare through academic, government and community roles, as a contributor to state and federal policy formulation, and as a champion of social justice.\n\nVinson was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters in Social Work (honoris causa) from the University of Sydney, as well as being an Honorary Professor in the School of Social Work and Policy Studies at the University of Sydney from which he graduated in 1956. He is also an Emeritus Professor of the University of New South Wales.\n\nVinson died at Woollahra, New South Wales on 17 February 2017.\n\nB.A., Dip. Soc. Studies (Sydney) 1956; Dip.

Founded on , Virginia State developed as the United States's first fully state-supported four-year institution of higher learning for black Americans. The university is a member school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.\n\nVirginia State University was founded on March 6, 1882, when the legislature passed a bill to charter the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute. The bill was sponsored by Delegate Alfred W. Harris, a black attorney whose offices were in Petersburg, but who lived in and represented Dinwiddie County in the General Assembly. A hostile lawsuit delayed opening day for nineteen months, until October 1, 1883. In 1902, the legislature revised the charter act to curtail the collegiate program and to change the name to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1920, the land-grant program for Blacks was moved from a private school, Hampton Institute, where it had been since 1872, to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1923 the college program was restored, and the name was changed to Virginia State College for Negroes in 1930. The two-year branch in Norfolk was added to the college in 1944; the Norfolk division became a four-year branch in 1956 and gained independence as Norfolk State College in 1969. Meanwhile, the parent school was renamed Virginia State College in 1946. Finally, the legislature passed a law in 1979 to provide the present name, Virginia State University.\n\nIn the first academic year, 1883–84, the University had 126 students and seven faculty (all of them Black), one building, 33 acres, a 200-book library, and a $20,000 budget. By the centennial year of 1982, the University was fully integrated, with a student body of nearly 5,000, a full-time faculty of about 250, a library containing 200,000 books and 360,000 microform and non-print items, a 236-acre campus and 416- acre farm, more than 50 buildings, including 15 dormitories and 16 classroom buildings, and a biennial budget of $31,000,000, exclusive of capital outlay.\n\nThe university is situated in Chesterfield County at Ettrick, on a bluff across the Appomattox River from the city of Petersburg. It is accessible via Interstate Highways 95 and 85, which meet in Petersburg. The university is only two and a half hours away from Washington, D.C. to the north, the Raleigh-Durham- Chapel Hill area to the southwest, and Charlottesville to the northwest.\n\nThe first person to bear the title of President, John Mercer Langston, was one of the best-known blacks of his day. Until 1992, he was the only black ever elected to the United States Congress from Virginia (elected in 1888), and he was the great-uncle of the famed writer Langston Hughes. From 1888 to 1968, four presidents - James H. Johnston, John M. Gandy, Luther H. Foster, Robert P. Daniel served an average of 20 years, helping the school to overcome adversity and move forward. The next twenty years, 1968-1992, saw six more presidents—James F. Tucker, Wendell P. Russell, Walker H. Quarles, Jr., Thomas M. Law, Wilbert Greenfield, and Wesley Cornelious McClure. On June 1, 1993, Eddie N. Moore, Jr., the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Virginia, became the twelfth President of Virginia State University. Dr. Keith T. Miller became Virginia State University's 13th president from 2010 to 2014. In 2015, Dr. Pamela V. Hammond became the first woman to lead Virginia State University in 133 years. She was appointed as interim president on January 1, 2015. On February 1, 2016, President Makola Abdullah, Ph.D., was named as the 14th president of Virginia State University. Dr. Abdullah previously served as provost and senior vice president at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Fla. President Abdullah is a Chicago native who is the youngest African American to receive a Ph.D. in engineering. He earned his undergraduate degree from Howard University in civil engineering and a Master of Science in civil engineering from Northwestern University.\n\nThe university has a main campus and a agricultural research facility known as the Randolph Farm. The main campus includes more than 50 buildings, including 11 dormitories and 18 academic buildings. The main campus is located close to the Appomattox River in Ettrick, Virginia.\n\n\nThis is a list of the departments within each college:\n\n\nThe 2017–2018 student body was 57.4% female and 43% male. It consists of 69.7% in-state and 30.3% out-of-state students. 97.2% of students live on campus and 2.8% off-campus. 91.1% of students self-identify as Black/African American, while 4.0% are White, and 4.0% are racially unreported.\n\nVirginia State University has a very active National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) along with six other non Pan-Hellenic fraternities and sororities which include the following active fraternities and sororities:\n\nThe Virginia State University Trojan Explosion is composed of instrumentalists, Essence of Troy Dancers, Satin Divas Flag, and Troy Elegance Twirlers.\n\nThe famed “Marching 110,” was built during the leadership of Dr. F. Nathaniel Pops Gatlin and Dr. Claiborne T. Richardson. In 1984 the marching band was renamed the “Trojan Explosion” under the direction of Harold J. Haughton, Sr. and the music department began to grow. In 2013, Professor James Holden, Jr. became Director of Bands. In addition to serving as Director of the world renowned VSU Gospel Chorale, Professor Holden has served as Assistant Director of Bands since 1984. Arguably one of the top arrangers in the country, Professor Holden is known throughout the musical world as an exquisite saxophonist.\n\nThe renowned Trojan Explosion Marching Band is a captivating show style band executing high intensity, musicality and showmanship on and off the field. The Trojan Explosion has been selected to attend the Honda Battle of the Bands 9 consecutive years. In addition to numerous accolades and achievements, the drum line performed at the White House for President Barack Obama during the signing of the HBCU Funding Bill.The Trojan explosion Dawn's blue and orange for home games and blue,orange,and white for away games.\n\nOriginally led by head coach Paulette Johnson for 35 years, the Woo Woos are a nationally recognized cheerleading squad known for original, up-tempo and high energy performances. The 30 member squad is composed of young women from all over the country. The squad focuses on community service as well as promoting school spirit. Tryouts are held annually during the spring semester for VSU full-time students. Instructional camps and workshops are offered throughout the state. \n\nIn 2001, the university granted the Woo Woo Alumni chapter its initial charter. The organization has a rapidly growing membership that is actively involved in the promotion of the squad and its individual members. Shandra Claiborne, a former Woo Woo, led the team for one year following the retirement of Johnson. The squad has been under the leadership of former Woo Woo Cassandra Artis-Williams since 2013.\n\nThe Department of Music had a recording Concert Choir. In 1974, This choir recorded an album entitled \"The Undine Smith Moore Song Book\" a recording in the series of \"Afro-American heritage in songs.\" This recording was third in the series, which aspired to produce a recording each year of the works of this black composer who was a former faculty member and co-director of the Black Man in American Music Center. The choir also performed selections from this series in Baltimore at Bethel AME Church,\" including songs from a group of gospel selections arranged by VSC students Larry Bland, Janet Coleman, and Roger Holliman.\" Several graduates of VSC were living in Baltimore, and came to join the choir at the end of the program as they sang the \"Evening Song.\"\nThis list includes graduates, non-graduate former students and current students of Virginia State University.\n"}

The stated mission of the Youth Challenge Program is \"to intervene in and reclaim the lives of at-risk youth to produce program graduates with the values, skills, education and self-discipline necessary to succeed as adults.\" The program accepts 16- to 18-year-old male and female high school dropouts who are drug-free and not in trouble with the law. The program lasts for 17½ months. The first 5½ months are part of the quasi-military Residential Phase. The last 12 months are part of the Post-Residential Phase. Most participants will earn their GED or a high school diploma by the end of their Residential Phase.\n\nThe program is one of many programs administered by the National Guard Bureau that address leadership, life skills, and physical training.\n\n\nThe following is a list of states who participate in the Youth Challenge Program. Some states have multiple campuses; for example, Georgia has a YCA at both Ft. Stewart and Ft. Gordon, but both fall under the same state director.\n\n\n\n"}
