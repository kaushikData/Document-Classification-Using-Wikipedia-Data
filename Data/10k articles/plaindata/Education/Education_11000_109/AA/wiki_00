In both cases, the person reporting the emergency communicates with the 9-1-1 call-taker by tapping in a specific pattern with a finger, pen, key, etc., on the mouthpiece of the phone or the speaker section of the call box.\n\nTwo tapping patterns are used in order to distinguish the type of assistance requested: a steady tapping pattern indicates a request for Police assistance, while a repeated two-tap pattern indicates a request for Fire and Emergency Medical Service (“EMS”) response. The person reporting the emergency should employ the appropriate tapping method for at least 90 seconds, and ideally until the requested emergency services arrive. If possible, the person should remain at the pay phone or call box location to direct arriving Police, Fire, or EMS personnel to the emergency.\n\nThe tapping protocol was introduced in 1996 in order to meet a federal court's requirement that New York offer a 9-1-1 notification alternative that would \"provide the hearing-impaired with a means of identifying not only their location, but also the type of emergency being reported.\" Under New York City’s Enhanced 9-1-1 (\"E-911\") system, every telephone and emergency call box automatically transmits its location to 911 operators, so that an operator receiving a tapping call will have the caller's location on-screen and will be able to distinguish, by the tapping pattern, which emergency services are being requested.\n\nThe tapping protocol and E-911 system have been in place in New York City since then.\n\n"}
{"id": "15348203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15348203", "title": "Aliteracy", "text": "Aliteracy\n\nAliteracy (sometimes spelled alliteracy) is the state of being able to read but being uninterested in doing so. This phenomenon has been reported on as a problem occurring separately from illiteracy, which is more common in the developing world, while aliteracy is primarily a problem in the developed world. In 2002, John Ramsey defined aliteracy as a loss of a reading habit usually since reading is slow and frustrating for the reader.\n\nIn a publication analyzing the 1972 International Book Year, an estimate was given that as many as 57% of the citizens of an unnamed European nation known for their production of important books did not read books, or that 43% were book readers. Estimates for other industrialized nations' active readers ranged from 33 to 55%.\n\nJim Trelease, author of \"The Read-Aloud Handbook\", has stated that this trend away from the written word is more than worrisome, and that it's tearing apart culture. People who have stopped reading, he says, \"base their future decisions on what they used to know...If you don't read much, you really don't know much...you're dangerous.\"\n\nAmerican historian Daniel Boorstin, in 1984, while serving as librarian of Congress, issued a landmark report: \"Books in Our Future\". Citing recent statistics that only about half of all Americans read regularly every year, he referred to the \"twin menaces\" of illiteracy and aliteracy. \"In the United States today,\" Boorstin wrote, \"aliteracy is widespread.\" In the United States, a 2008 study reported that 46.7% of adult Americans did not read a book not required for work or school during 2002.\nAnother alert to this phenomenon was a 1991 editorial in \"Fortune\" magazine by Stratford P. Sherman (with Laurie Kretchmar). It refers to a study by John P. Robinson, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading. Samuel Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, is quoted on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book.\n\nKylene Beers' 1996 study connected aliteracy with reading motivation in teens. She noted unmotivated readers complained about not connecting with the text and could not \"see\" or visualize what was happening in the book. The inability to relate to the characters reduced the desire to read.\n\nRobert Putnam, in his book \"Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community\" argues that television has fragmented our society.\n\nMotorola is mentioned as making preparations to pay $5,000,000 to teach their workers reading skills, and Ford Motor Company is described as, since 1982, having already sent 32,000 workers to a similar program. Publisher Simon & Schuster was quoted as predicting a market of $500,000,000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations.\n\nSteven Layne's book, \"Igniting a Passion for Reading\" discusses several proven methods that readers can do to increase the desire to read in others.\n\nOne method is to read aloud, both to children and adults. Reading aloud allows the listener to hear the story without struggling through decoding the words and possible frustration.\n\nAnother method, used in schools, is to encourage students to read every day, choosing for themselves what to read, and reading simply for enjoyment. This is often referred to as Sustained Silent Reading (SSR). Dr. Stephen Krashen, a leading proponent of SSR, looked at 54 studies of such programs and found that in general they were successful at improving reading skills and building a reading habit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "665435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=665435", "title": "American Mathematics Competitions", "text": "American Mathematics Competitions\n\nThe American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) are the first of a series of competitions in secondary school mathematics that determine the United States team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). The selection process takes place over the course of roughly four stages. At the last stage, the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program (MOP), the United States coaches select six members to form the IMO team. The United States Math Team of 1994 is the only team ever to achieve a perfect score (all six members earned perfect marks), and is colloquially known as the \"dream team\".\n\nThere are three levels:\n\nStudents who perform well on the AMC 10 or AMC 12 exams are invited to participate in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). Students who perform well on the AIME are then invited to the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) or United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO). Students who do exceptionally well on the USAMO (typically around 30 students) are invited to go to the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program (MOSP or more commonly, MOP), and six students are selected from the top twelve scorers on the USAMO (through yet another exam, the Team Selection Test (TST)) to form the United States International Math Olympiad Team.\n\nAmerican Mathematics Competitions is also the name of the organization, based in Washington, DC, responsible for creating, distributing and coordinating the American Mathematics Competitions contests, which include the American Mathematics Contest, AIME, and USAMO.\n\nThe \"members of the Committee on the American Mathematics Competitions (CAMC) are dedicated to the goal of strengthening the mathematical capabilities of our nation's youth. The CAMC believes that one way to meet this goal is to identify, recognize and reward excellence in mathematics through a series of national contests called the American Mathematics Competitions\". The AMC include: the American Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC 8) (formerly the American Junior High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 8 and below, begun in 1985; the American Mathematics Contest 10 (AMC 10), for students in grades 9 and 10, begun in 2000; the American Mathematics Contest 12 (AMC 12) (formerly the American High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 11 and 12, begun in 1950; the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), begun in 1983; and the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), begun in 1972.\n\nThere are certain rewards for doing well on the AMC tests. For the AMC 8, a perfect score may earn a book prize or a plaque (as it did for the students who achieved perfect scores in 2002); a list of high scoring students is also available to colleges, institutions, and programs who want to attract students strong in mathematics. This may earn a high scorer an invitation to places like MathPath, a summer program for middle schoolers. The top-scoring student in each school is also awarded a special pin.\n\nFor the AMC 10 and AMC 12, a high score earns recognition (in particular, perfect scorers' names and pictures are published in a special awards book); as with the AMC 8, a list of high-scoring students is also available to colleges, institutions, etc. The top-scoring student in each school is awarded a special pin, or a bronze, silver, or gold medal, depending on how many times he or she was the top scorer.\n\nIn addition, high scorers on the AMC 10 and AMC 12 qualify to take the next round of competitions, the 3-hour long American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), typically held in March or April. Any student who scores in the top 1% on the AMC 10 (or 2.5% as of 2011), scores in the top 5% on the AMC 12, scores at least 100 points on the AMC 12, or scores at least 120 on the AMC 10 is invited to take the AIME.* The answer to each of the 15 questions on the AIME is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, so while it is technically a multiple-choice test, it is not one in practice.\n\nThe combined scores of the AMC 12 and the AIME are used to determine approximately 270 individuals that will be invited back to take a 9-hour, 2-day, 6-problem session of proofs known as the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), while the combined scores of the AMC 10 and the AIME are used to determine approximately 230 individuals that will be invited to take the United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO), which follows the same format. Approximately thirty students are selected based on their USAMO performance to be trained at the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program, or MOSP (better known as MOP to its participants). Approximately 12 of the top USAJMO scorers are invited as well. Unless qualifying for a particularly high level, all students must be in 9th grade or higher to be admitted into MOSP, and high school seniors are admitted only if they are members of that year's IMO team.\n\nDuring this summer camp, a 3-day exam (the TSTST) is given to determine the approximately 18 individuals who will form the TSTST group. These individuals take a series of contests throughout the year, such as the Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad, to finally pick the 6 member US Mathematics Team that will represent the US at the International Math Olympiad. The current head coach of the US IMO team is Po-Shen Loh from Carnegie Mellon University\n\nThe AMC 8 is a 25 multiple-choice question, 40-minute test for middle schoolers designed to promote the development and enhancement of problem-solving skills. No problems require the use of a calculator, and their use has been banned since 2008. Though the contest is typically held on a Thursday in November, in 2018 the AMC 8 will take place on Tuesday, November 13.\n\nThe AMC 8 is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly only. There is no penalty for getting a question wrong, and each question has equal value. Thus, a student who answers 23 questions correctly and 2 questions incorrectly receives a score of 23. This is not a standardized test; i.e. no school has to take it, but some schools choose to, mainly to encourage growth in mathematics among their students. Full scorers on the AMC 8 (25/25) get recognition and their picture on the AMCs website as a top scorer.\n\nRanking\n\nBased on questions correct:\n\nAwards\n\nThe AMC 10 and AMC 12 are 25 question, 75-minute multiple choice examinations in secondary school mathematics containing problems which can be understood and solved with pre-calculus concepts. From 1994-2007, calculators were allowed, but like the AMC 8, unneeded.\n\nSince the 2007-2008 school year, calculators have been disallowed on all of the selection tests for the International Math Olympiad Team (including AMC, AIME, USAMO, TST)\n\nHigh scores on the AMC 10 or 12 can qualify the participant for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). On the AMC 10, the top 2.5 % make it; around 110 to 120 points. On the AMC 12, the top 5% make it; around 90 to 100 points.\n\nEach exam is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly and the number of questions left blank. A student receives 6 points for each question answered correctly, 1.5 points for each question left blank, and no points for incorrect answers. Thus, a student who answers 18 correctly, leaves 5 blanks, and misses 2 gets 18×6 + 5×1.5 = 115.5 points. The maximum possible score is 6×25 = 150 points; in 2006, the AMC 12 had a total of 17 perfect scores between its two administrations, while the AMC 10 had 89.\n\nFrom 1974 until 1999, the exam had 30 questions and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally during this time period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however, it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted questions. When the exam was shortened as part of the 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student must answer at least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.\n\nThe exams somewhat overlap, with the medium-hard AMC 10 questions being the same as the medium-easy ones on the AMC 12. Since 2002, two administrations have been scheduled, so as to avoid conflicts with school breaks. Students are eligible to take an A exam and a B exam, and may even take the AMC 10-A and the AMC 12-B, though they may not take both the AMC 10 and AMC 12 from the same date. If a student takes both exams, they may use either score towards qualification to the AIME or USAMO.\n\n\n"}

Tanenbaum\n\nAndrew Stuart Tanenbaum (born March 16, 1944), sometimes referred to by the handle ast, is an American-Dutch computer scientist and professor emeritus of computer science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\n\nHe is best known as the author of MINIX, a free Unix-like operating system for teaching purposes, and for his computer science textbooks, regarded as standard texts in the field. He regards his teaching job as his most important work. Since 2004 he has operated Electoral-vote.com, a website dedicated to analysis of polling data in federal elections in the United States.\n\nTanenbaum was born in New York City and grew up in suburban White Plains, New York. He is Jewish. His paternal grandfather was born in Khorostkiv in the Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\nHe received his bachelor of Science degree in Physics from MIT in 1965 and his Ph.D. degree in astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971. Tanenbaum also served as a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.\n\nHe moved to the Netherlands to live with his wife, who is Dutch, but he retains his United States citizenship. He teaches courses about Computer Organization and Operating Systems and supervises the work of Ph.D. candidates at the VU University Amsterdam. On , he announced his retirement.\n\nTanenbaum is well recognized for his textbooks on computer science. They include:\n\nHis book, \"Operating Systems: Design and Implementation\" and MINIX were Linus Torvalds' inspiration for the Linux kernel. In his autobiography \"Just for Fun\", Torvalds describes it as \"the book that launched me to new heights\".\n\nHis books have been translated into many languages including Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Mexican Spanish, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish. They have appeared in over 175 editions and are used at universities around the world.\n\nTanenbaum has had a number of Ph.D. students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.\nThese include:\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the Vrije Universiteit, University of Amsterdam, Delft University of Technology, and Leiden University. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\nThe Amsterdam Compiler Kit is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.\n\nIn 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of UNIX, called MINIX (MINi-unIX), for the IBM PC. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text. The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a Usenet newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own (POSIX like) kernel, called Linux, which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code.\n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one. The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure operating system. The system is based on a microkernel, with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode. The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. MINIX 3, as the current version is called, is available under the BSD license for free.\n\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a postdoctoral researcher. These projects include:\n\nIn 2004, Tanenbaum created Electoral-vote.com, a web site analyzing opinion polls for the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election, using them to project the outcome in the Electoral College. He stated that he created the site as an American who \"knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.\" The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as \"the Votemaster\" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred John Kerry. Mentioning that he supported the Democrats, he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day before the election, and also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.\n\nThrough the site he also covered the 2006 midterm elections, correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.\n\nFor the 2008 elections, he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by Norm Coleman over Al Franken. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were Colorado and Nevada.\n\nHe incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 United States presidential election.\n\nThe Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on Usenet in 1992.\n\n\n\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n\n"}

{"id": "2416403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2416403", "title": "Ballet master", "text": "Ballet master\n\nBallet Master (also \"Balletmaster\", \"Ballet Mistress\" [increasingly archaic English language use], \"Premier Maître de ballet\" or \"Premier Maître de ballet en Chef\") is the term used for an employee of a ballet company who is responsible for the level of competence of the dancers in their company. In modern times, ballet masters are generally charged with teaching the daily company ballet class and rehearsing the dancers for both new and established ballets in the company's repertoire. The artistic director of a ballet company, whether a male or female, may also be called its ballet master. Historic use of gender marking in job titles in ballet (and live theatre) is being supplanted by gender-neutral language job titles regardless of an employee's gender (e.g. \"Ballet Master\" in lieu of \"Ballet Mistress\", \"Wig Master\" as an alternative to \"Wig Mistress\"). \n\nEspecially during the early centuries of ballet troupes and ballet companies from the 18th century until the early 20th century, the position of \"First\" Ballet master, referred to traditionally as the \"Premier Maître de ballet en Chef\" or more simply as the \"Maître de ballet\", was the undisputed head of the company who acted as chief choreographer and \"Artistic Director\". His duties included creating ballets, dances in operas, commissioning music, and presiding over the teaching of the dancers and style desired. It was this head ballet master who had the responsibility of the artistic directorship of a particular group of dancers or of a theatre.\n\nAfter the early 20th century, primarily after the disbandment of the original Ballets Russes, the title has been used more to describe the master teachers/assistant directors of a ballet company, (previously known as \"Second\" Ballet master), with the head of a company being referred to as the \"Artistic Director\".\n\n"}

If the master's attempts to re-enter were successful, extra tasks were inflicted as a penalty, and willingly performed by the boys. On the third day terms of capitulation, usually in Latin verse, were signed, and these always conceded the immediate right to indulge in football and a cockfight. The custom was long retained at Eton College and figures in many school stories, including the story \"The Barring Out: or Party Spirit\" in \"The Parent's Assistant\"\nby Maria Edgeworth (1796), and the 1948 Billy Bunter story \"Barring Out\".)\n\nMore serious incidents of barring out reportedly took place at The Royal School, Armagh, and Belfast Royal Academy in Northern Ireland; and at the Royal High School, Edinburgh.\n\nDr. Samuel Johnson reports a story that Joseph Addison, when a schoolboy, was the ringleader of a barring out at his school.\n\nThe custom extended to some early American Colonial schools, such as William and Mary College in Virginia, where students barred out Dr. James Blair and shot at him with pistols when he attempted to enter. According to \nDavid Hackett Fischer, the custom became common in the southern highlands and the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, though occasionally taking place elsewhere in the colonies.\n\nBarring out continued in Falstone, a village in Northumberland, until 1940 when the headmaster William Moody, who was unaware of the custom, demanded entrance to his school and the students eventually relented and let him enter.\n\n"}

The group, founded in June 1942, consisted of students from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich who distributed leaflets against the Nazis' war policy. Christoph Probst belonged, along with the Scholl siblings, Willi Graf and Alexander Schmorell to the tightest circle, into which university professor Kurt Huber also came.\n\nThe members of White Rose put together, printed and distributed, at the risk of their lives, six leaflets in all. On 18 February 1943, the Scholls were distributing the sixth leaflet at the university when they were discovered by a custodian, who delivered them to the Gestapo.\n\nOn 22 February 1943, Christoph Probst and the Scholls were tried and sentenced together at the \"Volksgerichtshof\" by judge Roland Freisler, who was known for often determining sentences even before the trial, and all three were sentenced to death by guillotine. Their sentences were carried out on the very same day at Stadelheim Prison in Munich.\n\nTheir grave may be found in the graveyard bordering the execution place, \"Am Perlacher Forst\".\n\nHis father, Hermann Probst, was a private scholar and Sanskrit researcher, fostered contacts with artists who were deemed by the Nazis to be \"decadent\". After his first marriage with Karin Katharina Kleeblatt, Christoph's mother, broke up in 1919, he married Elise Jaffée, who was Jewish. Christoph's sister, Angelika, remembers that her brother was strongly critical of Nazi ideas that violated human dignity.\n\nProbst went to boarding school at Marquartstein and Landheim Schondorf, which was also not conducive to fostering Nazi German ideas, and at 17, he matriculated. After military service, he began his medical studies with great earnestness. Aged 21, he married Herta Dohrn, with whom he had three children: Michael, Vincent and Katja.\n\nChristoph Probst came rather late into the White Rose as he did not belong to the same student corps as Hans Scholl, Alexander Schmorell and Willi Graf, and stayed for the most part in the background, as he had to think of his family. He wrote some of the text for the White Rose's leaflet which Hans Scholl was carrying with him when he and his sister Sophie went to the university on 18 February 1943 to distribute leftover copies of the sixth leaflet.\n\nWhen the Scholl siblings were arrested at the University of Munich, the Gestapo acquired proof against Probst. Before his execution he requested to be and was baptized by a Roman Catholic priest. He was executed on 22 February 1943, along with Hans and Sophie Scholl, despite asking for clemency during interrogation. He also requested a trial for the sake of his wife and three children, who were aged three years, two years and four weeks old. His wife, Herta Probst, was sick with childbed fever at the time.\n\nOn 3 November 1999, Christoph Probst was included in the martyrology of the Catholic church.\n\nChristoph Probst was portrayed by Florian Stetter in the film \"\".\n\n"}

Design-based learning environments can be found across many disciplines, including those traditionally associated with design (e.g. art, architecture, engineering, interior design, graphic design), as well as others not normally considered to be design-related (science, technology, business, humanities). DBL, as well as project-based learning and problem-based learning, is used to teach 21st century skills such as communication and collaboration and foster deeper learning.\n\nDeeper learning is supported when students design and create an artifact that requires understanding and application of knowledge. DBL activity supports iteration as students create, assess, and redesign their projects. The work's complexity often requires collaboration and specialized roles, providing students with the opportunity to become “experts” in a particular area. Design projects require students to establish goals and constraints, generate ideas, and create prototypes through storyboarding or other representational practices. Robotics competitions in schools are popular design-based learning activities, wherein student teams design, build and then pilot their robots in competitive challenges. \nDesign-based learning was developed in the 1980s by Doreen Nelson, a professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and the Art Center College of Design. Her findings suggested that kinesthetic problem-solving helps students acquire, retain, and synthesize information in practical ways.\n\nThe design process is an iterative process that has a variety of sequential steps: \nA similar approach is the ADDIE Model of instructional design, a framework of generic processes used by instructional designers and training developers. It represents a descriptive guideline with five distinct phases:\n\nPositive benefits of the design-based learning approach have been observed, including student-based learning where students (often) identify their project's needs, develop their own ideas, and engage in a larger range of thinking than with the traditional scripted inquiry model. The results from the 2008 study by Mehalik et al. found significant improvement in student performance using the DBL model compared to the scripted model. A 1998 study (Fraser, Fraser & Tobin, 1991) suggest that DBL has the potential to increase students’ desire to learn, enhance success in science class, and increase interest in science topics. Students were observed to be engaged in DBL and the lower-achieving students were able to explain concepts at higher levels than previously observed by their teacher. In-depth experience in design activities and creation of meaningful outcomes in technology were observed in terms of the finished product, documentation, and reflection.\nSignificant benefits of implementing DBL has been observed in the areas of math and science (Darling-Hammond et al., 2008). Research has found that students who participate in learning by design projects have a more systematic understanding of a system’s parts and functions that control groups (Hmelo, Holton, & Kolodner, 2000).\n\nA 2000 study (Hmelo, Holton, and Kolodner) found that the design project led to better learning outcomes and included deeper learning than the traditional learning approach. The researchers also noted that the students developed greater understanding of complex systems. The study found that in using DBL, both higher-achieving and lower-achieving students showed strong evidence of progress in learning the targeted concepts, students were able to apply key concepts in their work, and there were positive effects on motivation and sense of ownership over work product by both groups and individual students.\n\nThe teaching of 21st century skills is more effective when teachers gain expertise in both the practice and the teaching of these skills, in effect becoming successful 21st century learners in the areas of: communication and collaboration amongst teachers and with students; being flexible with new classroom dynamics; fostering independent student learning; adapting teaching and learning styles to new pedagogical approaches.\n\nChallenges to implementing DBL include developing the skills of the instructors: \n\n\n\n"}

After the establishment of the State University of Tirana, the \"High Institute for Legal Studies\" was incorporated into the wider university structure as one of seven faculties, and renamed as the \"'Faculty of Law\". In 1965, the university was once again reorganized and the \"Faculty of Law\" was merged with the Department of Political Science, to form a bigger \"Faculty of Political Science and Law\". The new faculty sought to prepare specialists in political science, who were to serve as civil servants for the central and local organs of government and legal specialists, to serve in the judiciary and prosecution service. In 1967, the Faculty opened journalism course, which was to prepare journalists for the government-owned newspapers and for the newly established Albanian Radio and Television.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the faculty was again reorganized, with the courses of political science transferred to a newly created department and philosophy brought under the ambit of the Faculty.

He was the Chief Education Officer for Cambridgeshire for over thirty years, taking up the post in 1922 during a time of depression in the United Kingdom following the First World War.\n\nMorris was born in Southport in Lancashire in 1889. At the age of fourteen he began work as an office boy at \"The Southport Visiter\", later becoming a reporter. In 1910 he moved to St David's University College, Lampeter to read for a degree in theology, and in 1912 moved to Exeter College, Oxford. At the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered for army service, and became an officer in the RASC. In 1919 following the end of the war he read philosophy at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nAfter a year as Assistant Secretary, Henry Morris took up the post of Secretary of Education for Cambridgeshire in 1922. At one point during the Great Depression, Cambridgeshire was the second poorest county in England, despite the relative wealth of the university. Education outside of the City of Cambridge was in a poor state due to lack of funding, with no separate secondary schools in the countryside; all children between the ages of three and fourteen were educated in their village school-house, often in one room and by the same, single teacher for their entire school career. Morris envisioned integrated between secondary and community education accessible by all those living in the villages and small towns around Cambridgeshire: the idea of 'village colleges'. He described this as \"raising the school leaving age to ninety\", and firmly believed that education, both formal and informal, should be a lifelong process. In the 1930s his visions materialised as the village colleges he had initially only hoped for, and the first four village colleges in Cambridgeshire were opened before the country became heavily involved in the conflicts of the Second World War.\nUntil 1946, Morris lived at The Old Granary in Silver Street, Cambridge, where he was the tenant of Maud Darwin, daughter-in-law of the naturalist Charles Darwin. A blue plaque on the house commemorates Morris.\n\nHenry Morris' idea evolved from what was initially seen by many in the government as a radical, liberal, paternalistic approach to delivering secondary education; to a system of education that was adopted by many other counties within the United Kingdom and abroad, due to its proven success in Cambridgeshire. By the time of his death in 1962, there were many village colleges successfully delivering education to both secondary school students (11- to 16-year-olds), and members of their local communities of all ages.\n\nToday the concept lives on to great success in Cambridgeshire and many other areas of the country. Comberton Village College in South Cambridgeshire has, in several recent years, been at or near the top of the league tables for state comprehensive schools in England. The system of whole community education, as used by Comberton Village College, was complimented by British Prime Minister, Tony Blair - a true reflection of the success of Henry Morris' concept.\n\nHe died on 10 December 1961 at Hill End Hospital, St Albans, where he had spent his last months; a simple cremation ceremony at Golders Green Crematorium took place on 14 December 1961. \n\nThe following village colleges were founded by Morris.\n\n\nTwo further colleges were opened by him shortly after his retirement from the post in 1954.\n\n\nIn order to commemorate the life works, and achievements of Henry Morris, a group of his friends decided to create a memorial to him that they felt he would be truly proud of. They established a trust fund, with the objective of promoting enjoyment in the form of independent travel and study among the youth of the City of Cambridge, East Cambridgeshire and South Cambridgeshire. The trust fund, for several decades now, has annually awarded grants usually ranging from £20-£200 per person for self organised projects involving travel abroad or home based interests. It is possible to receive a grant from the trust if you are aged thirteen to nineteen, are a student or permanent resident of the City of Cambridge, East Cambridgeshire or South Cambridgeshire, and wish to pursue an interest either from home or abroad.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1847, and it was named after the Greek national benefactor Constantinos Ionides, father of Alexander Constantine Ionides.\n\nIonideios was established in 1847. However, its history began in 1844, when the Mayor of Piraeus was Petros Omiridis Skylitsis, who addressed to Konstantinos Ionidis by letter he asked for help in setting up schools in Piraeus. In his reply to the mayor, Constantinos Ionides stated that he would provide 30,000 drachmas, an amount of great importance at the time, provided that the Municipality of Piraeus would purchase the land pay for the future cost of the school in order to function. In 1845 the City Council accepted these terms together with some others that the donor had set.\n\nTwo years later, in 1847 and on the mayoralty of Dimitrios Theocharis, the construction of the school began and on 21 May of the same year while the donor provided 10,000 drachmas more for the needs of the school and the creation of a library. In 1862, the establishment of the Gymnasium was signed by the then Minister of Education. Until 1914 the school housed the only Gymnasium in Piraeus. This year, with the foundation of the Second Gymnasium in the city of Piraeus, Ionides renamed the school to First Gymnasium. The Gymnasium operated in the original building of 1847 until 1932, when it was demolished, in order to erect in its place the building in which it is housed today. In 1963, the Minister of Education, Grigorios Kasimatis renames the school to Ionideios Model School of Piraeu. Since 1986 the official name is set to be \"Experimental Gymnasium and Lyceum of Ionideios\" and it is usually referred to as \"Ionideios High School of Piraeus\".\n\nEvery year the Greek ministry of education organises exams for the 17 model schools of Greece. The students apply for one of the 17 schools. One of them is Ionideios which accepts the 108 best students of these exams who applied for Ionideios. In case a student leaves the school for any reason before their graduation a special exam is organised in order to find the student who is going to replace the student who left.\n\nThe building of the School is located on the western side of the building square that is formed by Korai Square, Iroon Polytechniou str. and Sotiros Dios str., in the center of Piraeus. Students and teachers use the entrance of 17, Sotiros Dios Street.\nOn the ground floor are the concierge, the canteen, the Event Hall and the Gymnasium's Computer Laboratory.\nOn the first floor is the courtyard, indoor gymnasium, the Chemistry Lab, 4 classrooms, which are used by the first grade of Lyceum, the Multimedia Lab and the Library.\nOn the second floor are the offices of the Directors, the Deputy Directors, the Secretariats and the Office of the Teachers, four classes of teaching, which are used by the 2nd grade of Lyceum, as well as the Physics and Biology Laboratories.\nOn the third floor there are twelve classrooms, which are used by the entire Gymnasium as well as another computer lab.\nOn the fourth floor, there are four classrooms, which are used by the Third Grade of Lyceum, as well as a robotics lab.\nMore than half of the rooms are equipped with interactive whiteboards.\nAt Ionideios there is a library from the first years of its foundation, which is one of the largest School Libraries in Greece. It has an area of 90 sqm and contains 24 bookshelves.\n\nThe library houses 2 collections, the old collection of Ioneidos and the newest one. The old collection lists 5,556 titles, according to the latest census of 1999, when the new School Library was funded under the EU's 2nd Community Support Framework. At that time the old collection was enriched with 4,600 titles and audiovisual material. The new library is continuously enriched with new material and to date it contains over 13,000 books and audiovisual material as well as magazines of varied content. In addition, electronic book search can be done through ABEKT's electronic automation system at the National Documentation Centre.\n\nAll library material is classified with the US DEWEY decimal system and is managed through the ABEKT system.\n\nThe Gymnasium's computer laboratory is located on the ground floor of the building and is equipped with a network of 12 workstations connected to a central computer. The Multimedia Hall, on the first floor, is a multi-purpose lab. In it take place the computer courses of Lyceum, as well as the lessons of other Lyceum courses.\n"}

{"id": "148809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148809", "title": "Judith Butler", "text": "Judith Butler\n\nJudith Pamela Butler (born 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School.\n\nButler is best known for her books \"Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity\" (1990) and \"Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex\" (1993), in which she challenges conventional notions of gender and develops her theory of gender performativity. This theory has had a major influence on feminist and queer scholarship. Her works are often studied in film studies courses emphasizing gender studies and performativity in discourse.\n\nButler has supported lesbian and gay rights movements and has spoken out on many contemporary political issues. In particular, she is a vocal critic of Zionism, Israeli politics and its effect on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, emphasizing that Israel does not and should not be taken to represent all Jews or Jewish opinion.\n\nJudith Butler was born on February 24, 1956, in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust. As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her \"first training in philosophy\". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with \"Haaretz\" that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's Rabbi because she was \"too talkative in class\". Butler also stated that she was \"thrilled\" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: \"Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?\"\n\nButler attended Bennington College before transferring to Yale University, where she studied philosophy, receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1978 and her Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1984. She spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright Scholar. She taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. In 2002 she held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. In addition, she joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.\n\nButler serves on the editorial board or advisory board of several academic journals, including \"JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, and Politics\" and \"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society.\"\n\nIn the essay \"Performative Acts and Gender Constitution\", Judith Butler proposes that gender is a performance. She draws on the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the feminism of Simone de Beauvoir, noting that both thinkers ground their theories in \"lived experience\" and view the sexual body as a historical idea or situation. Butler distinguishes \"between sex, as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation or signification of that facticity.\"\n\nButler argues that gender is best perceived as a performance, which suggests that it has a social audience. For Butler, the \"script\" of gender performance is effortlessly transmitted generation to generation in the form of socially established \"meanings\": She states, \"gender is not a radical choice ... [nor is it] imposed or inscribed upon the individual\". Given the social nature of human beings, most actions are witnessed, reproduced, and internalized and thus take on a performative or theatric quality. According to Butler's theory, gender is essentially a performative repetition of acts associated with the male or female. Currently, the actions appropriate for men and women have been transmitted to produce a social atmosphere that both maintains and legitimizes a seemingly natural gender binary. Consistently with her acceptance of the body as a historical idea, she suggests that our concept of gender is seen as natural or innate because the body \"becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time\".\n\nButler argues that the performance of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender to the performance of the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However, she also brings to light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the fact that there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.\n\nButler uses Sigmund Freud's notion of how a person's identity is modeled in terms of the normal. She revises Freud's notion of this concept's applicability to lesbianism, where Freud says that lesbians are modeling their behavior on men, the perceived normal or ideal. She instead says that all gender works in this way of performativity and a representing of an internalized notion of gender norms.\n\n\"Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity\" was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages. The book's title alludes to the 1974 John Waters film \"Female Trouble\", which stars the drag queen Divine. \"Gender Trouble\" discusses the works of Freud, de Beauvoir, Julia Kristeva, Jacques Lacan, Luce Irigaray, Monique Wittig, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The book has even inspired an intellectual fanzine, \"Judy!\"\n\nThe crux of Butler's argument in \"Gender Trouble\" is that the coherence of the categories of sex, gender, and sexuality—the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies—is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. Although the repeated, stylized bodily acts establish the appearance of an essential, ontological \"core\" gender, Butler understands gender, along with sex and sexuality, to be performative. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex. The performance of gender is not voluntary, in Butler's opinion, and she believes the gendered, sexed, desiring subject must be constructed within what she calls, borrowing from Foucault's \"Discipline and Punish\", \"regulative discourses.\" These, also called \"frameworks of intelligibility\" or \"disciplinary regimes,\" determine in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or \"natural.\" Regulative discourse includes disciplinary techniques that coerce the stylized actions and thereby maintain the appearance of \"core\" gender, sex and sexuality.\n\nThe supposed obviousness of sex as a natural fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a natural fact, is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, which then purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of sex. In Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural. Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the sex/gender distinction as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and compulsory heterosexuality will be ineffective.\n\nButler offers a critique of the terms \"gender\" and \"sex\" as they have been used by feminists. Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make \"women\" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations. Butler believes that feminists should not try to define \"women\" and she also believes that feminists should \"focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement.\" Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be \"flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors\". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of Queer theory.\n\nJudith Butler explores the production of identities such as \"homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\" and the limiting nature of identity categories. An identity category for her is a result of certain exclusions and concealments, and thus a site of regulation. Butler acknowledges, however, that categorized identities are important for political action at the present time. Butler believes that identity forms through repetition or imitation and is not original. Imitation fosters the illusion of continuity. Heterosexual identity, which is set up as an ideal, requires constant, compulsive repetition if it is to be safeguarded.\n\n\"Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"\" seeks to clear up readings and supposed misreadings of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice. Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of Derrida's theory of iterability, which is a form of citationality:\n\nPerformativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed \"by\" a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.\n\nThis concept is linked to Butler's discussion of performativity. Iterability, in its endless \"un\"determinedness as to-be-determinedness, is thus precisely that aspect of performativity that makes the production of the \"natural\" sexed, gendered, heterosexual subject possible, while also and at the same time opening that subject up to the possibility of its incoherence and contestation.\n\nIn \"Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative\", Butler surveys the problems of hate speech and censorship. She argues that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.\n\nButler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon's argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.\n\nDeploying Foucault's argument from the first volume of \"The History of Sexuality\", Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid. As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control. Extending this argument using Derrida and Lacan, Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic \"I\" is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; \"If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech\".\n\n\"Undoing Gender\" collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of her other books. Butler revisits and refines her notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing \"restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life\".\n\nButler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is \"automatic or mechanical\". She argues that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of \"human\" and \"less-than-human\" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a \"viable life\" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if his or her desires differ from normality. She states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life \"unlivable\". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.\n\nIn her discussion of intersex, Butler addresses the case of David Reimer, a person whose sex was medically \"reassigned\" from male to female after a botched circumcision at eight months of age. Reimer was \"made\" female by doctors, but later in life identified as \"really\" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in \"As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl\", which he wrote with John Colapinto. Reimer committed suicide in 2004.\n\nIn \"Giving an Account of Oneself\", Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from Theodor Adorno, Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean Laplanche, Adriana Cavarero and Emmanuel Levinas, Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. She theorizes the subject in relation to the social – a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical \"I\", in the first place.\n\nButler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.\n\nInstead she argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.\n\nButler's work has been influential in feminist and queer theory, cultural studies, and continental philosophy. Yet her contribution to a range of other disciplines—such as psychoanalysis, literary, film, and performance studies as well as visual arts—has also been significant. Her theory of gender performativity as well as her conception of \"critically queer\" have not only transformed understandings of gender and queer identity in the academic world, but have shaped and mobilized various kinds of political activism, particularly queer activism, across the globe. Butler's work has also entered into contemporary debates on the teaching of gender, gay parenting, and the depathologization of transgender people. Before election to the papacy, Pope Benedict XVI wrote several pages challenging Butler's arguments on gender. In several countries, Butler became the symbol of the destruction of traditional gender roles for reactionary movements. This was particularly the case in France during the anti-gay marriage protests. Bruno Perreau has shown that Butler was literally depicted as an \"antichrist\", both because of her gender and her Jewish identity, the fear of minority politics and critical studies being expressed through fantasies of a corrupted body.\n\nSome academics and political activists maintain that Butler's radical departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and her non-essentialist conception of gender—along with her insistence that power helps form the subject—revolutionized feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies. Darin Barney of McGill University writes that:\nOthers scholars have been more critical. In 1998, Denis Dutton's journal \"Philosophy and Literature\" awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual \"Bad Writing Competition\", which set out to \"celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles.\" Her unwitting entry, which ran in a 1997 issue of the scholarly journal \"Diacritics\", ran thus:\nSome critics have accused Butler of elitism due to her difficult prose style, while others claim that she reduces gender to \"discourse\" or promotes a form of gender voluntarism. Susan Bordo, for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler's conception of gender as performance. A particularly vocal critic has been liberal feminist Martha Nussbaum, who has argued that Butler misreads J. L. Austin's idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no normative ethical theory to direct the subversive performances that Butler endorses. Finally, Nancy Fraser's critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists. Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances her from \"everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves. ... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?\"\n\nButler responded to criticisms of her prose in the preface to her 1999 book, \"Gender Trouble.\"\n\nMore recently, several critics—most prominently, Viviane Namaste—have criticised Judith Butler's \"Undoing Gender\" for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like \"gender politics\" and \"gender violence\" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can \"[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialised urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work\", and produce instead \"a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out\". Nevertheless, both Namaste and Laurie acknowledge the enduring importance of Butler's critical contributions to the study of gender identities.\n\nGerman feminist Alice Schwarzer speaks of Butler's \"radical intellectual games\" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising her right to same-sex-marriage in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend Islam, including Islamism, from critics.\n\nMuch of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and she served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. Over the years, she has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements. She has also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay. More recently, she has been active in the Occupy movement and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) campaign against Israel.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized teach-in against the 2006 Lebanon War at the University of California, Berkeley. Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. She cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, she went on to name several groups that she commended as stronger opponents of \"homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism\".\n\nIn October 2011, Butler attended Occupy Wall Street and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, she said: \n\nPeople have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.\n\nShe is currently an executive member of FFIPP - Educational Network for Human Rights in Israel/Palestine. She is also a member of the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nWhen Butler received the 2012 Adorno Prize, the prize committee came under attack from Israel's Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, Efraim Zuroff, and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler's selection because of her remarks about Israel and specifically her \"calls for a boycott against Israel\". Butler responded saying that \"she did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally\". Rather, she wrote, the attacks are \"directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies\".\n\nIn a letter to the \"Mondoweiss\" website, Butler asserted that she developed strong ethical views on the basis of Jewish philosophical thought and that it is \"blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating\".\n\nButler was criticized for statements she had made about Hamas and Hezbollah. She had described them as \"social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left\". She was accused of defending \"Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations\" and supporting their tactics.\n\nButler responded to these criticisms by stating that her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, her established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented.\n\nButler describes the origin of her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way: \n\nI was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to \"the global left\" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.\n\nIn a January 2015 interview with George Yancy of \"The New York Times\", Butler discussed the Black Lives Matter movement. The dialogue draws heavily on her 2004 book \"Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.\"\n\nOn May 11, 2018, Butler led a group of scholars in writing a letter to New York University following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor Avital Ronell. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the Title IX complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a \"malicious campaign\" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed \"malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare\" for a highly regarded scholar. \"If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed.\" Butler, the chief signatory, invoked her title as President Elect of the Modern Language Association. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from her post. He argued that \"Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty's privilege of impunity. ... [Butler] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over. We should never look back.\" Some three months later, Butler apologized to the MLA for the letter. \"I acknowledged that I should not have allowed the MLA affiliation to go forward with my name,\" she wrote to the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\". \"I expressed regret to the MLA officers and staff, and my colleagues accepted my apology. I extend that same apology to MLA members.\"\n\nButler lives in Berkeley with her partner Wendy Brown and son, Isaac.\n\nButler has had a visiting appointment at Birkbeck, University of London (2009–).\n\n\nAll of Butler's books have been translated into numerous languages; \"Gender Trouble\", alone, has been translated into twenty-seven different languages. In addition, she has co-authored and edited over a dozen volumes—the most recent of which is \"Dispossession: The Performative in the Political\" (2013), coauthored with Athena Athanasiou. Over the years she has also published many influential essays, interviews, and public presentations. Butler is considered by many as \"one of the most influential voices in contemporary political theory,\" and as the most widely read and influential gender theorist in the world.\n\nThe following is a partial list of Butler's publications.\n\nBooks\n\nBook chapters\n\n"}

The most well known organizations that serve as primary conduits of Saudi funding in Indonesia are the \"Dewan Dakwah Islamiyah Indonesia\" (the Indonesian Society for the Propagation of Islam, or DDII) and LIPIA.\n\nAlthough the vision of the LIPIA establishment is to be the distinguished leader in creative learning, teaching and research in Islamic and Arabic sciences, it has also became a channel for Saudi government to spread its ideology. The salafi movement in early 1990s in Indonesia began to develop on university campuses, but mostly gained impetus with the arrival of other Middle-eastern educated and Soviet-Afghan War veterans. Following the 1979 Shia revolution in Iran and the Iranian/Saudi hegemonic conflict that ensued, Indonesia took on major strategic importance for Saudi religious politics. LIPIA not only helps Saudi Arabia to influence Indonesian society, it also provides a gateway to all of Southeast Asia.\n\nAll lectures taught in LIPIA are delivered in Arabic language and about 80–90 percent of the lecturers are from Saudi Arabia. It has very high acceptance standard, where only 200 students are accepted out of 2000 applicants. Once they are admitted, they do not need to pay any tuition, even they are paid stipends. 200 students graduate from the college every year.\n\nThe college teaches Wahhabi Madhab, a branch of Salafi. Every student has to learn the teachings of Ibn Taimiyah. The college was also influenced by Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin, and some of its lecturers were influenced by the Muslim brotherhood doctrine. Many of the alumni later became Salafi activists, preachers or teachers. Some of the alumni then open other institutions based on Wahhabism and funded by Saudi Arabia. Ulil Abshar Abdalla noted that LIPIA's Wahhabism curriculum predisposes its graduates to adopt an attitude hostile to the local Indonesian culture and Muslim practices. Top male students, who are willing to learn the Koran by heart and can be expected to propagate Saudi ideas in Southeast Asia, are given grants for the Imam Muhammad bin Saud University in Riyadh. Their stay in Riyadh is intended to make them more committed to Wahhabi values and more sympathetic to Saudi rule.\n\nSome figures who have studied at LIPIA are Jafar Umar Thalib, Yazid bin Abdul Qadir Jawas, Muhammad Rizieq Shihab, and Ulil Abshar Abdalla.\n\nThe program is in the format of courses that include learning the Quran and Arabic language free of charge to people who are interested in participating. The program is held on Saturday and Sunday on a weekly basis. The classes are held for two Semester (24-week or 192 hours) which are adjusted to LIPIA school calendar. Lessons in Jakarta transfer deeply rooted discourses from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia, with teachers required to impart the superiority of the Hanbali School of Law.\n\nParticipants who have passed the final exam will be given a certificate of LIPIA at the end of the course activities. Everyday life on campus is permeated by commandments and prohibitions intended to shape the students according to the Saudi model: Wearing jeans, loud laughter, listening to music, and watching television are all prohibited. In contrast, the common dress style for Salafi men - ankle-length linen pants, sandals, goatees and the use of neem sticks - are all encouraged. Women are expected to veil themselves completely.\n"}

The aim of the game is to build the famed Playboy Empire from scratch, starting from a humble magazine to celebrity endorsements to home entertainment to Internet websites to merchandise.\n\nThe player can mold the famed Playboy Mansion to their own needs and wants, and has the option of experiencing the infamous \"Playboy\" Playmate parties in locations such as the Grotto and the Clubhouse. Hef, as well as all other characters in the game, can build three types of relationships with other characters: casual, business, and romantic. Each month, the player has to print an issue of the magazine. To do that the player needs a cover shoot, a centerfold, an essay from a celebrity, interview with a celebrity, a pictorial about a subject and an article about a subject. The player must hire photographers and writers to create each issue. All the characters have interests, such as sports and music, and writers on those topics will produce higher-quality articles. In the game, the player is the photographer during photo shoots. The game contains many sexual references, including sexual relationships.\n\nThere are twelve missions in total. Some of the goals include making and/or fixing relationships with people, publishing certain magazine content, and throwing parties. Players can also choose not to achieve goals, as there is no time limit, and do other things such as parties, mansion renovations and playing with the mansion's variety of games; however, magazines must continue to be published as that is the player's income source.\n\nThe main song on the video game is playboy mansion by Prince Charming..from the album songs for my therapist\nA soundtrack to the game, mixed by American DJ and record producer Felix da Housecat has been released. It features house tracks by many renowned producers like Armand Van Helden, DJ Sneak or Kaskade.\n\n\"Playboy: The Mansion - Private Party Expansion Pack\" is the expansion pack. It adds extra features such as parties like Midsummer Night's Dream, world-famous celebrities and Playmates, new animations, enhanced character editing and party-themed music.\n\nThe expansion adds many new features to the game. When characters engage in sexual activities, they now remove their underwear and their genitals are blurred, much like \"The Sims\" characters. Another feature is the ability to throw \"theme parties\", which consist of Halloween, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hef's Birthday, Tropical, Playmate of the Year and more.\n\nThe game was met with mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 60% and 59 out of 100 for the PC version, 59.97% and 59 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version, and 62.14% and 61 out of 100 for the Xbox version.\n\nEurogamer noted that the game was similar to \"The Sims\" series but was unfortunately less entertaining. It was considered \"a little too slight a proposition for a full game.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave it a mixed review and stated, \"Sex and nudity often work well in movies, but video games laced with sex never rise above mediocrity, and \"Mansion\" seems decidedly underbaked.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \"A frisky concept with limited thrills and not enough depth to challenge gamers.\" \"Detroit Free Press\" gave it two stars out of four and stated, \"I flipped on the game expecting a world of champagne, roses and frequent wisps of steam.

{"id": "45519483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45519483", "title": "Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports", "text": "Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports\n\nPositive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a set of ideas and tools that schools use to improve the behavior of students. PBIS uses evidence and data-based programs, practices and strategies to frame behavioral improvement in terms of student growth in academic performance, safety, behavior, and establishing and maintaining positive school culture. PBIS addresses the needs of at-risk students as well as the multi-leveled needs of all students in regards to behavior, which creates an environment for both teaching and learning to occur in schools. In contrast to PBIS, many schools used exclusionary discipline practices including detentions, suspension, or expulsions to separate students from the classroom and from peers. PBIS emphasizes preventing problem behaviors before they happen to increase the opportunity for students to learn by keeping them in the classroom. PBIS is a team-based framework for schools that borrows elements from response to intervention, an intervention that uses diagnostic data to develop personalized learning plans for all students.\n\nPBIS is an acronym for Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports. Effective classroom management and discipline are essential for teaching and learning. PBIS emphasizes the integrated use of classroom management and school-wide discipline strategies coupled with effective academic instruction to create a positive and safe school climate for all students. PBIS is based in a behaviorist psychology approach to improving student behavior, which means that teachers and students identify misbehavior, model appropriate behaviors, and provide clear consequences for behavior in the classroom context. In a PBIS model, schools must define, teach, and reinforce appropriate behaviors to ensure success. Research shows that punishing students inconsistently without a positive alternative, is ineffective and only offers short-term solutions. Modeling and rewarding positive behaviors are more effective. The goal of PBIS is to establish a positive school climate. To do this, a continuum of behavior support has been established which can be applied at the school level (primary level), for small groups of students (secondary level), and for individual level (tertiary level).\n\nPBIS is not a packaged program for districts to purchase. Instead, it is a framework approach that helps schools to identify the key tasks in developing preventative positive behavior tailored to their own school. It is an approach defined by the following core design components.\n\nThe outcome is the goal for improved student behavior towards which the school community aims. The goals must be measurable, and must clearly be the result of implementing the PBIS model. Outcomes of a successful PBIS framework with a school can be measured in both behavior data and academic achievement of the students in the school. The academic and behavior goals are often defined and supported by the students, families, and teachers in tandem for the program to succeed.\n\nPBIS is grounded in the data being used for all levels of decision making. The team often considers trends in numbers, locations of where problems occurred, which classes they occurred in, and individual students that were involved. Through the data, schools take stock of their current situation, pinpoint areas for change and or improvement, and evaluate the effects of current and future interventions.\n\nThis component refers to the evidence-based curriculum, instruction, interventions, and strategies implemented within the school, and are meant to create a common and shared understanding of expectations. These practices are introduced through the team after a review of the data.\n\nPBIS requires a review team of educators with buy-in from across the school and strong administrative support to design and enforce the PBIS system. The team is generally a representative group of all of the staff (classroom teachers, special education teachers, specialists, etc.). In a secondary school, students could also be included as part of this team. The team creates the systems used by the remainder of the staff and the students they serve.\n\nEach PBIS model uses a continuum of support. Tiers of support that range in intestate are offered to students as their needs fluctuate. Most students are supported by tier 1 (universal) Level of support, which describes the general school context. As students struggle with the behavioral expectations of the model, they may advance to higher tiers to provide more support.\n\nThe first level in PBIS is the universal level. In terms of PBIS, this refers to the school-wide expectations that are defined and taught to all school staff in each of the settings within the school. These expectations are developed by the team and taught to students by their regular classroom teachers, administrators or others who have contact with all students. Many schools who have adopted this framework use: Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, but like all aspects, this is determined by the school. The fidelity of the expectations should be determined by the continuous collecting of data. Along with the expectations, there should be a system of acknowledgement and reinforcement of expected behaviors.\n\nThe Core Principles of PBIS at the primary level are:\nThese principles make the PBIS program significant in that it makes it more proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, PBIS helps schools develop a common language, common practices, and consistent application of positive and negative reinforcement at a school-wide level.\n\nAlthough the primary level is taught and reinforced with all students, there may be some students who need additional intervention for students with at-risk behaviors as determined by the data. Secondary prevention provides intensive or targeted interventions to support students not responding to the primary efforts. These behavioral interventions are taught by specialized staff like special educators, school psychologists, behavior interventionists, and counselors. Some examples of tier 2 behavior interventions are targeted social skill groups, behavior plans with continuous progress monitoring.\n\nPBIS also acknowledges that some students have high risk behaviors and need specialized, or individualized skill building practice due to exhibited habits of problem behavior. Tier 3 behavioral interventions involve a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and an individualized plan of support which includes: \nTo succeed in a tier 3 intervention, both tier 1 and tier 2 interventions must also be in place. Also, support must be conducted in a comprehensive and collaborative manner.\n\nThe Tier 3 process should include the student with the behavior issue and the people who know them the best on a personal level working together as a behavioral support team (BST). Support should be tailored to the student’s specific needs. It should also include multiple interventions. The goal at this level is to diminish problematic behavior, increase adaptive skills, and attempt to increase the student’s quality of life.\n\nCulturally responsive PBIS (CR-PBIS) is also a framework aimed at restructuring school culture much like PBIS. However, CR-PBIS emphasizes change through understanding and interacting with the community. Providing an environment in which all cultures are acknowledged, respected, and celebrated is important in building the bridge between home culture and school culture. To ensure all students succeed, an understanding of their various cultural beliefs and practices are a must. When someone engages in culturally responsive practice, they are forming an understanding about the values, beliefs, and behaviors of other people than themselves.\n\nRace has been a predictor of success in schools for decades. Students of color have statistically lower rates of success. Part of the job of educators is to help bridge the social understanding gap in order to bridge the educational understanding gap. Because of this, there is some concern that PBIS alone \ncreates outcome disparities due to culture. The behavior of students with color, without the \nknowledge of the community they come from, may be seen as disruptive, resistant, and limiting \nto student success. CR-PBIS tries to address these concerns that are left untouched by the \ntraditional PBIS framework by including families as a large piece of creating an environment for teaching and learning.\n\nJust like PBIS, Responsive Classroom (RC) centers on research-based approaches and strive to ensure high quality education to all students. Both agree that these positive behaviors and the skills needed to reach them must be explicitly taught to students. Lastly, both also believe that non-punitive strategies are more effective than what has been used in schools in the past.\n\nWhere PBIS is a framework that coaches the school staff to create their own resources and changes, RC outlines specific prescribed practices that schools should use to reach this goal. Responsive Classroom is a for-purchase-program that staff can be trained in at multiple levels and has published tools and strategies for meeting these goals with students.\n\n"}

It is founded, operated, and partly funded by associations and people outside the country. PUST was jointly planned and constructed by forces from both North and South Korea, along with contributions from groups and individuals from other nations, in particular China and the United States. The initiative is largely funded by Evangelical Christian movements. Originally scheduled for launch in 2003, the project was delayed for several years and began operations in October 2010.\n\nThe university is in the countryside outside of Pyongyang in a separate but close administrative region with permission required for access to Pyongyang. After introductory negotiations, the PUST project was started in 2001, on the initiative of Professor Kim Chin Kyung, endorsed in a personal meeting with former North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il. Professor Kim's earlier accomplishments include being founding president of Yanbian University of Science and Technology (YUST) in northeastern China, but inside the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, founded in 1992. The PUST will cooperate with YUST and draw on their experiences.\n\nWith exception of foreign language courses, all teaching is conducted in English.

Plans include the hiring of up to 250 faculty members from universities and research institutions in South Korea, China, the United States, and other countries. As a joint venture university, the PUST is seen as a contribution to the Korean reunification process.\n\nKim Hak Song, who managed a farm run by the agriculture department of the university, was detained on charges of committing “hostile criminal acts” against the country on 6 May 2017. Kim Sang-duk, who also worked for the university, had been arrested on similar charges on April 22. They both were released on May 8, 2018, into U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's custody after overtures were made for a meeting to be held between President Donald Trump and Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un in June 2018.\n\nDue to a ban on Americans traveling to North Korea issued by the U.S. State Department in mid-July in 2017, the university had to start the fall semester without its dozens of American staffers in September, roughly 60 out of 130 foreigners in the university, including faculty members, staffers and family members, as none of them received special permission to stay.\n\nThe goal of PUST is to contribute to North Korean economic development by producing professionals and leaders in technical disciplines, who are fluent in English and another foreign language (such as Chinese or German), and who are accustomed to working in an international setting. Bachelor of Science and doctorate degrees will be awarded in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Agriculture and Life Sciences (ALS), and International Finance and Management (IFM). The university has plans to open schools in Public Healthcare and Construction Engineering as early as 2013.\n\nGraduate students and professors have internet access, but it is filtered and monitored.\n\n\n"}

Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools, or grades Kindergarten-8th Grade.\n\nIn schools which use a house system a feature of the school is the competition between the houses; this is especially brought out during sporting events such as an inter-house sports day.\n\nGames that are played on school sports days can be wide and varied. They can include straightforward sprints and longer races for all age groups as well as egg and spoon races. Three legged races are run as well as sack races, wheelbarrow races, and parent and child races.\n\nAdditional games are traditionally run in Ireland, and the UK, such as horseshoes.\n\nThere have been a number of controversies surrounding school sports days in recent years, many of which have been publicised by the media.\n\nSome schools have abolished or heavily altered sports days on the grounds that they are too competitive and may damage pupils' self-esteem, with some commentators calling for the event to be banned due to the public humiliation caused to those children who are not gifted athletically. This view has been condemned as \"political correctness\" by many commentators, notably by journalist Melanie Phillips in her 1996 book \"All Must Have Prizes\"., a book heavily criticised by reviewers for its prejudiced, fact-less and distorted analyses.\n\nIn June 2005, \"Country Life\" magazine published a report claiming that school sports days have become excessively competitive due to overbearing and \"over-zealous\" parents, who place too much pressure on their children to succeed. The report also revealed that many schools have banned \"mothers and fathers\" races due to fighting and cheating.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, a number of schools and education authorities have banned photography and filming with video cameras at sports days and other school events. Some authorities cite general privacy issues as justification for the ban. Others have raised concerns about pedophiles, which in turn has sparked accusations of hysteria and moral panic. Many parents have expressed anger at being unable to take photographs or videos as souvenirs of these events, and the ban has been criticised by some as a paranoid over-reaction to public concerns about pedophilia and child safety issues.\n\nIn India, sports days are held for 2 - 3 days. These include games like football, cricket, throw ball, dodge ball, volleyball, track and field, basketball etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school. In India, many traditional games such as Kho-Kho and Kabaddi, March-past are played.\n\nSports day, called \"undōkai\" (運動会) in Japanese, is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday in Japanese schools. During weeks preceding the sports day, students practice their events which they would like to show their parents and friends, within their class of physical education, which often includes \"tamaire\", performances by the school band and presentations by various school clubs as well as individual and group competitive events. These practices, and the sports days themselves, normally take place on the schools' fields, which provide little relief from the heat and sun.\n\nSome schools have responded by scheduling their sports days during cooler months and by encouraging their students to drink water regularly. Currently, the event occurs most often in the autumn (September/October), or in the spring (May/June). In primary schools in Hokkaidō, the event is usually held between the later part of May and the earlier part of June.\n\nSports Day in Russia is held on the second Saturday in August. \n\nSports day in Qatar is a national holiday, held every second-Tuesday of February every year. The Qatar Olympic Committee is tasked with organizing the large-scale nationwide activities that are held all over Qatar, and include a wide variety of sports such as; football, basketball, tennis, marathons, open walks, as well as regional sports such as camel riding. Other venues of sports day include Aspire Zone, Katara, The Pearl, among others. Sports day's popularity extends to the point that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Qatar's Emir is casually seen participating in events.\n\nMany large organizations have sports days for their employees. One notable example is Her Majesty's Civil Service in the UK, which holds a number of departmental sports days.\n"}

The College of General Studies offers programs of special interest to adults and non-traditional students, including baccalaureate degrees (BA/BS) and post-baccalaureate certificates. The fourth largest undergraduate unit at the University of Pittsburgh, the administration of the College of General Studies is overseen by the School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe College of General Studies evolved from the 1908 Downtown Division of the Pittsburgh Academy. It became the Department of Afternoon, Saturday and Evening Studies in 1911 when it moved from Downtown to Oakland and began offering a limited number of off-campus courses. By 1920, Pitt had expanded its off-campus offerings to 19 locations in western Pennsylvania and Ohio, including Erie and Youngstown. In 1932, Pitt established the University Extension Division, which became known informally as the evening program, with its director reporting directly to the chancellor. On March 11, 1958, the Pitt Board of Trustees, following a recommendation by then Chancellor Edward Litchfield, approved the establishment of the School of General Studies primarily as an alternative for adults wishing to continuing education. Enrollment in the School of General Studies peaked at 18,930 during the 1974-75 academic year, the vast majority of which were part-time students. In 1981, the School of General Studies was renamed the College of General Studies to reflect that its degree was comparable to an Arts and Sciences degree. In the early 1990s, the College of General Studies offered as many as 30 degree majors, which was downgraded to ten in 1998-99 in order to eliminate duplication with majors offered in other Pitt units. In 2002 the McCarl Center for Nontraditional Student Success open followed by a major restructuring of the College of General Studies in 2003. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, for those 50 years old and older, and CGSOnline was established in 2005.\n\n\nOriginally located on the fourth floor of the Cathedral of Learning, the $537,000 McCarl Center was opened in 2002 and occupies space that once housed two levels of the main stacks of the University's library. Made possible by a gift from F. James and Foster J.J. McCarl, it serves as resource center for non-traditional students and hosts seminars and events. The space was designed by Alan J. Cueri and his architectural firm Strada, LLC, and includes wood finishes, double-height spaces with high ceilings and windows, a main corridor conceived as an interior street, and many elements that refer to the Cathedral of Learning's Gothic architecture including decorative painted metal columns with contemporary buttress-style arches. The center included a resource library, meeting rooms, and a student lounge, and is staffed with academic advisors and has contains a reception area for the College of General Studies. Three unsigned and undated by glass-encased murals that depict Renaissance painting styles and which have long belonged to the University but are of unknown origin hang in a hallway outside the Center.\n\nThe College of General Studies, including the McCarl Center, the Office of Veterans Services, and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, relocated from the Cathedral of Learning to the first floor of Posvar Hall in May, 2014.\n\nMajors offered through the College of General Studies\nThe College of General Studies also offers a self designed major, either a BA or BS, for students who want to design a major more suited for their intended career.\n\nIn addition to these bachelor's degree programs, the College of General Studies also offers post-baccalaureate certificates with a number of other units including the College of Business Administration, the University Center for Social and Urban Research, and the Center for National Preparedness.\n\nThe College of General Studies offers about 65 courses across its disciplines through PittOnline web based instruction and also has satellite campuses in Butler County, Mt.

{"id": "567655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=567655", "title": "Varsity team", "text": "Varsity team\n\nVarsity is an alteration and shortening of the term \"university\". The meaning differs depending on the region, but is usually related to sporting activity.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, varsity team or varsity club refers to groups participating in varsity matches in sport or other competitions between rival universities. The term originally referred strictly to university-sponsored teams, and dates from the 1840s.\n\nIn contemporary Scots language the term \"varsity\" is often interchangeable with \"university\" in contexts unrelated to sporting activity.\n\nIn the United States and Canada varsity teams are the principal athletic teams representing a college, university, high school, or other secondary school. Such teams compete against similar teams at corresponding educational institutions. Groups of varsity sports teams are often organized into athletic conferences, which are groups of teams that regularly play each other during a given athletic season. In recognition of their high level of performance, athletes on varsity teams are often given varsity letters. They are in contrast to the institution's club sports. \n\nA major difference between varsity and club sports is the source for allocated funds. Varsity teams receive financial support, equipment, and facilities from college and university athletic department budgets. Universities often allocate club sport budgets through student life departments similar to other clubs on campus. Because club sports cost more than other clubs, many club student-athletes must pay to play and also engage in team fundraising efforts to pay for facilities time, equipment, and other team expenses. At various levels of collegiate sports, varsity student athletes are eligible for scholarships solely or partially based on athletic skills.\n\nVarsity can be compared with the junior varsity level, which is typically for less-experienced underclassmen. Players may be able to go up a level to varsity playing by performing well.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Varsity is the oldest and most prestigious rowing race. It was held for the first time in 1878, and was started as a Dutch equivalent for the Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nIn South Africa and some other Commonwealth countries, varsity is often still used in place of the word university, in contexts unrelated to sporting activity.\n\n"}

An independent panel later concluded that the university changed its records, and granted the degree despite incomplete graduation requirements. West Virginia University's president Michael Garrison, its provost Gerald Lang, and its business school dean R. Stephen Sears, resigned as a result of the investigation, and the university's general counsel and the president's communications officer relinquished those roles.\n\nOn October 2, 2007 Heather Bresch, the daughter of then-governor (and subsequently United States Senator) Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was promoted to chief operating officer at Mylan, a Cecil Township, Pennsylvania-based generic drug maker.\n\nOn October 11, 2007 the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" contacted West Virginia University to confirm academic credentials claimed by Bresch, including an EMBA degree. Research done by the \"Post-Gazette\" indicated that Bresch's course work ceased with 22 out of the 48-credit-hour program remaining to be completed. The WVU Registrar told the newspaper that Bresch had earned an undergraduate degree, but did not finish her graduate degree. However, on October 15, 2007, a university spokeswoman announced that WVU officials had verified that Bresch had \"completed all the requirements for an executive masters of business administration degree,\" but did not receive her diploma because she failed to pay a $50 graduation fee. The WVU official attributed the misunderstanding to the business school's failure to transfer records from nearly half of Bresch's course work.\n\nOn October 22, 2007, R. Stephen Sears, the Milan Puskar Dean of WVU's business school, sent a letter to WVU's admissions and records office retroactively granting Bresch an EMBA. Six classes were added to her record with letter grades, and two classes with \"Incomplete\" grades were given letter grades.\n\nThe University commissioned a report written by a panel of faculty members from WVU and other universities to look into the matter. As covered by the \"Post-Gazette\", the panel discovered the change in Bresch's letter grades, and the University announced in April 2008 that it would rescind Bresch's degree. WVU provost Gerald Lang announced his resignation and shortly thereafter College of Business & Economics Dean Stephen Sears announced his resignation as well.\n\nThe report's panel found that high-ranking university administrators \"cherry-picked\" information and that grades were \"simply pulled from thin air\" to grant Bresch the degree nearly 10 years after she was supposed to graduate. The panel concluded administrators lacked documentation to prove Bresch's claims, relied too heavily on verbal assertions and caved to political pressure. The report did not find that the university president directly interfered, but it concluded the presence of his chief of staff in the decision-making meeting created \"palpable\" pressure. The panel concluded (“taking the most charitable view\") that Bresch did not deliberately lie in believing that she had earned degree. \n\nOn May 1, 2008, the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", which first reported on the controversy, published an editorial calling for the President Michael Garrison's resignation. On the same day, WVU's student newspaper, \"The Daily Athenaeum\" held a student forum where some students called for Garrison's resignation. Garrison did not attend, and was represented by a member of the executive communications staff.\n\nThe Chairman of West Virginia University's Health Sciences Center neurosurgery department organized a faculty letter in support of President Garrison. Some faculty members felt pressured to sign the letter, which had 23 signatures.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, WVU's faculty senate passed a non-binding resolution 77-19 that stated: \"The Faculty Senate of West Virginia University votes no confidence in President Garrison. For the good of the institution and for the benefit of our students, he must resign or the Board of Governors must require his resignation.\" One emeritus member of the faculty called the grade alterations by the WVU administration a \"serious academic crime\" by subverting the faculty's traditional authority.\n\nMany WVU alumni expressed concern and anger regarding the controversy and feared damage to the university's reputation. Prominent Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania attorney and WVU alum Peter J. Kalis called for removal of Steven Goodwin, chairman of WVU's board of directors, as well as Garrison.\nGarrison subsequently resigned and was replaced by interim President C. Peter Magrath. Magrath served for a year before James P. Clements was named to be the next president.\n\nIn addition, the university's general counsel stepped down as general counsel but remained vice president of legal affairs. The president's communications officer was reassigned to another job in the university.\n"}

The WorldWideWhiteboard domain, trademark, and technology are owned and developed by Link-Systems International, Inc. (LSI), a privately held distance-learning software corporation in Tampa, Florida. The WorldWideWhiteboard went live in 1996 under the name \"NetTutor,\" although the LSI NetTutor online tutoring service is technically just one implementation of the WorldWideWhiteboard product. Version 3.8 of the WorldWideWhiteboard is in use not only in the current NetTutor online tutoring service, but also in on-campus online tutoring programs, online courses, and collaborative learning environments in the U.S. and around the world. As a Java applet, it can be run on Windows, Mac, and Linux and runs without downloading software. LSI maintains the application and leases both hosted and unhosted access to it. LSI operations — tutoring, product development, online content services, management, and technical support — are housed in the company's Tampa offices.\n\nThe WorldWideWhiteboard is the first software product developed by Link-Systems International (LSI). LSI was launched in 1995 primarily as a company that converted text-based content like scholarly journals into an SGML format. Incorporated in the State of Florida on February 27, 1996, LSI expanded its mission to the Web-based implementation of a variety of traditionally face-to-face academic activities. The company developed what it called the \"Net Tutor\" product that included a whiteboard-like interface and, later, a tutoring service that used the whiteboard to conduct online tutoring. For about five years, the software side of this product leased as NetTutor to schools, individual educators, and programs, for example to conduct online tutoring using tutors provided by the institution, as well as for online instruction and office hours. Eventually, LSI re-christened the interface the WorldWideWhiteboard. The company still owns the NetTutor trademark, which refers to the online tutoring it supplies via the WorldWideWhiteboard and using professional tutors it employs.\n\nThis history seems to justify the company's claim that it was the first to offer commercially a tool for Web access to a shared, real-time environment with such education-oriented features as subject-specific tool bars. The WorldWideWhiteboard was also adopted as an option available with certain text-books by publishers such as McGraw-Hill, John Wiley and Sons, Pearson, Cengage Learning, and Bedford, Freeman and Worth. The use of the WorldWideWhiteboard by campuses and educational programs to support online environments, give classes, hold faculty office hours and meetings expanded over the next decade.\n\nIn 2010, LSI began development of an HTML5 version of the WorldWideWhiteboard. This version has now replaced the earlier, Java-based version and allows for the use of the interface on mobile devices. This is one of several cases where software developers have opted for browser-based development, counting on the future development of HTML5 API's to support audio and video interaction, rather than self-standing phone apps. As of 2013, installations of WorldWideWhiteboard had been converted from Java-based to HTML5-based versions.\n\nAs the WorldWideWhiteboard gained more popularity, LSI came to be included in the Inc. 5000 in 2014.\n\nThe WorldWideWhiteboard product was apparently the first successful web collaboration tool in wide use in education. Online whiteboards generally can accommodate a theoretically unlimited number of participants and an instructor in a synchronous, i.e., live interactive session. The WorldWideWhiteboard allows for both audio and up to four video streams, as well as numerous asynchronous modes of interaction.\n\n\nCertain of these studies have been cited widely, mainly because of the seminal role of the WorldWideWhiteboard as an educational Web-conferencing tool. (See, for instance, Reushle and Loch in \"Conducting a Trial Web Conferencing Software.\" and the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Quality Enhancement Plan for 2007)\n\nThis research suggests that all the forms of expression — including video and audio interaction — available on the WorldWideWhiteboard can be successfully used in the classroom.\n\nOther questions raised by scholars include:\n\n\nWhile these questions, educators agree, are not fully decided, more recent study suggests that the student-centered dialog possible on the WorldWideWhiteboard encourages learner persistence and success.\n\nThe technology of the WorldWideWhiteboard is not geared to a particular pedagogic or andragogic approach. Its set of activities can therefore be used by any educator for online communication. This also means that questions about how the WorldWideWhiteboard is set up are matters for the institution to decide. LSI has no consultancy component, so that, while figures about usage of the WorldWideWhiteboard can be used to demonstrate how a school's Quality Enhancement Program is working, it is up to the user to create the documentation for this or any other accreditation-related measures.\n\nHowever, each features of the WorldWideWhiteboard can be customized for use in different institutions and for different subjects. The appearance of the dashboard, symbols displayed on the whiteboard interface can be customized, as well. As an example, fractions and graphing tools may appear on an Algebra class whiteboard, while there may be integral signs as well on the toolbar for a Calculus course.\n\n\n"}

Its activities throughout its history have spanned more than 100 countries and five continents.It was founded in 1880 in Saint Petersburg to provide professional and vocational training for young Jews. \n\nWorld ORT is a federation of autonomous ORT national organisations. In 2005 ORT's global budget exceeded US$250 million annually. ORT's current operations are in Israel, the former Soviet Union (including the Baltic States), Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. ORT also runs International Cooperation programs and supports non-sectarian economic and social development in underdeveloped parts of the world, with vocational training and the provision of technical assistance.\n\nIn 2003 Israel was the area of ORT's largest operation, with 90,000 students educated or trained at ORT’s 159 schools, colleges and institutions, educating 25% of Israel’s hi-tech workforce. However in 2006 ORT Israel withdrew from World ORT. World ORT continues to work in Israel under the name of \"Kadima Mada-Educating for Life\", working with the Israeli Ministry of Education, other Israeli ministries, regional councils and hospitals providing increased resources and improved facilities and schools equipment. World ORT raises funds through its membership organisations in different countries and through the Jewish Federations of North America\" (JFNA).\n\nWorld ORT is legally constituted in Switzerland, but operates from offices in London, England. It has consultative status for information and education purposes with UNESCO, and observer status at the International Labour Organization\n\nORT is a founding member of ICVA (International Council of Voluntary Agencies).\n\nThe second partition of Poland in 1793 had resulted in a sharp increase in the number of Jews in Russia, so that in 1794 Empress Catherine the Great decreed that the majority of them would henceforth be restricted to living and working in the Pale of Settlement. The Jews were not allowed to leave the Pale or own land outside it. They were removed from their homes and villages and once resettled, barred from all but a handful of professions. The crowded conditions and legal barriers to self-sufficiency led to deepening poverty for the Pale's four million inhabitants. After the reforms of Tsar Alexander II in the 1860s, the situation improved for some Jews but those in the Pale remained trapped by economic hardship and dismal conditions. In 1880, Samuel Polyakov, Horace de Gunzburg and Nikolai Bakst petitioned Tsar Alexander II for permission to start an assistance fund which would improve the lives of the millions of Russian Jews then living in poverty. The fund would provide education and training in practical occupations like handicrafts and agricultural skills and would help people to help themselves.\n\nPermission was granted and the appeal was sent out, signed by Poliakov and de Gunzburg as well as Abram Zak, Leon Rosenthal and Meer Fridland, leading to the establishment of the Society for Trades and Agricultural Labor among the Jews in Russia was established. In its first 25 years, ORT raised educational standards and provided training to 25,000 Jews across the Russian Empire. People trained as artisans in glass-blowing, learned sewing and gardening, trained as mechanics, cabinetmakers, and furniture designers \n\nThe first programs created by ORT were dictated by the demands of the market. In 1909, the industrialization in Russia created a need for artisans, so ORT developed courses for electricians in Vilna where electric streetcars were being introduced. They offered automotive courses in St. Petersburg when the automobile began taking root there in 1910. ORT’s training programs varied to meet the needs of Jews depending on where they lived and what the gaps in the workforce were. That flexibility and diversity meant that ORT became an established educational leader in many fields within only its first few decades of existence.\n\nAfter World War I, ORT opened agricultural schools to provide tools and training for agricultural enterprises. ORT headquarters moved to Berlin in 1921, after the Bolshevik Revolution. Initially, the Berlin office dealt mainly with fundraising and support for Jewish education in other countries where the Jews were less well-off. When the Nazis rose to power in 1933, Jewish children were expelled from German schools. ORT sought to open a school in Berlin but encountered difficulties due to the ban on selling property to Jews. Using its international ties, the British branch of ORT purchased a school building and dormitory in the Moabit quarter of Berlin. It received authorization to open in April 1937 after promising that all graduates would leave the country upon graduation.\nLater ORT headquarters moved to France and finally to Geneva. Local groups such as American ORT and Women's American ORT, ORT Canada and British ORT were formed to support the growing network of programs. In 1938, Stalinist purges forced the closure of ORT programs in the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring World War II, ORT continued to serve Jewish communities, including those under Nazi occupation. In the Warsaw Ghetto, the German authorities gave ORT permission to open vocational training courses. Those courses continued throughout the war and until the liquidation of the Ghetto. They served as a template for similar ORT programs in other Jewish centers like Łódź and Kaunas.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, ORT established rehabilitation programs for the survivors. The first one in Germany was started in August 1945 in the Landsberg DP camp. Vocational training centers were set up in 78 DP (Displaced Persons) Camps in Germany, and nearly 85,000 people acquired professions and the tools they would need to rebuild their lives. Jacob Olejski, a Dachau survivor who had previously organized ORT in Lithuania, was the driving force behind ORT's revival in Germany. After 1948 he organized ORT in the newly founded state of Israel.\n\nORT operations in Israel started in Jaffa and Jerusalem, and although the Iron Curtain forced the closure of ORT’s activities in Eastern Europe, in the 1950s Ort activity increased in Western Europe, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran and India.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, ORT continued to provide education and relief services to Jewish communities in Israel, Africa and Asia while opening new programs to serve the Latin American Jewish communities in Argentina (ORT Argentina), Brazil and Uruguay (ORT Uruguay). In the early 1990s ORT returned to the former Soviet Union and the Baltic States, where it now serves 27,000 students in 58 schools and educational institutions every year.\n\nIn 2000, World ORT celebrated its 120th anniversary. The educational services provided through their network continues and has now been supplemented by programs intended to deliver basic nutrition, clothing, books and school supplies, counseling and other services designed to meet the growing emotional needs of students as well \n\nIn addition to technical and financial support for its network of schools and programs in 60 countries around the world, World ORT has developed additional campaigns:\n\n\n\n"}
