Homes; born December 18, 1961, Washington, D.C.) is an American writer best known for her controversial novels and unusual short stories, which feature extreme situations and characters. Notably, her novel \"The End of Alice\" (1996) depicts a convicted child molester and murderer.\n\nHomes, who was adopted at birth, met her biological parents for the first time when she was 31, and published a memoir, \"The Mistress's Daughter\" (2007) about her exploration of her expanded \"family\". \"May We Be Forgiven,\" was published by Viking Books on September 27, 2012. The first chapter of the novel was published in the 100th issue of \"Granta\" (in 2008; edited by William Boyd), and was selected by Salman Rushdie for \"The Best American Short Stories 2008\". The novel won the Women's Prize for Fiction in 2013.\n\nHomes was born in 1961 in Washington, DC to a single woman who got pregnant during an affair with her older, married boss. Homes was put up for adoption immediately after birth and reared by her adoptive parents in the Washington metropolitan area. She did not meet her biological parents until she was 31, when her mother first tracked her down.\n\nHomes received her Bachelor of Arts in 1985 from Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied with the author Grace Paley. She earned her Master of Fine Arts from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop.\n\nHomes has written both short stories and novels; the former published in leading magazines such as \"Granta,\" \"The New Yorker\", \"McSweeney's,\" and \"BOMB Magazine\".\n\nShe wrote her first novel, \"Jack\", when she was 19; it was published in 1989 when she was 28, after she had published some short stories. An exploration of family life and sexuality, it features a boy with divorced parents who learns that his father is gay. The book was critically praised and is still featured in school and college reading lists. Homes wrote a screenplay to adapt it as a film by the same name, produced in 2004 for the cable network Showtime.\n\nA year later, her first short-story collection, \"The Safety of Objects\" (1990), was published. This was adapted as an independent feature film of the same name, released in 2001 and starring Glenn Close among others. Homes co-wrote the screenplay together with the director, Rose Troche.\n\nHer second novel was \"In a Country of Mothers\" (1993). It centered around a therapist and a girl patient who was adopted; the therapist begins to think the girl might be her own daughter, whom she had given up at birth. (Homes was writing this novel and it was in production before her own birth mother tracked her down in 1992.)\n\nHomes' 1996 novel, \"The End of Alice,\" is narrated mostly by a convicted child molester and murderer imprisoned in the West Block of Sing Sing. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Cunningham described this work as \ndark and treacherous as ice on a highway. It establishes A. M. Homes as one of the bravest, most terrifying writers working today. She never plays it safe, and it begins to look as if she can do almost anything. \nIt aroused considerable controversy and received mixed reviews because of its subject matter and objectionable protagonists; in the UK, bookseller W.H. Smith refused to carry it.\n\nHomes published the first chapter of her 1999 novel \"Music for Torching\" as a short story in \"The New Yorker.\" The novel features characters who appeared in the short stories of her first collection, \"The Safety of Objects.\" It features a suburban couple who deliberately burn their house down. Jill Adams in \"The Barcelona Review\" described it as having Homes' \"trademark style of wry humor applied to the uncanny dissection of suburbia’s facade.\" Britain's \"The Observer\" found it \"immensely disturbing\". \"People\" magazine called the novel \"haunting,\",\n\nGary Krist in \"The New York Times\" described it as a \nnasty and willfully grotesque novel. The fact is, I was at times appalled by the book, annoyed by it, angered by it. Its ending struck me as cynical and manipulative. But even so, I found myself rapt from beginning to end, fascinated by Homes's single-minded talent for provocation.\"He concluded with a caveat: \"In her last two novels, the desire to outrage is so conspicuous that it risks obscuring her powerful gifts as a novelist.\"\n\nWriting in \"The Guardian\" in 2003, the writer Ali Smith described Homes' second short story collection, \"Things You Should Know,\" as \"funny and glinting and masterful, light as air, strange as a dream, monstrous as truth: the real and classic thing.\"\n\nHer novel, \"This Book Will Save Your Life\" (2006), was set in Los Angeles; it satirized upper-class residents and the city's culture. It featured \"a rich, isolated man who suffers a physical crisis and goes on a wild compassion spree.\" \"The Guardian\" said that \"it was kitschy and bordered on the inane, but there was something appealing about its mixture of the apocalyptic and the perkily upbeat, caught nicely by John Waters when he said: 'If Oprah went insane, this might be her favourite book.'\"\n\nWith \"May We Be Forgiven\" (2012), Homes returned to a setting in Westchester County, New York, the region described in several of her novels. Packed with violent, emotional incident in the first chapter, it won the Women's Prize for Fiction (formerly the Orange Prize), awarded in the United Kingdom.\"The Guardian\" review described it as \"a novel about forgiveness, family, intimacy, consumerism and the myth of success.\" The reviewer said, \"AM Homes can't really be compared to any other writer; no one else is quite as dark and funny and elegant all at the same time.\"\n\nHomes' articles and essays are published in magazines such as \"The New Yorker\", \"Artforum\", \"Vanity Fair\", and \"McSweeney's\", among others. She has also been a contributing editor to \"BOMB Magazine\" since 1995, where she has published articles and interviews with various artists and writers, including Eric Fischl, Tobias Wolff, and Adam Bartos.\n\nIn 2004, \"The New Yorker\" published \"The Mistress's Daughter\", her essay about meeting her biological parents for the first time at age 31; unmarried when she was born, they had immediately put her up for adoption. She expanded the essay about exploration of her \"family\" members and published her memoir in 2007.\n\nHomes wrote for season two of the television drama series, \"The L Word,\" and produced season three. She developed an HBO series, \"The Hamptons\" about the resort towns along the ocean on eastern Long Island, which she described as \"a cross between \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Grapes of Wrath\".\"\n\nSince 2010, Homes has been developing television pilots for CBS with Timberman/Beverly Productions. In 2013 she was developing Koethi Zan's best-selling novel, \"The Never List,\" as a dramatic series for CBS television. Homes was a writer and Co-Executive Producer on the 2017 USA Series Falling Water, and also a writer and Co-Executive Producer on the David Kelly Stephen King Series, Mr. Mercedes.\n\nHomes lives in New York City with her daughter, Juliet, born in 2003. She has taught in the writing programs at Columbia University, The New School, and New York University. In 2008 she was teaching in the Creative Writing Program at Princeton University.\n\nIn her memoir \"The Mistress's Daughter\", Homes describes meeting her birth parents for the first time when she was 31. They were unmarried when she was born and put her up for adoption. Her birth mother Ellen Ballman was having an affair with her much older, married boss Norman Hecht when she became pregnant. Ballman initiated contact with Homes in hopes that her daughter might donate a kidney to her. Homes also met the members of her father's \"legal\" family.\n\nAsked about her sexuality, Homes said in an April 2007 interview in the \"Washington Post\", \"I've dated men and I've dated women and there's no more or less to it than that.\" In an interview with \"Diva\" magazine, she said, \"I am bisexual, but I wouldn't necessarily define myself that way.\"\n\nOnce a guest artist at the artists' collective Yaddo, Homes was named as its co-chairwoman with Susan Unterberg in 2013. On this, she stated, \"Without Yaddo, I wouldn't exist as a writer. Yaddo gives artists the increasingly rare gift of a time and place to do one's work, suspended from the intrusive buzz of the every day. I am forever indebted.\"\n\nHomes has received numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, a Cullman Center Fellowship from the New York Public Library, a Center for Scholars and Writers Fellowship, National Foundation for the Arts and New York Foundation for the Arts fellowships, and the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis. Her work has been translated into 22 languages.\n\nIn June 2013, she won the prestigious Women's Prize for FictionWomen's Prize for Fiction (formerly named the Orange Prize for Fiction) for her novel \"May We Be Forgiven\" (2012).\n\n\n\n\n"}

AGSEP describes itself as Government Associated Organisation because of its consultancy status to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Disaster Relief Services and the Ministry for Rehabilitation & District Development.\n\nAGSEP works with volunteers; mainly with students from leading German universities doing undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the fields of economics, political science, social science, engineering, sport and other disciplines. The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.)has been conducting sport events and international exchanges between Sri Lankan and European sport teams since 1989. The organisation is based in Marawila, in rural\nwestern Sri Lanka, and was founded by the current CEO of the programme, Dr. Dietmar Döring, who at that time was the national coach of the table tennis team. Dr. Döring saw an opportunity to use sport events as an avenue to enhance tourism and\nthe relationships between estranged ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. The philosophy of A.G.S.E.P. is that sport is an ideal way of connecting people and transcending social, cultural, ethnic and religious cleavages. Sport provides a neutral platform for all participants, who are able to experience and learn from each other in a playful and open atmosphere.\n\nAGSEP's mission it to assist the divided ethnic groups of Sri Lanka to find peace by exposing the children of the island to children of other ethnic groups as part of sporting events.\n\nThe German social education worker Dietmar Doering founded AGSEP while he was a national coach for the table tennis team of Sri Lanka.\n\nSince 1989, against the background of a long-lasting civil war, AGSEP has promoted integrative sport events as peaceful intergroup sport encounters that popularise social values such as intercultural togetherness, respect, courage, commitment, and appreciation through active participation and exchange. Integrative sport events are planned, organised, implemented and staged in co-operation with the three major ethnic groups on the island, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims.\n\nAGSEP imported more than five million US dollars worth of medicines directly from Germany and distributed them to areas affected by the 2004 tsunami.\n\nAGSEP organized the International Run for Peace in Sri Lanka in its bid to promote a lasting peace in the war-torn island.\n\nAGSEP organizes International Master Games in Sri Lanka where competitors from a number of countries used to take part.\n\nPlayers between the ages of 30 to 70 years used to take part in table tennis, badminton, football, handball and beach soccer tournaments which will be played in towns such as Negombo, Kandy, Trincomalee, Galle, Marawila, Puttalam and Hambantota. \n\nTeams from Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, England, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Scotland, Finland, Denmark, Poland, Russia, Ireland and Asian countries Japan, China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Maldives, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam and Canada will compete in the Masters Games.\n\n\"German Memories in Asia\" is a collection of memories by the author Rajkumar Kanagasingam, in his discussions with the German university students, who have been volunteering in Asia under internship programs; and a collection of facts by the author by further research on the discussed subjects. It narrates Asian and European historical events, especially the German, since the Roman Empire era and about the Germans in Germany, Latin America, North America, East European countries, Australia and elsewhere in the world and their migrations, life styles, encounters and assimilation since ancient times.\n\nThe author analyses the Franco-Prussian War and the Otto von Bismarck's diplomacy, Austria & the divided German states, German-Brazilians today, the Pennsylvania's Amish county & the Mennonite communities, the German colonies in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Volga Germans in Russia under Bolshevist atrocities and the First and Second World War issues of Kaiser William II and his diplomatic chaos, Firebombing on Dresden, Danube Swabians and their expulsion, the U.S. President Gen. Dwight D Eisenhower in the crisis of starving German POWs and more.\n\nThe book explores the author's encounters in his early days in the war-ravaged Jaffna in the northern part of Sri Lanka, and then in a tsunami relief mission there with German universities' internship students.\n\n"}

The scheme was launched with an initial funding of . It mainly targets the clusters in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Bihar and Delhi.\n\nAccording to census data, the child gender ratio (0–6 years) in India was 927 girls per 1,000 boys in 2001, which dropped to 918 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2011. A 2012 UNICEF report ranked India 41st among 195 countries. In the Population Census of 2011 it was revealed that the population ratio of India 2011 is 943 females per 1000 of males. The Sex Ratio 2011 shows an upward trend from the census 2001 data.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion of [International Day of the Girl Child] in 2015, the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had called for the eradication of female foeticide and invited suggestions from the citizens of India via the MyGov.in portal.\n\nThe Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) scheme was launched on 22 January 2015 by Modi. It aims to address the issue of the declining child sex ratio image (CSR) and is a national initiative jointly run by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Human Resource Development. It initially focused multi-sector action in 100 districts throughout the country where there was a low CSR.\n\nOn 26 August 2016, Olympics 2016 bronze medallist Sakshi Malik was made brand ambassador for BBBP.\n\nThe hashtag #SelfieWithDaughter was promoted on social media in June 2015, which started when Sunil Jaglan the sarpanch of the village Bibipur, Jind in Haryana took a selfie with his daughter Nandini and posted on Facebook on 9 June 2015. The hashtag garnered worldwide fame.\n\nSex-selective abortion or female foeticide has led to a sharp drop in the ratio of girls born in contrast to boy infants in some states in India. Ultrasound technology has made it possible for pregnant women and their families to learn the gender of a foetus early in a pregnancy. Discrimination against girl infants, for several reasons, has combined with the technology to result in a rise in abortions of foetuses identified as female during ultrasonic testing.\n\nThe trend was first noticed when results of the 1991 national census were released, and it was confirmed to be a worsening problem when results of the 2001 national census were released. The reduction in the female population of certain Indian states continues to worsen, as results of the 2011 national census have shown. It has been observed that the trend is most pronounced in relatively prosperous regions of India. The dowry system in India is often blamed; the expectation that a large dowry must be provided for daughters in order for them to marry is frequently cited as a major cause for the problem. Pressure for parents to provide large dowries for their daughters is most intense in prosperous states where high standards of living, and modern consumerism, are more prevalent in Indian society.\n\nRates of female foeticide in Madhya Pradesh are increasing; the rate of live births was 932 girls per 1000 boys in 2001, which dropped to 918 by 2011. It is expected that if this trend continues, by 2021 the number of girls will drop below 900 per 1000 boys.\n\nStrategies employed to successfully carry out the scheme are:\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party has formed a National Executive Committee to promote Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) across the country. The committee is organising a number of programs to promote \"Save Girl Child\" and \"to Educate Girl Child\" since January 2015. Dr. Rajendra Phadke is the National Convener of BBBP Abhiyan. \n\nThe Beti Bachao campaign is also supported by the Indian Medical Association.\n"}

The AV Vault gave the game high praise, and noted that it managed to overcome the negative stigma around educational games as having \"terrible graphics, shallow stories, little replay value, and shoddy production values\".\n\nJust Adventure noted that while there was an overarching goal, there was no plot-related logical reasoning given for the player to complete each individual puzzle, beside the fact that they can't progress to different areas until they do. Similarly, Adventure Gamers thought the game could have been served better by having a juicier story that matched its intriguing world and puzzles. GameSpy offered a mixed review, but ultimately gave it a 1 star rating.

In schools today, the terms BICS and CALP are most frequently used to discuss the language proficiency levels of students who are in the process of acquiring a new language. These students typically develop proficiency in BICS well before they acquire a strong grasp of CALP or academic language. As a result, students may initially appear fully proficient and fluent, while still struggling with significant language gaps. \n\nIn a 1996 ethnographic study of Salvadorean students in Washington, D.C., Carolyn Vincent found that the students' language attainments were \"largely deceptive\". Students were less proficient than they appeared because they were able \"to converse on a few everyday, frequently discussed subjects\" but often lacked proficiency in academic language. Carolyn Edelsky was an early critic of the BICS/CALP distinction, arguing that academic language is measured inaccurately through a reliance on \"test-wiseness\". Cummins countered this by noting that academic language proficiency does not rely \"on test scores as support for either its construct validity or relevance to education\". Further, it is tempting for teachers and administrators to move students with a high BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills/Social Language Proficiency) level into a 'mainstream' class because they 'sound' like the other kids on the playground.\n\nAlthough the terms BICS and CALP are still widely used, Cummins has more recently used the terms \"conversational language\" and \"academic language\". Instructors of bilingual educational environments, Cummins tells us, should be mindful that a student's apparent ability to interact at a high cognitive level on the 'street' does not necessarily imply the same cognitive or communications ability in the 'class'. Cummins insists that a more thorough assessment of the student's academic language abilities be performed before moving the student out of a 'sheltered' language development environment.\n"}

The term itself is still establishing currency.\n\nDigital civics has arisen from concerns regarding the challenges faced by individuals and society in the digital age. As science and technology have advanced, so too has human understanding of their place in the world. This has altered the way people interact with one another and the broader context in which they exist. Digital civics respond to these challenges by formulating a robust foundation upon which initiatives into digital citizenship and digital citizen engagement can be developed.\n\nResearcher Estelle Clements defines digital civics as “the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens who inhabit the infosphere and access the world digitally.” Clements, who was a doctoral researcher at the Dublin Institute of Technology at the time, first put forward this definition in 2010 as part of an educational project done in conjunction with the Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive. The goal of their project was to teach about life in the online world.\n\nAccording to Clements this definition meets three objectives:\n\n\nOther conceptions of digital civics are still emerging. Newcastle University has suggested that Digital Civics is about “Digital technologies and citizen-driven design”.\n\nNumerous scholars have suggested that the Philosophy of Information is the most logical course to underpin policy and project work for life in the digital age. The Information Philosopher Luciano Floridi has played a critical role in the success of such work, particularly in exploration of Information Society, European Policy, and European Commission’s Onlife initiative.\n\nClements identifies four underlying pillars that contribute to a robust digital civics as well as four key concepts in which digital civics is grounded.\n\nPhilosophy (specifically the Philosophy of Information as described by Luciano Floridi) \nHistory (drawing from Media Ecology and Classical scholarship),\n\nEthics (particularly Virtue Ethics)\n\nCivics (including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as a conjoining of the public and private personas called Hybrid selves).\n\n- It acknowledges the transformations in human life and our world brought about by new scientific breakthroughs and technological developments, and the impact these changes have on how we behave.\n\n- It recognises the importance of responding to these changes in ethical and intellectually rigorous ways.\n\n- And it appreciates that we have a long historical tradition from which to draw when addressing these challenges.\n\n- Fundamental to Digital Civics is an appreciation of the informational nature of reality.\n\nIn considering the ethical issues that arise from digital age civic issues, numerous scholars have suggested that such ethical initiatives should use virtue ethics as a basis for a shared global information ethics: namely, Charles Ess, Shannon Vallor, and Richard Volkman (2010). In her doctoral work on digital civics pedagogy, Clements suggests that her findings were compatible with a framework of virtue ethics. However, the Information philosopher Luciano Floridi asserts that a global information ethics cannot be built upon virtue ethics because virtue ethics is “intrinsically egopoeitic” and thus does not take into account responsibilities owed to the surrounding community or environment. To date, this matter is still contested.\n\nIn 2010, the first pedagogical program for digital civics was started by the Oscar Wilde Facebook Laboratory. It was a collaboration between Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive and the Dublin Institute of Technology's, Estelle Clements. A global team of researchers and educators created a multi-platform (online and offline) learning environment to teach students and the public about digital civics. The project formed the basis of Clements’ doctoral work which formulated a Model for Digital Civics in Pedagogy. At the time, Clements was particularly concerned that new digital citizenship initiatives were not considering the necessary underlying philosophical and ethical issues raised by the digital age and sought to provide a robust foundation to solve this problem.\n\nIn 2014 Newcastle University, launched a program to teach digital civics to postgraduate students at their Open Lab . The program research concentrates on “exploring how digital technologies can empower citizens and communities” and “trains doctoral students in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services.”\n\nIn 2018, [[The MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics (YPP) released a digital civics toolkit described as: “a collection of resources for educators to support youth to explore, recognize, and take seriously the civic potentials of digital life.” The toolkit draws heavily from digital media literacy, focusing on 5 modules: Exploring Community Issues, Investigation, Dialogue, Voice, and Action”.\n\nClements, E.

He was ordained a priest in 1902. He briefly worked in Senegal before being sent to Dahomey. In 1903, he was named vicar of Abomey, and soon took on several other administrative roles in Porto-Novo. Aupiais was reassigned to Dakar from 1915 to 1918. At the end of World War I, he returned to Dahomey and served as director of mission schools. Aupiais was an important religious figure and helped advance the careers of Paul Hazoumé and Sourou-Migan Apithy. In 1925, Aupiais founded the journal \"La Reconnaissance Africaine\", striving to publish ethnographic studies by Dahomeyans and popularize African culture abroad. He was a strident admirer of the indigenous culture and integrated traditional music, costumes and dances into religious celebrations.\n\nIn 1926, he returned to Paris and sought to end forced labor in the colonies and joined the executive committee of the annual Louvain Missiology Week. Aupiais studied at the newly opened Institute of Ethnology in Paris from 1926 to 1928. That year, he became Provincial of the Lyon Province SMA, serving until 1931. Between 1929-1930 he produced two films, one a documentary on Catholic mission efforts in Dahomey, \"Le Dahomey Chrétien\", the other an ethnographic film of traditional religious ceremonies, \"Le Dahomey religieux\", which was censored in 1931. In 1938, he published \"Le Missionnaire\", an overview of his colonial life and work in Africa. The following year, his ethnological work led to him being admitted to the Academy of Colonial Sciences. Although he lived in France during this period, he frequently travelled to Porto-Novo. On 18 October 1945, he was elected to serve as the first representative from Dahomey in the French Assembly. However, he fell ill and died on 14 December 1945 in France. His protege Apithy succeeded him.\n"}
{"id": "724650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=724650", "title": "Free education", "text": "Free education\n\nFree education is education funded through taxation or charitable organizations rather than tuition funding. Many models of free higher education have been proposed. Primary school and other comprehensive or compulsory education is free in many countries, for example, and all education is mostly free (often not including books (from primary) and a number of administrative and sundry fees in university) including post-graduate studies in the Nordic countries. The Article 13 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ensures the right to free education at primary education and progressive introduction of it at secondary and higher education as the right to education.\n\nIn University of Oslo, there is no tuition fee except small semester fee of NOK(600) (74 USD). From 2013 in Northern Europe, Estonia started providing free higher education as well. Sweden, until the early 21st century, provided free education to foreign students but changes have been introduced to charge fees to foreign students from outside the European community. Denmark also has universal free education, and provides a monthly stipend, the \"Statens Uddannelsesstøtte\" or \"SU\", to students over 18 years of age or students who are under 18 and attending a higher education. Bachelor and master's degree programmes in Denmark are offered in either Danish or English depending on the programme or university. Cuba, Brazil, Czech Republic, Greece, Turkey and Argentina provide free education at all levels, including college and university for its citizens.\n\nIn Brazil, free education is offered by the Ministry of Education, which offers scholarships for graduate degrees, masters, doctoral and post-doctoral for Brazilians and immigrants who have Brazilian citizenship. The best universities and research centers are public institutions, financed by either the local state (state universities) or the federal government (federal universities). Graduate students can get paid if they qualify for the incentive but competition is extremely fierce. There has been a proliferation in the last 10 years of private universities which are interested in providing professional training to their undergraduates. These private colleges are not interested in nurturing research centers, since it is not part of their business model to get involved with research.\n\nIn Iran, most prestigious universities are called governmental universities which offer free education for students who pass a very competitive entrance exam with high scores. Graduates from these universities are obliged to serve the country for as many years as they studied for their degree, in order to get their diploma. \n\nUruguay adopted free, compulsory, and secular education in 1876, after a reform led by José Pedro Varela during the Lorenzo Latorre dictatorship. The University of the Republic follows the same principles, although graduates must pay a yearly contribution.\n\nIn Fiji the government announced in 2013 it would cover the costs of primary and secondary school education, equivalent to 250 Fiji dollars per year per student.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, free education is provided by the government at different levels. Government funded schools such as national schools, provincial schools and piriven provided primary and secondary education free, while assisted schools and semi-governmental schools provided the same at subsidized rates. At the university level, the universities provide undergraduate courses free, however, this totals only about 10% for those qualified for university entrance. Grants and scholarships are provided for a limited number of study allowances. Hon.C.W.W.Kannangara who was the Minister of Education made education free for all Sri Lankan students in 1940 s. Kannangara's significant achievements in areas of education have led him to being commonly referred to as the Father of Free Education in Sri Lanka. Health services of Sri Lanka are also free.\n\nElsewhere, free education usually comes to students in the form of scholarships and grants, if they cover all or most of students' expenses. Individuals, institutions, and advocacy initiatives are examples of providers of grants and scholarships. They may have economic (e.g. tax-deductibility), humanitarian, charitable or religious motivations.\n\nThere are examples of steps towards free education being taken across the world primarily in those nations developing rapidly, such as China.\n\nIn the Philippines, free public tertiary education has been enacted in 2017.\n\nIn Mauritius, the government provides free education to its citizens from pre-primary to secondary levels. Since July 2005, the government also introduced free transport for all students.\n\nIn New Zealand, the Labour government will introduce three years of free post-school study or training. In 2018 new students will have one year free for entering study or training from January 1 2018. From 2021 those starting tertiary education would get two years free, and from 2024 three years. The overall cost of the package is $6 billion. Labour has also pledged to increase student allowances by $50 a week, and to restore post-graduate students' eligibility for student allowances.\n\nIn European countries such as France and Malta, tuition is usually free for European students, and in Germany, tuition is free for all European and international students. In Scotland University tuition is free for all Scottish nationals and is discounted for all European students, except from students coming from other parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Russia, prior to the destruction of the USSR, tuition was free for everyone obtaining sufficient grades. Since 1991, if a student obtains sufficient grades, he or she is still eligible for a free education (on a competitive basis) in state or private universities, but he/she can also pay for studying if grades are above minimal threshold, but not enough to be enrolled into desired university for free.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago offers free tertiary education to its citizens up to the undergraduate level at accredited public and select private institutions. Postgraduate degrees are paid up to 50% by the government at accredited institutions. This benefit is given to the citizens under a programme called Government Assisted Tuition Expenses Programme and it is managed by the Funding and Grants Administration Division of the Ministry of Tertiary Education and Skills Training\n\nIn the United States, students pay tuition to attend Community Colleges, with many taking on debt in the form of Federal Loans i.e. \"Student Loans\".\n\nFree education has long been identified with \"sponsored education\". This may now evoke images of advertising campaigns, but in the past, especially during the Renaissance, it was common practice among rich dignitaries to sponsor the education of a young man as his patron.\n\nThomas Jefferson proposed, \"establishing free schools to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic, and from these schools those of intellectual ability, regardless of background or economic status, would receive a college education paid for by the state.\"\n\nIn the United States, the first free public institution of higher education, the Free Academy of the City of New York (today the City College of New York), was founded in 1847 with the aim of providing free education to the urban poor, immigrants and their children. Its graduates went on to receive 10 Nobel Prizes, more than at any other public university. During the late 19th century, the government's compulsory education was introduced as free or universal education, and extended across the country by the 1920s. \n\nCompulsory education is typically funded through taxes. Aggravated truancy can be prosecuted. Homeschooling, private or parochial schooling is usually a legal alternative. \n\nAs of the start of many free internet-based learning institutions such as edX and mitX, education is now free to anyone in the world with internet access. In many countries, the policy for the merit system has not yet caught up with these recent advances in education technology.\n\nOnline education has become an option in recent years, particularly with the development of free MOOCs (massive open online courses) from providers such as Khan Academy (High School) and Higher Education, through providers such as Udacity, Alison, World Education University (WEU) and Coursera. Free education has become available through several websites with some resembling the courses of study of accredited universities. Online education faces barriers such as institutional adoption, license or copyright restrictions, incompatibility and educator awareness of available resources.\n\nDue to the extensive requirements of resources for online education, many open community projects have been initiated. Specifically, the Wikimedia Foundation has developed a project devoted to free online educational resources, Wikiversity, and recently, several other sites for specific topics have developed.\n\nChristian Leaders Institute offers tuition free college level ministry education. Students can take any classes free of charge, but are encouraged to help support the mission of the institution by making donations to this 501 (c)3 United States Charity.\n\nFree education does not only take the form of publicly funded institutions like state universities.\n\nIn France, philosopher Michel Onfray created the first non-governmental free education university since antiquity, in 2002, with his Université populaire de Caen in Normandy. His decision was triggered by the accession of far-right party Front National to the second round of the 2002 French presidential elections. Onfray stated that people need more political, historical and philosophical background education to be more conscious citizens. His university is run by an association loi 1901.\n\n"}

{"id": "154170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154170", "title": "Intuition", "text": "Intuition\n\nIntuition is the ability to acquire knowledge without proof, evidence, or conscious reasoning, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired. Different writers give the word \"intuition\" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.\n\nThe word \"intuition\" comes from the Latin verb \"intueri\" translated as \"consider\" or from the late middle English word \"intuit\", \"to contemplate\".\n\nBoth Eastern and Western philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. Philosophy of mind deals with the concept of intuition.\n\nIn the East intuition is mostly intertwined with religion and spirituality, and various meanings exist from different religious texts.\n\nIn Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the Vedic and other esoteric texts.\n\nFor Sri Aurobindo intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in sanskrit) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry & aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.\nHe finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us. However, with knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.\n\nHe finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans (Vedic) and later was taken over by reason which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress. As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working. He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.\n\nOsho believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal instincts to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.\n\nAdvaita vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience Brahman.\n\nBuddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious thinking, as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form. In Zen Buddhism various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as koans – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment (satori). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.\n\nIn Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads (Arabic: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to prophethood. \nSiháb al Din-al Suhrawadi, in his book \"Philosophy Of Illumination\" (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation (mushahada) on this to bring about correct judgments. while Ibn Sīnā finds the ability of having intuition as a \"prophetic capacity\" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.\n\nIn the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to Plato. In his book \"Republic\" he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human reason to comprehend the true nature of reality. In his works \"Meno\" and \"Phaedo\", he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the \"soul of eternity,\" and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as anamnesis. The study was later continued by his followers.\n\nIn his book \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", Descartes refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as rational intuition. Later philosophers, such as Hume, have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that \"the resemblance\" (recognition of relations) \"will strike the eye\" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, \"or rather in mind\" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of empiricism.\n\nImmanuel Kant finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the cognitive faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called perception). Kant held that our mind casts all of our external intuitions in the form of space, and all of our internal intuitions (memory, thought) in the form of time. Intuitionism is a position advanced by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer in philosophy of mathematics derived from Kant's claim that all mathematical knowledge is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. Intuitionistic logic was devised by Arend Heyting to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of constructivism in general). It is characterized by rejecting the law of excluded middle: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as double negation elimination and the use of reductio ad absurdum to prove the existence of something.\n\nIntuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth. However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially George Bealer have tried to defend appeals to intuition against Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis. A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from experimental philosophers, who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.\n\nThe metaphilosophical assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. Timothy Williamson has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general skepticism about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.\n\nAccording to Sigmund Freud, knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.\n\nIn Carl Jung's theory of the ego, described in 1916 in \"Psychological Types\", intuition is an \"irrational function\", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the \"rational functions\" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as \"perception via the unconscious\": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.\n\nJung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an \"intuitive type\", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, \"the natural champion of all minorities with a future\", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the archetypes, seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.\n\nIn more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and decision making. For example, the recognition primed decision (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. Gary Klein found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The analysis is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.\n\nInstinct is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.\n\nIntuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying nonverbal communication, researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred. In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.\n\nIntuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy. Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately \"know\" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of instincts. Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to \"gut feelings\" and when viable illustrate preconscious activity.\n\nIntuition Peak in Antarctica is so named \"in appreciation of the role of scientific intuition for the advancement of human knowledge.\"\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "52823527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52823527", "title": "Julie Favre", "text": "Julie Favre\n\nJulie Velten Favre (November 15, 1833 – c. 1896), sometimes called Madame Jules Favre, was a French philosopher and educator. She is known for her work educating young women and for advancing a moral philosophy that advocated living a virtuous life, rather than one based on rules and punishment.\n\nFavre was born Caroline Julie Émilie Velten in Wissembourg in the north-eastern part of France to Michel Velten and Caroline Louise Weber. Her father was a Lutheran minister. As a child she disagreed with the imposition of religious practices and was greatly affected by the French Revolution of 1848, which happened when she was thirteen years old. Velten grew to believe strongly in freedom and self-determination.\n\nNot long after completing her teaching degree in Wissembourg, Velten became head assistant of a boarding school in Paris. Run by a Mme. Frèrejean, this Protestant school emphasized the personal will and good mental habits over strict punishment or rigid oversight. Velten was highly influenced by this educational approach. After Frèrejean's death in 1860, Velten became director of the school.\n\nIn 1870, the Franco-Prussian War broke out and northeastern France was occupied by German forces. Velten stayed at the school with students who were unable to leave.\nVelten married Jules Favre, a public official who was active in the French Third Republic, in 1871. The couple traveled often, and Velten Favre used this time to translate various German and Swiss books into French. She also was an intellectual equal of her husband and contributed to his works. In the preface of one of his books, he said of her, \"Her name ought to be beside mine on all the works to which over the last four years she has so faithfully contributed and for which I found, in her mind and heart, the surest guide.\"\n\nJules Favre died in January 1880, and in the following years she compiled, edited and completed his works into several volumes. In 1883 she wrote a defense of her husband's career, which some at the time viewed in a negative light.\n\nIn 1881, Jules Ferry, the French Minister of National Education, named Velten Favre director of the Ècole Normale Supérieure de Sèvres. Ferry was a champion of secular public education, and Velten Favre was well suited to lead the movement for French women to receive secondary education, despite a skeptical public. Velten Favre continued to teach at the school until she died in 1896.\n\nAs an educator, Velten Favre frequently pulled excerpts from classical and modern philosophers such as Aristotle, the Stoics, Plato, Socrates, Molière and Ralph Waldo Emerson for her students to read and discuss. Her own works grew from this educational background and were mainly written in the 1880s. She believed in universal morality, encouraging her students to live educated, moral lives. Personally she considered moral law to have foundations in the Christian perspective, but she also wrote that moral truth could be found outside of Christianity.\n\nIn particular, Velten Favre wrote that one is first a moral citizen, and only secondarily is a member of a country or family.

Our children, our nation.\"\n\nLittle Angels' School (LAS) has a primary wing at Jhamsikhel. The main Hattiban campus offers education up to high school but also includes post-secondary levels. In 2066 BS, LAS began offering the internationally recognized General Certificate of Education classes - Cambridge A Level.

{"id": "26379984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26379984", "title": "Max Hardberger", "text": "Max Hardberger\n\nFlorian Max Hardberger (born November 19, 1948) is an American adventurer, ship captain, aviator, ship recovery specialist, admiralty lawyer and author of maritime fiction and non-fiction adventures.\n\nHardberger received his high school degree in 1966 from the Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee. He became a licensed aircraft pilot at the age of 16 while at Castle Heights. Hardberger attended college at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana then transferred to the University of New Orleans for another two years of study. In 1969 he graduated early with a BA in English. During college, Hardberger became a SCUBA diver, skilled sailor and navigator. After college, Hardberger attended the Program in Creative Writing at the University of Iowa (commonly known as the \"Iowa Writers' Workshop\"), where in 1972 he received a Master of Fine Arts degree in Fiction and Poetry. In 1998, Hardberger earned a \"Juris Doctor\" degree from Northwestern California University School of Law in Sacramento, California, and was admitted to the State Bar of California.\n\nHardberger's first book was \"Deadweight: Owning the Ocean Freighter\" (1994), a textbook on ship ownership. He followed \"Deadweight\" with his first novel, \"Freighter Captain\" (1998), a semi-autobiographical account of his adventures as a ship captain in the Caribbean. Hardberger then moved from maritime subjects to a murder mystery with his 1999 novel, \"The Jumping-Off Place,\" which was a tribute to the hardboiled detective novels of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. On April 6, 2010, Hardberger's auto-biography about his ship recovery adventures was published by the Broadway Books imprint of Random House, entitled \"SEIZED! A Sea Captain's Adventures Battling Scoundrels and Pirates While Recovering Stolen Ships in the World's Most Troubled Waters.\" A paperback edition of SEIZED for the British Commonwealth market will be released by Nicholas Brealey Publishing on June 24, 2010.\n\nAs a devotee of the hardboiled school of fiction, Hardberger's writing style offers gritty realism. Like his life, many of Hardberger's books are set in the seedy world of international business. His protagonists are often like himself, savvy, sardonic, and capable of violent action, and his villains are drawn from the panoply of miscreants he's met as a ship captain and maritime lawyer. Hardberger's stories are fact-based, real-world adventures from the underbelly of world commerce.\n\nAfter college, Hardberger started his professional career with a short stint teaching English at Mandeville High School in Louisiana. Hardberger then worked as a newspaper reporter for the Houma Daily Guide in Houma, Louisiana. He left the newspaper to explore Mexico in an old school bus before returning to the United States to attend graduate school. After he received his MFA degree in 1972, Hardberger taught English at All Saints Episcopal School in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He left teaching to work as a drummer in various blues bands on the Chitlin Circuit.\n\nIn 1977, Hardberger returned home to Louisiana to work as a deckhand and then as a mate on the oilfield supply vessel \"Magcobar Mercury\" in the Gulf of Mexico. After he earned a captain's license, Hardberger's employer sent him to the Dresser-Magcobar Drilling Fluids School in Houston to learn how to become a drilling fluids engineer, also known as a \"mud man.\" Hardberger initially worked in oilfields off the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast and then worked as a drilling fluids consultant in Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War. Between oilfield hitches, Hardberger continued his flying lessons, earning commercial and flight instructor licenses, and took a wide variety of flying jobs, including towing banners, dusting crops, doing nightly check runs for banks and transporting dead bodies for mortuaries. Hardberger also delivered aircraft to Central America. \nHardberger returned to the classroom for the 1984–85 school year, when he taught English and world history at Pope John Paul II High School (Slidell, Louisiana). Hardberger briefly returned to the oilfields of Guatemala in 1985, then began crop dusting on a full-time basis in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. At the end of the 1986 crop dusting season, Hardberger traveled to Miami, Florida to search for new work.\n\nWhen Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier was overthrown as the ruler of Haiti in 1986, trade opened up between the United States and Haiti. The Miami River was the loading port for many small freighters in the Haitian trade. After Hardberger left crop dusting, he searched for and soon found work on the Miami River as the captain of a small freighter engaged in that trade. Among his commands was the \"Erika\", a small freighter which transported cargoes throughout the Caribbean. Hardberger's voyages on the \"Erika\" were the basis of his 1998 semi-autobiographical novel, \"Freighter Captain\".\n\nHardberger left the \"Erika\" to work for a Miami-based ship owner, MorganPrice & Co., as port captain responsible for overseeing port calls by the company's ships. During this period, a MorganPrice freighter, the \"Patric M\", was seized by a shipper in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. This action required Hardberger to sail the vessel out of port under the cover of night and without a clearance, in violation of Venezuelan law. This operation was Hardberger's first vessel \"extraction\" and is detailed in his autobiography, \"Seized\".\n\nHardberger left MorganPrice in 1990 to form his own marine consultancy business in Louisiana. He was periodically retained by shipowners to extract their vessels from lawless ports without a clearance from local authorities. In 1998, following his admission to the California Bar, Hardberger began to practice maritime law alongside his marine consultancy and vessel extraction business. In 2002, Hardberger formed the ship repossession company Vessel Extractions, LLC (\"VessEx\") to extract vessels that have been illegitimately detained or seized in foreign countries. In 2004, Hardberger was featured in The Learning Channel series, \"Repo Men: Stealing for a Living\", in a segment entitled \"Repo Adventurer,\"documenting his extraction of a 10,000-ton freighter from Haiti during the 2004 rebellion and his delivery of the vessel to her mortgagee in the Bahamas.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1999 and in February 2011 had 380 members.\n\nAnnals and chronicles were the main genres of historical writing in the Middle Ages. Consequently, they have always been of great importance to historians. The extent to which they are also of interest to students of medieval literature or of historical linguistics was only fully realised in the latter part of the 20th century. Since many chronicles are illustrated, they are also a fruitful object of study for art historians. It was the desire for a forum in which these disciplines could operate together that led to the foundation of the society.\n\nThe history of the society began with a series of triennial conferences initially in Utrecht, but later moving from place to place. These early conferences were hosted by Erik Kooper (English studies, Utrecht). It was at the second of these conferences, in 1999, that the society was formally founded.\n\nThe society maintains a website financed by the University of Liverpool, and publishes a regular newsletter with information on recent publications in the chronicles field.\n\nVolumes of proceedings of the first three conferences were published by Rodopi. When the society was founded, this triennial publication was transformed into a yearbook, now the peer-reviewed journal \"The Medieval Chronicle\".\n\nThe journal is trilingual, with articles in English, French and German. As well as the proceedings of the society's conferences, and also of the Cambridge Chronicle Symposium, the journal includes research submitted independently of the conferences. A number of text editions of chronicles have also been published here.\n\nConferences to date:\n\nA number of interdisciplinary projects have been inspired by the society, including \"Repertorium Chronicarum\" an on-line database of Latin chronicle manuscripts maintained by Dan Embree on the website of Mississippi State university.\nA major project of the society was the \"Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle\" published in Leiden by Brill.\nThe \"EMC\" contains around 2500 usually quite short articles on individual authors or on anonymous works. A majority of these are from Western Christendom, but there are also entries on Slavic, Byzantine, Syriac, Islamic and Jewish chronicles. These give information on the date, language, form and manuscript tradition, and discuss issues which have been highlighted in recent scholarship. There are also about 60 longer \"thematic\" articles on particular aspects of chronicles. The two-volume paper edition appeared in 2010 and runs to around 1830 pages, with about 60 black-and-white full-page illustrations. About 450 scholars collaborated in writing it. An electronic edition with additional articles appeared in 2012; an update with significant expansions appeared in 2016.\n\n\n"}

For this performance, she came out of retirement to sing the role of The Mother.\n\nShe has made four rare recordings fo Gramophone Company in 1904. Her voice can be heard on the anthology album \n\"The Record of Singing Volume I (1899-1919)\".\n\n\n\n"}

In 1979, it was expanded to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional scholarship and talent in the visual, creative, and performing arts. In 2015, the program was expanded once again to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical fields.

In addition, each Chief State School Officer (CSSO) may nominate up to ten male and ten female candidates, residing in the CSSO's jurisdiction, based on their outstanding scholarship. Additionally, the program is partnering with several recognition organizations that will each nominate up to 10 candidates from their individual programs. Each year approximately 4,000 students are invited to apply to the program.\n\nCandidates then go through a rigorous application process where they must submit candidacy materials, including essays, self-assessments, secondary school reports, and transcripts. Candidates are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership, service, and other extracurricular activities, and an analysis of their essays.\n\nIn mid-April approximately 800 Semifinalists are chosen by a review committee of qualified individuals experienced in secondary and post-secondary education. Six to twenty Semifinalists are identified for each state/jurisdiction. The number of Semifinalists identified per state/jurisdiction is proportionate to the number of candidates for that state.\n\nIn May, the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to 161 Presidential Scholars. One male student and one female Scholar are chosen from the world, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and from families of U.S. citizens and from citizens living abroad. In addition, up to fifteen Scholars are chosen at-large.\n\nThe National YoungArts Foundation reviews approximately 12,000 candidates annually of 15- to 18-year-old artists in the fields of visual, literary, performing and design arts. From these they select (through a blind adjudication process) the top 600-700 artists in the nation as National Winners. 171 of these Winners travel to Miami, Florida for National YoungArts Week, where they are further adjudicated by panelists and can win up to $10,000 to help them pursue a career in the arts. These 171 Winners are then narrowed down to 60 nominees that are recommended to the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars. These 60 candidates are invited to apply, and the Commission, in turn, selects the 20 U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts.\n\nStudents must register and participate in YoungArts, a national program of the National Young Arts Foundation designed to identify, recognize and encourage talented high school seniors who demonstrate excellence in cinematic arts, dance, design, jazz, music, photography, theater, vocal performance, visual arts or writing.\n\nBased on the discipline entered, registrants must submit audiotapes, videotapes, slides or manuscripts demonstrating artistic accomplishment. One panel for each arts discipline evaluates applicants in a two-step blind adjudication process. The judges review material submitted by the applicants and select up to 20 award candidates in each of the ten disciplines for live adjudications in Miami (YoungArts also has National Merit and Honorable Mention Winners that can attend one of three Regional Programs in Los Angeles, New York City and Miami, Florida, as well). All applicants are judged against a standard of excellence within each artistic discipline, not against each other.\n\nThe final judging from the National YoungArts Week results in the recognition of excellence in five different award categories. Upon completion of the YoungArts program, YoungArts will nominate up to sixty students who meet the eligibility requirements for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program. These students will be mailed candidacy materials and invited to apply to the program.\n\nTo be considered further, candidates must submit candidacy materials, including essays, self-assessments, secondary school reports, and transcripts. Candidates are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership, service, and extracurricular activities, and an analysis of their essays.\n\nArts candidates enter the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program selection process at the semifinalist level. In April the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to twenty U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts.\nIn 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. Students are nominated through their Chief State School Officer (CSSO). Each CSSO can nominate up to five candidates who meet the U.S. Presidential Scholars candidacy requirements for the 2016 program. Candidacy materials are mailed to the selected students, and they are invited to apply to the program. To be considered further, candidates must submit candidacy materials, including essays, self-assessments, secondary school reports, and transcripts. Candidates are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership, service, and extracurricular activities, and an analysis of their essays. Career and Technical Education candidates enter the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program selection process at the semifinalist level. In April the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to twenty U.S. Presidential Scholars in Career and Technical Education.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A student who leaves of their own accord (e.g., to work or care for a child), rather than through the action of the school, is considered a school dropout. In typical use, the category of pushouts excludes students who have been formally expelled from school for violating rules (e.g., for being violent).\n\nStudents may be pushed out of school because their presence in the school creates difficulty in meeting some goal of the school. For example, in the case where funding for the school is dependent upon scholastic achievement of the students, if the school can get rid of low-performing students, average test scores on academic performance tests will go up, thus increasing funding. Schools may pushout truant students, who formally enroll in classes, but then refuse to attend.\n\nIn some low-performing schools in Chicago combined dropout/pushout rates have exceeded 25% in one year.\n\nChildren are also pushed from schools because they present discipline problems. Within youth advocacy and activist communities, pushout is a term that recognizes the intersecting forces of oppression most commonly responsible for high school \"drop outs\" within marginalized communities of color, allowing for the responsibility to be placed on those forces, rather than the youth impacted by unequal education, economics, disciplinary actions, and racism. \n\n"}

Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action\n\nSchuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), was a case before the United States Supreme Court questioning whether a state violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by enshrining a ban on race- and sex-based discrimination on public university admissions in its state constitution.\n\nThe case was argued on October 15, 2013, on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which had ruled in 2012 that the Michigan ban, approved by the state's voters in 2006, was unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit was reversed and the state ban upheld.\n\nThe case did not result in a majority opinion; Justice Kennedy wrote a plurality opinion. Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case, presumably because she had worked on the case during her time as United States Solicitor General.\n\nIn 1961, President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order establishing the concept of affirmative action and mandating that federally financed projects ensure that their hiring and employment practices are free of racial bias. With the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin was prohibited.\n\nIn the first case involving affirmative action in higher education, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\" (1978) that the UC Davis medical school admissions program violated the Fourteenth Amendment with the institution of quotas for underrepresented minorities. It did not, however, eliminate race as a factor in university admissions, calling diversity a \"compelling interest.\"\n\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in \"Hopwood v. Texas\" (5th Cir.1996) that the University of Texas School of Law could not use race as a factor in admissions. This was the first successful legal challenge to racial preferences since \"Bakke\".\n\nTwo cases in 2003 involving the University of Michigan found that the university's policy of granting extra points to minorities for undergraduate admissions was unconstitutional (\"Gratz v. Bollinger\") but that a program which gave holistic consideration for being a certain racial minority, though not an automatic boost, in admissions to the law school was constitutional (\"Grutter v. Bollinger\").\n\nMichigan voters approved Proposal 2 in 2006 which amended the state's constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment, public education or public contracting purposes, except for actions mandated by federal law or that are necessary in order for an institution to receive federal funding.\n\nThe Court heard oral argument on October 15, 2013. John J. Bursch, then the Michigan Solicitor General, argued for the petitioner, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette. Mark D. Rosenbaum argued for the Cantrell respondents, and Shanta Driver argued for the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nOn April 22, 2014, the Court ruled for the petitioner that the ban on affirmative action in the Michigan Constitution is constitutional. Justice Kennedy, writing the plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, wrote that \"[t]here is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters.\" Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito joined in the plurality.\n\nChief Justice Roberts also filed a concurring opinion, arguing that the dissent contains a paradox: the governing board banning affirmative action is an exercise of policymaking authority, but others who reach that conclusion (presumed to mean the supporters of Proposal 2) do not take race seriously. He continues that racial preferences may actually do more harm than good, as they reinforce doubt about whether or not minorities belong.\n\nJustice Scalia filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Justice Thomas. He examines what he calls a \"frighteningly bizarre question\": Whether the Equal Protection Clause forbids what its text requires. He answers this by quoting his concurrence/dissent in \"Grutter\": that \"the Constitution [forbids] government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception.\" He asserts that the people of Michigan adopted that understanding of the clause as their fundamental law, and that by adopting it, \"they did not simultaneously offend it.\"\n\nJustice Breyer filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that the case has nothing to do with reordering the political process, nor moving decision-making power from one level to another, but rather that university boards delegated admissions-related authority to unelected faculty and administration. He further argues that the same principle which supports the right of the people or their representatives to adopt affirmative action policies for the sake of inclusion also gives them the right to vote not to do so, as Michigan did.\n\nJustice Sotomayor filed a dissent, joined by Justice Ginsburg, outlining what she called the nation's \"long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of racial minorities to participate in the political process.\" She charges that \"[a] majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.\" Sotomayor contended that those opposed to affirmative action policies could have either lobbied the boards of the state's universities to change their policies or, through the electoral process, changed the membership of the boards. She invokes the political-process doctrine, recognized in \"Hunter v. Erickson\" (1969) and \"Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\" (2007), whereby \"[w]hen the majority reconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority, that alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny.\" Sotomayor had previously credited her own admission to college to affirmative action, stating \"I am the perfect affirmative action baby,\" and that without affirmative action \"it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted.\"\n"}

{"id": "568646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568646", "title": "Simplified Instructional Computer", "text": "Simplified Instructional Computer\n\nThe Simplified Instructional Computer (also abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical computer system introduced in \"System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming\", by Leland Beck. Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.\n\nThe SIC machine has basic addressing, storing most memory addresses hexadecimal integer format. Similar to most modern computing systems, the SIC architecture stores all data in binary and uses the two's complement to represent negative values at the machine level. Memory storage in SIC consists of 8-bit bytes, and all memory addresses in SIC are byte addresses. Any three consecutive bytes form a 24-bit 'word' value, addressed by the location of the lowest numbered byte in the word value. Numeric values are stored as word values, and character values use the 8-bit ASCII system. The SIC machine does not support floating-point hardware and have at most 32,768 bytes of memory. There is also a more complicated machine built on top of SIC called the Simplified Instruction Computer with Extra Equipment (SIC/XE). The XE expansion of SIC adds a 48-bit floating point data type, an additional memory addressing mode, and extra memory (1 megabyte instead of 32,768 bytes) to the original machine. All SIC assembly code is upwards compatible with SIC/XE.\n\nSIC machines have several registers, each 24 bits long and having both a numeric and character representation:\n\nIn addition to the standard SIC registers, there are also four additional general-purpose registers specific to the SIC/XE machine:\n\nThese five/nine registers allow the SIC or SIC/XE machine to perform most simple tasks in a customized assembly language. In the System Software book, this is used with a theoretical series of operation codes to aid in the understanding of assemblers and linker-loaders required for the execution of assembly language code.\n\nThe Simplified Instruction Computer has three instruction formats, and the Extra Equipment add-on includes a fourth. The instruction formats provide a model for memory and data management. Each format has a different representation in memory:\n\nBoth format 3 and format 4 have six-bit flag values in them, consisting of the following flag bits:\n\n\nSIC uses a special assembly language with its own operation codes that hold the hex values needed to assemble and execute programs. A sample program is provided below to get an idea of what a SIC program might look like. In the code below, there are three columns. The first column represents a forwarded symbol that will store its location in memory. The second column denotes either a SIC instruction (opcode) or a constant value (BYTE or WORD). The third column takes the symbol value obtained by going through the first column and uses it to run the operation specified in the second column. This process creates an object code, and all the object codes are put into an object file to be run by the SIC machine.\n\ncodice_1\n\nIf you were to assemble this program, you would get the object code depicted below. The beginning of each line consists of a record type and hex values for memory locations. For example, the top line is an 'H' record, the first 6 hex digits signify its relative starting location, and the last 6 hex digits represent the program's size. The lines throughout are similar, with each 'T' record consisting of 6 hex digits to signify that line's starting location, 2 hex digits to indicate the size (in bytes) of the line, and the object codes that were created during the assembly process.\n\ncodice_2\n\nGiven below is a program illustrating data movement in SIC.\n\ncodice_3\n\nSince the SIC and SIC/XE machines are not real machines, the task of actually constructing a SIC emulator is often part of coursework in a systems programming class. The purpose of SIC is to teach introductory-level systems programmers or collegiate students how to write and assemble code below higher-level languages like C and C++. With that being said, there are some sources of SIC-emulating programs across the web, however infrequent they may be.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1925 by Linus A. Sims, the principal of Hammond High School, as Hammond Junior College, located in a wing of the high school building. Sims succeeded in getting the campus moved to north Hammond in 1928, when it became known as Southeastern Louisiana College. It achieved university status in 1970.\n\nEnrolled are 14,594 students representing 43 states and 66 countries. During the 1990s, Southeastern was one of the fastest-growing colleges in the United States. The university is the third largest in Louisiana, trailing only LSU and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\n\nSoutheastern's colors are green and gold, and the mascot is the \"Lions\". Southeastern's sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (FCS for football) in the Southland Conference.\n\nThe Hammond campus is located east of Baton Rouge and northwest of New Orleans.\n\nWhat began as a junior college supported by local taxes developed into a major university as Southeastern has grown to meet the evolving needs of southeast Louisiana and the Florida parishes.\nOn July 7, 1925, the voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue that created Hammond Junior College. Operated under the auspices of the Tangipahoa Parish School Board, Sims opened the doors on September 13, 1925, with a faculty of three women and two men and 40 students. The two-year coeducational institution offered basic undergraduate work in arts and sciences that culminated in a teaching certificate.\n\nRapidly increasing enrollments quickly forced the college out of its two rooms in Hammond High School. In 1927, voters supported the purchase of the Hunter Leake estate on Hammond's north end. In 1928, Hammond Junior College became Southeastern Louisiana College, formally adopted into the state educational system under the control of the State Board of Education. The purchase of adjoining the original plot provided the space to develop a suitable campus. In 1934, a state bond issue provided for the construction of McGehee Hall and a gymnasium.\n\nLucius McGehee Hall was built in 1935. it is the oldest building constructed by the University. McGehee Hall is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1937, the State Board of Education authorized curricula for four-year programs in liberal arts, teacher education, business administration, music, social sciences, and physical education. The first baccalaureate degrees were conferred in May 1939.\n\nVoter approval of Act 388 in 1938, an amendment to the 1920 Louisiana Constitution, granted Southeastern Louisiana College the same legal status as other four-year colleges. The amendment did not, however, require the state to fund Southeastern at the level of other institutions of higher education, despite strong local support.\n\nOn January 18, 1946, the State Board made available funds to purchase seven city blocks east and west of the campus, and of land north and northwest of the campus, increasing Southeastern's total area to approximately .\n\nOn March 3, 1946, Southeastern was formally approved and accepted into full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as a four-year degree-granting institution.\nAfter World War II, returning G.I.s caused exponential growth of the college, necessitating construction of classrooms, a student union, a cafeteria, a health center, dormitories, apartments for married students, and many surplus temporary buildings donated by the federal government. In 1948, the U.S. Navy contributed two steel barracks for use as dormitories including McNeely Hall (which was demolished in 2007).\n\nIn 1960, the State Board authorized Southeastern to offer master's degrees through the newly formed Division of Graduate Studies. Southeastern began awarding the Education Specialist degree in 1967. The War Memorial Student Union, constructed in the mid-1960s, is the only student union building in the United States dedicated to alumni who died in World War II. \nIn 1969, the college awarded its first Distinguished Alumnus Award to jazz pianist Bill Evans.\nGovernor John McKeithen on June 16, 1970, signed into law the legislative act turning Southeastern Louisiana College into Southeastern Louisiana University. Early 1970s also saw the construction of D Vickers, the Athletics Building, and the C.E. Cate Teacher Education Building.\n\nAfter years of planning and fundraising, the Southeastern Louisiana University Center was constructed. An 8000-seat (more if the floor level is used) arena, the University Center hosts all home basketball games and a variety of civic, cultural, and big-name entertainment events.\nIn October 1986, a group of faculty members launched Fanfare, a festival celebrating the arts, humanities and sciences. Since then, Fanfare has become an acclaimed month-long event, drawing nationally and internationally recognized artists and providing recognition for those closer to home. In addition to providing entertainment for Lake Pontchartrain's Northshore Area, Fanfare has an educational-outreach program that works closely with local schools. In October 2005, Fanfare proudly celebrated its 20th anniversary.\n\nSoutheastern's enrollment, continually increasing since its inception, reached an important milestone in 1997, registering over 15 thousand students for the fall semester. Pervasive professional accreditations, such as accreditation of the College of Business by AACSB, and excellent egress from/to I-55 and I-12 figure significantly in the increase. From its founding in 1925 until 2009, Southeastern has conferred more than 50,000 degrees.\n\nAs Southeastern celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2000, the fall semester marked an exciting change as Southeastern implemented screened admissions standards for the first time. Also during the 2000–2001 academic year, the Village, Fayard Hall, and the Claude B. Pennington, Jr., Student Activity Center were completed.\nIn May 2001, Southeastern received full approval from the Board of Regents for its first new graduate degree program in more than a decade, an MS in Integrated Science and Technology. Since then, Southeastern received approval for seven additional programs: MA in Organizational Communications, MS in Applied Sociology, BS in Athletic Training, BS in Health Education & Promotion, BS in Health Studies, BS in Occupational Health, Safety & Environment, and Master of Arts in Teaching.\n\nIn 2001 Southeastern took ownership of the historic Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in downtown Hammond. The theater is operated by a separate foundation and presents a variety of theatrical works, concerts, and dance performances.\n\nIn Fall 2003, Southeastern hit a record enrollment of 15,662 students. Fall 2003 also saw the return of football to Strawberry Stadium, after an 18-year hiatus. The Lions completed the season 5–7.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Southeastern began implementing portions of the Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criteria, a full year ahead of schedule and before any other schools in the state.\n\nIn Fall 2005, Southeastern began its first year under the full Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criterion. In the same semester Southeastern, which was virtually undamaged by Hurricane Katrina, absorbed some two thousand students whom the storm had displaced from institutions in New Orleans. North of the War Memorial Student Union is a large fountain constructed and dedicated in 2007 to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita; it is the only such memorial fountain in existence.\n\nJohn Alario (R – Jefferson Parish), dean of the Louisiana State Senate, is a graduate of Southeastern. Another Southeastern alumnus was the late State Representative Donald Ray Kennard, who began representing parts of East Baton Rouge and Livingston parishes starting in 1976. Kennard is also a former president of the Southeastern Alumni Association. See also \n\nSoutheastern offers has its University Center for commencement exercises of high schools throughout the Northshore Region and actively encouraging area high school students to continue on to the university level.\n\nSoutheastern owns the Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in Hammond's Historic District. First opened in 1928, the Columbia was acquired by the university in the 1990s and renovated in the amount of $5.6 million. The large foyer is dedicated to the late State Senator John Hainkel, who was instrumental in obtaining the funding for the renovation.\n\nSoutheastern Louisiana University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award degrees at the Associate, Baccalaureate and Master's levels. Southeastern has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1946.\n\nSoutheastern consists of five colleges with 18 academic departments and programs offering over 60 degree programs.\n\nSoutheastern's state-of-the-art library houses several important collections, including the Morrison Room, the Rayburn Collection, the Pineywoods People Exhibits, and the Center for Regional Studies.\n\nSoutheastern offers nursing curricula in Hammond and Baton Rouge. In a consortium with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Southeastern offers a master of science in nursing.\n\nSoutheastern became a doctoral-granting institution in 2005 with the inauguration of a doctor of education in higher education leadership.\n\nSoutheastern's business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Southeastern was the first institution in Louisiana to achieve AACSB's separate and special accreditation in accounting. Graduates of both the MBA program and the Executive MBA program are serving widely in education and industry.\n\nIn the aftermath of Tulane University's post-Katrina decision to close several engineering programs including computer engineering, Southeastern received approval from the Louisiana Board of Regents to develop an undergraduate curriculum in engineering technology within the Department of Computer Science & Industrial Technology.\n\n\n\n\nSoutheastern Louisiana sponsors 16 NCAA Division I level varsity teams compete in the Southland Conference.\n\nSoutheastern has several state-of-the-art athletic facilities, including an eight-lane all-weather running track completed in 2011 (see inset).\n\nSoutheastern's major campus media and publications are the \"Lion's Roar\" (newspaper), KSLU (FM radio station), \"ByLion\" (weekly online publication), the Southeastern Channel (public access cable television channel), and \"Le Souvenir\" (official yearbook).\n\n\"The Lion's Roar\" is the official newspaper of the students of Southeastern Louisiana University. Distributed on Tuesdays, it is published weekly during regular semesters and monthly during the summer semester. \"The Lion's Roar\" is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern Louisiana University working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs. \"The Lion's Roar\" has been in continuous publication since 1937.\n\nSoutheastern's KSLU-FM radio station began operation on November 11, 1974, as a radio club at the university, operating at 10 watts of power. Initially the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during weekends and holidays. Thanks to support from the Student Government Association and self-assessed fees of the student body, in 1983 the station qualified for membership in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Since that time the station has grown to 3,000 watts, the maximum allowed because of the crowded 88–92 MHz band and the university's proximity to Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\n\nIn 1988, KSLU became the first radio station in the South to install a digital touchscreen operating system. The installation was featured in \"Broadcast Engineering\" magazine and visited by radio personnel from across the world.\n\nThe broadcast schedule offers non-commercial programs, with offerings including local talk shows, entertainment and sports news, campus and community activities.\n\nIn 1993, an emergency-situation room was added using amateur radio equipment purchased with grants from State Farm Insurance and Louisiana Power & Light (a subsidiary of Entergy). During critical times, this room is staffed by local ham operators, members of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service in the Florida Parishes area.\n\nIn the past, the station produced several political forums which were fed to all public radio stations in Louisiana and to commercial stations via the Louisiana News Network.\n\nThe year 1996 brought another phase as KSLU began broadcasting globally via the internet, enabling families of international and out-of-state students to hear live university events.\n\nA job at KSLU was the start of the media career of Robin Roberts.\n\n\"ByLion\" is published weekly online (bi-weekly during the summer session) for the faculty and staff of Southeastern Louisiana University. This newspaper is very popular among freshman students.\n\nThe Southeastern Channel officially began July 9, 2002.\nThe Southeastern Channel won four Telly Awards in 2007. Staff member Steve Zaffuto won two Bronze Tellys for animation of \"Native Sounds\" and \"Current Events\" promotions, and Josh Kapusinski won a first-place Silver Telly for animation and a Bronze Telly for editing the \"Florida Parish Chronicles\" promo. Josh Kapusinski's \"Florida Parish Chronicles\" promo won a 2006 Emmy Award in the Suncoast Region.\n\nAlumni of the public-access TV channel include Randi Rousseau, Christopher Guagliardo, Chris Lecoq, Matt Milton, Nick Brilleaux, Robbie Rhodes, Travis Connelley, Tim Tregle, Tim Tully, John Reis, Allen Waddell, Whitney Magee, and Chris Coleman.\n\n\"Le Souvenir\" is the official student yearbook of Southeastern. It is published annually and distributed to the student body in the fall semester. \"Le Souvenir\" is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs. \"Le Souvenir\" (French for \"the memory\") has been in continuous publication since 1929.\n\n\n"}

Beginning in the late 1970s, he had worked with hundreds of high schools, studying the development and design of the American educational system, leading to his major work \"Horace's Compromise\" in 1984. In the same year, he founded the Coalition of Essential Schools based on the principles espoused in \"Horace's Compromise\".\n\nSizer was born in New Haven, Connecticut to Theodore Sizer, Sr. (1892–1967), an art history professor at Yale University. He received his B.A. in English from Yale in 1953 and subsequently served in the Army as an artillery officer. He later described his experience leading soldiers in a democratic and egalitarian fashion as a formative influence on his ideas about education. After teaching in high schools, he earned his masters and doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1957 and 1961, respectively. He was a faculty member and later dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, a position he held during the 1969 Harvard student strike. While dean, he reorganized the school into seven departments, expanding the resources available for research (particularly in the area of urban education), while expanding minority enrollment. In 1970, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Education.\n\nSizer left Harvard to serve as headmaster of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts from 1972 to 1981, to lead a study of American high schools sponsored by the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National Association of Independent Schools. From 1983 to 1997, he worked at Brown University as a professor and chair of the education department, and in 1993, he became the Founding Director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform.\n\nDuring his years at Brown, he produced most of his books, including \"Horace's Compromise.\" In it, he examined the fundamental compromise at the heart of allegedly successful American high schools. He suggested that the students agree to generally behave in exchange for the schools agreeing not to push them too hard or challenge them too severely. Thus, he widened the scope of schools that were failing to do their best to educate children far beyond the traditionally criticized poor and urban schools and challenged the conceptions of what could be considered a successful school. The ideas explored in his \"Horace Trilogy\" supply much of the foundation of the Coalition of Essential Schools.\n\nAfter retiring from Brown, Sizer took a one-year position during the 1998–99 school year as co-principal (with his wife Nancy Faust Sizer) of the Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School, of which he was a Trustee Emeritus and helped to found. Their book, \"Keeping School\" (coauthored with Deborah Meier and Nancy Faust Sizer), drew from this experience. From 1997 through 2006, Sizer returned to the Harvard Graduate School of Education as a visiting professor, co-teaching a course on redesigning the American secondary school with his wife, while he continued to work on the issues of integrating the multiple services that low socio-economic status families need in poor communities.\n\nHis wife, Nancy Faust Sizer, whom he married in 1955, was also an educator, and they had four children. He died at age 77 on October 21, 2009 at his home in Harvard, Massachusetts due to colon cancer.\n\n\n"}

It was discontinued in 2010.\n\nTrain to Gain was designed to deliver vocational training to employed individuals in the UK, primarily those in the 25+ age band who did not already have a Full Level 2 Qualification, via the Skills Funding Agency, formerly the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The initiative was rolled out nationally in September 2006. Train to Gain formed a part of the Employer Responsive training model. On 24 May 2010 the UK government announced a £200 million reduction in this programme as part of its planned £6.2 billion reduction in expenditure in the 2010-11 government financial year. The Train to Gain brand was scrapped in July 2010.\n\nTrain to Gain was designed to ameliorate the skills deficiency in the UK identified by the Leitch review. The purported idea of the service is to offer skills advice and match business needs with Further Education and training providers. The service will also identify any funding or grants that can be used to offset the investment in training. The support and advice offered by Train to Gain is claimed to be flexible, responsive and offered at a time and place to suit businesses.\n\nThe supposed appeal to employers is that they receive targeted, quality approved training to upskill their staff in line with their individual and business related needs. The appeal to employees is allegedly that they are invested in, given training to help them in their role and the opportunity to certify their existing skills. In addition to this there is funding available to improve their overall skills and levels of literacy and numeracy. A NAO report published in July 2009 queried whether the tax payer was receiving good value for money from this programme.\n\nTrain to Gain is designed to maximise on the effectiveness of the Skills Brokerage — Skills Brokers liaise with employers to identify their skill needs and then provide a matching service with appropriate training providers. Thus Train to Gain can also reference the entirety of employer training and liaison.\n\nThe fundamental criteria for eligibility for Train to Gain core funding are:\n\n\nLearners in the 19–25 age band are eligible for funding through Train to Gain where an apprenticeship would not be considered appropriate, for example where the learner is on a temporary contract. Apprenticeships are the UK government's preferred route for vocational training in this age group. Learners below the age of 19 cannot be funded through Train to Gain.\n\nQualifications that are eligible for funding via Train to Gain are identified as such in the LSC's Learning Aims Database (LAD). These are primarily NVQs at level 2 or level 3 alongside Skills for Life at levels 1 & 2.\n\nDuring the course of the 07/08 contract year the LSC released several additional \"flexibilities\" applying to learner eligibility. These allowed volunteers to access the Train to Gain service, as well as self-employed learners. A further flexibility allows exemption from the criteria concerning prior attainment (i.e. no full level 2), for learners coming through the local employment partnership (LEP) route. That is to say, those learners who find work through Jobcentre Plus and subsequently come on to Train to Gain.\n\nThe LSC has outlined further enhancements to the Train to Gain service in a recent letter to training providers. These include additional level 2s and level 3s for those who already have them (under specific circumstances), accessibility to Skills for life for those ineligible due to prior attainment and funding for Skills for life at levels other than 1 and 2.\n\nNAO report on train to gain. http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0809/train_to_gain.aspx\nAnnouncement of reduction in govt funding http://bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2010/May/BIS-savings\n\nPlease note: there is a fraudulent training company called Train2GainHGV which has embezzled large sums of money from members of the public who enrolled with them in order to take HGV driving courses.

Its charter states that it \"shall exist to: serve the interests of the current and future students of the University of California and promotes [\"sic\"] cooperation between various student governments of the University and student organizations concerned with higher education.\" The Association is not a public agency, but its leadership is composed of representatives of UC student governments, which are \"official units of the University\" system (with one exception). UCSA participates in various aspects of the UC system's governance, notably including the selection of the student representative on the UC Board of Regents.\n\nUCSA representatives have opposed education funding cuts and increases in student fees and supported affirmative action in enrollment policies. The association mobilizes students via voter registration campaigns; it recorded 26,000 new voter registrations in 2006, and added 12,300 new registrations in 2008 for the California Democratic and Republican primaries. In April 2016, UCSA called for the removal of then-chancellor of UC Davis, Linda Katehi. In January and October 2017, UCSA called for the removal of Norman Pattiz, a UC Regent, due to sexual harassment allegations that Pattiz has admitted to.\n\nUCSA's governing body is its board of directors, which is chartered to be made up of the external vice presidents of all UC student governments. However, UCSA generally requires each student government to pay dues to maintain voting rights on the board. Thus, student governments may effectively \"withdraw\" from UCSA by refusing to pay dues. \n\nIn May 2017, the UCSA board of directors included voting members from 18 student governments. That number dropped to 11 in 2018 because a number of professional and graduate student governments withdrew from UCSA and formed a separate organization named \"University of California Graduate and Professional Council\". \n\n, the UCSA board of directors included voting members from the following student governments:\n\n\nSouthern and northern regional UC student nominating commissions annually select ten semifinalists for University of California student regent. These semifinalists are then interviewed by the UCSA board of directors. The board chooses three applicants, who are then interviewed by a special Regents' committee. The committee then recommends a nominee to the full board of University of California Regents.\n\n\n"}
