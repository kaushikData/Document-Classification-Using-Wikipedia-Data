AAPT publications include two peer-reviewed journals, the \"American Journal of Physics\" and \"The Physics Teacher\". The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators, including the Richtmyer Memorial Award, and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in College Park, Maryland.\n\nThe American Association of Physics Teachers was founded on December 31, 1930, when forty-five physicists held a meeting during the joint APS-AAAS meeting in Cleveland specifically for that purpose.\n\nThe AAPT became a founding member of the American Institute of Physics after the other founding members were convinced of the stability of the AAPT itself after a new constitution for the AAPT was agreed upon.\n\nThe AAPT sponsors a number of competitions. The Physics Bowl, Six Flags' roller coaster contest, and the US Physics Team are just a few. The US physics team is determined by two preliminary exams and a week and a half long \"boot camp.\" Each year, five members are selected to compete against dozens of countries in the International Physics Olympiad (IPHO).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "261061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261061", "title": "Anticipatory democracy", "text": "Anticipatory democracy\n\nAnticipatory democracy is a theory of civics relying on democratic decision making that takes into account predictions of future events that have some credibility with the electorate. The phrase was coined by Alvin Toffler in his book \"Future Shock\" and was expanded on in the 1978 book \"Anticipatory Democracy\", edited by Clement Bezold.\n\nOther well-known advocates of the anticipatory approach include Newt Gingrich, Heidi Toffler, K. Eric Drexler, and Robin Hanson. They all advocate approaches where the public, not just experts, participate in this \"anticipation\".\n\nThe FutureMAP program of the Information Awareness Office program of the United States government proposed a prediction market prior to its cancellation on July 29, 2003.\n\nBioregional democracy can appear as a variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the ecological health outcomes of any given action. However it usually relies more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.\n\nAn alternative, deliberative democracy, may combine with either the anticipatory or the bioregional model. It relies less on formal models and a market system for betting on future events, and more on discussion.\n\nDeliberative, anticipatory and bioregional approaches can all be considered variants of participatory democracy with different thresholds of ease of participation, burden of proof, concern for non-human life or future generations, and reflection of participants' tolerances versus preferences or ideals of truth. Sometimes a deliberative model is described as more \"left\" and an anticipatory model as more \"right\". Those who wish to avoid this debate and see merits to both approaches, e.g. Greens, usually prefer the generic term \"participatory democracy\". This term has become fundamental to green politics itself.\nOther terms which likewise have more specific associations with advocates or methods include: grassroots democracy, semi-direct democracy, consensus democracy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38164724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38164724", "title": "Arts Olympiad", "text": "Arts Olympiad\n\nThe Arts Olympiad is an international art competition for children ages 8 to 12 organized by International Child Art Foundation with one million participants from seventy countries. Each competition is four years long and it is held every four year. The competition includes the element of art and peace to encourage children around the world to use creativity and cooperation.\n\nDr. Ashfaq Ishaq, founder of the International Child Art Foundation, started the first Arts Olympiad competition in 1999 to address the issue which was coined decades earlier as the \"fourth grade slump\" in creativity. The researchers at the time suggested that the phenomenon is a result of a drop in creativity around the ages of nine as they start conforming to standardized testing and to please parents and teachers. The plan was to let children who were the winners of U.S. states and other countries to come together in a festival to let them work together and learn other cultures with the goal to move future generations toward global peace.\n\nThe theme for the first Art Olympiad was \"My World in the Year 2000\" to ask children to create art in which they envisioned themselves in the new millennium. There was one million children in 86 countries in the program which was run between 1997 and 2000. The winning pieced from around the world were exhibited at the \"World Children’s Festival\" in 1999 on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The artworks were also later exhibited at the White House Millennium Celebration, the United Nations Headquarters, and the 2003 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Dubai.\n\nSince then the format of the global competition, a festival in Washington, DC and global exhibitions have been following in the next Arts Olympiad cycles. The 2nd Arts Olympiad was held between 2001 and 2004 with the theme of \"Me in the New Millennium\". Starting in the 3rd Arts Olympiad (2005-2008), the theme was shifted to relate art and sport to promote the artist-athlete ideal. The fourth Arts Olympiad (2009-2012) continued the same theme with title \"My Favorite Sport\".\n\nDuring the first two years of the competition, local schools are participated in the Arts Olympiad lesson plan. The artworks as the result of the lessons are then put into a selection process.\n\nThe selection process in the United States is first done from at the local school district. The selection of artworks from within a school or school district. The artworks are then submitted to Washington, DC for another selection to have a representative of each participating state.\n\nIn other countries, the partner in each country will administrate the selection. The selection can be in many phases involving the competition at the local level and at the national level.\n\nThe winners who represent the participating U.S. states and countries are invited to the World Children's Festival in Washington, DC.\n\nThe World Children's Festival is a three-day festival held every four years on the National Mall in Washington, DC for winners of the Arts Olympiad to participate. The festival includes over 50 performances and many art-related workshops. It also has sessions for the winners from different countries to co-create artworks with many adult artists. \nBefore the event, the Arts Olympiad winners from Washington, D.C. are asked to be ambassadors for the festival and exchange emails with international winners to welcome to the festival. The international winners are welcomed to the host families around the Washington area.\n\nChildren share ideas and work together during the three-day festival. On the last night of the festival, the celebratory dinner is held with all guests dressing in national attire.\n\nSimilar festivals have been replicated in other counties such as the European Children’s Festival at Olympia Park in Munich in 2006.\n\nAfter the World Children's Festival, the winning pieces will travel to exhibitions in the U.S. and internationally. The past exhibitions have been in United Arab Emirates, Germany, Israel, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Uganda, Italy, Egypt, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Qatar.\n\nThe organizer have seen the potential and the importance of Art Olympiad winners to promote the cause. An example was demonstrated when a winner from Peru who have gone through difficulties in arranging competition because there was no office of the Internal Child Art Foundation in the country, that child eventually set up and organize the competition in the country for the next season with the support from the ministry of education. With that, they started encouraging the winners to contribute back to the program and set up a youth board for the organization.\n\nIn each cycle of the Arts Olympiad competition, a number of winners are choose to serve the youth board of the organization. Their roles are to be organization's spokespersons, conduct fundraising to support the programs, write for ChildArt magazine, help stage and be the master of ceremonies at the World Children's Festival, and nominate innovative leaders, companies and organizations for the World Children's Award.\n\nSince the formation of the youth board there have been 38 members from two dozen counties.\n\n"}

It is the oldest continuously operated place-based college scholarship fund in the United States. The fund is managed by a local board of trustees. Its assets total over $6,800,000, making it one of the largest scholarship funds in Oregon.\n\nBernard Daly was a doctor, businessman, banker, rancher, state representative, state senator, county judge, and regent of Oregon State Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). Daly was born in Ireland on February 17, 1858. He immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1864. After graduating from medical school, he joined the United States Army. In 1887, Daly left the army and moved to Lakeview, Oregon where he began a private medical practice. Over the years, Daly played a very important role in the economic development of Lake County, establishing a number of successful businesses.\n\nWhen Daly died on January 4, 1920, he had business interests throughout Lake County. He was the largest stockholder in the Bank of Lakeview. He owned the largest ranch in south-central Oregon as well as a number of other businesses. He also owned at least 14 buildings in downtown Lakeview. All together his partnerships and investments brought the value of his estate to almost $1,000,000, a very large sum in 1920.\n\nIn his will, Daly gave his fortune to the people of Lake County in the form of the Bernard Daly Educational Fund. In his will, Daly wrote:\n\nThe fact that his will specifically directed that Daly scholarships be granted to women as well as men was very progressive for that era. Based on the terms of the will, the scholarships must be used to attend \"schools, colleges, and technical schools of the State of Oregon.\"\n\nThe first Daly Fund scholarships were awarded in 1922. Today, the education fund Daly established is the oldest continuously operating place-based college scholarship in the United States. It provides scholarships to three Lake County high schools, located in Lakeview, Paisley, and Silver Lake. Together, the three schools graduate approximately 100 students per year. Each year, approximately 40 Lake County students attend college on Daly scholarships. The scholarship provides $2,000 per term, up to a maximum of $8,200 per year. Since the fund was established, over 2,000 students from Lake County communities have attended college on Daly Fund scholarships.\n\nSince it was established in 1922, the Fund has continued to grow. As of 2006, it had over $6,800,000 in assets available to support scholarships for Lake County students.\n\nThe Bernard Daly Educational Fund is governed by a five-person board of trustees. As of 2007, the trustees are: Dr. Mike Sabin of Lakeview (chairman); James C. Lynch of Lakeview (secretary/treasurer); Alan Parks of Silver Lake (trustee); and Ann Tracy of Lakeview (trustee).\n\n"}
{"id": "13421150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13421150", "title": "Bishop Scott Academy", "text": "Bishop Scott Academy\n\nBishop Scott Academy was a school located in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Affiliated with the Episcopal Church, the school was named for the Bishop Thomas Fielding Scott. The school opened in 1870 to educate young men in good citizenship and prepare them to enter the ministry. Later a military department was added to the school before the academy closed in 1904. The school organized the first American football team and held the first football game in the Pacific Northwest in 1889.\n\nThe academy was related to an earlier attempt by Scott to found a diocesan school. The Reverend William Richmond had started a school at Yamhill in 1852. Bishop Scott moved Richmond's school to present-day Lake Oswego, Oregon, where Scott had purchased 70 acres that included a school building dating to 1850. Here Scott established the Diocesan School for Boys. Bernard Cornelius, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, was appointed in 1856 by Scott as principal over 17 boarders. A primary department opened in 1858, and the school was renamed Trinity School for Boys. The school offered \"both religious and secular education\". Cornelius resigned in 1860, and the school closed for two years. In 1862 it reopened under leadership of the Reverend Michael Fackler. Although Cornelius returned to the reigns in 1863, he could not halt declining enrollment. Trinity school closed in 1866 and the trustees sold the property.\n\nFunds and property were provided to Scott's successor, Bishop B. Wistar Morris, to establish another school, but located in Portland, Oregon. The land comprised 38 city lots along 19th Street, between Couch and Everett Streets in Portland. The donors were Captain George H. Flanders and his sister, Mrs. Caroline Couch (wife of John H. Couch). Morris laid the cornerstone on July 5, 1870.\n\nThe newly completed Bishop Scott Grammar and Divinity School opened as a boarding and day-school for boys on September 6, 1870, under principal Charles H. Allen. Comprising three storeys above a basement, the building housed 2 classrooms, recitation rooms, a parlour, library, 16 rooms for boarders, a suite for the principal and his family, and its own chapel, called Saint Timothy's. Although the total costs amounted to $15,000, no debt remained.\n\nA year after opening the school had a new head master: Professor R. W. Laing, M.A., L.L.D., assisted by the Reverend George Burton.\n\nBy 1873 the property was valued at $30,000, after the addition of the chapel, school rooms, and the dormitory. Costs were defrayed from tuition fees of $150 per annum, and interest from an $7,000 endowment—the proceeds from the sale of the Oswego property. Eighty pupils attended school, thirteen down from the previous year, drawn from Oregon, Washington, California, Utah, Alaska, and British Columbia. The faculty comprised three teachers: Junior Master, William M. Barker; Primary Master, Mr. Grant; and Senior Master, Rev. A. N. Wrixon. As chaplain, Burton conducted services \"in the large schoolroom of the Grammar School\" at 10.30am, and Sunday School at 2pm in August.\n\nAt the start of Christmas Term on 1 September, Rev. Burton, now rector of Trinity Parish, was ensconced as head master. As it had been since 1870, the school was still administered directly by Bishop Morris. Subjects included modern languages, music, singing, drawing, chemistry, and penmanship. Oregon's superintendent of education found that the grammar school's \"philosophical and chemical apparatus [were] unsurpassed in the State\", and mentioned that the school library contained 1,500 books.\n\nThe school had replaced almost all its faculty by 1874, and added women to the staff for the first time. Laing and Barker continued, alongside the new head master and chaplain, Rev. D'Estaing Jennings, M.A. Miss I. A. Buss was added as \"Preceptress\" (female teacher), and Matron Maria Emery had been appointed. A military tone was introduced, in the form of Drill Master R. R. Anderson and the organization of the Bishop Scott Cadets. Drilling was viewed not only in terms of military preparedness, but as a form of exercise.\n\nOn 8 November 1877 the grammar school was heavily damaged by fire. Before fire almost destroyed the library and equipment, the enrollment stood at 43 day pupils and 40 boarders.\n\nJoseph Wood Hill was the new principal when the rebuilt school opened on the same premises in September 1878. Burton had been deposed by Bishop Morris in May that year. The new building was smaller than the one it replaced, although \"admirable\" and \"of superior architectural character\", to fit in with the homes in the surrounding area.\n\nHill was a native of Westport, Connecticut, having attained a BA from Yale University earlier in 1878. He had responded to an address that Bishop Scott gave to a class at Yale. Noah Porter, Yale's president, recommended Hill for his character, teaching experience, and maturity. After his appointment, Hill studied medicine at Willamette University's College of Medicine in Portland, graduating as a MD in 1881. At college he rowed, and became a member of the Gamma Nu fraternity.\n\nOnly five boarding pupils attended the school at the start, and there were \"less than twenty pupils, all told\". Hill leased the school building from the bishop, and later from the board of trustees that had been appointed when Oregon became a separate diocese in 1889.\n\nEchoing the beliefs of Bishop Scott in the value of private over public education, Hill modelled the school after the private boarding schools on the east coast, like the one that he himself had attended. He filled the initial faculty vacancies with Yale graduates, such as John W. Gavin and English teacher Allan Elsworth. At the same time he did subsidize from his own pocket those students for whom the $300 annual fees were a hardship.\n\nHill spent his vacations visiting exemplary private schools throughout the United States, and gradually became convinced that military discipline was essential for the Academy. In 1886, he declared that pupils should wear uniforms.\n\nIllustrating the amount of control the principal was granted by Bishop Morris, Hill renamed the school the Bishop Scott Academy in 1887. A military department was added, and the Academy became the first school on the West Coast to adopt military discipline. Hill had an armory built that measured 5,000 square feet—\"the largest indoor space in Portland\" for some time. Although intended as a drill hall, the armory was also used for dances, which Hill believed would provide cadets with a graceful posture.\n\nIn order to promote military training, the federal government loaned weapons to schools which employed a qualified officer as military commandant. Hill appointed Lieutenant Colonel F. E. Patterson in 1887 as instructor in mathematics and military tactics. Consequently, the steamship \"Oregon\" brought Springfield rifles and \"two 3-inch rifled field pieces and carriages\" in 1890 to the Academy \"from the Benicia arsenal, California\". Academy cadets could now learn how to use light artillery.\n\nIn 1891 the Academy became the first school permitted to sit Yale University's entrance examinations without direct supervision of Yale faculty. The uniforms for the intake of 234 students that year were supplied by Thomas Kay Woolen Mills' store in Salem.\n\nGavin organized the first football team in the Northwest at the Academy, which held the first football game in the Northwest in 1889. Gavin had learned to play while studying at Yale. Until that time, rugby union had been the preferred form of football at the school.\n\nLike many institutions across the United States, the school was badly affected by the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1893. Hill recalled that he had 70 pupils by June 1893; but in September only 12 returned when the school re-opened. The principal's own financial state also suffered due to the Panic, his investment in real estate, and the general contraction of the Oregon economy. Hill tried to deflect the impact by assigning the lease of the school to the diocesan secretary, thus placing the Academy out of the reach of his debtors. He also transferred some of his properties to his wife.\n\nDesiring to further formalize the military aspect of the Academy, Hill asked for a serving officer to be assigned. Accordingly, the federal War Department appointed Captain W. A. Kimball in 1895. The United States Army now in effect controlled the Academy's military section. When the Spanish–American War broke out, 30 alumni from the Academy served, fourteen as commissioned officers.\n\nThe school also became the first in the Pacific Northwest to implement the Sloyd system of instruction, with Hill personally contributing financially to the purchasing in 1895 of the required equipment.\n\nAfter 23 years of service, Hill retired in 1901 after a disagreement with the school's board of trustees. Some of the trustees had argued that the diocese should operate the school. They said that the diocese had acted outside its legal limits in granting a lease to Hill. Not wishing to become an employee of the diocese, Hill departed on amiable terms. His first wife, Jessie K. Adams, died in 1901. Hill married Laura E. MacEwan, the widow of the Academy's chaplain, that same year. Originally a Democrat, Hill shifted allegiance to the Republican party in 1896, due to his support for the gold standard. A Freemason, Hill obtained the Knights Templar degree of the York Rite. He started the Hill Military Academy elsewhere in the city, and later became an agent for President William Howard Taft.\n\nArthur C. Newill, who had read classics at Balliol College, Oxford, was appointed as Hill's successor. The Academy's enrollment declined after having reached 234 in 1901, and under financial pressure the Diocese closed the school in 1904.\n\nSubsequently, several unsuccessful attempts were made to revive the Academy in Yamhill County, Oregon. For example, in June 1913 \"The Ontario Argus\" announced that \"the Bishop Scott Grammar School for Boys\" would reopen in September, north of Yamhill.\n\n\nNote: Incomplete list; dates refer to when individuals are mentioned in biennial reports of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Oregon.\n"}

It was designed by William E. Parsons.\n\nThe Manila Elks Lodge #761 is a unique branch club of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks—BPOE, an American fraternal order. It is one of only two Elks Club established outside of current United States territory, the other being in Panama near the former American territory of the Panama Canal Zone,\n\nThe Manila Elks Club was founded after the Spanish–American War ended in 1898 which resulted in the transfer of the Spanish Philippines to the United States control. In 1901, a group of Americans residing in Manila for the \"unbridled entrepreneurial possibilities,\"and \"yearning for camaraderie and solidarity,\" petitioned the national Elks organization to allow the founding of an Elks Club on American soil in the Philippines. . The Grand Exalted Ruler of the Grand Lodge in the United States approved the petition in 1905.\n\nThe first clubhouse, formerly Clubhouse of the Order of the Elks, was established along Calle Victoria in Intramuros, Manila. In 1904, it moved to Calle San Luis opposite the Old Luneta.\n\nFinally in 1910, it built its permanent home at the site that was used to be occupied by the Manila Overseas Press Club and now occupied by the Museo Pambata ng Maynila. Following the proposed Manila Plan of Daniel Burnham, the Elks Club was housed in a three-story building with features similar to the Manila Army and Navy Club co-located on the same piece of property. One building housed a civilian club and the other a military club. The original Manila Elks Club building, designed in the Mission Revival style modeled on the architecture of the California missions, opened in 1910 on the land purchased in the Luneta Park extension, in the Ermita District of Manila.\n\nAfter the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, ending the U.S. territorial Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, this clubhouse housed the United States High Commissioner to the Philippines and his staff from 1935 to 1940.\n\nIn 1942, during the World War II Japanese occupation of the Philippines, Japanese forces marched directly to the Elks Club and the adjacent Army and Navy Club, taking almost 100 residents from both clubs to be imprisoned in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp.\n\nThis first Elks Club building was left in ruins by the war's end. It was later destroyed during the war, after which a two-story edifice was built by the Cojuangco family in February 1949.\n\nIn February 1949, the Elks Lodge #761 opened the newly rebuilt Manila Elks Club building on the site of the first, though on the renamed Dewey Boulevard. The Elks occupied this building until the 1960s. The building along Roxas Boulevard was later acquired by the Philippine government.\n\nIn the 1960s, because of issues of foreign ownership of the property, the Elks Lodge #761 (the Manila Elks Club) moved out of its second clubhouse to new facility in the Flag Village area of Makati, across from where the Rockwell Center is today.\n\nIn 1977, the Elks Lodge #761 moved again, acquiring 1000 square meters of space on the 7th floor of the Corinthian Plaza building in central Makati City, Metro Manila, where they are still located. It still is \"the American Club in the Philippines\".\n\nThe 1949 second Manila Elks Club building and its grounds, on renamed Roxas Boulevard, now houses the Museo Pambata or the children's museum. The museum was founded by Dr. Estefania Aldaba-Lim in 1994, who was a Philippine presidential cabinet member, active in UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund), and founded the Institute of Human Relations at Philippine Women's University.\n\n\n"}

He also ran a darkroom and gallery in Paris, Le Chasseur d'Images, where he printed and exhibited the works of his contemporaries. His best-known imagery features the French circus.\n\nBorn into a well-to-do family on 30 May 1912 in Montbéliard (Doubs), Tuefferd was encouraged in his early interest in photography by his father, Jean-Pierre Tuefferd, doctor and capable amateur photographer and, from 1959 to 1965, mayor of Montbéliard.\n\nTuefferd studied at the Lycee Louis-le-Grand in Paris in 1920. He made his first photographs in 1925 with a vest-pocket Kodak and on his first trip to Tunisia in 1929. Resident there in 1931 he joined the 4th Zouaves Regiment, and equipped with a Leica and a \"Spido\" press camera by L. Gaumont & Cie, he made portraits of soldiers and landscapes of the desert as well as documenting the Tunisian population, hitherto ignored by photographers.\n\nTuefferd began exhibiting in the salons in the 1930s, including the influential XXXI Salon International D'Art Photographique (Societe Francaise de Photographie) in 1936, which was judged by Laure Albin-Guillot.\n\nOn leave, he met George Hoyningen-Huene who lent him his Rolleiflex to take pictures of the shooting of a parody of \"L'Atlantide\" by GW Pabst. Impressed by the quality of the photos, Hoyningen-Huene offered him an internship at \"Vogue\" studios in Paris in the autumn (Condé Nast SA), where he worked in the studio, darkroom and retouching workshop on advertising and product shots. In March 1932, he left the \"Vogue\" studio and entered that of Gaston Grenier. There he set up a specialized facilities for 35 mm processing and very quickly photographers such as Rogi André, Ilse Bing, Robert Capa, Ergy Landau and Man Ray became his clients. He photographed the liner \"SS\" \"Normandie\" in 1936.\n\nIn June 1937, with an inheritance, Tuefferd opened the Le Chasseur d'Images gallery at 46 rue du Bac, the first Paris gallery dedicated to photography in which he showed both known and unknown photographers. Emmanuel Sougez was first to exhibit there in June 1937. German photographer Herbert List pinned his prints directly to the wall as it was customary in the photo galleries of the time. Others followed in solo or group exhibitions: Pierre Adam, Marcel Arthaud, Ilse Bing, Serge Boiron, Bill Brandt, Max Del, Louis Caillaud, Yvonne Chevalier, André Garban, Sandro Guida, Pierre Jahan, Henri Lacheroy, René-Leon Servant.\n\nLe Chasseur d'Images also presented the original illustrations of Arts et Métiers Graphiques \"Photographie\" albums from 1938 to 1939. He organized the first \"Rectangle\" exhibition, of works by the group of 13 exclusively French photographers whose founder was Sougez, and presented the Modernist photography club, Le Noir et Blanc, successor to the Rolleiclub. The gallery could present up to 150 30 × 40 cm prints and photographs were sold for 100 Francs. Shows rarely exceeded two weeks in duration and on opening nights, the gallery provided an invaluable rendezvous for photographers. Mobilization for war in September 1939 brought an end to the enterprise.\n\n\n\n\nIn October 1940, he returned to Paris and devoted himself to documenting, in a humanist mode, the world of the circus that visited Paris every year and in which he found a unique subject, a world of its own redolent of Old Paris, and for years photographed trapeze artists seen from below, spotlit against a dark background and gasping spectators craning their necks, as well as behind-the-scenes vignettes of circus performers applying makeup, practicing, eating and training animals.\n\nHe was stills photographer for Pathé-Cinéma’s \"Port d'attache\" and \"Le Secret de Madame Clapain.\" For the publisher Prisma, he wrote the practical component of a photography correspondence course and articles for \"L'Agenda Prisma.\"\n\nIn 1945, after making documentaries for the tourist commission, Tuefferd went back to Tunisia to shoot documentary films on Ramadan, on the island of Djerba, in Kairouan, and a falcon hunt. Banned in Paris from continuing his professional practice during the Régime de Vichy, he went to New York City to reunite with his artist friends, among them Alexander Calder whom he had met in Tunisia.\n\nIn 1946, he helped co-found the influential Le Groupe des XV with René Servant, Marcel Bovis, Lucien Lorelle, Jean Séeberger, and Emmanuel Sougez.\n\nIn 1949, he returned to France and resumed his work on the circus. He contributed photography to the journals \"L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui,\" \"Le Courrier des métiers d'art,\" \"Métiers de France.\"\n\nIn the early 1950s Tuefferd lived for a time in Hudson, NH and photographed in the USA, and in 1955 was included by Edward Steichen in the seminal world-touring \"The Family of Man\" that commenced at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn the midst of a snowstorm on Mt Cardigan, NH, in 1968 met his wife-to-be Helen (née McDougall, 17 February 1932 – 30 April 2016) who was a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club, participating in White Mountain hikes. Though for a time he relinquished photography to work in electronics in the United States he resumed again in 1992.\n\nHe died on December 17, 1996 and was survived by his wife Helen, and his two sons, Max and Nanook.\n\nThe Musée National des Arts et Traditions posthumously showed his circus imagery in an exhibit in 1999 entitled \"François Tuefferd: \"Le cirque\", photographs 1933-1954.\" A catalogue of his circus work was published by la Réunion des Musées Nationaux.\n\n\n\n"}

The Commission also serves as the only Education USA advising center in Iceland, providing impartial advice on U.S. education opportunities.\n\nThe Icelandic Fulbright Commission was founded in 1957, when a bi-national agreement between Iceland and the United States was signed on February 23, 1957. Grants are awarded to students of Icelandic and American descent for graduate and post-graduate studies, while scholar grants are awarded to Icelandic scholars to undertake research in the United States and for American scholars to teach and do research in Iceland. The Commission offers approximately 6-10 student grants annually to Icelandic citizens and another 1-2 grants for Icelandic scholars who plan to conduct research in the US. Approximately 5-6 grants are offered to US students and another 3 on average to US scholars each year.\n\nIn addition, the Icelandic Fulbright Commission administers two other grants offered to Icelandic citizens. The Frank Boas scholarship for L.L.M Law study at Harvard University, is competed for annually by 9 European countries, of which Iceland is one. The Cobb Family Fellowship is funded by a former US Ambassador to Iceland Charles E. Cobb. and his wife Sue M.Cobb.

The agreement sets up a three year pilot project whereby the Ministry funds the Fulbright-MFA Arctic Scholar Grant. This grant brings one US scholar to Iceland per academic year for one semester to teach, as well as conduct research. The grant is open to scholars in a wide variety of Arctic fields.\n\nIn January 2015, the Commission signed an agreement with the US National Science Foundation (NSF) for a three-year pilot project to bring U.S. scholars and fellows to Iceland to conduct research in a wide variety of fields in the social and natural sciences, as they relate to the Arctic. NSF provides funding for Fulbright-NSF Arctic Research Grants and the Commission administers the grants program and provides infrastructure, services, and support to grantees. This is the first such partnership between the NSF and Fulbright. In addition to the Fulbright-NSF grants, we are participating in the Fulbright Arctic Initiative (FAI). The FAI brings together Fulbright scholars from all Arctic Council states to collaborate across disciplines on pressing issues facing the Arctic.\n\nThe Commission is funded by the U.S. and Icelandic governments. The Icelandic Minister of Education and the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland are the Honorary Chairmen of the Board. The Ministry of Education and the U.S. Embassy appoint the Commission's Board of Directors, four Icelanders and four Americans, in addition to one alternate each.

Set up during the beginning of his reign, King Sejong staffed the Hall of Worthies with talented scholars and instructed them to conduct a variety of research activities to strengthen his rule and the nation. The Hall of Worthies is best known for the role it played in the development of the Hangul script, the official alphabet in the Korean language.\n\nThe Hall of Worthies originally served an advisory role to the king, and King Sejong restructured and expanded its role into an academic research institute. During the early part of King Sejong's reign, the Hall of Worthies served as a legislative system, but its role eventually grew to hold discussions regarding Joseon's national policy. The Hall of Worthies would also later act as an organ of press.\n\nThe Hall participated in various scholarly endeavors, of which the best-known may be the compilation of the \"Hunminjeongeum\", in which the hangul writing system was first formulated. In the Hunminjeongeum, King Sejong wrote a preface which explained the origin and purpose of the newly created alphabet, Hangul. He then instructed his scholars of the Jiphyeonjeon (Hall of Worthies) to write detailed explanations of each of its letters along with examples of each of them. The purpose of the Hunminjeongeum was to provide instructions on how to use the new alphabet. The definitive edition of the Hunminjeongeum is known as the Haerye Edition of Hunminjeongeum (Haerye refers to the explanations and examples of the Hall of Worthies scholars, which were previously missing in other known editions)\n\nThe head of the Hall of Worthies, Jeong In-ji, compiled the Hunminjeongeum, and his treatise explaining the creation of the script, he wrote that the work was widely introduced to the public on the tenth day of the ninth lunar month of 1446, which was October 9, 1446, on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nConfucianism ideals were very important to King Sejong, and he wanted his subjects to have a medium through which they could learn the ethics and morals of Confucianism. During his 14th year in power, King Sejong instructed his scholars at the Hall of Worthies to compile outstanding examples of the fundamental principles in human relationships (filial piety, loyalty to the state, and wifely devotion) from both Korean and Chinese history. This compilation of works would become the book \"Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles in Human Relationships\" (Samgang Haengshildo, Hanja: 三綱行實圖, Hangul: 삼강행실도). Unfortunately, this work was originally recorded in Chinese characters, and thus, the general public could not read it until it was translated into hangul some 30 years later.\n\nBesides the invention of Hangul and published works such as Samgang Haengshildo, the Hall of Worthies was involved in publication of numerous scholarly and scientific writings, which contributed to reputation of Sejong's reign as the golden age of Korean culture.\n\nThe Hall of Worthies was disbanded by King Sejo () after many of its members (notably the six martyred ministers) plotted to assassinate Sejo in 1456, following the latter's usurpation of the throne from King Danjong. However, a similar organization, the Hongmungwan (), Office of Special Advisors, continued much of the same work, though without enjoying the same prestige or output it had during the earlier period.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38786354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38786354", "title": "Introduction to cooperative learning", "text": "Introduction to cooperative learning\n\nCooperative learning is the instructional use of small groups so that students work together to maximize their own and each other's learning.\n\nCooperative learning may be contrasted with competitive and individualistic learning. The key difference between these teaching approaches is the way students' learning goals are structured. The goal structure specifies the ways in which students will interact with each other and the teacher during the instructional session. Within cooperative situations, individuals seek outcomes that are beneficial to themselves and beneficial to all other group members. In competitive learning students work against each other to achieve an academic goal such as a grade of \"A\" that only one or a few students can attain. Finally, in individualistic learning students work by themselves to accomplish learning goals unrelated to those of the other students.\nIn cooperative and individualistic learning, student efforts are evaluated on a criteria-referenced basis while in competitive learning teachers grade in a norm-referenced basis.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, cooperative learning was relatively unknown and largely ignored by educators. Elementary, secondary, and university teaching was dominated by competitive and individualistic learning. Cultural resistance to cooperative learning was based on social Darwinism, with its premise that students must be taught to survive in a \"dog-eat-dog\" world, and the myth of \"rugged individualism\" underlying the use of individualistic learning. While competition dominated educational thought, it was being challenged by individualistic learning largely based on B. F. Skinner's work on programmed learning and behavioral modification. Educational practices and thought, however, have changed. Cooperative learning is now an accepted and highly recommended instructional procedure at all levels of education.\n\nMost of the original theories of cooperative learning have their roots on social interdependence and Lewinian field theory. Theorizing on social interdependence began in the early 1900s, when one of the founders of the Gestalt School of Psychology, Kurt Koffka, proposed that groups were dynamic wholes in which the interdependence among members could vary. One of his colleagues, Kurt Lewin refined Koffka's notions in the 1920s and 1930s while stating that (a) the essence of a group is the interdependence among members (created by common goals) which results in the group being a \"dynamic whole\" so that a change in the state of any member or subgroup changes the state of any other member or subgroup, and (b) an intrinsic state of tension within group members motivates movement toward the accomplishment of the desired common goals. For interdependence to exist, there must be more than one person or entity involved, and the persons or entities must have impact on each other in that a change in the state of one causes a change in the state of the others. From the work of Lewin's students and colleagues, such as Ovisankian, Lissner, Mahler, and Lewis, it may be concluded that it is the drive for goal accomplishment that motivates cooperative and competitive behavior.\nIn the late 1940s, one of Lewin's graduate students, Morton Deutsch, extended Lewin's reasoning about social interdependence and formulated a theory of cooperation and competition. Deutsch conceptualized three types of social interdependence–positive, negative, and none. Deutsch's basic premise was that the type of interdependence structured in a situation determines how individuals interact with each other which, in turn, largely determines outcomes. Positive interdependence tends to result in promotive interaction, negative interdependence tends to result in oppositional or contrient interaction, and no interdependence results in an absence of interaction.\n\nAccording to Johnson and Johnson, there are three types of cooperative learning: formal, informal and cooperative base groups.\n\nFormal cooperative learning consists of students working together, for one class period to several weeks, to achieve shared learning goals and complete jointly specific tasks and assignments. Johnson, Johnson & Holubec describe the teachers' role in formal cooperative learning groups. It includes (a) making preinstructional decisions about tasks, objectives, group size and composition, roles, materials and room assignment (b) explaining the task and cooperative structure to the students (c) monitoring students' learning and intervening to provide assistance in completing the task or using group skills effectively and (d) assessing students' learning and helping students process how well their groups functioned.\n\nInformal cooperative learning consists of having students work together to achieve a joint learning goal in temporary groups that last from a few minutes to one class period. The students take part in focused discussions before and after the lesson and interspersing pair discussions throughout the lesson. \nInformal cooperative learning ensures students are actively involved in understanding what is being presented. It is also useful to set a mood conducive to learning, help set expectations, provide closure to an instructional session and precue the next session. Moreover, during the informal cooperative learning techniques, teachers have time to move around the class listening to what students are saying. This can give instructors insight into how well students understand the material, as well as being behavior that increases the individual accountability of each student participating in the discussions.\n\nTwo important aspects of using informal cooperative learning groups are to (a) make the task and the instructions explicit and precise and (b) require the groups to produce a specific product (such as a written answer). \nAccording to Johnson, Johnson and Holubec the informal cooperative learning procedure is organized in the following way:\n\nCooperative base groups are long-term, heterogeneous cooperative learning groups with stable membership. Typically, cooperative base groups are heterogeneous in membership (especially in terms of achievement motivation and task orientation), meet regularly (for example, daily or biweekly), and last for the duration of the class (a semester or year), or, preferably, for several years.\n\nThe agenda of the base group can include academic support tasks (such as editing each other's essays), personal support tasks (such as getting to know each other and helping each other solve nonacademic problems), routine tasks (such as taking attendance), and assessment tasks (such as checking each other's understanding of the answers to test questions when the test is first taken individually and then retaken in the base group).\n\nMembers' primary responsibilities are to (a) ensure all members are making good academic progress (i.e., positive goal interdependence) (b) hold each other accountable for striving to learn (i.e., individual accountability), and (c) provide each other with support, encouragement, and assistance in completing assignments (i.e., promotive interaction).\n\nPermanent cooperative base groups provide the arena in which caring and committed partnerships can be created that provide the social support needed to improve attendance, personalize the educational experience, increase achievement, and improve the quality of school life.\n\nThese three types of cooperative learning may be used together. A typical class session may begin with a base group meeting, which is followed by a short lecture in which informal cooperative learning is used. The lecture may then be followed by a formal cooperative learning lesson. Near the end of the class session, another short lecture may be delivered with the use of informal cooperative learning. The class may end with a base group meeting.\nUsing the group meetings can help the students evaluate what they learned and help them with class building. Using small groups for class building will make the class stronger as a whole and give the classes a stronger understanding of the topics.\n\nNot all groups are cooperative. Johnson and Johnson describe the five elements that need to be present for a group to be cooperative:\n\n\nThe study of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts is commonly recognized as one of the oldest fields of research in social psychology. In the late 1800s, Triplett in the United States, Turner in England, and Mayer in Germany conducted a series of studies on the factors associated with competitive performance. Since then over 750 studies have been conducted on the relative merits of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts. The research has focused on numerous outcomes, which may be subsumed within the broad and interrelated categories of effort to achieve quality of relationships and psychological health.\n\nEffort to achieve: Cooperation promotes considerably greater effort to achieve than does competitive or individualistic efforts. In this meta-analysis by David Johnson and Roger Johnson, effort to achieve includes such variables as achievement (effect-sizes = 0.67 and 0.64 compared to competitive and individualistic efforts), long-term retention, time on-task (effect-sizes = 0.76,and 1.17), use of higher-level reasoning strategies (effect-sizes =0.93 and 0.97), generation of new ideas and solutions, transfer of what is learned within one situation to another, intrinsic motivation, achievement motivation, continuing motivation to learn, and positive attitudes toward learning and school.\n\nQuality of relationships: cooperation generally promotes greater interpersonal attraction among individuals (effect sizes = 0.67 and 0.60 compared to competitive and individualistic efforts respectively) and greater social support (effect-sizes = 0.62 and 0.70).\n\nPsychological health: Johnson and Johnson define psychological health as the ability (cognitive capacities, motivational orientations, and social skills) to build, maintain, and appropriately modify interdependent relationships with others to succeed in achieving goals. People who are unable to do so often (a) become depressed, anxious, frustrated, and lonely, (b) tend to feel afraid, inadequate, helpless, hopeless, and isolated, and (c) rigidly cling to unproductive and ineffective ways of coping with adversity.\nSeveral scientific studies have shown a strong relationship between cooperativeness and psychological health, a mixed picture was found with competitiveness and psychological health, and a strong relationship was found between an individualistic orientation and psychological pathology.\n\nFinally, there is evidence that cooperation promotes more frequent use of higher level reasoning strategies than do competitive (effect size = 0.93) or individualistic (effect size = 0.97) efforts. Similarly, cooperation tends to promote more accurate perspective taking than do competitive (effect size = 0.61) or individualistic (effect size = 0.44) efforts. Thus, the more cooperative learning experiences students are involved in, the more mature their cognitive and moral decision making and the more they will tend to take other people's perspectives in account when making decisions.\n\n"}

It is usually accompanied by a sequence of gestures that mimic the words of the song. Its Roud Folk Song Index number is 11586.\n\nA commonly used version uses these words and gestures:\nOther versions exist.\n\nThe song can be found in publications including an alternative version in the book, \"Camp and Camino in Lower California\" (1910), where it was referred to as [the classic] \"Spider Song\". It appears to be a different version of this song using “blooming, bloody” instead of \"itsy bitsy\". It was later published in one of its several modern versions in \"Western Folklore\", by the California Folklore Society (1948), Mike and Peggy Seeger's, \"American Folk Songs for Children\" (1948). In 2013 Maziar Bahari's company Off-Centre Productions created an animated version of the song featuring an animated mouse character called \"Journo\".\n\nLyrics as described in 1910, as being from the 'classic' \"Spider Song\":\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Oh, the blooming, bloody spider went up the spider web,\nThe blooming, bloody rain came down and washed the spider out,\nThe blooming, bloody sun came out and dried up all the rain,\nAnd the blooming, bloody spider came up the web again.</poem>\n\nThe song is sung by and for children in countless languages and cultures. In Germany the melody is used for the song \"\".\n\nThe popular nursery rhyme has been covered and sampled a number of times. Bart Simpson sang the rhyme in the tenth episode of season four of \"The Simpsons\", \"Lisa's First Word\". It was featured in the children's program \"Dora the Explorer\" and in the \"South Park\" episode \"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\". A child singing the rhyme twice can be heard in the opening of the \"Criminal Minds\" episode, \"Gatekeeper\". It is one of the main musical themes in the 2006 horror movie \"Séance\".\n\n\n"}

Aniston's godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father's best friends.\n\nAs a child, Aniston moved to New York City. Despite her father's television career, Aniston was discouraged from watching TV, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school. Her mother and father split up when she was nine years old. Her father is best known for his role as Victor Kiriakis on the NBC daytime drama \"Days of Our Lives\", which he originated in 1985. Her mother appeared in two 1960s TV series, \"The Wild Wild West\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\".\n\nHaving discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school, Aniston enrolled in and graduated from Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society. Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher. She was in \"The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window\" by Lorraine Hansberry and \"Three Sisters\" by Anton Chekhov.\n\nAniston worked in Off-Broadway productions such as \"For Dear Life\" and \"Dancing on Checker's Grave\", and supported herself with several part-time jobs, which included working as a telemarketer, waitress, and bike messenger. In 1988, Aniston had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film \"Mac and Me\". In 1989, she appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\", as a spokesmodel for \"Nutrisystem\", and moved back to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1990, Aniston obtained her first television role, as a regular, on the series \"Molloy\", and appeared in \"Ferris Bueller\", a television adaptation of the 1986 film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\"; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film \"Camp Cucamonga\" (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film \"Leprechaun\" (1993). A 2014 retrospective from \"Entertainment Weekly\" identified \"Leprechaun\" as Aniston's worst role to date, and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.\n\nAniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series, \"The Edge\" and \"Muddling Through\", and guest-starred in \"Quantum Leap\", \"Herman's Head\", and \"Burke's Law\".\n\nDepressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance about her career. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged Aniston to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for \"Friends\", a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producers of the show originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller, but Courteney Cox was considered to be better suited to the role. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on \"Saturday Night Live\", but turned it down to do \"Friends\". She played the character of Rachel from 1994 until the show ended in 2004.\n\nThe program was successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers. Her character was widely popular during the airing of the series and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television. The actress received a salary of 1 million per episode for the last two seasons of \"Friends\", as well as five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

Aniston's first starring vehicle was the film \"Picture Perfect\" (1997), in which she starred as a struggling young advertising executive, opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success, and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence. In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy \"The Object of My Affection\", and in 1999, she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film \"Office Space\" for director Mike Judge.\n\nAniston starred in the independent dramedy \"The Good Girl\" (2002), as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over US$14 million in North America. Film critic Roger Ebert declared the role as her breakthrough film, stating that, \"after languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining \"Office Space\" to the disposable \"Picture Perfect\", Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her \"Friends\" image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.\"\n\nAniston's biggest commercial success to date is the comedy \"Bruce Almighty\" (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God himself for one week. With a worldwide box office gross of US$484 million, the film was the fifth highest-grossing big screen production of the year. Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly-wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy \"Along Came Polly\" (2004), opposite Ben Stiller, which placed number one at the North American box office, earning US$27.7 million in its opening weekend; it eventually made US$172 million globally.\n\nIn 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller \"Derailed\", and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy \"Rumor Has It...\"; Both films were moderate box office hits.

The film received mixed reviews but grossed approximately 39.17 million during its opening weekend and 204 million worldwide. \"The A.V. Club\"s Keith Phipps gave the film a negative review stating, \"It's like watching the 'we were on a break' episode of \"Friends\" stretched to feature length, and without the blessed relief of commercial breaks or the promise of \"Seinfeld\" around the corner.\" \"CinemaBlend\" gave the film a positive review stating, \"In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, \" The Break-Up\" offers a refreshing flipside.\"\n\nIn 2006, Aniston directed a hospital emergency room-set short film called \"Room 10\", starring Robin Wright and Kris Kristofferson as part of \"Glamour\"s Reel Moments film series. She noted that she was inspired to direct by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also directed a short film in 2006.\nIn 2007, Aniston guest-starred in an episode of \"Dirt\", playing the rival of Courteney Cox's character, and in the third episode of season three of \"30 Rock\", playing a woman who stalks Jack Donaghy.

The movie grossed US$178.8 million globally and ranked at number one at the United States box office for its opening weekend. While the film received mixed reviews, Aniston, along with Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly, were often praised by critics as being the stand-outs in the film.\n\nAniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter in the romantic comedy action film \"The Bounty Hunter\" (2010), which also starred Gerard Butler. The film was panned by critics, with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" describing it as a \"mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.\" Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over 130 million worldwide. A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy \"The Switch\" (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film's opening weekend drew what \"The Hollywood Reporter\" dubbed \"a dispiriting 8.4 million.\" The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.\n\nIn 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season 2 premiere of ABC's sitcom \"Cougar Town\", playing a psychiatrist. Her announcement to appear on \"Cougar Town\" garnered excitement and was dubbed as her return to television. \"The A.V. Club\" wrote, \"Aniston plays Jules' therapist, and the part is more or less a twist on the old, 'The psychiatrist is crazier than the patient!' gimmick, though the show has a lot of fun with the idea that the therapist is obviously batshit [...] It's a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.\" Numerous media outlets also praised her performance.\n\nIn 2011, she starred with Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy \"Just Go with It\", which was released on Valentine's Day weekend, and played a sexually aggressive dentist who harasses his employee in the comedy \"Horrible Bosses\", opposite Colin Farrell, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jamie Foxx, directed by Seth Gordon. \"Just Go with It\" and \"Horrible Bosses\" both made over US$100 million in North America and US$200 million worldwide.\n\nAniston appeared in the comedy \"Wanderlust\" (2012) with Paul Rudd, with whom she acted in \"The Object of My Affection\" and also \"Friends\", as a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them. The script for \"Wanderlust\", bought by Universal Pictures, was produced by Judd Apatow. \"Wanderlust\" received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only US$21 million worldwide, against a production budget of US$35 million. Aniston starred as a struggling stripper who agrees to pose as a wife for a drug deal, with Jason Sudeikis, in EUE/Screen Gems Productions' \"We're the Millers\" (2013), filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina and in the state of New Mexico.

The film was released in limited theaters, to positive reviews. Catherine Shoard of \"The Guardian\" described her performance as \"endearingly comic\" and Eric Kohn of \"Indie Wire\" wrote that her role in the film outshone every recent film performance by her stating, \"Aniston tops any of her recent performances with a spirited turn that harkens back to her neurotic days on \"Friends\".\" She also reprised her role in the sequel \"Horrible Bosses 2\" (2014).\n\nAniston starred in the film \"Cake\" (2014), directed by Daniel Barnz, portraying an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain. The film received mixed reviews; however, Aniston's performance was highly praised, dubbed by some critics as \"Oscar-worthy.\" The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance \"heartbreakingly good\", Gregory Ellwood of \"HitFix\" stated, \"It's really on most people's radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn't disappoint.\" He further stated, \"Aniston makes you believe in Claire's pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. [...] It's a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.\" For her portrayal, Aniston was nominated for the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG) for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nIn 2015, Aniston starred as a reluctant therapist in the screwball comedy \"She's Funny That Way\", directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The film, which was produced by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach and also starred Owen Wilson, Imogen Poots, Kathryn Hahn, Rhys Ifans, and Will Forte, received mixed reviews and found a limited release in theaters, but Aniston's performance was once again noticed. Wesley Morris of \"The Grantland\" called her \"one of the great screen comedians. [...] Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. [...] This isn't just Aniston having the best stuff. It's her having the most fun with her talent. She's funny in every way.\" She's \"one of the film's few bright spots\" for Lou Lumenick from \"The New York Post\".\n\nAniston starred as a recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy \"Mother's Day\" (2016), directed by Garry Marshall and opposite Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Timothy Olyphant, and Jason Sudeikis.

While she does not \"normally gravitate toward being in war films\", she made an exception with \"The Yellow Birds\" as it was \"written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced\". The film, first presented during the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018. \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in its review: \"Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances\".\n\nAniston and Reese Witherspoon are developing a morning show drama \"The Morning Show\" for Apple, her first project for a streaming service, .

On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation and finalized their divorce on October 2, 2005. During their divorce proceedings, there was intense speculation in the media that Pitt had been unfaithful to Aniston with his \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" co-star Angelina Jolie, whom he started dating soon after the split. In the following months, the public's reaction toward the divorce was reported in the press, and \"Team Aniston\" and \"Team Jolie\" T-shirts appeared throughout the country. The divorce made the front-pages of tabloid magazines for years, and it still continues to be discussed in the media. Aniston commented on the divorce in a January 2015 interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", stating that \"Nobody did anything wrong... It was just like, sometimes things [happen].\"\n\nIn 2005, amid reports that Pitt and Aniston's divorce was due to Aniston's refusal to have children with Pitt, Aniston stated to \"Vanity Fair\", \"I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children. I did and I do and I will... I would never give up that experience for a career.\" Aniston also revealed that her divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, Nancy, from whom she was estranged for nearly a decade. They initially became estranged when Nancy talked about her daughter on a television show and later wrote a book entitled, \"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir\" (1999). Aniston has also stated she was devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whose work helped make her separation from Pitt easier. Aniston said her relationship with Pitt, which she does not regret, was \"seven very intense years together\" and that \"it was a beautiful, complicated relationship\".\n\nAniston started a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter Justin Theroux in May 2011. In January 2012, Aniston and Theroux purchased a home in Los Angeles's Bel-Air neighborhood for roughly 22 million. They became engaged on August 10, 2012 and were married on August 5, 2015 at their Bel-Air estate. On February 15, 2018, Aniston and Theroux announced in a statement to the Associated Press their decision to separate at the end of 2017.\n\nAniston is a Democrat, donating to Barack Obama's presidential campaign and taking part in a fund-raising lunch for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 Presidential campaign.\n\nAniston practices yoga and Budokan karate. In 2014, Aniston spoke of her Transcendental Meditation practice.\n\nAniston said she had undiagnosed dyslexia, which had affected her education and self-esteem, and that after being diagnosed in her 20s, her outlook toward life changed. She stated, \"I thought I wasn't smart. I just couldn't retain anything. Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained.\"\n\nAniston is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. In 2007, \"Forbes\" rated her as one of the top 20 richest women in entertainment and estimated her net worth to be about 110 million. Aniston was also included in the annual Star Salary Top 10 of trade magazine \"The Hollywood Reporter\" for 2006. According to \"Forbes\", in October 2007, Aniston was the top-selling celebrity face of the entertainment industry. She was also Hollywood's most profitable actress. Aniston has been on the \"Forbes\" Celebrity 100 list, based on \"earnings and fame\", every year since 2001, topping the list in 2003. For the year of 2008, \"Forbes\" listed Aniston's earnings as 27 million.\nIn 2014, Aniston ranked 3rd on \"Forbes\" Top Earning Actresses, earning US$31 million in that year. Her net worth is estimated to be 150 million . In 2015, Aniston ranked 5th on \"Forbes\" Top Earning Actresses, earning US$16.5 million in that year.

In May 2017, \"Forbes\" estimated Aniston's net worth to be US$200 million. The following August, the magazine ranked her as the world's second highest-paid actress with yearly earnings of $25.5 million.\n\nAniston has been included in magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women. In 2005, she became the first-ever \"GQ\" Woman of the Year. She has frequently appeared on \"People\"s annual list of \"Most Beautiful Women\", and was number-one in 2004 and recently in 2016. She also topped the magazine's Best Dressed List in 2006. She has been a regular on \"FHM\"s 100 Sexiest Women list since 1996, ranking at number 79 in 2012, number 81 in 2010, number 24 in 2009, and number 27 in 2008. In 2011, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported the most sought after body parts of the rich and famous revealed by two Hollywood plastic surgeons who carried out a survey among their patients to build up the picture of what the perfect woman would look like. Under the category of the most sought after body shape, Aniston was voted in the top three, alongside Gisele Bündchen and Penélope Cruz. In the same year, readers of \"Men's Health\" magazine voted Aniston the \"Sexiest Woman of All Time\". Although Aniston disliked the hairstyle she wore during her first two years on \"Friends\", \"The Rachel\" became very popular among women.\n\nAniston received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 22, 2012. The star is located at 6270 Hollywood Boulevard. Her star is the 2,462nd placed on the Walk of Fame. On \"Forbes\" list of the 100 Most Powerful Actresses in Hollywood, she was ranked eighth in 2009, second in both 2011 and 2012, and third in 2013.\n\nIn July 2016, Jennifer Aniston wrote an essay for \"The Huffington Post\", in reply to recent rumors about her, where she criticized \"The objectification and scrutiny we put women through...\" and stated that \"We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies...We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \"happily ever after\" for ourselves.\" The essay was supported by many celebrities and thoroughly discussed in the media.\n\nAniston has been mentioned in film and TV, including \"Scream 2\", \"Arrested Development\", \"Monk\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Fresh Off the Boat\" and \"Master of None\". She has been called a role model by Kaley Cuoco, Selena Gomez, and Miley Cyrus.\n\nAniston came to prominence in 1994 with her role of Rachel Green in the widely popular television sitcom \"Friends\".

The current minister is Jean-Michel Blanquer.\n\nA governmental position overseeing public education was first created in France in 1802. Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of Minister of Public Instruction was created in 1828. For much of its history, the position was combined with that of Minister of Public Worship, who dealt with issues related to the Roman Catholic Church, except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a Protestant. The position has also occasionally been combined with Minister of Sports and Minister of Youth Affairs. In 1932, the office's title was changed to Minister of National Education, although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed Minister of Education during the Presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (1974–1981).

{"id": "13189181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13189181", "title": "National Association of Student Personnel Administrators", "text": "National Association of Student Personnel Administrators\n\nThe National Association of Student Personnel Administrators is a U.S.-based student affairs organization boasting more than 13,000 members at 1,400 campuses, and 25 countries. Founded in 1919 at the University of Wisconsin, NASPA is one of many organizations focused on graduate enrollment management.\n\nIn December 1918, Robert Rienow, the dean of men at the University of Iowa desired to create a meeting that would bring together various deans of men in the midwest. He, with Thomas Arkle Clark, dean of men at the University of Illinois, facilitated the founding meeting held at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in January 1919. The first meeting was quite small - three deans of men and three professors having campus interests were in attendance.\n\nProfessor Louis A. Strauss of the University of Michigan referred to the first meeting as the \"Conference of Deans and Advisers of Men.\" This label was used in prevalence until 1929 when it was changed to the National Association of Deans and Advisers of Men (NADAM). The new name was more fitting because many American universities did not have the \"Dean of Men\" title. Thomas Arkle Clark was the first person to claim the title in 1909, although he assumed the responsibilities in 1901. Scott Goodnight, dean of men at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, served as host for this historic first meeting. Retroactively, he is referred to as the first president of NADAM.\n\nIn 1925, the first piece of \"research\" - presented by John Bennett of Teachers College, Columbia University - was offered at a NADAM meeting. It dealt with the prevalence of the office of dean of men in American colleges and universities. The last meeting of the '20s was the first to be conducted away from the college campus; there were 76 participants, each paying dues of $10.\n\nIn the 1930s, there were continued requests for publications to be submitted to the conferences. The \"NASPA Journal\", as a result, was first introduced in 1963. Before that time, newsletters were the primary way of communicating regarding published material.\n\nOne of the Association's major preoccupations in the 1940s was World War II and its aftermath. The adaptation of campuses to the war effort are reflected in the conference minutes, and the problems relating to veterans once the war was over took the rest of the decade. The decade was noted by the presence of Armour Blackburn of Howard University, the first African-American administrator to participate and serve on an executive committee.\n\nAs student affairs offices began to change and administrators no longer used \"Dean of Men\" and \"Advisor of Men\" as their titles, the organization followed suit. Mary Ethel Ball, acting dean of students at the University of Colorado, became the first female \"institutional representative,\" although women had participated in meetings since the 20s. Dean Wesley P. Lloyd at Brigham Young University recommended a name change in 1951 to the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA). This gave a new breadth to the organization, which stated its purpose: \"to discuss and study the most effective methods of aiding students in their intellectual, social, moral, and personal development\".\n\nFive commissions were established at the 1951 conference to deal with substantive, ongoing issues (e.g., professional relationships, ethics, professional preparation). A secondary benefit of the commissions was in making more members able to participate in the association's activities.\n\nThe 1960s marked many changes in NASPA. For the first time, outside funding was secured for a NASPA activity, making the association an early leader in educating members concerning drug abuse. NASPA was an active participant in the development of the Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of Students. From 1966 until the end of the decade and beyond, crisis was the most prominent campus issue and the most prominent association concern. Some deans were enormously successful in protecting both their campuses and the rights of students, but disruption of campuses became more prevalent.\n\nDuring the 1970s, increased regionalization heightened opportunities for involvement across the whole spectrum of NASPA's membership. Alice Manicur of Frostbug State College became the first female president, and community colleges began to make their presence felt. George Young at Broward Community College was the first community college person to serve as president of NASPA.\n\nIt was during this decade that NASPA first established a national office under the leadereship of Channing Briggs at Portland State University. Upon Briggs' retirement in 1981, Richard F. Stevens became the second executive director, and the national office was moved to Ohio State University. In 1985, the association voted to move its headquarters to Washington, D.C., and in 1987 Elizabeth M. Nuss of Indiana University, succeeded Stevens. In 1995, Gwendolyn Dungy succeeded Nuss. In 2000 the National Association for Women in Education was merged into NASPA.\n\nLaurence Smith, Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at Eastern Michigan University, initiated the concept of the Centers for Innovation in February 2000, proposing centers for leadership, public policy, research, and technology to guide professional development for the association. \n"}
{"id": "25150988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25150988", "title": "National Civics Bureau", "text": "National Civics Bureau\n\nThe National Civics Bureau (), abbreviated BTN, was an agency of the Malaysian previous ruling government under Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in the Prime Minister's Department. It was established in 1974 as the Youth Research Unit (Unit Penyelidikan Belia) under the Youth Ministry, but was renamed and transferred in 1981. BTN's stated objective is to nurture the spirit of patriotism and commitment to excellence among Malaysians, and train leaders and future leaders to support the nation's development efforts. BTN's programmes are controversial, and many accuse them of explicitly promoting \"ketuanan Melayu\" and the former governing coalition Barisan Nasional (BN). On 25 November 2009, the Selangor state government issued a ban prohibiting state civil servants, employees of state subsidiaries, and students at state-owned institutions from attending BTN courses. On 2 December 2009, the Penang state government followed suit and banned all state civil servants from attending the controversial courses. \n\nOn 13 August 2018, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman from the new federal government under Pakatan Harapan (PH) announced that the BTN and National Service Training Programme (PLKN) were abolished.\n\nAlthough BTN has been the subject of various allegations over the years, in late 2009, it became the subject of greater controversy, when many allegations of racism and political propaganda appeared in quick succession. One BTN alumnus claimed that he was \"taught a song with lyrics like 'the land that you walk upon is owned by others'. Lecturers told us the Malays were forced to depend on the Chinese for support after 1998 because some Malays had betrayed their own race,\" in reference to Malays voting against the Barisan Nasional in 1999 general election. Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, another alumnus and assemblyman for Seri Setia in the State Legislative Assembly of Selangor, claimed that the BTN camp he attended was \"racial and political in nature,\" with trainers telling attendees that Malays require affirmative action and criticising the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) as \"deviationist\". Amirudin Shari, assemblyman for Batu Caves, claimed that \"participants are indoctrinated with propaganda about 'Ketuanan Melayu' and external threats\". Another alumnus claims he was taught that the Chinese were \"the Jews of Asia,\" and part of a conspiracy to topple the government. Another alumnus alleged she was \"told that the Malays were the most supreme race in the world, we were God's chosen few, that the others were insignificant. We were warned about certain elements in our society and abroad, determined to undermine Malay excellence.\"\n\nOn 21 November 2009, Nik Nazmi, Amirudin and five other Pakatan Rakyat state assemblymen asked the Selangor government to stop requiring students at its universities and colleges to attend BTN courses. After the Selangor government issued a ban prohibiting state employees and students at state institutions from attending BTN programmes, the State Executive Councillor for Education, Dr. Halimah Ali, described the courses as \"indoctrination by the Barisan Nasional government\" and said, \"the courses promote racism and my own children who have attended BTN have been given booklets that encourage hate towards the opposition.\"\n\nIn September 2010, BTN deputy director Hamim Husin was reported for referring Chinese as \"Si mata pepet\" (the slant-eyed) and Indians as \"Si botol\" (the drinkers) during a closed-door function of Puteri UMNO (Women youth wing of United Malays National Organisation) delegates. In November 2010, Minister in Prime Minister's department Nazri Aziz reported that the deputy director has been suspended from duty since October 2010 and a warning letter has been issued. However, the duration of suspension was not disclosed.\n\n\"The Malaysian Insider\" reported in November 2009 that in response to brewing controversy, the Cabinet had discussed the need to revamp BTN. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Idris Jala arranged a briefing for the Cabinet on the effects of BTN programmes, and the meeting concluded with the Prime Minister reportedly saying, \"This must end.\" In an editorial, the publication said: \"\"The Malaysian Insider\" understands that there are moves within the administration to dilute the syllabus of BTN courses, as a compromise. But such half-measures are not likely to be enough if Najib is serious about reversing what many Malaysians see as institutionalised racism.\"\n\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin defended BTN, saying its programmes inculcate nationalism and unity among Malaysians in line with the Prime Minister's 1Malaysia concept. Subsequently, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Ahmad Maslan said \"knowledge and information ... presented at these courses are based on historical facts and data ... collected from various agencies and ... experts\" and are consistent with 1Malaysia. Ahmad, who is also head of the BTN, denied allegations that it was systemically racist: \"Out of the 1,000 lectures given, maybe only one minute the lecturer had a slip-up so it is unfair that you portray BTN as racist just for that.\" Describing typical course contents, he said participants \"are taught about the Federal Constitution, the social contract, the position of the Malays in this country and 60 per cent of the population are the bumiputras.\" Although Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz previously told the press that the Cabinet had ordered a revamp of BTN courses to eliminate elements inconsistent with 1Malaysia, Ahmad denied this, saying that Cabinet merely wanted an \"upgrade\" as opposed to a \"revamp\". Responding, Nazri insisted that \"Whatever word you use, upgrade or revamp ... to me, it is a change of module. Datuk Ahmad Masalan is a member of the Cabinet, he can’t dispute my statement.\" Nazri also criticised the denial of allegations against BTN, saying that opposition members who had previously been in government like Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim \"know, so what is there to deny?\" and said that BTN had been used to promote certain political leaders.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad defended BTN as meant to inculcate the values of discipline and hard work in public servants and scholars: \"What we tried to teach them is that they should have new values, new culture...because the culture and the value-system they have is not conducive to success. If they want to serve the government well, they must accept and practice a certain value system.\" The ruling party-owned \"Utusan Malaysia\" newspaper criticised the decision to change the BTN curriculum, claiming Nazri was acting on his own and urging the government not to \"bow down\" to the opposition. In response, Nazri branded Mahathir's statement \"bloody racist,\" criticising both him and \"Utusan Malaysia\" for denying the allegations against BTN:\n\nNazri denied that criticism from Pakatan Rakyat or the Selangor government decision were reasons for the Cabinet decision, saying: \"...courses run by BTN using public funds must be used properly and it amounts to millions so if you want to talk about patriotism, patriotism for all, not just the Malays, for all Malaysians. It's not because of the Selangor state government that we changed the syllabus so it's long before that.\" In response, Mahathir accused Nazri of hypocrisy, saying \"I must be a racist if Nazri says I am racist. Don't ever say that I am not. He knows everything. He belongs to a party which is racist... which is Umno. ... Umno is a party \"perkauman\" [racism] and is meant only for Malays and nobody [else] can join. So he (Nazri) is in a racist party but says he is against racism. So he should resign from the party.\" Mahathir is a former President of Umno, and was still a member of it and the time of making the statement. Koh Tsu Koon, another Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, defended Nazri, saying perhaps Mahathir was unaware of the nature of BTN's curriculum: \"[R]ecent feedback from participants since last year showed that the BTN course has diverted from its earlier version. Participants, including JPA [Public Services Department] scholars, felt very upset and disheartened.\"\n\nFormer BTN director and Member of Parliament for Sungai Petani, Johari Abdul then alleged that Mahathir was responsible for changes in the BTN programme, saying that under Mahathir, BTN courses emphasised propaganda supportive of the ruling party, making claims such as \"If the Umno-BN government falls, then ... the Malays would be enslaved in their own country.\" Other Members of Parliament, such as deputy chair of the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club and MP for Kinabatangan, Bung Mokhtar Radin, argued that BTN still served a useful purpose: \"I don't see it as racist. It is one of the government agencies that have taught society the characteristics of a great nation and understand the real Malaysia. BTN has also played a role since independence towards strengthening racial harmony in this country. So I really regret the actions by Pakatan state governments to prohibit the activities by BTN because BTN has never had the intention to weaken any party members but it is a platform for the public to gain knowledge.\"\n\nFrom 11 March 2015 until 15 June 2015, BTN had published a series of presentation slides which was available on its official website. One of the presentation slides had claimed Malay independent publishers to be \"anti-establishment\", in which their \"movement without supervision from the authorities\" will \"bring a negative effect on the government\" and giving birth to \"new icons of the young generation that spread extreme and free ideas\". The slide had also recommended that government officials ban any books having \"explicit and free\" content produced by them. This has raised ire from the publishers, who had collectively made a media statement demanding a public apology from the agency. Following the incident, BTN decided to take down all the controversial slides from its website while maintaining that the content of the slides were meant for \"academic discussion\" only.\n\nOther slides published by the agency included a slide that examined the performance of the Barisan Nasional (BN) ruling coalition from 1959 to 2014 with racial breakdown of popular votes towards BN and Pakatan Rakyat (PR) seats and also percentages of Muslim and non-Muslim member of parliament (MPs) in Parliament of Malaysia. Another slide had accused Chinese newspapers of being \"fine needles that penetrate the government whilst promoting opposition movements.\" The national opposition party Democratic Action Party (DAP) is accused of using several Malay leaders to purportedly \"destroy the Malay community\". DAP was also accused in the slide of controlling the minds of people from Sabah and Sarawak by invoking the issue of the use of the name \"Allah\" in the context of local Christian presses, and inciting separation of both states from Malaysia. The slide also claimed that a change in the current government will cause \"political instability\" in the country, bringing up comparisons with the Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime. Another slide presents a breakdown of a list of the 10 richest men in Malaysia, where most of them are Chinese, and also the situation of Christians \"being allowed to build large churches despite only accounting for 9.1% of the total population in Malaysia\". It also argued that \"racism can unite a nation or race\", whereas the racial minorities in Malaysia \"already have their needs fulfilled as entitled under international human rights laws\".\n\nIn August 2018, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, the Youth and Sports Minister of Malaysia announced that the National Civics Bureau will be abolished with immediate effect. The decision to scrap the BTN programme was made during two successive Cabinet meetings, because evidence shown that the programme was misused to spread misguided indoctrination. The staff and resources under the National Civics Bureau programme will be reassigned to work in other ministries of the Malaysian government.\n"}

Second, the guiding questions must be sequenced in a carefully constructed manner so that not only do students reach the appropriate conclusion, but at the same time various process and learning skills are implemented and developed. \n\nTypically the first few questions build on students' prior knowledge and direct attention to the information provided by the model. This is followed by questions designed to help promote the recognitions of relationships and patterns in the data, leading toward some concept development. The final questions may involve applying the concepts to new situations and generalizing students' new knowledge and understanding. Thus, POGIL activities follow the structure of the learning cycle of exploration, concept invention and application, and has a strong basis in constructivism.\n\nStudents in a POGIL classroom may work in small groups of three or four to tackle a specifically designed activity. Each student is assigned a role, such as a task manager, recorder, spokesperson or reflector. The instructor acts as a facilitator who listens to the discussions between students, intervening at appropriate times to help facilitate student learning. In their groups, students may discuss and analyze problems and their answers to questions that are crafted to help lead them to consider the general ideas in question and to construct their own understanding of important concepts. As they formulate their ideas, they may share their understanding and discoveries with other groups.\n\nRather than having the instructor begin class by defining terms and laying out concepts, students work actively to master material and formulate a deeper understanding of content. Built into the experience is the support of a variety of important process skills, including communication, teamwork, and critical thinking, which translates to a more complete understanding of the entire concept, and a lasting understanding of the material. \n\nThe teaching method of POGIL is supported by the POGIL Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 organization based in Lancaster, PA. The POGIL Project has earned numerous grants from the National Science Foundation and other sources. The POGIL Project is based on an understanding of the important components of an effective faculty development structure. The project trains faculty to implement POGIL in their classrooms, and creates new POGIL materials through an multitude of opportunities including workshops, on-site visits, and consultancies. The project also hosts an annual POGIL National Meeting to grow and expand the POGIL community. \n\nThe current director of The POGIL Project is Rick Moog, a Professor of Chemistry at Franklin & Marshall College. Dr. Moog has used POGIL materials in his teaching since 1994, and is a co-author of POGIL materials for both general and physical chemistry.\n\n"}

Members are appointed by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.\nIt acts in an advisory role and does not direct any research funding, which comes from the UK Research Councils.\n\nScotland has a proud tradition of science research and innovation, but this tends to be exclusively found in its main universities. R&D in Scottish industry is lower than the rest of the UK (RUK). Scotland has 10% of the population of the UK but produces 30% of the PhDs in microbiology and genetics. The University of Dundee is noted for its work in biochemistry.\n\nHowever in physical sciences, from 1999–2004, there was a 12% drop in Scottish graduates, and a 17% drop in engineering and technology graduates. In the post-war years, and up to the early 1990s, Scotland was producing more than its fair share of science and engineering graduates; it was seen a popular and challenging option, although mainly among males. Now, proportionately more children at Scottish schools are perceived to be indifferent to the challenges that science presents. Older science teachers at Scottish schools are not being replaced in the number needed. \"Why Science Matters\", the 2003 report, found that Scotland was short of around 350 chemistry teachers and 200 physics teachers. \n\nThe organisation was announced in August 2001, and founded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, with funding from the Scottish Executive.\n\nFrom 1 January 2007, it moved to the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser.

Writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) refers to a formal programmatic approach within contemporary secondary and higher education composition studies that promotes the importance of writing in classes outside of composition. \n\nWorking in partnership with the Association for Writing Across the Curriculum Programs (AWAC), the WAC Clearinghouse operates as a publishing collaborative, drawing on contributions from more than 125 individuals serving on the editorial boards of academic journals supported by the Clearinghouse, as editors or reviewers of its book series, as editors of resource pages on its website, and as members of the overall Clearinghouse editorial board. The open-access character of the scholarship available through the Clearinghouse book series provides free access to scholarly books and textbooks, providing students and teachers with an alternative to purchasing scholarly and classroom instructional materials. For individuals and libraries who wish to own print copies of its books, the Clearinghouse works with University Press of Colorado to make print books available in low-cost editions. The Clearinghouse also collaborates with other open-access publishers in the field of writing studies, including Computers and Composition Digital Press and Writing Spaces, which both publish open-access scholarly work, including innovative, multimodal digital writing projects, using traditional academic peer reviewed processes. The WAC Clearinghouse addresses several disciplinary areas within writing studies, such as second-language writing, writing fellows, and writing in the STEM disciplines.\n\nEstablished in 1997, the Clearinghouse is among the most successful open-access publishing projects in the humanities. It supports eight academic journals, including \"The WAC Journal,\" focused on WAC theory and ideas; \"Across the Disciplines,\" devoted to language, learning and academic writing; \"Double Helix,\" an international journal on writing, critical thinking, pedagogical theory and classroom practice; and \"RhetNet,\" an online journal of rhetoric and composition that explores what \"net\" publishing may be in its natural form, as well as several others. The Clearinghouse also has published 90 books and provides access to peer-reviewed resources for teachers who wish to use writing in courses across the disciplines, including a bibliography (published in collaboration with CompPile, which became part of the Clearinghouse in 2018), resource pages on writing fellows programs and second-language learners, conference proceedings, WAC program descriptions, a list of scholarly journals, and the 2014 Statement on WAC Principles and Practices, among others.\n\nIn May 2012, to mark its fifteenth year of operation, the WAC Clearinghouse launched the 25 Collective, a demonstration project for sustainable publishing. The goal of the project was to publish 25 new books for a total expenditure of $50,000—a cost far below that borne by traditional academic presses. Leveraging university resources (office space, computing resources, and web servers), the project operated within its budget and had, by March 2017, reached its goal, producing 29 books at an average cost of less than $2000 per book. The success of the project led to the launch of the Colorado State University Open Press, a publishing project that supports the use of the publishing collaborative model developed through the WAC Clearinghouse in other disciplines.\n\nThe Clearinghouse is hosted by Colorado State University and receives support from the Colorado State University Open Press. It also receives support from donations and funds from purchases of selected books in print form. Donations are used to defray costs associated with honoraria for graduate students who serve as copy editors and designers for Clearinghouse books, for accessibility to the Web site and publications, for the purchase of ISBN numbers, and for software and equipment expense. Interested patrons my donate online or by check through the Clearinghouse Web site. \n\n"}
