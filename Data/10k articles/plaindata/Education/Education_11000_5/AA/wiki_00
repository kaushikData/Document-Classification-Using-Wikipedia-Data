It runs a large technology education centre in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and is also involved in the training of midwives.\n\nAfghanistan Relief Organization is a non-political, non-religious, nonprofit 501(c)(3), non-governmental humanitarian organization, registered in both the United States and in Afghanistan, founded in the United States in 1998. It is based in Cypress, Orange County, California, USA, and works in Afghanistan.\n\nARO was officially formed in 1998 by Abdul Satar, a communications project manager and businessman, and a fellow Afghan, Aboul Fazil Khalili, the grandson of the former Afghan poet laureate, Khalilullah Khalili. They wanted to help a region in the northern province of Takhar suffering after a crippling earthquake.\n\nThe organization delivers relief aid in the form of food, medicine, school supplies and winter relief supplies directly to those in need and offers general education programs designed to encourage self-sufficiency. ARO provides free education to 1100 girls and boys, as well as providing adult education programs to both women and men at the Technology Education Center (TEC) in Kabul, where it employs Afghan staff. The centre operates from 7am to 7pm to accommodate the numbers. Courses at the TEC include computing, Dari, Pashtu, English, math, science, and job skills training.\n\nARO operates with an all-volunteer team and no paid office or warehouse space and with minimal overhead in the United States. The organization spends less than 7 percent on administration and fundraising in the United States and Afghanistan, and attempts to put the maximum percentage of donor contributions to work in Afghanistan.\n\nAfghanistan Relief Organization is not to be confused with the original UK charity Afghan Relief, set up by the writer and Sufi teacher Idries Shah in 1984 and removed from the registry in 2002, having ceased operations.\n\nIn February 2002, for the first time in almost 30 years, a commercial 747 aircraft landed at Kabul International Airport, carrying desperately needed humanitarian supplies for Afghanistan Relief. Teaming up with two nonprofit organizations, Evergreen International Airlines' Evergreen Humanitarian and Relief Services Inc. and Mercy Corps, and with the help of Microsoft, $2 million worth of aid supplies, much of it collected by Afghanistan Relief Organization following an appeal, were shipped aboard the plane. Items included hygiene kits, newborn and baby kits, livestock feed, winter clothing and blankets, school kits, and medical supplies\n\nAt a meeting hosted by University of California, Los Angeles's International Institute on 7 February 2002, Noor Delawari, an advisory board member of the Afghanistan Foundation and chair of the ARO, spoke of the urgent need for aid in Afghanistan:\nAfghanistan Relief Organization has also raised funds for the training of teachers and the construction of rural libraries in Afghanistan. The fundraising events have been supported by many celebrities, including Halle Berry, former President George H. W. Bush, Cher, Will Ferrell, Jodie Foster, Jake Gyllenhaal, \"Kite Runner\" author Khaled Hosseini, Angelina Jolie, Madonna, Eva Mendes, Steve Nash and Natalie Portman.\n\nAfghan Ambassador Said Tayeb Jawad visited Los Angeles, California on 23 February 2007 to deliver the keynote address at the ARO's annual fundraiser, \"Peace Through Education\".\n\nAccording to a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Education Fact Sheet (plus Q and A) for Afghanistan, 2007: \nFilm producers Participant Productions and Paramount Vantage have designated ARO as one of the non-governmental organization (NGO) partners in a social action campaign to accompany the award-winning film, \"The Kite Runner\", based on Khaled Hosseini's international best-seller, through an introduction by the author.\n\nIn 2007, Paramount Classics and DreamWorks Pictures studios donated 500 laptop computers to schoolchildren in Kabul. The ARO distributed the computers, provided by the One Laptop per Child initiative which is aimed at children in developing countries. \"Kite Runner\" author Khaled Hosseini is quoted as saying that \"Education of the general population is critical to the transformation of Afghanistan's political and economic condition.\"\n\nWith deaths in pregnancy or in childbirth so high in Afghanistan, and few trained women there to assist with childbirth, the training of midwives is another major project for the Afghanistan Relief Organization. In 2006, one in 60 Afghan women died of pregnancy-related causes, giving the country one of the world's highest maternal mortality rates, second only to Sierra Leone. The infant mortality rate was about 135 per 1,000 live births in 2006, which is an improvement from the 165 per 1,000 in 2001, but is still far too high.\n\n\n"}

She continued to learn the piano and she was able to perform very complex compositions compared to her age, which made her a special piano player. Alba went to \"The English school of Mrs. Miller\" and then to the \"French School of Mlle. Edges\"; she continued her studies in English and French with the help of her father; she showed interest in literature of different writers, specially William Shakespeare.\n\nAfter completing her higher education, she continued her piano studies with the maestro Carlos J. Meneses who presented her in some recitals. When the master Meneses returned to the National Conservatory, from which it had separated previously, Alba enrolled in the conservatory as well, and continued her classes with him. She also attended the classes of Alberto Villaseñor, her cousin Pedro Luis Ogazon and Ricardo Castro who was the Directorate of the Conservatory at that time. Ricardo Castro frequently changed the piano teachers because of circumstances beyond his control, but this did not prejudice Alba's ability to carry out her studies.\n\nAt the end of her piano career at the National Conservatory of Music in 1908, she traveled to New York City and obtained the \"B certificate\" from the 'Virgil Academy' and she received congratulations from her teacher, Mr. A. K. Virgil.\n\nConsidering herself apt to instruct her compatriots, she began teaching music and piano shortly after her return to Mexico following the 'Virgil System'.\n\nIn 1910, during his second visit to Mexico, Josef Hofmann asked Alba to translate his book \"La Execución Pianística\", a task that she subsequently carried out.\nWithout abandoning the musical-pianist art, in 1917, she published her book \"The Musical Art in Mexico\", in which she summarized the musical movement in Mexico until that year. Later she carried out diverse concerts, some with the National Classic Quartet and others. In 1919, for the first time in Mexico, Alba Herrera y Ogazón with Julian Carrillo played the \"Sonatas of Beethoven\". Later she undertook a tour in the republic in company with Julián Carrillo the director of the National Symphony Orchestra, and Sante Lo Priore, an Italian violinist.\n\nAfter she finished her tour in the republic, she published her book \"Points of View\", that consisted of critic essays in music; the book was circulated in 1921.\nShe then started the preparation of several other books: \"Mosaicos Musicales\", \"Greorge Eliot\", \"My Miserable Hours\" and \"General History of Music\".\n\nAs a lecturer Alba Herrera y Ogazón participated effectively in the celebration of the centenary of Beethoven, in the conference that was dictated to music, during the time of the romanticism; and was a speaker in the speeches of the inauguration of the Faculty of Music and anniversary, also she taught classes of musical history.\n\nAs a journalist, Alba collaborated actively with the Time, The Illustrated World, The Journal, The Tribune, Magazine of Magazines, Pegasus, El Globo, El Universal Ilustrado, El Universal, and others. She also occasionally collaborated with \"Excélsior\", \"Get to Know Mexico\", \"La Opinión\", \"Mexican Herald\", \"Conservatorio\", \"Tricolor\" Sombra \",\" Cosmos \",\" New Democracy \"(New York) etc., and she was a member of following corporations: Ateneo de México , Society of Local History Studies of Mexico City, Ateneo Hispánico, PEN Grupo Ariel, Sociedad Pro Arte Patrio, International League of Iberian and Hispanic American Women, and the International Society of Pianoforte Teachers and Players, also held the following positions: lecturer in the former department of aesthetic culture of the Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico), during 1922 to 1927; professor of piano and history of the music, in the National Conservatory and in the faculty of music of the National University of Mexico, independent until its death.\nAlba Herrera y Ogazon died in 1931.

During the 1950s, he studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he began to take an interest in painting. In 1958, he moved to New York City to pursue artistic and activist work. Among other successes, he created art education programs to serve underprivileged students at Queens College and participated actively in the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (1969). His advocacy of artists of color Howardena Pindell, Sam Gilliam, Roy DeCarava, and others contributed to their increasing visibility and reputation in museums and the historical canon. He received many awards, including the John Hay Whitney Fellowship (1965–66), the New York Council on the Arts fellowships (1971–81), and the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1974–81).\n\nBenny Andrews was born into a family of ten on November 13, 1930, in the small community of Plainview, Georgia. His parents, George and Viola (née Perryman), were sharecroppers. His mother and father emphasized the importance of education, religion, and freedom of expression. George Andrews himself was a self-taught artist whose drawings and paintings led to renown as the \"Dot Man\" and a retrospective at the Morris Museum of Art.\n\nDespite his parents' stress on education, they could not afford to let Andrews go to school when they needed his help to pick or plant cotton. He attended high school only in the winter. Andrews managed to graduate from Burney Street High School in Madison, Georgia in 1948, making him his family's first high school graduate.\n\nHe got a two-year scholarship to go to Forth Valley College, whose limited art curriculum made it difficult for him to explore a range of media. His grades were poor, so when his scholarship ran out, he left college to join the U.S. Air Force. Having served from 1950 to 1953, he used the G.I. Bill to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was trained as an abstract expressionist and received his BFA.\n\nIn 1962 the \"New York Times\" praised his first New York City solo exhibit. He received the John Hay Whitney Fellowship for 1965-1966 and a CAPS award from the New York State Council on the Arts in 1971. In the same year, he painted one of his most notable works, \"No More Games\", which highlighted the plight of black artists and became an icon of his emerging social justice activism in the art world.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1997, Andrews taught at Queens College, City University of New York and created an arts program for prisons, one that became a national model.\n\nIn 1969, Andrews co-founded the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC), an organization that protested the \"Harlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968\" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. No African-Americans had been involved in organizing the show, and it contained no art—only photo reproductions and copies of newspaper articles about Harlem.\n\nThe BECC then persuaded the Whitney Museum to launch a similar exhibition of African American artists, but later felt compelled to boycott the Whitney show for similar reasons.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1984, Andrews served as the director of visual arts for the National Endowment for the Arts. In this position, he had the chance to advocate for fellowships and grants to go to talented black artists who may otherwise have escaped notice.\n\nAndrews traveled in 2006 to the Gulf Coast to work on an art project with children displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nBenny Andrews was a figural painter in the expressionist style who painted a diverse range of themes of suffering and injustice, including the Holocaust, Native American forced migrations, and Hurricane Katrina. In the 1960s he began to find his own style of painting, which developed parallel to the flourishing collage moment. Other influences on his work include surrealism and Southern folk art. His work hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Studio Museum in Harlem (New York City); the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia; the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC; and the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nReflecting his minimalist style, Andrews said he was not interested in how much he could paint, but how little. He incorporated his sparing use of geometrical forms to convey broader messages about his subjects. Gabriel Tenabe describes his drawing as \"delicate, subtle, and intimate... draw(ing) from his past private life in Georgia and his social life in New York.\" Christian imagery is juxtaposed with sensibilities of humanism to call out false religion, false democracy, sexism, and militarism and their roles in creating a failed society.\n\nUsing various media, Andrews depicted diverse American scenes and people in a figurative style that he felt both reflected the dignity of those he portrayed and served his commitment to social change.\n\nBenny Andrews was married to artist Nene Humphrey for 20 years. He had three children.\n\nAndrews died of cancer at the age of 75.\n\n\n"}

The role makes Cayne the first transgender actress to play a recurring transgender character in primetime.\n\nCandis Cayne was born Brendan McDaniel in 1971 on Maui, Hawaii. She has a fraternal twin brother named Dylan. Their parents taught at a Waldorf School, and the family lived on campus. She graduated from Henry Perrine Baldwin High School in 1989 and then spent a year in Los Angeles, where she trained as a dancer.\n\nCayne then moved to New York in the early 1990s, making a name for herself as a choreographer and drag performer. About three years after her arrival in NYC, Cayne realized that the term transgender described how she felt about herself. Already performing as \"Candis Cayne\" at New York gay bar Boy Bar and as a featured performer at Tour in New York's Chelsea, the entertainer also participated in Wigstock, the annual drag festival in Manhattan's East Village. In 1995 Cayne appeared in the related documentary film \"\", the comedy-drama film \"Stonewall\", and the Universal Studios comedy feature film \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\", for which she also did choreography.\n\nIn 1996, she had a supporting role in the comedy-drama film \"Always Something Better\" (a.k.a. \"Never Look Back\"). In 1997 Cayne was in a documentary called Drag Time on HBO along with many other famous New York nightlife performers. Candis also co-starred in the music video for RuPaul's \"A Little Bit of Love\" with female impersonator Jazzmun. Cayne also starred as the title character in the 1998 independent film \"Mob Queen\", and won the 2001 Miss Continental pageant.

These are used in both commercial and military training applications.\n\nThe history of control loading systems starts with the history of flight simulation. The first flight simulator was the Link Trainer, also known as the Blue Box. This was developed in the 1920s and used pumps, valves and bellows to provide the flight control forces. The next development in control loading systems was the use of hydraulic actuators to provide the forces required on the flight controls. These were utilized for around 20 years in the simulator industry until the development of electric actuators.\n\nThe main concept is to provide forces to the pilot using an actuator (hydraulic or electric). The approach used in high fidelity applications is to connect this actuator via a linkage to the pilot controls. The actuator is then controlled with a servo controller to control the torque or current of the motor. An outer-loop control then controls the torque provided to the pilot using a control loop around a force sensor.\n\nThe control loading system must take in inputs from the simulator and pilot and provide outputs for the pilot and simulator. Inputs are application of force and aircraft states and outputs are flight control position and forces.\nAn aircraft with reversible controls needs to have all of the complex components modeled within the control loading system. These include cables, rods, aero forces from the control surface, centering springs and trim actuators. As the control system gets more complicated they have to simulate effects such as bob-weights and feel units. Fly-by-wire systems are disconnected from the control surfaces and so do not need the complex features but add other functionality which is simulated.\nThe high fidelity architecture has centralized control, individual analog signals to the control module, a brushless DC motor with low gear ratio and linkages to the pilot controls.\nThe modular designs have localized control and digital reporting over a field bus to the central control module. The control loading systems are designed to allow situating the actuators closer to the pilot. This is necessary for mission training systems that can be easily deployed and moved around the world.\n\nControl Loading Systems are similar in design to active sidesticks. These provide cues to pilots during the flight via actuation systems. Some examples of active sidesticks used in aircraft are for the F-35 Lightning II and the T-50 Golden Eagle jet trainer developed by KAI in partnership with Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n\nThe regulations governing control loading systems for civil simulators are the Federal Aviation Administration regulations in North America and EASA (formerly JAA) in Europe. The FAA documents are AC 120-40B for airplane simulator qualification, Advisory circular 120-45A for Airplane Flight Training Device Qualification and AC 120-63 for helicopter Simulator Qualification. The EASA regulations are similar to the FAR's.\nBetween 2006 and 2008 the International Working Group of the RAeS's Flight Simulation Group met on several occasions to redefine the standards applicable to flight simulation. This resulted in the release of a draft standards document to ICAO. This will be released by ICAO in 2009 and at this time the FAA and EASA should incorporate this into the regulations. The changes behind the standards will define different levels of simulator training devices which define what training requirements can be trained on with particular levels of simulators.\n"}
{"id": "4071917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4071917", "title": "Criterion-referenced test", "text": "Criterion-referenced test\n\nA criterion-referenced test is a style of test which uses test scores to generate a statement about the behavior that can be expected of a person with that score. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material. Criterion-referenced assessment can be contrasted with norm-referenced assessment and ipsative assessment.\n\nCriterion-referenced testing was a major focus of psychometric research in the 1970s.\n\nA common misunderstanding regarding the term is the meaning of \"criterion\". Many, if not most, criterion-referenced tests involve a cutscore, where the examinee passes if their score exceeds the cutscore and fails if it does not (often called a mastery test). The \"criterion\" is not the cutscore; the criterion is the domain of subject matter that the test is designed to assess. For example, the criterion may be \"Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers,\" and the cutscore may be that students should correctly answer a minimum of 80% of the questions to pass.\n\nThe criterion-referenced interpretation of a test score identifies the relationship to the subject matter. In the case of a mastery test, this does mean identifying whether the examinee has \"mastered\" a specified level of the subject matter by comparing their score to the cutscore. However, not all criterion-referenced tests have a cutscore, and the score can simply refer to a person's standing on the subject domain. The ACT is an example of this; there is no cutscore, it simply is an assessment of the student's knowledge of high-school level subject matter.\n\nBecause of this common misunderstanding, criterion-referenced tests have also been called standards-based assessments by some education agencies, as students are assessed with regards to standards that define what they \"should\" know, as defined by the state.\n\nBoth terms \"criterion-referenced\" and \"norm-referenced\" were originally coined by Robert Glaser. Unlike a criterion-reference test, a norm-referenced test indicates whether the test-taker did better or worse than other people who took the test.\nFor example, if the criterion is \"Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers,\" then reasonable test questions might look like \"formula_1\" or \"formula_2\" A criterion-referenced test would report the student's performance strictly according to whether the individual student correctly answered these questions. A norm-referenced test would report primarily whether this student correctly answered more questions compared to other students in the group.\nEven when testing similar topics, a test which is designed to accurately assess mastery may use different questions than one which is intended to show relative ranking. This is because some questions are better at reflecting actual achievement of students, and some test questions are better at differentiating between the best students and the worst students. (Many questions will do both.) A criterion-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by students who know the specific material. A norm-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by the \"best\" students and not correctly answered by the \"worst\" students (e.g. Cambridge University's pre-entry 'S' paper).\nSome tests can provide useful information about both actual achievement and relative ranking. The ACT provides both a ranking, and indication of what level is considered necessary to likely success in college. Some argue that the term \"criterion-referenced test\" is a misnomer, since it can refer to the \"interpretation\" of the score as well as the test itself. In the previous example, the same score on the ACT can be interpreted in a norm-referenced or criterion-referenced manner.\n\nMany high-profile criterion-referenced tests are also high-stakes tests, where the results of the test have important implications for the individual examinee. Examples of this include high school graduation examinations and licensure testing where the test must be passed to work in a profession, such as to become a physician or attorney. However, being a high-stakes test is not specifically a feature of a criterion-referenced test. It is instead a feature of how an educational or government agency chooses to use the results of the test.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 2011 within a technological industrial area in the city of Petah Tikva in the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area.\n\nDan Academic Center was founded in 2011 by top academics, chief executives and entrepreneurs from the high tech and IT industries in Israel as an unprecedented initiative to create a unique academic college that specializes in the high tech and IT fields and to bring together academic education with front-line practical knowledge \n\n. The close relations and collaborations between the center and joint companies in the industry provide the motto for the center \"the industry's academy\". \n\nDuring the years prior to the establishment of the center statistics have shown a decline in the number of graduates from the computer science and management information systems disciplines in higher education institutes in Israel, which implied a growing demand for academically educated manpower in the high tech and IT industries. At the same time it is noted that a significant amount of high tech employees in Israel who do not hold a relevant professional qualification encounter a glass ceiling on their way up to more senior positions. Dan Academic Center was created with the purpose of generating a workforce that maintains both a relevant academic qualification and cutting edge practical knowledge that would meet the needs of the industry. The center has defined its mission statement as to provide the next generation of professionals in the high tech industry in Israel.\n\nThe students in Dan Academic Center combine work and study. They work in high tech organizations, companies and IT units. The center provides experienced employees with the opportunity to acquire an academic qualification and thereby to increase their chances to get promoted to senior positions in the organizations they already work in. For freshmen the center has created \"Dan Works\", a business networking platform in order to refer them for employment in the joint companies. These companies hire the students for work so that in graduation they would have gained relevant practical experience. This helps the students through their study years to make a connection between theory and practice, to get to know professionals in their fields, and to increase their chances for employment in the high tech industry after graduation.\n\nThe center's academic activity and curricula are developed, among other criteria, according to the industry's needs so as to provide the students with both the theoretical and practical knowledge required. This scheme is directed by an advisory board that consists of executives and entrepreneurs from the joint companies, to include Matrix, John Bryce Training, Cisco, Comverse, Intel, Oracle, Microsoft, Cellcom, Nokia Siemens Networks, Amdocs, Orbotech, 013 Netvision, BMC Software, HP, IBM and EMC.\n\nSeveral committees in the advisory board are responsible to advance certain subject areas in the center to include academic research according to industry's needs, integration of industry related contents into academic curricula, local high school academy partnership, career development and social involvement.\n\nThe center holds special events to include lectures and conferences. The \"coffee, technology and academy\" lectures are intended for registered and prospective students and are given by executives and top professionals from the joint companies. Through these lectures the students are informed about current and future trends in the high tech industry, and prospective students get the chance to learn more about the center and its collaboration with the industry. The joint companies may organize conferences in the center on various topics.\n\nDan Academic center is accredited by the Council for Higher Education in Israel to teach for the following degrees.\n\n\nDuring their study years the students are offered to work and manage projects in the joint companies, to take elective courses by which to focus on subjects they want to intern in and to take courses from other departments. The students can also collaborate with one another on a project. In their third year of study they are required to conduct a practicum in one of the joint companies, for which they are instructed both by the center and the relevant company.\n"}

Feld works in an atmosphere between modern dance and classical ballet. His company and schools, including the Feld Ballet and Ballet Tech, are deeply committed to dance and dance education in New York City.\n\nFeld has choreographed nearly 150 ballets since 1967, with his work being performed by such companies as American Ballet Theatre, the Joffrey Ballet, the Juilliard School, New York City Ballet, the New York City Opera, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, among many others.\n\nFeld was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Alice (née Posner), a travel agent, and Benjamin Noah Feld, an attorney. Feld attended the High School of Performing Arts in New York, and studied at the School of American Ballet and the New Dance Group, as well as with Richard Thomas and Donald McKayle.\n\nHe performed as a child in George Balanchine's original production of \"The Nutcracker\" as the Nutcracker Prince; and later with the companies of Mary Anthony, Pearl Lang, and Sophie Maslow. At sixteen he appeared on Broadway in \"West Side Story\" and was cast as Baby John in the movie version of the musical; during the filming of \"Cool\" (one of the hardest dances in the film), Feld was sick with pneumonia. His other Broadway credits from this period include \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nHe appeared on television on \"The Garry Moore Show\" and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\nLater, Feld joined American Ballet Theatre, leaving at age 25 to form his own company.\n\nIn the early 1980s, with Cora Cahan, Feld founded the Joyce Theater as a home for the Feld Ballet. Feld was also instrumental in the creation of the Lawrence A. Wien Center for Dance & Theater at 890 Broadway in New York.\n\nIn 1967, at the age of twenty-five, Feld broke away from the American Ballet Theatre to form his own company, the American Ballet Company. Feld used his new company, later known simply as Feld Ballet, to explore a variety of dance genres.\n\nIn 1978, Feld began a ballet school, the New Ballet School. Feld believed that all children should have the opportunity to learn dance, regardless of their family income. In keeping with that philosophy, and in partnership with the New York City Board of Education, he auditioned more than 1,500 children at eight New York City public schools; almost 150 students were then enrolled, tuition-free, to a 17-week course at the New Ballet School. Additional dancers at the school were drawn from other troupes and academies. Since its 1978 founding, Feld's school has auditioned 827,655 New York City public school students, and provided classes for 20,976 children. In 1996 the school changed its name to the New York City Public School for Dance.\n\nIn 1997, Feld merged his school and the Feld Ballet into Ballet Tech, providing a unified organization, and establishing a professional performing outlet for the school's graduates. In 2003, Feld disbanded the Feld Ballet to focus on his schools. Today, Ballet Tech’s activities include the tuition-free New York City Public School for Dance, and Kids Dance, a pre-professional children’s group.\n\nFeld has choreographed 147 ballets since 1967, with his work being performed by the American Ballet Company, American Ballet Theatre, the Atlanta Ballet, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Feld Ballets/NY & Ballet Tech & Kids Dance, the Boston Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet, the John Curry Skating Company, the Juilliard School, the London Festival Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada, the New York City Ballet, the New York City Opera, the Pacific Northwest Ballet, the Richmond Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and the San Francisco Ballet, among others.\n\nFeld’s choreography also appeared in the revival of the Broadway musical \"On the Town\" (2001), performed in Central Park. In place of the company’s usual summer engagement at the Joyce Theater, Feld included several of his own dancers of the Ballet Tech company.\n\nFeld uses aspects from ballet and modern dance and fuses them together in his work. \"The down of one, the up of the other — both beauties attracted me, I think I've spent my choreographic life trying in some way to reconcile, cope, deal with these two elements.\" He claims to have always \"loved the pointe shoe.\"\n\nFeld's works are varied and contain anything from off-beat music to aerobic exercises, including somersaults, push-ups, sprints, leaps, and calisthenics. His choreography was inspired by Jewish material, along with the influence of Martha Graham.\n\n\"A Yankee Doodle\", Feld's most recent ballet, premiered in New York on June 11, 2015; it was choreographed for 13 kids from the Ballet Tech school, to American fife & drum music.\n\n\nFeld has been honored with numerous awards, including the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (1969), the Dance Magazine Award (1990), and an honorary doctorate degree from Juilliard (1991).\n\n\n"}

It is situated in Juja, 36 kilometres northeast of Nairobi, along the Nairobi-Thika SuperHighway, off Exit 15. It offers courses in Technology, Engineering, Science, Architecture and Building sciences. The university has a strong research interest in the areas of biotechnology and engineering. Notable former students include Aden Duale, the current Leader of Majority in the 11th Kenyan Parliament; Njoroge Kamau the founder of Ignite Kenya and Beyond; and Thuku Kamau, among others.\n\nThe university was started in 1981 as Jomo Kenyatta College of Agriculture and Technology (JKCAT), a middle-level college by the government of Kenya with assistance from the Japanese government. Plans for the establishment of JKCAT started in 1977. In early 1978, the Kenyan president, Jomo Kenyatta, donated 200 hectares of farmland for the establishment of the college. The first group of students were admitted on 4 May 1981. The new president Daniel Arap Moi formally opened JKUAT on 17 March 1982.\n\nThe first graduation ceremony was held in April 1984 with diploma certificates presented to graduates in agricultural engineering, food technology and horticulture. On 1 September 1988, Moi declared JKUAT a constituent College of Kenyatta University through a legal notice, under the Kenyatta University Act (CAP 210C). The name of JKUAT officially changed to Jomo Kenyatta University College of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). It was finally established as a university through the JKUAT Act, 1994 and inaugurated on 7 December 1994.\n\nJomo Kenyatta has the following campuses, schools, faculties, institutes and colleges:\n\n\nThe university offers accommodation to some of the students at subsidized rates. There are six students' hostels inside the school compound, of which three are occupied by males and three by females.\n\nThere are three student dining cafeterias: the candle in the wind, main mess and the Hall six dining mess. \n\nThe university has a library that has a seating capacity of 600 students and is stocked with 80,000 volumes. The library also offers other essential services like online services, reference, interlibrary loan, user education, orientation, online information services, photocopying, binding and repair.\n\nIn February 2010, JKUAT was selected as the host for the East and Central Africa regional institute of the Pan African University. The post-graduate Institute on Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation would be hosted at the Main Campus in Juja, with the first students admitted in September 2011. The decision that Kenya would host the regional institute was made in July 2010 after a protracted dispute. JKUAT hosts the African Institute for Capacity Development (AICAD).\n\nThe Chinese government agreed to support the development of infrastructure, classrooms, hostels and laboratories at JKUAT based Pan African University, Institute of Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUIST), an initiative by the African Union.

Working on behalf of the Kafka estate in London, England, the SDSU Kafka Project is working to recover materials written by Franz Kafka, the widely acclaimed modernist author, stolen by the Gestapo in 1933. The search continues in Eastern Europe and Israel.\n\nThe SDSU Kafka Project, headed by SDSU adjunct professor and biographer Kathi Diamant, with an international board of advisors, is searching for Kafka's notebooks and letters written in correspondence to Dora Diamant, his lover at the time of his death in 1924, as well as Dora's correspondence with Kafka's friend, literary executor and first biographer Max Brod. Kafka's missing writings consist of 35 letters written to Dora Diamant between 1923–1924 and up to 20 notebooks, representing the last year of his life. The contents of these letters and notebooks is unknown and has never been published. The 70 letters that Dora wrote to Max Brod between 1924-1952 are amongst the hotly contested Brod Collection. Dora Diamant's letters to Max Brod contain information to further identify the missing materials\n\nKafka requested that all his extant writings be destroyed, however, Dora, following Kafka's express wish that his writings be burned, secretly kept them in her Berlin home. Following the Nazi takeover in 1933, the Gestapo ransacked her Berlin flat and confiscated every piece of paper, looking for Communist propaganda. In the early 1930s, Dora and her husband, Lutz Lask, were members of the KPD and Lask was the editor of the illegal Communist organ, \"Die Rote Fahne.\" After the theft of her secret Kafka treasure, Dora contacted Max Brod to beg that he rescue the materials. Brod was told that the mountainous stacks of papers confiscated in the early days of Nazi rule made it impossible to recover at the time. In the mid-1950s, Brod, now living in Tel Aviv, worked with Kafka scholar and biographer Klaus Wagenbach to attempt recovery of Kafka's lost writings. However, their search ended at the Iron Curtain when the Berlin Chief of Police informed them Kafka's papers were most likely amongst confiscated materials taken out of Berlin in a train transport during the Allied bombing for safekeeping in Silesia.\n\nThe Kafka Project has conducted two extensive research projects, in 1998 in the German archives and in 2008 in Poland. The Kafka Project has been responsible for the discoveries of three original Kafka letters, Dora Diamant's missing diaries and letters, and the only extant personal possession of Kafka, his hairbrush. \"also found in Kafka Project Discoveries\", \"Kafka Project\".

{"id": "1706118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1706118", "title": "Little Golden Books", "text": "Little Golden Books\n\nLittle Golden Books is a popular series of children's books. The eighth book in the series, \"The Poky Little Puppy\", is the top-selling children's book of all time. Many of the Little Golden Books have become bestsellers, including \"The Poky Little Puppy\", \"Tootle\", \"Scuffy the Tugboat\", and \"The Little Red Hen\". Several of the illustrators for the Little Golden Books later became staples within the picture book industry, including Corinne Malvern, Tibor Gergely, Gustaf Tenggren, Feodor Rojankovsky, Richard Scarry, Eloise Wilkin, and Garth Williams.\n\nMany books in the Little Golden Books series deal with nature and science, Bible stories, nursery rhymes, and fairy tales. Christmas titles are published every year. Some Little Golden Books and related products have featured children's characters from other media, e.g. \"Sesame Street\", \"The Muppets\", Disney, \"Looney Tunes\", \"Barbie\", \"Power Rangers\", etc. Television and movie tie-ins have been particularly popular. Over the years Hopalong Cassidy, Cheyenne, Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Captain Kangaroo, Mister Rogers, and even Donny and Marie Osmond have appeared in Little Golden Books. That many old titles remain in print shows the strong nostalgia appeal of the series.\n\nThe series originated with Simon & Schuster; Western Printing and Lithographing Company in Racine, Wisconsin was Simon & Schuster's partner in the Little Golden Books venture, with Western handling the actual printing. Ownership and control of the series has changed several times since; Little Golden Books are currently published by Penguin Random House.\n\nAlthough the details have changed over the years, the Little Golden Books have maintained a distinctive appearance. A copy of \"The Poky Little Puppy\" bought today is essentially the same as one printed in 1942. Both are readily recognizable as Little Golden Books. At the time of the series' golden anniversary in 1992, Golden Books claimed that a billion and a half Little Golden Books had been sold.\n\nAlthough the Little Golden Books have remained the backbone of the product line, the enterprise that produced the Little Golden Books has created a variety of children's books in various formats, including records, tapes, videos, and even toys and games. Some titles have appeared in several different formats (including \"A Golden Book\").\n\nLittle Golden Books was the brainchild of Georges Duplaix, who in 1940 was head of Artists and Writers Guild Inc., a division of Western Publishing tasked with developing new children's books. Meanwhile, a shared printing plant led Western and Simon & Schuster to develop a close relationship. In 1938, the first joint effort between Western and Simon & Schuster, \"A Children’s History,\" was published.\n\nDuplaix had the idea to produce a colorful, more durable and affordable children’s book than those being published at that time which sold for $2 to $3. With the help of Lucile Olge, also working at the Guild, Duplaix contacted Albert Leventhal, a vice president and sales manager at Simon & Schuster, and Leon Shimkin, also at Simon & Schuster, with his idea.\n\nThe group decided to publish twelve titles for simultaneous release in what was to be called the Little Golden Books Series. Each book would have 42 pages, 28 printed in two-color, and 14 in four-color. The books would be staple-bound. The group originally discussed a 50-cent price for the books, but Western did not want to compete with other 50-cent books already on the market. The group calculated that if the print run for each title was 50,000 copies instead of 25,000, the books could affordably be sold for 25 cents each.\n\nMary Reed, Ph.D., a professor at the Teachers College, Columbia University, served as initial editor of the series.\n\nThe first 12 titles were printed in September 1942 and released to stores in October:\n\nThree editions totaling 1.5 million books sold out within five months of publication in 1942.\n\nSimon & Schuster editor Dorothy A. Bennett also worked with Duplaix on the Little Golden Books. Bennett became the editor of the franchise, producing books by such authors and illustrators as Margaret Wise Brown, Clement Hurd, Edith Thacher Hurd, and Garth Williams. Bennett authored several Golden Books, and introduced some of the first recorded books for children with Little Golden Records in 1948.\n\nA big boost to the series came with the involvement of Lucy Sprague Mitchell, an educator and founder of Bank Street Nursery School in New York's West Village, that later became the Bank Street College of Education. A strong proponent of realistic children books, Mitchell created the Bank Street Writer’s Laboratory, whose works became the new basis for the Little Golden Book series, with characters and situations that were often inspired by the very neighborhood where the Bank School was located.\n\nAs historian Leonard S. Marcus writes,\nIn 1958, Simon & Schuster sold its interest in Little Golden Books to Western Publishing. The price of Little Golden Books rose to 29¢ in 1962.\n\nWestern introduced a line of Big Little Golden Books for slightly older children, age 5 and up. These included new stories such as \"The House That Had Enough\" and reprints such as \"The Monster at the End of This Book\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Golden Books introduced Golden Melody Books that included a long-lasting electronic chip that played music every time the book was opened. Titles included popular children's songs such as \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\" and songs from children's TV and movies including\" People in Your Neighborhood\" from \"Sesame Street\" and \"Heigh Ho\" from \"Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\n\nIn the year 2000, Encore Software produced a series of \"Little Golden Books\" titles for CD ROM, including \"The Poky Little Puppy\", \"Mother Goose\", \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", \"The Velveteen Rabbit\", \"Tootle\", and \"The Saggy Baggy Elephant\". These six individual titles were some of the first major software releases to be produced entirely in Macromedia Flash. \n\nIn 2001, Random House acquired Little Golden Books for about $85 million. At that point, nearly 15 million copies of \"The Poky Little Puppy\" had been sold, including copies in various languages.\n\nIn 2015, with the release of Little Golden Book adaptations of the first six installments of the \"Star Wars\" saga on August 25, the Little Golden Book adaptation of \"\" became the first ever Little Golden Book in history to be based on a film that was rated PG-13 by the MPAA. Months later, on April 12, 2016, a Little Golden Book adaptation of \"\", the next film in the saga, also rated PG-13, was released. This opened the door for further Little Golden Books that drew upon PG-13 rated licensed film properties, such as the 2016 reboot of \"Ghostbusters\", characters and storylines from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and even \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nMany popular authors and illustrators have worked on Little Golden Books and related products, including:\n\n\nIn 2010, Ryan Jude Novelline revealed the \"Golden Book Gown\", a \"one-of-a-kind fairytale-inspired gown almost entirely from Golden Books...[featuring] a 22,000-square-inch page-turning skirt and a form-fitting bodice made from the spines\".\n\nIn an episode of \"Friends\", Chandler tracks down an early edition of \"The Velveteen Rabbit\" for his girlfriend as a birthday gift. He warns Rachel against touching the rabbit due to the oils of human hands.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "241128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241128", "title": "Michigan State University", "text": "Michigan State University\n\nMichigan State University (MSU) is a public research university in East Lansing, Michigan, United States. MSU was founded in 1855 and served as a model for land-grant universities later created under the Morrill Act of 1862. The university was founded as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, one of the country's first institutions of higher education to teach scientific agriculture. After the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU is one of the largest universities in the United States (in terms of enrollment) and has approximately 563,000 living alumni worldwide.\n\nMichigan State frequently ranks among the top 30 public universities in the United States and the top 100 research universities in the world. \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranks many of its graduate programs among the best in the nation, including African history, criminology, industrial and organizational psychology, educational psychology, elementary and secondary education, osteopathic medicine, human medicine, nuclear physics, rehabilitation counseling, supply chain/logistics, and veterinary medicine. MSU pioneered the studies of packaging, hospitality business, supply chain management, and communication sciences. Michigan State is a member of the Association of American Universities, an organization of 62 leading research universities in North America. The university's campus houses the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, the Abrams Planetarium, the Wharton Center for Performing Arts, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, and the country's largest residence hall system.\n\nThe Michigan State Spartans compete in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference. Michigan State Spartans football won the Rose Bowl Game in 1954, 1956, 1988 and 2014, and a total of six national championships. Spartans men's basketball won the NCAA National Championship in 1979 and 2000 and has attained the Final Four seven times since the 1998–1999 season. Spartans ice hockey won NCAA national titles in 1966, 1986 and 2007.\n\nThe Michigan Constitution of 1850 called for the creation of an \"agricultural school,\" though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan. Classes began on May 13, 1857, with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students.\n\nThe first president, Joseph R. Williams, designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both the students and the College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.\n\nIn 1860, Williams became acting lieutenant governor and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This gave the college a four-year curriculum and the power to grant master's degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution. The college changed its name to State Agricultural College, and its first class graduated in the same year. As the Civil War had begun, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony. The first alumni enlisted to the Union Army. Williams died, and the following year, Abraham Lincoln signed the First Morrill Act of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model. Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University one of the nation's first land-grant college.\n\nThe college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous stagecoach trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a \"Women Course\" that melded a home economics curriculum with liberal arts and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now Tuskegee University. President Jonathan L. Snyder invited its president Booker T. Washington to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African-American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated the same year, and two years later the college changed its name to Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.).\n\nDuring the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it changed its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, John A. Hannah, became president of the College.\n\nAfter World War II, he began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.\n\nIn 1957, Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now Oakland University, with Matilda Dodge Wilson. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the University of Chicago resigned from the Big Ten Conference in 1946. Hannah lobbied to take its place, gaining admission in 1949.\n\nSix years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science. Nine years afterward, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan allowed the University to drop the words \"Agriculture and Applied Science\" from its name. Since 1964, the institution has been Michigan State University.\n\nIn 1957, the donation of in Pontiac Township, Oakland County, Michigan prompted creation of Michigan State University – Oakland. That campus became the independent school, Oakland University, in 1970.\n\nSince the end of the Hannah era in 1969, Michigan State shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, president Lou Anna Simon called for MSU to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new residential college and increased grants awarded from the National Institutes of Health past the US$100 million mark. While there are over 100 Land-grant universities in the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.\n\nMichigan State, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University created the University Research Corridor in 2006. This alliance was formed to transform and strengthen Michigan's economy by reaching out to businesses, policymakers, innovators, investors and the public to speed up technology transfer, make resources more accessible and attract new jobs to the state.\n\nIn 2016, a police report was filed alleging that in 2000, USA Gymnastics team doctor and MSU sports physician Larry Nassar (also a professor in the College of Osteopathic Medicine) had sexually assaulted a minor named Rachael Denhollander under the guise of medical treatment. The allegation led to the arrest and eventual conviction of Nassar. He was sentenced in January 2018. Between the police report filing and the time of sentencing, 156 victims including Olympic gymnasts and MSU student athletes came forward to speak of abuses inflicted by Nassar. \"The Detroit News\" reported that 14 MSU representatives – including athletic trainers, coaches, a university police detective, and then-president Lou Anna Simon – had been alerted of sexual misconduct by Nassar across two decades. Michigan State and USA Gymnastics have been accused of enabling Nassar's abuse and are named as defendants in civil lawsuits that gymnasts and former MSU student athletes have filed against Nassar. MSU's role in the scandal led to the resignations of president Lou Anna Simon and athletic director Mark Hollis in January 2018. In March 2018, William Strampel was arrested and charged with felony misconduct in office and criminal sexual conduct for allegedly groping a student and storing nude photos of female students on his computer. Strampel is the former dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine and oversaw Larry Nassar's clinic. On May 16, 2018, it was announced that Michigan State University had agreed to pay the victims of Nassar $500 million. On November 20, 2018, former university president Simon was charged with two felonies and two misdemeanor counts for lying to the police about her knowledge of sexual abuse committed by Nassar.\n\nMSU's sprawling campus is in East Lansing, Michigan. The campus is perched on the banks of the Red Cedar River. Development of the campus started in 1856 with three buildings: a multipurpose College Hall building, a dormitory later called \"Saints' Rest\", and a barn. Today, MSU's contiguous campus consists of , of which are developed. There are 556 buildings: 100 for academics, 131 for agriculture, 166 for housing and food service, and 42 for athletics. Overall, the university has of indoor space. Connecting it all is of roads and of sidewalks. MSU also owns 44 non-campus properties, totaling in 28 different counties.In early 2017, construction of a $22.5 million solar project began at five parking lots on campus. Carports with solar arrays will be built, generating about 5 percent of the electricity used on campus annually.\n\nThe oldest part of campus lies on the Red Cedar river's north bank. It includes Collegiate Gothic architecture, plentiful trees, and curving roads with few straight lines. The College built its first three buildings here, of which none survive. Other historic buildings north of the river include the president's official residence, Cowles House, and Beaumont Tower, a carillon clock tower marking the site of College Hall, the original classroom building. To the east lies Eustace–Cole Hall, America's first freestanding horticulture laboratory. Other landmarks include the bronze statue of former president John A. Hannah, the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, and the painted boulder known as \"The Rock\", a popular spot for theatre, tailgating, and candlelight vigils. On the campus's northwest corner is the University's hotel, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center. The university also has a museum, initiated in 1857. MSU Museum is one of the Midwest's oldest museums and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nThe campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II International Style buildings, and is characterized by sparser foliage, relatively straight roadways, and many parking lots. The \"2020 Vision\" Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with parking ramps and green space, but these plans will take many years to reach fruition. As part of the master plan, the University erected a new bronze statue of \"The Spartan\" in 2005 to be placed at the intersection of Chestnut and Kalamazoo, just south of the Red Cedar River. This replica replaced the original modernist terra cotta statue, which can still be seen inside Spartan Stadium. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the Cyclotron, the College of Law, and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB).\n\nThis part of campus is home to the MSU Horticulture Gardens and the adjoining 4-H Children's Garden. South of the gardens lie the Canadian National and CSX railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland. The university's agricultural facilities include the Horse, Dairy Cattle, Beef Cattle, Sheep, and Poultry Teaching and Research Farms, as well as the Air Quality Control Lab and the Diagnostics Center for Population and Animal Health.\n\nThe Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4-star hotel and a business-friendly conference center. It is on the northwest corner of Michigan State University's campus, across from the Brody Complex, on Harrison Road just south of Michigan Avenue. The hotel's 160 rooms and suites can accommodate anyone staying in East Lansing for a business conference, sporting event or an on-campus visit. Besides a lodging facility, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center is a \"learning laboratory for the 300–400 students each year that are enrolled in The School of Hospitality Business and other majors.\" The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center strives to facilitate education by hosting conferences and seminars.\n\nMSU ran a small campus at Dubai Knowledge Village, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It first offered only one program, a master's program in human resources and labor relations. In 2011, it added a master's program in Public Health.\n\nPreviously, MSU established an education center in Dubai that offered six undergraduate programs, thereby becoming the first American university with a presence in Dubai International Academic City. The University attracted 100 students in 2007, its first year, but the school was unable to achieve the 100–150 new students per year needed for the program to be viable, and in 2010 MSU closed the program and the campus.\n\nMichigan State offers a rolling admissions system, with an early admission deadline in October. MSU is considered \"more selective\" by the U.S. News & World Report. Its admissions are difficult; for 2009's entering class, the 25th/75th percentiles for the SAT were 1030 and 1240 out of 1600, and its 25th/75th percentiles on the ACT were 23 and 27 out of 36.\n\nFor Fall 2015 MSU received over 35,300 freshman applications, a record for the school.\n\nMSU has the seventh largest student body in the U.S. For the fiscal year of 2015–16, the Office of the Registrar conferred 12,322 degrees. The student body is 55% female and 45% male. While 89% of students come from all 83 counties in the State of Michigan, also represented are all 50 states in the U.S. and about 130 other countries.\n\nIn Fall 2015, 7,568 international students enrolled at MSU, with the top five countries being China (4,700), South Korea (483), India (342), Saudi Arabia (222) and Taiwan (187). According to a Brookings Institution report analyzing foreign student visa approvals from 2008-2012, MSU has the highest enrollment of Chinese international students in the United States, with roughly 4,700 Chinese citizens enrolled during the period of the study. A Chinese-language tourism promotion video, released in 2014 by the Greater Lansing Convention & Visitors Bureau, claimed that MSU's Chinese student population had climbed to \"more than 6,000 people.\"\n\nMSU has about 4,500 faculty and 6,000 staff members, and a student/faculty ratio of 19:1. Listed as a Public Ivy, Michigan State is a member of the Association of American Universities. Michigan State University Ombudsman is the longest continually operating ombudsman office at a college or university in the country. MSU's study abroad program is the largest of any single-campus university in the United States with 2,461 students studying abroad in 2004–2005 in over 60 countries on all continents, including Antarctica.\n\nMSU has six faculty members elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS): Martin Bukovac (1983), James Dye (1989), Pamela Fraker (2007), Richard Lenski (2006), Michael Thomashow (2003), and James Tiedje (2003).\n\nIn its 2016–17 rankings, \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" ranked MSU 21st in public schools, 41st overall in the United States, and 101st in the world. Michigan State ranks 101–150 in the world in 2016, according to the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\". The 2018 \"QS World University Rankings\" placed it at 149th internationally. In its 2017 edition, \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked it as tied for the 33rd-best public university in the United States, tied for 82nd nationally and 78th globally.\n\nThe university has over 200 academic programs. \"U.S. News\" ranked MSU's graduate-level programs in elementary teacher's education, secondary teacher's education, industrial and organizational psychology, and nuclear physics first in the nation for 2016. \"U.S. News\" also ranks MSU third nationally for graduate education in African history and fourth nationally for graduate education in Educational Psychology.\n\nThe Eli Broad College of Business was ranked No. 42nd among undergraduate institutions nationally by \"Businessweek.\" Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates received job offers in 2014. The 2016 \"U.S. News\" ranked Michigan State's undergraduate supply chain management/logistics program in the Eli Broad College of Business 1st in the nation. In addition, the Eli Broad College of Business undergraduate accounting program is ranked 13th, the master's accounting program is ranked 15th, and the doctoral program is ranked 11th, according to the 2013 \"Public Accounting Report\"'s Annual Survey of Accounting Professors. The MBA program is ranked 19th in the U.S. by \"Forbes\" magazine.\n\nThe College of Communication Arts and Sciences was established in 1955 and was the first of its kind in the United States. The college's Media and Information Studies doctoral program was ranked No. 2 in 2007 by \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" in the category of mass communication. The communication doctoral program was ranked No. 4 in a separate category of communication in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\"'s 2005 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index, published in 2007. The college's faculty and alumni include eight Pulitzer Prize winners and a two-time Emmy Award winning recording mixer.\n\nOther programs of note include criminal justice, hospitality business, packaging, political science, dietetics and communications. The Sustainable Endowments Institute awarded Michigan State with an overall grade of \"B\" on the 2009 Campus Sustainability Survey, including \"A\"s in the categories of Administration, Transportation, Endowment Transparency, and Investment Policies.\n\nThe Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum is the university's contemporary art museum. Michigan State University Libraries comprise North America's 29th largest academic library system with over 4.9 million volumes and 6.7 million microforms.\n\nThe university has a long history of academic research, and in 2013–14 spent $528 million toward it. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid corn, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor G. Malcolm Trout invented the process for the homogenization of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug. Albert Fert, an Adjunct professor at MSU, was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Peter Grünberg.\n\nToday, Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a particle accelerator called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as the site for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The $730 million facility will attract top researchers from around the world to conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.\nIn 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element germanium, called Ge-60 In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of Brazil, broke ground on the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics & Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins. Since 1999, MSU has been part of a consortium called the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor, which aims to develop biotechnology research in the State of Michigan. Finally, the College of Communication Arts and Sciences' Quello Center researches issues of information and communication management.\n\nMichigan State University is a participant in the Big Ten Academic Alliance. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the Big Ten Conference. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014–2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed \"in-house\" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries. The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date. Course sharing, professional development programs, study abroad and international collaborations, and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.\n\nMSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) endowment started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate R.E. Olds helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000. There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.\n\nThis changed dramatically in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of fiscal year 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase in the size of the endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.\n\nMSU has over 200 academic programs offered by 17 degree-granting colleges.\n\nMSU has several residential colleges, based on the Oxbridge \"living-learning\" model. By putting classes in student dormitories, these colleges improve student access to faculty and facilities. MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College started in 1965 with an interdisciplinary curriculum. MSU closed Morrill College in 1979, but today the university has three residential colleges, including the recent opening of the Residential College in Arts & Humanities (RCAH) located in Snyder and Phillips halls.\n\nEstablished in 1967, James Madison College is a smaller component residential college featuring multidisciplinary programs in the social sciences, founded on a model of liberal education. James Madison College is housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are tenure track faculty. James Madison College has about 1150 students total, with each freshman class containing about 320 students. Each of Madison's four majors—Social Relations and Policy, International Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Comparative Cultures and Politics—requires two years of foreign language and one semester of \"field experience\" in an internship or study abroad program. Although Madison students make up about 4% of MSU graduates, they represent around 35% of the MSU's Phi Beta Kappa members.\n\nAlso established in 1967, Lyman Briggs College teaches math and science within social, historical and philosophical contexts. Many Lyman Briggs students intend to pursue careers in medicine, but the school supports over 30 coordinate majors, from human biology to computer sciences. Lyman Briggs is one of the few colleges that lets undergraduates teach as \"Learning Assistants.\"\n\nMSU's newest residential college is the Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though all the students will graduate with the same degree, MSU encourages students in the college to get a second degree or specialization. The university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College.\nThe Michigan State University College of Law is an independent, non-profit corporation affiliated with the public institution. Founded in Detroit in 1891 as the Detroit College of Law, the law school moved to East Lansing in 1995 becoming affiliated with the university. Students attending MSU College of Law come from 42 states and 13 countries. The law school publishes the Michigan State Law Review, the Michigan State Journal of International Law, the Journal of Medicine Law, and the Journal of Business & Securities Law. The College of Law is the home of the Geoffrey Fieger Trial Practice Institute, the first trial practice institute in the United States. In October 2018, MSU's Board of Trustees voted to fully integrate the College of Law into the university, thereby converting it from a private to a public law school. The integration is expected to take a year and a half to finalize.\n\nThe Eli Broad College of Business has programs in accounting, information systems, finance, general management, human resource management, marketing, supply chain management, and hospitality business. The school has 2,066 admitted undergraduate students and 817 graduate students. The Eli Broad Graduate School of Management, which \"Businessweek\" magazine in 2012 ranked 35th in the nation and 14th among public institutions, offers three MBA programs, as well as joint degrees with the College of Law. The opening of the Eugene C. Eppley Center for Graduate Studies in Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management brought the first program in the United States to offer a Master of Business Administration degree in Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management to MSU.\n\nThe Michigan State University College of Nursing grants B.S.N., M.S.N., and PhD degrees.\nThe Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine was the world's first publicly funded college of osteopathic medicine. It has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – more than two-thirds of the college's graduates remain to practice in Michigan. In 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in southeast Michigan, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician shortage.\n\nAccording to \"U.S. News & World Report\"'s 2016 rankings, the College of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O. degree) ranked tied for 12th among U.S. medical schools for primary care, and the College of Human Medicine (MD degree) was ranked 70th among the U.S. medical schools for primary care.\n\nThe College of Human Medicine graduates students with a Doctor of Medicine (M.D. degree) and is split into seven distinct campuses located in East Lansing, Kalamazoo, Flint, Saginaw, Marquette, Traverse City and Grand Rapids. Each campus is affiliated with local hospitals and other medical facilities professionals in the area. For example, the Lansing campus includes Sparrow Hospital and McLaren–Greater Lansing Hospital. The College of Human Medicine has recently gained attention for its expansion into the Grand Rapids area, with the new Secchia Center completed in the Fall of 2010, that is expected to fuel the growing medical industry in that region.\n\nThough Michigan State has offered courses in veterinary science since its founding, the College of Veterinary Medicine was not formally established as a four-year, degree-granting program until 1910. In 2011, the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine was ranked No. 9 in the nation. The college has over of office, teaching, and research space, as well as a veterinary teaching hospital.\n\nIn recent years, MSU's music program has grown substantially. Music major enrollment increased more than 97% between 1991 and 2004. In early 2007, this growth led the university board of trustees to spin the music program off into its own college unit: The MSU College of Music. The new college faces many new challenges, such as working with limited space and funding. Nevertheless, MSU's music college plans on continued success, placing an annual average of 25 graduate students in tenure stream university positions.\n\nThe College of Education at Michigan State University offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in several fields, including counseling, educational psychology, special education, teacher education and kinesiology. The graduate school has several programs ranked in the top five in the country by \"U.S. News & World Report\" for 2016: elementary teacher education (1st), secondary teacher education (1st), curriculum and instruction (3rd), educational psychology (4th), and higher education administration (4th). The College of Education is housed in Erickson Hall. \n\nFounded in 1956, the MSU Honors College provides individualized curricula to MSU's top undergraduate students. Though the college offers no majors of its own, it has its own dean and academic advisers to help Honors students with their educational pursuits.\nHigh school students starting at MSU may join the Honors College if they are in the top 5% of their high school graduating class and have an ACT score of at least 30 or an SAT total score of at least 1360. Students can also be admitted after their first semester, generally if they're in the top 10% of their College in GPA. Once admitted, students must maintain a 3.20 GPA and complete eight approved honors courses to graduate with Honors College designation on their degree. If membership is relinquished, it cannot be reclaimed.\n\nAfter three years of planning, The College of Engineering launched the first stages of its Residential Experience for Spartan Engineering, formally known as the Residential Option for Scientists and Engineers (ROSES), the new program is in Wilson Hall after being housed in Bailey Hall for a number of years. The Residential program essentially combines with a brand new academic component, Cornerstone Engineering, where freshman engineering students not only get an overview of the engineering field(s) but get a hands-on experience along with it. Global Engineering is a new subject that is of interest for not only the Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs but the entire College of Engineering at MSU. Engineering in today's society has shown to have a monumental impact on the global economy due to advancements in education, interdependence on economics with infrastructure, computers, transportation, technology and other manufactured goods as well as Michigan State University's study-abroad program being ranked No. 1 in the nation, allowing for students to experience education and learn cultures in hundreds of countries. The newly established Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs for College of Engineering have started programs abroad for more courses in engineering including Study abroad seminars. In 2014, the Detroit Free Press reported on a MSU study which ranked engineering among the top 20 college degrees with the highest starting salaries.\n\nMSU offers a 30 credit graduate program for Masters in Educational Technology in 3 different formats; completely online, hybrid in East Lansing, Michigan, or overseas.\n\nMichigan State's NCAA Division I-A program offers 12 varsity sports for men and 13 for women. Since their teams are called the Spartans, MSU's mascot is a Spartan warrior named Sparty. The university participates in the Big Ten Conference in all varsity sports, including the new Big Ten hockey conference, featuring 6 teams. The current athletic director is Mark Hollis, who was promoted to the position on January 1, 2008. Hollis replaced Ron Mason, who served as head hockey coach from 1979 to 2002, retiring with a record total of 924 wins, and a 635–270–69 record at MSU.\n\nIn 1888 Michigan State University (then known as Michigan Agricultural College) along with Olivet, Albion and Hillsdale Colleges was a founding member of the nation's oldest athletic conference, the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA). MAC left the conference in 1907.\n\nFootball has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896. MSU football teams won the Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, 1988, and 2014. They won national championships in 1951, 1952, 1955, 1957, 1965 and 1966. The Spartans accounted for four of the top eight selections in the 1967 NFL Draft, the only time a college football program has accomplished such a feat.\n\nToday, the football team competes in Spartan Stadium, a renovated 75,005 seat football stadium near the center of campus. The current coach is Mark Dantonio, who was hired on November 27, 2006. He led the team in its first season to a 7–6 record. In 2010, the Spartans finished 11–2 (7–1 in conference play) and were Co-Big Ten Champion along with Wisconsin and Ohio State. In 2011, the Spartans finished 1st in the Legends Division of the Big Ten with a 7–1 (11–3) conference record, logging back-to-back 11 win seasons for the first time in Spartan history. In 2014, MSU achieved an 11–2 overall record with losses only to the University of Oregon Ducks and The Ohio State Buckeyes, and ended the season ranked #5.\n\nMSU's traditional archrival is the University of Michigan, against whom they compete annually for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Their overall record against the Wolverines currently stands at 32–67–5 and 23–34–2 since 1953 when the Paul Bunyan Trophy was established and MSU joined the Big Ten Conference.\nMSU's men's basketball team has won the National Championship twice: in 1979 and again in 2000. In 1979, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, along with Greg Kelser and Jay Vincent led MSU to a 75–64 win against the Larry Bird-led Indiana State Sycamores in the Championship game. In 2000, three players from Flint, Morris Peterson, Charlie Bell and Mateen Cleaves, led the team to its second national title. Dubbed the \"Flintstones\", they were the key to the Spartans' victory over Florida in the Championship game. In 2009 the Spartans made it to the National Championship game before losing 89–72 to North Carolina.\n\nThe basketball team plays at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center under head coach Tom Izzo, who has a 574–225 record as of August 2018 (.718 winning percentage). The student spirit section at Breslin is called the Izzone. Izzo's coaching has helped the team make seven Final Fours since 1999, winning the title in 2000, and eighteen consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (beginning in 1998).\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Michigan State and Kentucky played in the \"Basketbowl\", in which a record crowd of 78,129 watched the game in Detroit's Ford Field. Kentucky won 79–74.\n\nThe Michigan State University men's ice hockey team started in 1924, though it has been a varsity sport only since 1950. The team has since won national titles in 1966, 1986 and 2007. The Spartans came close to repeating the national title in 1987, but lost the championship game to the University of North Dakota. They play at MSU's Munn Ice Arena. Former head coach Ron Mason is college hockey's winningest coach with 924 wins total and 635 at MSU. The current head coach is Tom Anastos. The MSU men's ice hockey team competes in the Big Ten conference. They formerly competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Michigan State leads the CCHA in all-time wins, is second in CCHA Conference championships with 7, and is first in CCHA Tournament Championships with 11. Along with the University of Michigan (U-M) and the Ohio State University, it was one of three Big Ten schools in the CCHA. As with other sports, the hockey rivalry between MSU and U-M is a fierce one, and on October 6, 2001, MSU faced U-M in the Cold War, during which a world record crowd of 74,554 packed Spartan Stadium to watch the game end in a 3–3 tie.\nIn the 2006–2007 season, the Men's Ice Hockey team defeated Boston College for its third NCAA hockey championship.\n\nBetween World War I and World War II, Michigan State College competed in the Central Collegiate Conference, winning titles in 1926–1929, 1932, 1933 and 1935. Michigan State also experienced success in the IC4A, at New York's Van Cortlandt Park, winning 15 team titles (1933–1937, 1949, 1953, 1956–1960, 1962, 1963 and 1968). Since entering the Big Ten in 1950, Michigan State has won 14 men's team titles (1951–1953, 1955–1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1970 and 1971). Michigan State hosted the inaugural NCAA cross country championships in 1938 and every year thereafter through 1964 (there was no championship in 1943). The Spartans won NCAA championships in 1939, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1955, 1956, 1958 and 1959.\n\nMSU Spartan Wrestling won their only team NCAA Championship in 1967. The current Spartans Head coach is Roger Chandler in his 2nd season. The team competes on campus at the Jenison Field House. Spartan Wrestling has over 50 Big Ten Conference Champions, over 100 All-Americans, and 11 individual wrestlers have NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships. Notable former Spartan wrestlers include Rashad Evans and Gray Maynard.\n\nEast Lansing is very much a college town, with 60.2% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah's push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.\nIn 2014 there were approximately 50,085 students, 38,786 undergraduate and 11,299 graduate and professional. The students are from all 50 states and 130 countries around the world.\n\nWith over 3,000 members, Michigan State University's Greek Community is one of the largest in the US. Started in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, and Alpha Phi sorority; the MSU Greek system now consists of 55 Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils: National Panhellenic Conference, North American Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council is made up of 9 organizations, 5 Fraternities and 4 Sororities, that were founded on Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU's). The Interfraternity Council and the Women's Panhellenic Council are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many philanthropy events and community fundraisers. For example, in April 2011 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $260,000 for the American Cancer Society, and $5,000 for each of these charities: Big Brothers Big Sisters, The Listening Ear and previous charities include: the Make-a-Wish Foundation (MSU Chapter), Share Laura's Hope, The Mary Beth Knox Scholarship, and the Special Olympics, in which fraternity and sorority members get to help each other participate.\n\nThe Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the all-university undergraduate student government of Michigan State University. It is unusual amongst university student governments for its decentralized bicameral structure, and the relatively non-existent influence of the Greek system. The structure has since changed to a single General Assembly as part of reorganization in the late 2000s. ASMSU representatives are nonpartisan and many are elected in noncompetitive races. Their mission is to enhance the individual and collective student experience through education, empowerment, and advocacy by education to the needs and interest of students. Some services they offer include: free blue books, low cost copies and printing, free yearbooks, interest free loans, funding for student organizations, free legal consultation, and iClicker and graphing calculator rentals.\n\nStudents pay $20 per semester to fund the functions of the ASMSU, including stipends for the organization's officers and activities throughout the year. Some students have criticized ASMSU for not having enough electoral participation to gain a student mandate. Turnout since 2001 has hovered between 3 and 17 percent, with the 2006 election bringing out 8% of the undergraduate student body.\n\nStudent-run organizations beyond student government also have a large impact on the East Lansing/Michigan State University community. Student Organizations are registered through the Department of Student Life, which currently has a registry of over 800 student organizations.\n\nThe Eli Broad College of Business includes 27 student organizations of primary interest to business students. The three largest organizations are the Finance Association (FA), the Accounting Student Association (ASA), and the Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA). The SCMA is the host of the university's largest major specific career fair. The fair attracts over 100 companies and over 400 students each year.\n\nActivists have played a significant role in MSU history. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests helped create co-ed residence halls, and blocked the routing of Interstate 496 through campus. In the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the University to divest the stocks of companies doing business in apartheid South Africa from its endowment portfolio, such as Coca-Cola. MSU has many student groups focused on political change. Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union and the Council of Graduate Students. Michigan State also has a variety of partisan groups ranging from liberal to conservative, including the College Republicans, the College Democrats and several third party organizations. Other partisan activist groups include Young Americans for Freedom and Young Americans for Liberty on the right; Young Democratic Socialists, Students for Economic Justice, Young Communist League and \"MEChA\" on the left. Given MSU's proximity to the Michigan state capital of Lansing, many politically inclined Spartans intern for state representatives.\n\nThe MSU Office of Sustainability works with the University Committee for a Sustainable Campus to \"foster a collaborative learning culture that leads the community to heightened awareness of its environmental impact.\" The University is a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the world's first greenhouse gas emission registry, and boasts the lowest electrical consumption per square foot among Big Ten universities. The University has set a goal of reducing energy use by 15%, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, reducing landfill waste by 30% by 2015.\n\nThe university has also pledged to meet LEED-certification standards for all new construction. In July 2009, the University completed construction of a $13.3 million recycling center, and hopes to double their 2008 recycling rate of 14% by 2010.\nThe construction of Brody Hall, a residence hall of Michigan State University Housing, was completed in August 2011 and qualified for LEED Silver certification because the facility includes a rain water collection tank used for restroom fixtures, a white PVC roof, meters that will monitor utilities to make sure they are used efficiently, and the use of recycled matter and local sources for building materials.\n\nThe Environmental Steward's program support's president Simon's \"Boldness by Design\" strategic vision to transform environmental stewardship on campus within the seven-year time frame. Environmental stewards promote environmental changes among co-workers and peers, be points of contact for their department for environment-related concerns, and be liaisons between the Be Spartan Green Team and buildings.\n\nThe Student Organic Farm is a student-run, four-season farm, which teaches the principals of organic farming and through a certificate program and community-supported agriculture (CSA) on ten acres on the MSU campus.\nThe certificate program consists of year-round crop production, course work in organic farming, practical training and management, and an off-site internship requirement.\n\nMSU has a variety of campus media outlets. The student-run newspaper is \"The State News\" and free copies are available online or at East Lansing newsstands. The paper prints 28,500 copies from Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and 15,000 copies Monday through Friday during the summer. The paper is not published on weekends, holidays, or semester breaks, but is continually updated online at statenews.com. The campus yearbook is called the \"Red Cedar Log\". \"Red Cedar Review\", Michigan State University's premier literary digest for over forty years, is the longest running undergraduate-run literary journal in the United States. It is published annually by the Michigan State University Press.\n\nMSU also publishes a student-run magazine during the academic year called Ing Magazine. Created in 2007 by MSU alumnus Adam Grant, the publication is released at the beginning of each month and publishes 7 issues each school year. MSU also publishes a student-run fashion and lifestyle magazine called VIM Magazine once a semester.\n\nElectronic media include three radio stations and one public television station, as well as student-produced television shows. MSU's Public Broadcasting Service affiliate, WKAR-TV, the station is the second-oldest educational television station in the United States, and the oldest east of the Mississippi River. Besides broadcasting PBS shows, WKAR-TV produces its own local programming, such as a high school quiz bowl show called \"QuizBusters\". In addition, MSU has three radio stations; WKAR-AM plays National Public Radio's talk radio programming, whereas WKAR-FM focuses mostly on classical music programming. Michigan State's student-run radio station, WDBM, broadcasts mostly alternative music during weekdays and electric music programming nights and weekends.\n\nLou Anna Simon was president of the University from January 1, 2005, until January 24, 2018, when she resigned in the wake of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal. An interim successor was not immediately named.\n\nMSU's governing board, the Board of Trustees, receives its mandate from the Michigan Constitution as MSU is a state-owned school. The constitution allows for eight trustees who are elected by statewide referendum every two years. Trustees have eight-year terms, with two of the eight elected every other year.\n\nImportant College leaders in the 19th century include John C. Holmes, who kept the Agriculture School from being a part of the University of Michigan and is widely credited with being the prime mover for the school's founding; Joseph R. Williams, the first president; and Theophilus C. Abbot, the third president who stabilized the College after the Civil War. Also of importance was botany professor William J. Beal, an early plant (hybrid corn) geneticist who championed the laboratory teaching method. Another distinguished faculty member of the era was the alumnus/professor Liberty Hyde Bailey. Bailey was the first to raise the study of horticulture to a science, paralleling botany, which earned him the title of \"Father of American Horticulture\". William L. Carpenter, a jurist who was elected to the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan in 1894, and member of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1902 until 1904. Other famous 19th-century graduates include Ray Stannard Baker, a famed \"muckraker\" journalist and Pulitzer Prize winning biographer; Minakata Kumagusu, a renowned environmental scientist; William Chandler Bagley, a pioneering education reformer; and Lyman J. Briggs, 1893 graduate and renowned engineer and physicist who was the chairman of the U.S. Uranium Committee before the Second World War.\nAs of fall 2015, there were about 541,000 living MSU alumni worldwide. Notable politicians and public servants from MSU include former Michigan governors James Blanchard and John Engler, U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow, Tim Johnson, and Spencer Abraham, (who also served as Secretary of Energy),; U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Donna Hrinak, Prime Minister of South Korea Lee Wan-koo, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, former Jordan prime minister Adnan Badran, and Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court Wallace B. Jefferson.\n\nTrial lawyer Geoffrey Feiger, billionaire philanthropists Tom Gores, Andrew Beal and Eli Broad,\nPulitzer Prize-winning novelist Richard Ford, Teamsters president James P. Hoffa, and Quicken Loans founder and billionaire Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, are all also MSU alums.\n\nAlumni in Hollywood include actors such as James Caan, Anthony Heald, Robert Urich and William Fawcett; comedian Dick Martin, comedian Jackie Martling, film directors Michael Cimino and Sam Raimi, and film editor Bob Murawski, as well as screenwriter David Magee Puerto Rican comedian Sunshine Logroño (who has played the occasional Hollywood movie) was a graduate student at MSU.\n\nComposer Dika Newlin received her undergraduate degree from MSU, while lyricist, theatrical director and clinical psychologist Jacques Levy earned a doctorate in psychology. The university has also produced such jazz luminaries as pianist Henry Butler, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, and keyboardist/composer-arranger Clare Fischer.\n\nJournalists include NBC reporter Chris Hansen, AP White House correspondent Nedra Pickler and NPR Washington correspondent Don Gonyea. Novelist Michael Kimball graduated in 1990. Novelist and true crime author R.

{"id": "3997515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3997515", "title": "MicroMUSE", "text": "MicroMUSE\n\nMicroMUSE is a MUD started in 1990. It is based on the TinyMUSE system, which allows members to interact in a virtual environment called Cyberion City, as well as to create objects and modify their environment. MicroMUSE was conceived as an environment to allow people in far-flung locations to interact with each other, particularly college students with Internet access. A core group of users remain active today.\n\nMicroMUSE was founded as MicroMUSH by the user known as \"Jin\" in the summer of 1990. Based upon TinyMUSH, MicroMUSH was centered around Cyberion City, a space station orbiting earth of the 24th century. The initial MicroMUSH database was largely due to the efforts of Jin and the Wizards who went by the online aliases \"Trout_Complex\", \"Coyote\", \"Opera_Ghost\", \"Snooze\", \"Wai\", \"Star\" and \"Mama.Bear\". Larry \"Leet\" Foard and \"Bard\" (later known as \"Michael\") were, along with Jin, the primary programmers.\n\nThe focus, at the time, primarily was communication and creativity. Users were encouraged to build \"objects\" and were given extensive leeway to create and communicate with other members. At times, it could be compared to a high-tech version of the wild west.\n\nTypical problems of growth and success, over time, led to issues with computing resources. In April 1991, MicroMUSH moved to MIT. The name was officially changed to MicroMUSE during this same time period.\n\nThrough 1992, the focus of MicroMUSE continued to change, though not very noticeably to existing users. New users were given a smaller \"quota\" of object which they could build. The game was extremely popular at this point. One could log in at almost any time of day, and find at least thirty active people.\n\nBy the end of 1993, the space engine, which had been developed within the original theme of MicroMUSE, was moved out of MicroMUSE. The focus was shifting; it became less about creativity and communication between random people across the internet, and more about bringing in primary-school children. The \"quota\" of objects was reduced, for all players, from as much as 100, down to 10 \"objects\". The game became more-heavily censored, as some of the leadership began to push a K-12-friendly environment throughout the game. Long-time users who did not like the change, and spoke out against it, were often banned from the game altogether.\n\nBy the end of 1994, any semblance of what MicroMUSE had been was almost gone. A charter and bylaws were created, which officially changed the focus of MicroMUSE. The second developer had left the project, and Frnkzk became the head developer of MicroMUSE. The guidance of a \"mentor\" was required for anyone not pre-screened by the administration. By this point, the focus was solely education.\n\nThe changes in focus and game policies, along with changing technology, caused a gradual decline in the number of core members using MicroMUSE.\n\nAs the game changed drastically, in 1993 and 1994, very disorganized counter-movement began. There was no leader, and there were varying tactics.\n\nThere were attacks on MicroMUSE, which would cause it to crash, by exploiting poorly written routines. Generally, these would either cause a buffer-overflow, or would cause an infinite loop. The attacks were usually carried out by users who had been removed from the game for violating the new policies that had gone into effect after they began playing.\n\nMicroMUSE was using a highly customized version of TinyMUSE version 1.7b4. Many of these problems were fixed in version 1.8a4, and in later versions, but MicroMUSE suffered difficultly back-porting these changes into their version of the game.\n\nWith the eventual creation of new worlds using TinyMUSE, the attacks on MicroMUSE gradually ceased.\n\nAlternative TinyMUSE installations began to appear, based on the released version 1.8a4, which led to an argument over who \"owned\" TinyMUSE. At least one MicroMUSE administrator had fought against allowing other sites to use TinyMUSE as their codebase, and a small power-struggle took place between that administrator (Moulton) and the second primary developer (shkoo), who had taken over from the original primary developer (Jin). The dispute was finally settled, and the newer TinyMUSE version 1.8a4 was released to the public.\n\nBy the end of 1993, computer power was becoming much cheaper. One of the first alternatives, for instance, was run on an AMD 486/dx4-120, \"over-clocked\" to 160Mhz, with four megabytes of RAM.\n\nResponsibility for the official development of TinyMUSE was never handed back to MicroMUSE.\n\nToday's version of MicroMUSE Cyberion's residents are scholars who lived in a unique community dedicated to learning, teaching, and the preservation of knowledge. Dr. Barry Kort was instrumental in setting up MicroMUSE in its modern form, with assistance from Kevin Kane (\"Frnkzk\").\n\nMicroMUSE / MuseNet received the 1996 National Information Infrastructure NII Award for pioneering innovations in Children's Education via the Internet.\n\nThe MicroMUSE Charter and Bylaws (1994) define the history, goals and purposes of MicroMUSE.\n\n"}

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 19, 2006. In this episode, Lois discovers that Chris' school has removed the sex education program due to budget cuts and decides to bring the class back by becoming the teacher. Unfortunately, she gets fired a short time later for teaching the students about safe sex rather than abstinence. Meanwhile, Stewie attempts to find and kill the Tooth Fairy after being told \"horror\" stories by Brian.\n\nThe episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by James Purdum. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore, Mindy Cohn, Gary Cole, Taylor Cole, Lauren Conrad, David Cross, Margaret Easley, Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, Kevin Michael Richardson, André Sogliuzzo and Crawford Wilson, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\n\nAs Lois finds Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She is replaced by a reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.\n\nPeter, truly believing the anti-sex propaganda Meg brings home, starts wearing a chastity belt and refuses to have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in \"ear sex\" (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex \"in the eyes of the Lord.\" This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only as long as it is practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with Cleveland poking out the window and saying the line \"Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!\".\n\nMany scenes from the original episode were seen as vulgar and were removed from the television broadcast. One of the scenes removed was from the beginning of the episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching \"Genital Hospital\", a reference to the television show \"General Hospital\". The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as \"retarded friend\" (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird-tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the \"choose your own ending\" text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actors Drew Barrymore, Mindy Cohn, Gary Cole, Taylor Cole, Lauren Conrad, David Cross, Margaret Easley, Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, Kevin Michael Richardson, André Sogliuzzo and Crawford Wilson guest star in the episode. Recurring guest voices include Lori Alan, Alex Breckenridge, Steve Callaghan, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, John Viener, and Adam West, who has a role of an exaggerated version of himself.\n\nAs Lois is informed the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims \"Oh, no!\", a cut-a-way scene then begins of a sports car driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to \"Knight Rider\". When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", Starscream (from \"The Transformers\") and Man-E-Faces, all of which are fictional characters for television programs. When Peter is watching television, he is watching \"\"; the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show. When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused. The scene cuts to Michael Jackson in his childhood form eating a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats, saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a bust of William Shakespeare and a Rainbow Brite doll to demonstrate sexual intercourse. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie \"Airplane!\". While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that \"\" is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's bulimia, he mentions the death of singer Karen Carpenter, who died from anorexia in 1983. When Stewie thinks that Brian is the Tooth Fairy, Brian substantiates his identity by telling Stewie he has a picture of Chris Noth in his wallet, known for his role on \"Law & Order\".\n\nIn a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18–49 demographic, tying with \"The Simpsons\", while still winning over \"American Dad!\".\n\nAlthough the episode received little positive reception, it was given a positive review by \"IGN\"s Dan Iverson, who noted that its plot had \"great satire of the issue of sex education vs. abstinence\". He also stated that \"the random flashback jokes are often what are most memorable about each episode\". He gave the episode a rating of 7.8 out of 10. In his review of \"Family Guy\", volume 5, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode \"a smart jab at the conservative Christian approach to sex education\", and stated that \"the effect it has on Meg, as well as Peter, is great\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2328615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328615", "title": "Serge Lifar", "text": "Serge Lifar\n\nSerge Lifar (, \"Serhіy Mуkhailovуch Lуfar\"; , \"Sergey Mikhaylovich Lifar\") (, Kiev, Russian Empire15 December 1986, Lausanne, Switzerland) was a French ballet dancer and choreographer of Ukrainian origin, famous as one of the greatest male ballet dancers of the 20th century. Not only a dancer, Lifar was also a choreographer, director, writer, theoretician about dance, and collector.\n\nAs ballet master of the Paris Opera from 1930 to 1944, and from 1947 to 1958, he devoted himself to the restoration of the technical level of the Paris Opera Ballet, returning it to its place as one of the best companies in the world.\n\nLifar was born in Kiev, Russian Empire. His year of birth is officially shown as 1904 (as on a 2004 Ukrainian stamp commemorating his centenary). \nHe was the pupil of Bronislava Nijinska in her ballet studio «School of Movement» in Kiev.\n\nIn 1921 he left the Soviet Union and was noticed by Serge Diaghilev, who sent him to Turin in order to improve his technique with Enrico Cecchetti.\n\nHe made his debut at the Ballets Russes in 1923, where he became the principal dancer in 1925. Lifar was considered the successor to Nijinsky in the Ballets Russes. He was cast at the age of 21 opposite Tamara Karsavina in Nijinska's \"Roméo et Juliette\" (1926) ; Karsavina was twice his age. He originated leading roles in three Balanchine ballets for the Ballet Russes, including \"La Chatte\" (1927), with a score by French composer Henri Sauguet and based on an Aesop fable, which featured Lifar's famous entrance in a 'chariot' formed by his male companions; \"Apollon Musagète\" (1928) with a score by Stravinsky depicting the birth of the Greek God Apollo and his encounter with the three muses, Calliope, Polyhymnia, and Terpsichore; and \"Le Fils prodigue\" (\"The Prodigal Son\") (1929), with a score by Prokofiev, the last great ballet of the Diaghilev era.\n\nAt the death of Diaghilev in 1929, Lifar at the age of 24 was invited by Jacques Rouché to take over the directorship of the Paris Opéra Ballet, which had fallen into decline in the late 19th century. Lifar gave the company a new strength and purpose, initiating the rebirth of ballet in France, and began to create the first of many ballets for that company. These were immediately successful, such as \"Les Créatures de Prométhée\" (1929), a personal version of \"Le Spectre de la rose\" (1931); and \"L'Après-midi d'un faune\" (1935); \"Icare\" (1935), with costumes and decor by Picasso; \"Istar\" (1941); and \"Suite en Blanc\" (1943), which he qualified as \"Neoclassical ballet\".\n\nAs part of his effort to revitalize dance, Lifar thought the basic principles of ballet—specifically the five positions of the feet—denied mobility for the dancer. He codified two additional positions, known as the sixth and seventh positions, with the feet turned in, not out like the first five positions. The sixth and seventh positions were not Lifar's inventions, but revivals of positions that already existed in the eighteenth century, when there were ten positions of the feet in classical ballet; and their use is limited to Lifar's choreographies.\n\nDuring his three decades as director of the Paris Opéra Ballet, Lifar led the company through the turbulent times of World War II and the German occupation of France. Lifar was a collaborationist under the occupation {Franko, “Serge Lifar and the Question of Collaboration with the German Authorities under the Occupation of Paris (1940-1949),” in Dance Research 35/2 (Winter 2017): 218-257}. Lifar's postwar trial resulted in his condemnation as a collaborator and his suspension from the national stage. During his absence, Balanchine was hired to replace him.\nReturning to his former position, Lifar's presence was vehemently opposed by the Opera stagehands with the result that he was not allowed to appear on stage nor to consult with technical staff directly on any productions. Nevertheless, he brought the Paris Opéra Ballet to America and performed to full houses at the New York City Center despite protests. Audiences were enthusiastic and had great admiration for the company of dancers. He undoubtedly influenced Yvette Chauviré, Janine Charrat, and Roland Petit.\n\nIn 1958, Lifar was forced into retirement due to a strained relationship with the Opera management. A famous photograph was taken of Lifar leaving the Palais Garnier, after being forced to resign, looking somber and clasping the wings from the costume of Icarus that the character puts on in order to fly.\n\nOn 30 March 1958, at age 52, Lifar faced off against the 72-year-old impresario George de Cuevas in a duel in France. The duel was precipitated by an argument over changes to \"Black and White\" (\"Suite en blanc\"), a ballet by Lifar that was being presented by the Cuevas ballet company. Lifar had his face slapped in public after insisting that he retained the rights to \"Black and White\". Lifar sent his seconds to Cuevas who refused to extend an apology and chose to duel with swords. As duels had been \"technically outlawed\" in the 17th Century, the time and location of the duel were not disclosed to the public. The duel was conducted in front of 50 newspaper photographers and ended with the two combatants in tears and embraces in what \"The New York Times\" wrote \"what may well have been the most delicate encounter in the history of French dueling,\" with the sole injury being a cut on Lifar's right forearm in the seventh minute.\n\nIn 1977 the Paris Opéra Ballet devoted a full evening to his choreography.\n\nHe died in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1986, aged 81, and was buried in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.\n\nEditions Sauret published his memoirs, titled \"Les Mémoires d'Icare\", posthumously in 1993. The title references one of his greatest roles in the ballet \"Icare\". \"The story of the ballet is based on the ancient Greek myth of Icarus, whose father Daedalus builds him a pair of artificial wings. Disobeying his father's orders, Icarus flies too close to the sun, which melts the wax in his wings and causes him to plunge to his death.\"\n\nThe Serge Lifar Foundation was set up on 23 August 1989 by Lifar's companion, Countess Lillian Ahlefeldt-Laurvig. In 2012, jewels from the Countess' estate were auctioned at Sotheby's, with the proceeds going to the Foundation.\n\nIn the summer of 1994 on the stage of the National Ukraine Opera the First International Ballet Contest was held named after Serge Lifar. The Sixth Lifar International Ballet Competition was held in April 2006 and the seventh in Donetsk in March–April 2011.\n\n\nIn 1935 Lifar published his \"confessio fidei\" (\"confession of faith\") titled \"Le manifesto du chorégraphe\", proposing laws about the independence of choreography. Some of views include:\nHe also wrote a biography of Diaghilev titled \"Serge Diaghilev, His Life, His Work, His Legend: An Intimate Biography\" published by Putnam, London, 1940.\n\n\n\n"}

As one of the participants, Iran pledged to carry out the 2030 Agenda. In December 2016 the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran held a special ceremony announcing a national education initiative that was arranged by the UNESCO office in Iran to implement the educational objectives of this global program. The announcement created a stir among politicians and Marja' in the country.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, contains a set of seventeen Global Goals for 169 specific areas. This document was prepared by 193 United Nations (UN) Member States, as well as global civil society. The resolution is a broader agreement than the intergovernmental Post-2015 Development Agenda (successor to the Millennium Development Goals). Iran attended that conference, and pledged to carry out the 2030 Agenda.\n\nAccording to Al-Monitor, all 192 UN member states must \"ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning\" for everyone, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or age, by the year 2030. Based on this document, the Rouhani administration designed its own educational plan called \"The Islamic Republic of Iran 2030 National Education Act: Moving Toward Quality Education and Lifelong Learning, \"but it hadn't been approved by the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCRC). The 2030 Agenda is not the first educational initiative in Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad proposed \"The Fundamental Reform Document of Education (FRDE) in the Islamic Republic of Iran\" in 2011. Based on Islamic teachings, that initiative sought to \"foster monotheist individuals who have faith in God and believe in the Hereafter\".\n\nOn 7 May 2017 the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticized the 2030 National Education Act, saying: He also questioned why so-called international organization under the influence of big powers were making educational decisions for countries with differing histories and cultures.\n\nAccording to Iranian politician Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, the subject of Human rights in the 2030 Agenda is based on American concepts, which, he said, were far from the ideal of human generosity. He declared that Islam does emphasize gender justice and that there was no way to measure gender equality. He added that Iranians believe that any educational initiative must be based on Islamic tradition, because the Quran clearly speaks about education, but the 2030 Agenda strongly recommended that learning religious tradition and beliefs should not be emphasized in public education.\n\nOn 22 May 2017 Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi brought up the 2030 UNESCO document during a lecture for seminary students in the holy city of Qom. Describing many of the document's goals as \"beautiful and humane\", Makarem Shirazi said, meaning that it would \"consolidate the hegemonic system\". He also reiterated Rouhani's comments about adopting the document as long as it did not interfere with Iran's religion and culture and said, \"They [the Rouhani administration] have put this in writing and sent a letter, signed by three ministers, to the supreme leader and sent a copy of it to us as well. However, they seem to have forgotten that the creators of this document will only agree to those exceptions and conditions written below it that do not oppose the spirit of the document.\" He also stated that the 2030 Agenda was full of words that must be interpreted in their way; for example, the word \"family\" was used in the Agenda refers to all kinds of families, including same-sex couples. In addition, due to the meaning represented for violence, Basij (The Organization for Mobilization of the Oppressed, one of the five forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) and the IRGC have to be considered examples of violence.\n\nAccording to Hassan Rahimpour Azghadi, a member of the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, last year UNESCO said it was committed to the goal that the 2030 Agenda be implemented in all countries, although participation was apparently voluntary, and that it was up to each government to carry out this educational Agenda by the year 2030. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran) stated that implementation of the 2030 Agenda was not obligatory, but that if the Agenda was not carried out, the government would be found negligent. Some people believe the 2030 Agenda is an example of cultural JCPOA, which produces nothing except treading on the rights of the people. According to the contents of the 2030 Agenda, it finds similarities between Islamic views and Liberal or Neo-liberal views about children's rights and the education of women and family, but there are essential paradoxes. We do not say all the contents of the 2030 Agenda are contrary to Islam, definitely there are matters that correspond to Islamic tradition, so we don't disagree with all of this Agenda, but the problem is, why was this document (which goes against Islam in some articles) signed by neglecting the \"upper document\"? Due to the 2030 Agenda Sex education for children is their right, but teaching sexual abstinence and modesty is treading on their rights. Based on the 2030 Agenda we have to answer to western educators about how the Agenda is being implemented in our schools. In signing the document, we had agreed that sex education for children guarantees the health of the family and that homosexuality is one of the basic rights of humans.

Tax resistance is a form of direct action and, if in violation of the tax regulations, also a form of civil disobedience.\n\nExamples of tax resistance campaigns include those advocating home rule, such as the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi, and those promoting women's suffrage, such as the Women's Tax Resistance League. War tax resistance is the refusal to pay some or all taxes that pay for war, and may be practiced by conscientious objectors, pacifists, or those protesting against a particular war.\n\nTax resisters are distinct from \"tax protesters,\" who deny that the legal obligation to pay taxes exists or applies to them. Tax resisters may accept that some law commands them to pay taxes but they still choose to resist taxation.\n\nThe earliest and most widespread forms of taxation were the corvée and tithe, both of which can be traced back to the beginning of civilization. The corvée was state-imposed forced labour on peasants too poor to pay other forms of taxation (\"labour\" in ancient Egyptian is a synonym for taxes). Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the \"super-rich\", but in the later period, the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.\n\nBecause some believe taxation is oppressive, governments have always struggled with tax noncompliance and resistance. Indeed, it has been suggested that tax resistance played a significant role in the collapse of several empires, including the Egyptian, Roman, Spanish, and Aztec.\n\nReports of collective tax refusal include Zealots resisting the Roman poll tax during the 1st century AD, culminating in the First Jewish–Roman War. Other historic events that originated as tax revolts include the Magna Carta, the American Revolution and the French Revolution.\n\nWar tax resisters often highlight the relationship between income tax and war. In Britain income tax was introduced in 1799, to pay for weapons and equipment in preparation for the Napoleonic wars, whilst the US federal government imposed their first income tax in the Revenue Act of 1861 to help pay for the American Civil War.\n\n come from a wide range of backgrounds with diverse ideologies and aims. For example, Henry David Thoreau and William Lloyd Garrison drew inspiration from the American Revolution and the stubborn pacifism of the Quakers. Some tax resisters refuse to pay tax because their conscience will not allow them to fund war, whilst others resist tax as part of a campaign to overthrow the government.\n\nTax resisters have been violent revolutionaries like John Adams and pacifist nonresistants like John Woolman; communists like Karl Marx and capitalists like Vivien Kellems; solitary anti-war activists like Ammon Hennacy and leaders of independence movements like Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nLeo Tolstoy, a Christian anarchist, urged government leaders to change their attitude to war and citizens to taxes:\n\nAs an example of the numerous tax resistance methods, below are some of the legal and illegal techniques used by war tax resisters:\n\nA resister may lower their tax payments by using legal tax avoidance techniques.\n\nSome taxpayers pay their taxes, but include protest letters along with their tax forms. Others pay in a protesting form — for instance, by writing their cheque on a toilet seat or a mock-up of a missile. Others pay in a way that creates inconvenience for the collector — for instance, by paying the entire amount in low-denomination coins. This last method is less effective in countries where small coins are legal tender only in limited amounts, allowing the tax authority legally to reject such payments; for example in England and Wales, 1p coins are legal tender only in amounts up to 20p.\n\nOther tax resisters change their lifestyles so that they owe less tax. For instance; to avoid consumption taxes on alcohol, a resister might home-brew beer; to avoid excise taxes on gasoline, a resister might take up cycling; to avoid income tax, a resister may reduce their income below the tax threshold by embracing simple living or a freegan lifestyle. For example, UK citizens pay no income tax if their income is below the personal allowance. In the US the equivalent tax-free annual income is the sum of the standard deduction and personal exemption, though many deductions and credits allow people to earn much more than this and still avoid income tax.\n\nOpposition to war has led some, such as Ammon Hennacy and Ellen Thomas, to a form of tax resistance in which they reduce their income below the tax threshold by taking up a simple living lifestyle. These individuals believe that their government is engaged in immoral, unethical or destructive activities such as war, and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities.\n\nThese methods differ from tax evasion in that they stay within the tax laws, and they differ from tax avoidance in that the goal is to pay as little tax as possible rather than to keep as much post-tax income as possible.\n\nA resister may decide to reduce their tax paid through illegal tax evasion. For instance, one way to evade income tax is to only work for cash-in-hand, therefore circumventing withholding tax.\n\nSome tax resisters refuse to pay all or a portion of the taxes due, but then make an equivalent donation to charity. In this way, they demonstrate that the intent of their resistance is not selfish and that they want to use a portion of their earnings to contribute to the common good.\n\nFor instance, Julia Butterfly Hill resisted about $150,000 in federal taxes, and donated that money to after school programs, arts and cultural programs, community gardens, programs for Native Americans, alternatives to incarceration, and environmental protection programs. She said:\n\nI actually take the money that the IRS says goes to them and I give it to the places where our taxes \"should\" be going. And in my letter to the IRS I said: \"I'm not refusing to pay my taxes. I'm actually paying them but I'm paying them where they belong because you refuse to do so.\"\n\nGroups like the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund (United States), Peace Tax Seven (United Kingdom), (Germany), and Conscience and Peace Tax International are working to legalize a form of conscientious objection to military taxation which would enable conscientious objectors to designate their taxes to be spent only on non-military budget items. They see this as a legalized form of war tax redirection.\n\nSome resisters refuse to willingly pay only certain taxes, either because those taxes are especially noxious to them, or because they present a useful symbolic target, or because they are more easily resisted.\n\nFor instance, in the United States, many tax resisters resist the telephone federal excise tax. The tax was initiated to pay for the Spanish–American War and has frequently been raised or extended by the government during times of war. This made it an attractive symbolic target as a \"war tax\". Such refusal is relatively safe: because this tax is typically small, resistance very rarely triggers significant government retaliation. Phone companies will cooperate with such resisters by removing the excise tax from their phone bills and reporting their resistance to the government.\n\nThe most dramatic and characteristic method of tax resistance is to refuse to pay a tax – either by quietly ignoring the tax bill or by openly declaring the refusal to pay.\n\nSome tax resisters resist only a portion of the taxes due. For instance, some war tax resisters refuse to pay a percentage of their taxes equivalent to the military percentage of the government's budget.\n\nOther resisters withhold a symbolic amount – for instance, in the United States, some might hold back $17.76/17.76% (symbolic of the revolutionary year 1776) or $10.40/10.4% (in tribute to Form 1040, which is used in federal income tax returns).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8480391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8480391", "title": "Truth in Science", "text": "Truth in Science\n\nTruth in Science is a United Kingdom-based creationist organisation which promotes the Discovery Institute's \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign, which it uses to try to get pseudoscientific intelligent design creationism taught alongside evolution in school science lessons. The organisation claims that there is scientific controversy about the validity of Darwinian evolution, a view rejected by the United Kingdom's Royal Society and over 50 Academies of Science around the world. The group is affiliated with the Discovery Institute, the hub of the intelligent design movement, following its strategy and circulating the Institute's promotional materials.\n\nAccording to the Truth in Science website the organisation is run by a Board of Directors who are advised by a Council of Reference and a Scientific Panel. As of 20 June 2007 these are listed as follows\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of scientists do not consider the conclusions of intelligent design to be scientific. The National Science Teachers Association and others have termed intelligent design a pseudoscience, and some have termed it junk science. Little scientific evidence in support of the intelligent design hypothesis has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and intelligent design has never produced a single scientifically testable theory..\n\nIn September 2006, Truth in Science sent resource packs on intelligent design to the heads of science of all United Kingdom secondary schools. According to New Scientist, 59 schools around the United Kingdom used, or planned to use the Truth in Science information packs. The New Scientist article stated that Truth in Science circulated the material with the intention of countering the teaching of evolution in science classes, and that the information packs \"promote the notion that life on Earth was created through intelligent design, a euphemism for the biblical story of creation\".\n\nThe BBC News website reported the reaction to the information packs from the United Kingdom Department for Education and Skills: \"Neither creationism nor intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools, and are not specified in the science curriculum. The national curriculum for science clearly sets down that pupils should be taught that the fossil record is evidence for evolution, and how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction.\" -- \"DfES Spokesperson, BBC News\".\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, on November 1, 2006, The Right Hon. Jim Knight, Labour MP for Dorset South, and Minister of State at the Department for Education and Skills, the Minister for Schools, criticised Truth In Science, their information packs, and intelligent design creationism, citing them as unsuitable for the United Kingdom science curriculum. In answer to a question regarding what the Secretary of State for Education and Skills would do in response to the information packs, Knight said:\n\nIn December 2006, Colin Slee, the Dean of Southwark, said: \"Everything needs to be explored, so that children can ask sensible questions. Though I see no huge difficulty with exploring intelligent design or creationism or flat Earth, they happen to be misguided, foolish and flying in the face of all evidence. I see no problem with Darwinian theory and Christian faith going hand in hand\", -- \"Colin Slee, Dean of Southwark, The Times, December 2006\".\n\nEkklesia, a United Kingdom theological think-tank accused Truth in Science and the advocates of intelligent design of misrepresenting the bible, and that creationism and intelligent design are not on par with accepted scientific theories. According to one Ekklesia contributor, Geologist and Anglican vicar Michael Roberts, the material on the Truth in Science website is carefully packaged to hide its young Earth creationist roots. Simon Barrow, co-director of the UK Christian think tank Ekklesia outlined his critique of intelligent design creationism, and pseudo-scientific explanations for the universe: \"Creationism and ID are in no way comparable to scientific theories of origins and have no place in the modern science classroom. They also distort mature Christian understandings of the universe as coming into being through the whole world process, not through reversals or denials of that process. The roots of creationism, whether in its ‘hard’ form, or in attenuated ID ideas, lie not in science but in misinterpretations of the Bible. Claims that such notions can be justified from a ‘literal’ reading of Genesis are nonsensensical. This book has not one, but two ‘creation stories’. They differ widely in detail, are highly figurative, and were written to combat fatalistic Ancient Near East cosmogonies by stressing the underlying goodness of the world as a gift of God, not to comment on modern scientific matters\" -- \"Ekklesia, 25 September 2006.\"\n\nIn response to the introduction of intelligent design to European schools, the Royal Society stated that \"intelligent design has far more in common with a religious belief in creationism than it has with science\" and raised concerns that \"young people are poorly served by deliberate attempts to withhold, distort or misrepresent scientific knowledge and understanding in order to promote particular religious beliefs\". In a Guardian newspaper article, dated 27 November 2006, Professor Lewis Wolpert of University College London, attacked intelligent design, and the ambitions of Truth in Science: \"There is just no evidence for intelligent design, it is pure religion and has nothing to do with science. It should be banned from science classes\". In October 2006, a science organization called \"Science, Just Science\" reviewed the DVD information packs sent by Truth in Science to the heads of science at all United Kingdom secondary schools in September 2006.\n\nThe UK pro-science advocacy group British Centre for Science Education has condemned attempts to introduce the teaching of creationism at British schools. BCSE protested when \"Truth in Science\" sent information packs to every UK secondary school in September, 2006. In a letter to the editor, published in Financial Times, Ian Lowe of BCSE, expressed concern that creationism could possibly flourish even in Britain, while Mike Brass, chairman of BCSE, said in a letter to \"The Guardian\", \"intelligent design (ID) is creationism dressed up in a tux to sneak into our science classrooms.\"\n\nOn October 11, 2006, a reader, Chris Preedy, wrote a letter to The Times newspaper highlighting \"scientific errors\" on the Truth in Science website, including that the organization denies the evolution of bacterial flagellum. In response, Richard Buggs of the Truth in Science scientific panel published a letter in the Times stating:\n\n\n"}

It is operated by the Pan-Atlantic University in Lagos, Nigeria, the parent body of the Lagos Business School.\n\nThe virtual museum went live in the second quarter of 2011, although preliminary work had already started. The initiative was by Jess Castellote, a Spanish architect, and the Virtual museum is managed by Akinyemi Adetunji. It has four virtual floors and over a dozen gallery rooms, each of which is dedicated to a specific period or to a given school.\nThe interactive website now features about 800 works from different artists, including pioneering Nigerian artists such as Aina Onabolu and Bruce Onobrakpeya, and emerging artists such as Richardson Ovbiebo and Babalola Lawson.\n\nSome of the objects are held in private collections and are on public display for the first time.\n\nThe virtual museum complements the Nigerian National Museum, opened in 1957 in the city of Lagos. While the National Museum has an excellent collection that includes works from 900–200 BC, it lacks contemporary work; the virtual museum fills this gap.\nCastellote has said that he hopes the virtual museum will help unknown Nigerian artists who have produced great works to become better known. He acknowledges that there may be problems, such as ensuring authenticity and accuracy of information, but describes the site as a work in progress that will constantly evolve and improve.\n\nThe sections of the website resemble rooms and are modelled after major art schools and styles in Nigeria, with the exception of a few rooms dedicated to masters like Ben Enwinwu and Bruce Onobrakpeya, an octogenarian print artist. Featured in the virtual museum are approximately 80 artists, randomly distributed among the rooms. The list is subjective, though prominence and impact on contemporary Nigerian art is a yardstick employed in the selection. The Virtual Museum started small, but plans to build into one of the top educational resources on Nigerian art. The virtual museum will help disseminate and add to the body of existing knowledge on contemporary art in Nigeria. The artwork online are spread to accommodate all themes, styles and type of works (painting, sculpture, materialism, etc.) with major focus currently centred on painting and sculpture. The Virtual Museum is working with Nigerian artists and collectors to pool these works. For protection of artists’ and collectors’ rights, all reproductions/representations of artwork identify the artist who created them and the collection the works belong to; moreover, these artworks are reproduced in low resolution (72 dpi) so as to render them of little commercial use. Adequate consent and permission is requested before works are displayed. The website also provides external links to articles, papers, journals, or other domains providing added information on a subject or artist; this helps users gain a rounded knowledge.\n\n"}

The core elements are the Competence Matrix and the Competence Profiles. A Competence Matrix displays competences structurally in a table according to core work tasks in a specific occupational field (“competence area”) and the progress of competence development (“step of competence development”). Competence Profiles are formed from individual parts of this Competence Matrix. \nIn the context of ECVET the VQTS project sought to support the transnational mobility of learners. A Competence Matrix can be used for the development of qualifications, training programmes, and job profiles, as well as for human resource planning, the allocation of qualifications to the Qualifications Framework, and for developing higher permeability between vocational education and higher education.\n\nThe main goal of the VQTS model is the development of a systematic process for the comparison of competences and qualifications, and for the transnational transfer of competences acquired abroad (for example between education and working environment, or between vocational and higher education).\n\nA Competence Matrix displays competences in a table according to core work tasks and the progress of competence development. Competence areas and steps of competence development are described in the table. \nThe structure and different ranges of Competence Matrices can be shown by these examples: \n\nA Competence Matrix can be developed via a moderated workshop using experts from the respective areas. Within the VQTS model it is assumed that 5-25 competence areas will be defined per occupational field, and 2-6 steps of the competence development process described for each competence area. \nIt is not easy to describe competences, because they depend on a variety of characteristics and may be localised in different manners. There are no specific determinants for differentiating the steps in the model. Several dimensions could be:\n\nAbility to \nCompetences in this model refer to cognitive competences (knowledge), functional competences (skills) as well as social competences (behaviour).\n\nCompetence Profiles are formed from particular parts of a Competence Matrix by identifying competences that are relevant to a certain training programme or qualification (organisational profile) or are reflective the competences acquired so far by a person in training (individual profile).\nOrganisational profiles, developed by the authorities responsible for the respective training programmes or qualification, indicate the relevant competences of the specific training programme or qualification on the Competence Matrix and the corresponding number of Credit Points. Individual profiles, developed by the responsible training provider, assess which stage of competence development and Credit Points the student or apprentice has reached so far.\nBased on the competence profile of the person in training a Competence Profile Certificate can be issued.\n\nA Competence Matrix can be used for those purposes where the transparency of competence profiles is very important, such as:\nFor examples for applications see VQTS Website.\n\nThe VQTS models were coordinated by 3s under the “Leonardo da Vinci Programme\":\n\nThe VQTS project was closely aligned with the aims of the ‘Copenhagen Process’ wherein the EU countries declared their willingness to foster employability and lifelong learning in Europe by strengthening cooperation and increasing mobility in vocational education and training (VET). According to the ‘Copenhagen Process’, it should be possible to utilise competences acquired through formal, non-formal and informal learning throughout Europe. The VQTS model is one of the best instruments to implement ECVET and increase the (international) transparency and comparability of qualifications and training offers.\n\nThe VQTS I project received the Helsinki Award 2006 in the ‘Recognition of competences and qualifications, ECVET’ category, and the gold Lifelong Learning Award 2007 for its contributions to the aims of the ‘Copenhagen Process’. \nThe VQTS II project received the \"Best Projects 2007\" label in ADAM, the project and product portal for Leonardo da Vinci. \nThese projects have strongly contributed to improvements in vocational education and training in Europe in recent years.\n\nhttp://www.vocationalqualification.net\n\nDISCO - European Dictionary of Skills and Competences\n\nMarkowitsch, J., Luomi-Messerer, K., Becker, M., Spöttl, G.(2008): Putting Dreyfus into Action.

Sung by young Muslim Arab children, in 2010 the song became a hit on YouTube as well as Arabic and worldwide websites. The song was harshly criticized by Saudi journalist Fawzia Nasir al-Naeem, who argues that it indoctrinates children into bloodshed and terrorism.\n\nThe choir \"The Birds of Paradise\" was founded in 1994 by Jordanian-Palestinian businessman Khaled Maqdad.
