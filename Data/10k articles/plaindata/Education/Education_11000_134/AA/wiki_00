These largely came into force following abolitionist David Walker's 1829 publication of \"Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World\", which openly advocated rebellion, and Nat Turner's slave rebellion of 1831. The Southern white public was already fearful because of the Haitian Revolution of 1804 and the Denmark Vesey revolt of 1822.\n\nWilliam M. Banks wrote, in \"Black Intellectuals\":\"Literacy also threatened the control and surveillance network for slaves in the South. Concern about runaways prompted slaveholders to require passes for all slaves traveling unaccompanied off the plantation. Literate slaves, however, could forge the necessary papers and escape to the North (few white patrollers could read well enough to verify the documents). Many slaves who learned to write did indeed achieve freedom by this method. The wanted posters for runaways often mentioned whether the escapee could write.\"\n\n\"With the exception of Maryland and Kentucky, every Southern state absolutely prohibited the education of slaves,\" Angela Davis wrote.\n\nBetween 1829 and 1834 Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North and South Carolina and Virginia all passed anti-literacy laws. South Carolina prohibited teaching slaves to read and write, punishable by a fine of 100 pounds and six months in prison, via an amendment to its 1739 Negro Act.\n\nA website titled \"Fight Municipal Court Abuse (court.rchp.com) includes the following in its list of significant anti-black laws: \n\nA 19th-century Virginia law specified: \"[E]very assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading or writing, or in the night time for any purpose, shall be an unlawful assembly. Any justice may issue his warrant to any office or other person, requiring him to enter any place where such assemblage may be, and seize any negro therein; and he, or any other justice, may order such negro to be punished with stripes.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, black people who disobeyed the law were sentenced to whipping while whites received a fine and/or jail time.\n\nLaws restricting the education of black students were not limited to the South. In 1833, after black and white abolitionists founded a boarding school for African-American girls in Canterbury, Connecticut, the state legislature outlawed the instruction of 'colored students who were not inhabitants of the state', and the school was burned down shortly thereafter.\n\nEducators in the South found ways to both circumvent and challenge the law. John Berry Meachum, for example, moved his school out of St. Louis, Missouri when that state passed an anti-literacy law in 1847, and re-established it as the Floating Freedom School on a steamship on the Mississippi River, which was beyond the reach of Missouri state law. After she was arrested, tried, and served a month in prison for educating free black children in Norfolk, Virginia, Margaret Crittendon Douglas wrote a book on her experiences, which helped draw national attention to the anti-literacy laws.\n...Some slaveholders tolerated slave literacy. Others ignored the statutes for economic reasons, realizing that literate slaves could handle record-keeping and business transactions, and thus increase the profits and leisure time of the planter class. The prohibitions were also ignored by pious masters who wanted their slaves to read the Bible. There are also numerous accounts of planter children enjoying \"playing school\" and teaching their slave playmates the rudiments of literacy.\"\n"}

She subsequently began working with several different literacy organizations and spent much time researching and learning about the factors that contributed to illiteracy—she believed homelessness was also connected to illiteracy. In 1984 she wrote a children's book about her family told from the point of view of her dog C. Fred entitled \"C. Fred's Story\", and donated all proceeds to literacy charities. When her husband became President her most public cause was family literacy. She called it \"the most important issue we have\". Barbara Bush stated her dedication to eliminating the generational cycle of illiteracy in America by supporting programs where parents and their young children are able to learn together. During the early 1980s, statistics showed that 35 million adults in the United States could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million were not able to read beyond a fourth-grade level. She appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on Mrs. Bush's Story Time, a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children.\n\nBarbara Bush became involved with literacy organizations, served on literacy committees and chaired reading organizations. Eventually, she helped develop the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. The foundation formed in 1989 with a stated aim of getting low-income parents reading, creating positive examples for their children. The foundation aimed to help young parents pass their high school general educational development tests via literacy programs. It was first announced at a luncheon in March 1989. Barbara Bush was to be the foundation's honorary chairman, and Joan Abrahamson the chairman.\n\nSome funding came from a book, credited to the Bushes' dog Millie but ghostwritten by Barbara Bush, \"Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush\". The book reached #1 on the \"New York Times\" bestseller nonfiction list. The book earned $1.1 Million of royalties to July 1991. All of the after-tax royalties were donated to the foundation.\n\nBarbara Bush chaired the foundation until 2012. From then her children Jeb Bush and Doro Bush Koch served as co-chairs. Jeb Bush resigned in 2015, leaving Doro Bush Koch as the honorary chairman, though Barbara Bush remained active in the foundation.\n\nAs of 2014 the foundation ran 1500 literacy programs spread across in all US states. The foundation's stated mission is \"to make literacy a core value in every home in America\". It is registered as a public charitable organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nIn 2016, the organization announced a new partnership with Talk With Me Baby, a Georgia-based organization that the Foundation helped launch nationwide. The partnership was announced at a White House Summit on Behavioral Science Insights, along with the development of an online toolkit. The Foundation aimed for the toolkit to be used by any care providers, from parents to nurses to teachers, to engage children and work with them in the first three years of their lives to develop language, literacy and social skills.\n\nIn February 2017, the Foundation announced the creation of Voices for Literacy. Four other organizations will join with the Foundation with a commitment to improve the lives of both children and adults through literacy. The other organizations have varied backgrounds and areas of expertise, allowing Voices for Literacy to reach and connect with many different groups. The other organizations are: the Coalition on Adult Basic Education, Digital Promise, Pi Beta Phi, and Reading is Fundamental. The groups began their efforts with the \"Leave Your Mark for Literacy\" campaign, which involved an interactive online map tool.\n"}

Camfed programs operate in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi. \n\nCamfed was founded in 1993 by Ann Cotton to support girls to go to school who would otherwise be denied an education because of poverty. The idea for Camfed came from after a research trip to Zimbabwe in which she came to believe that the low enrollment of females in school was due to poverty that did not allow them to cover the school fees. It began with support for 32 girls to attend secondary school in two rural districts of Zimbabwe. By 2017, Camfed had supported more than 1.5 million children through education in a network of 5,500 schools in Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nAnticipating the need for post-school economic opportunities for young people in marginalized rural communities, the Camfed Alumnae Association (CAMA) was established in 1998 to connect young female school leavers and offer pathways to post-secondary school opportunities. CAMA provides a structure through which its members can develop their activism and leadership. By 2017, CAMA had a membership of 84,675 young women, among them now teachers, business leaders, government officials, health professionals and entrepreneurs. A hallmark of Camfed is the activism and philanthropy of its alumnae network, who are actively raising and administering funds to support the next generation of children in school. \n\nCamfed is overseen by an Executive Team of Directors from all Camfed offices led by its CEO, Lucy Lake, who joined Camfed in 1994. \n\nCamfed focuses on rural areas of Africa where poverty is widespread, and girls and young women face massive exclusion from education and the opportunities that are afforded by education. Camfed works to build around girls a supportive environment in which they can attend, and succeed, at primary and secondary school, and progress into young adulthood with opportunities that include professional training, higher education and job creation.\n\nCamfed provides aid by paying for school fees, providing school uniforms, books, and sanitary protection. They also work with the school by training teachers to be mentors. \n\nCAMA, the Camfed Alumnae Association, is the alumnae association for Camfed graduates. \n\nCAMA provides a structure through which its members can develop their activism and leadership. This is referred to as the 'CAMA Multiplier Effect', where these young women graduates are now leading the movement for girls' education in their communities. The ability of CAMA members to lead and implement such long lasting change comes from their lived experience.\n\nThe Learner Guide program was started and is run by women in the Camfed alumnae association CAMA network who volunteer in local schools to deliver a tailored curriculum encompassing leadership, health, learning and life skills to their younger peers. \n\nThis is a two part project that concurrently addresses equal access to quality education for children and the post-secondary school transition period for young women. Firstly, the Learner Guide Program offers a training program for young women to become Learner Guides, opening up post-secondary opportunities, providing transferable skills training, and work experience. Secondly, Learner Guides deliver a tailored program that supports marginalized children through their education, alongside the standard school curriculum. \n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals, a set of universal goals aimed to tackle poverty, inequality, discrimination and climate change across the world, came into action on the 1st January 2016. As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, these goals are designed to mobilize global efforts to transform the world in fifteen years.\n\nCamfed is contributing directly to progress with SDG4: Quality Education. In addition, through the sustainable and scalable programs introduced by Camfed in educating girls, and supporting young women through their transition into secure livelihoods, Camfed’s work contributes to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals including Goal 1: Poverty, Goal 3: Good Health, Goal 5: Gender Equality, Goal 13: Climate Action, and more.\n\nAwards \nIn October 2014, Camfed was recognised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for best practice in taking development innovation to scale. \n\nIn 2017, The Learner Guide Program was awarded the WISE Award.\n\nRatings \nCamfed USA is rated by Charity Navigator a 91.85 at of 100 overall with a rating of 88.48 out of 100 for its financials and a 100 out of 100 for transparency and accountability. \n\nCamfed has been endorsed by actor Morgan Freeman, former US President Bill Clinton, author Doris Lessing, former Prime Minister of Australia and GPE Board Chair Julia Gillard, singer/songwriter Joan Armatrading, actress, singer/songwriter, and philanthropist Rihanna, businesswoman and philanthropist Martha Lane Fox and actress, model and activist Emma Watson.\n\n\n"}

The CIM has been called an outcome-based education diploma as it would be either be necessary to receive or replace the high school diploma, and was characteristic of education reform legislation in many states such as Washington and Oregon.\n\nThe report called for the nation's workforce for the challenges of a new world economic order. The Report of the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, published in June 1990 by the National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE), led by Marc Tucker. This document is significant as it was the basis for the education reform laws, standards and assessment systems created by many states and the federal government in the 1990s in the United States. It codified the principles of outcomes-based education reform, which later became standards-based education reform.\n\nFrom the report:\n\nA new educational performance standard should be set for all students, to be met by age sixteen. This standard should be established nationally and benchmarked to the highest in the world. Students passing a series of performance- based assessments that incorporate the standard would be awarded a Certificate of Initial Mastery. This certificate would qualify the student to choose among going to work, entering a college preparatory program, or studying for a Technical and Professional Certificate, which would be explicitly tied to advanced job requirements. These standards would not be intended as sorting mechanisms, but would allow multiple opportunities for success; the goal would simply be to ensure achievement of high performance standards for the great majority of the nation's workforce.\n\nThe NCEE eventually signed contracts with districts and states covering over half of public school children, including WASL and MCAS. \n\nThe formal terms and contractual agreements have been abandoned as no states or districts are still contracted to the NCEE, and legislation in states such as Washington have discarded the term \"Certificate of Initial Mastery\" or its minor variations. \n\nThey have been effectively replaced by the No Child Left Behind, and tying the high school diploma to standards based test inspired by outcome-based education. Passing a test at the age of 16 was patterned after the European practice of ending the education of the non-college bound at 16 followed by an apprenticeship period, and this is why all states are using tests given at the 10th grade, even though US high schools don't\ngraduate until the end of 12th grade.\n\nThe NCEE published a new study in December 2006, also co-authored by Marc Tucker which is essentially an updated version of the America's Choice report. The term \"Certificate of Initial Mastery\" is abandoned, but the report \"Tough Choices or Tough Times\" still advocates a test given at age 16 which would end high school education, followed by enrollment in community college or university prep courses.\n\n\n"}

Severely challenging behaviour is not a transient phenomenon.\"\n\nChallenging behaviour is most often, though not exclusively exhibited by individuals with learning developmental disabilities, individuals with dementia or other mental health needs, such as strokes or acquired brain injuries, individuals with psychosis and by children, although such behaviours can be displayed by any person.\n\nCommon types of challenging behaviour include self-injurious behaviour (such as hitting, headbutting, biting, scratching), aggressive behaviour (such as hitting others, headbutting, shouting, swearing, screaming, scratching others, spitting, biting, punching, kicking), inappropriate sexualised behaviour (such as public masturbation or groping), behaviour directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviours (such as repetitive rocking or echolalia).\n\nThe term \"challenging behaviour\" has become subject to widespread misuse, most often as a euphemism for violent or aggressive behaviour. In educational settings it is often used to refer to acts of disobedience, defiance, or other non-compliance with authority. This is not what the term was originally intended to refer to. Increasingly professional groups are adopting alternative terms for example \"behaviour of concern\".\n\nChallenging behaviour may be caused by many kinds of factors, including: \nChallenging behaviour may also simply be a means of communication. A lot of the time, challenging behaviour is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviours to achieve the same aims. Behaviour analysts have focused on a developmental model of challenging behaviour.\n\nExperience and research suggests that what professionals call \"challenging behaviour\" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that services or others create around people with developmental disabilities, and a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of services or others to listen for what kind of life makes most sense to the person, especially where services or others create lifestyles and relationships that are centred on what suits them or the service and its staff rather than what suits the person. \n\nChallenging behaviour can often be viewed as a ‘behavioural equivalent’ of a mental health problem. However, research evidence indicates that challenging behaviours and mental health problems are relatively independent conditions. \n\nA common principle in behaviour management is looking for the message an individual is communicating through their challenging behaviour: \"All behaviour has meaning\". This is a core in the functional analysis process.\n\nChildren communicate through their behaviour, especially those who have not acquired language and vocabulary skills to tell the adult what the problem is.\n\nIn adults with developmental disabilities certain types of challenging behaviour can predict contact with police and hospital admission.\n\nChallenging behaviours may be viewed as occurring in a cycle:\n\nAnalysis of this cycle provides a foundation for using a variety of strategies to minimise the triggers of challenging behaviour, teach more appropriate behaviours in response to these triggers, or provide consequences to the challenging behaviour that will encourage a more appropriate response. Behavioural strategies such as Applied Behaviour Analysis, operant conditioning and positive behaviour support use similar approaches to analysing and responding to challenging behaviours. Recently, Eidetic Model of Growth (EMG) has been used with promising results. \n\n\n"}

Undergraduate students must have completed at least one year of general college course-work by the start date of the program. Other requirements are that the applicants should be in acceptable mental and physical health for which persons granted the scholarship are usually required to submit a satisfactory Medical Information Form and Physician’s Statement. The minimum age is 18 by the beginning of the CLS Program in the particular year.\n\nThe scholarship is open to students in all disciplines, including business, engineering, law, medicine, sciences, and humanities. There is also no discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, or disability in choosing awardees.\n\n\n\n\nThe equivalent of 1 year of college-level language study entails but is not limited to: 1 summer of intensive language study, 2 semesters of study (audited or for credit), or 1 year of private tutoring. A typical academic year is 9 months (36 weeks). A typical language course is 3–5 hours per week or 108–180 hours per academic year of language instruction. Applicants who have completed the CLS Program may count each summer of participation as one year of language study.

Applicants recommended for selection are forwarded to the U.S. Department of State for final approval. After notification, selected participants will be required to complete a language evaluation. Selected applicants will be assigned to a CLS institute site by mid to late April based on language evaluation results along with information provided in the online application.\n\nThe program begins with a two-day pre-departure orientation in Washington, D.C. Immediately following the orientation program, students are flown to their respective locations where they delve into the intensive language programs. The program itself involves approximately 20 hours a week of formal language instruction. In addition, CLS participants engage in a variety of language enhancement activities, including conversation partners, guest lectures, film viewings, host family visits (some sites), and cultural excursions. Some institutes require students to take a language pledge, which requires students to speak in the target language at designated times.

{"id": "30111373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30111373", "title": "Delors Report", "text": "Delors Report\n\nThe Delors Report was a report created by the Delors Commission in 1996. It proposed an integrated vision of education based on two key concepts, ‘learning throughout life’ and the four pillars of learning, to know, to do, to be and to live together. It was not in itself a blueprint for educational reform, but rather a basis for reflection and debate about what choices should be made in formulating policies. The report argued that choices about education were determined by choices about what kind of society we wished to live in. Beyond education’s immediate functionality, it considered the formation of the whole person to be an essential part of education’s purpose. The Delors Report was aligned closely with the moral and intellectual principles that underpin UNESCO, and therefore its analysis and recommendations were more humanistic and less instrumental and market-driven than other education reform studies of the time.\n\nThe Delors Report identified a number of tensions generated by technological, economic and social change. They included tensions between the global and the local; the universal and the particular; tradition and modernity; the spiritual and the material; long term and short term considerations; the need for competition and the ideal of equality of opportunity; and the expansion of knowledge and our capacity to assimilate it. These seven tensions remain useful perspectives from which to view the current dynamics of social transformation. Some are taking on new meaning, with fresh tensions emerging. These include patterns of economic growth characterized by rising vulnerability, growing inequality, increased ecological stress, and rising intolerance and violence. Finally, while there has been progress in human rights, implementation of norms often remains a challenge.\n\nOne of the most influential concepts of the 1996 Delors Report was that of the four pillars of learning. Formal education, the report argued, tends to emphasize certain types of knowledge to the detriment of others that are essential to sustaining human development.\nThe idea of the integrated approach to education reflected in the four pillars of learning has had significant influence on policy debates, teacher training and curriculum development in a range of countries worldwide.\n\nIt is important to note that the four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of ‘lifelong learning’, itself an adaptation of the concept of ‘lifelong education’ as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication \"Learning to Be\".\n"}
{"id": "20276446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20276446", "title": "Diversity University", "text": "Diversity University\n\nDiversity University was the first MOO dedicated specifically for education. Like other MUDs, it was an online realm that allowed people to interact in real time by connecting to a central server, assuming a virtual identity within that realm, \"teleporting\" (in other words, transporting your character) or \"walking\" to virtual rooms, and holding text-based conversations with others who had entered the same virtual room. The MOO server kept track of which characters were in each virtual \"room,\" so that the comments of each character would be sent back to the computers of every other person whose character was \"in\" the same virtual \"room.\" What distinguished Diversity University from other MOOs was its central structuring metaphor as a virtual university campus, as well as its pioneering use for actual online classes.\n\nDiversity University was created in summer 1993 by its founder (and original \"arch-wizard\"), Jeanne McWhorter, then a sociology graduate student at the University of Houston. In an interview with a reporter, she described her initial purpose in creating the online educational environment: \"It all began when I got interested in getting social workers online. ... Social workers all tend to be computerphobes — part of it is that we have it in our mind that computers dehumanize. I think computers do anything but — I think people are much more open and willing to talk about themselves when they're online.\" Josh Quittner continues, \"McWhorter figured that Diversity University would be a way to attract educators and students to computing as a communications medium.\"\n\nThe overarching idea was a virtual, online university space, allowing teachers and students to interact in real time. Diversity University was originally hosted on a server at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, although it moved to two other server environments during its life, since it often struggled for financial support and institutional backing. Its final homes were Marshall University and the University of Wisconsin - Parkside.\n\nDiversity University did not charge any hosting fees to faculty members and other educators who brought classes onto the MOO. Because the text-based interface required minimal computing resources for people to access the MOO, Diversity University espoused an egalitarian mission, which they articulated on their website: \n\"The mission of Diversity University is to develop, support and maintain creative and innovative environments and tools for teaching, learning and research through the Internet and other distributed computing systems, and to guide and educate people in the use of these and other tools, to foster collaboration in a synergistic climate, and to explore and utilize applications of emerging technology to these ends in a manner friendly to people who are disabled, geographically isolated or technologically limited\".\n\nAlthough MOOs are virtual spaces — basically computer objects in a database — they are usually organized around a central spatial metaphor. For Diversity University that metaphor was a physical university campus, with buildings that represented the subject fields of the participants, along with other types of buildings that you might find on a typical university campus. In his master's thesis on \"Design in Virtual Environments Using Architectural Metaphor,\" Dace A. Campbell used Diversity University's campus as an example of virtual architecture; one can see DU's \"campus\" structure as Figure 1.3 in that thesis.\n\nGuests who connected to Diversity University landed in a \"room\" in the \"Student Union,\" in a kind of orientation space, while registered characters would land in whatever \"room\" was their virtual home in that environment. Once in a room, characters could use commands to navigate around the virtual space. For example, they could type \"out\" to exit from the room to an adjoining room or hallway, and they could use the cardinal directions (n, s, e, w) to \"move\" in those directions from room to room, building to street, street to connected street, and also into other virtual buildings on the campus. When creating \"rooms,\" therefore, people who had building rights on the MOO were encouraged to use the appropriate version of the command (@dig) so that they would create not a free-floating, unconnected room, but a room that was joined to another room (or hallway), in the appropriate virtual building, allowing users to \"walk\" around the MOO. Other commands, ranging from basic to advanced, were also supported.\n\nBecause the overarching structure was metaphorical, characters and guests on the MOO had the \"magical\" ability to \"teleport\" (or jump) from a room in one virtual building to another room \"somewhere else\" by using commands such as @go (to go to a room by its object number or name) and @join (to join another character in a room). Rooms could be open or locked, to allow (or prevent) people from joining other characters in that virtual space. Programmers on the MOO could create \"virtual objects\" that had the ability to move characters from room to room, such as virtual cars, a magical tour globe that provided a guided tour of English-related rooms in the environment (programmed by one of Diversity University's \"wizards,\" Ulf Kastner), and a Points of Interest Board that served as a kind of portal to every site listed on the board, among others. Many of these features have been incorporated into newer, three-dimensional versions of Multi-User Virtual Environments, such as Second Life.\n\nJosh Quittner's March 1994 article about Diversity University described one of the first uses of DU as a space to hold actual university classes. In spring 1994, Leslie Harris (then an assistant professor at Susquehanna University) and Cynthia Wambeam (working as a composition instructor at the University of Wyoming) paired their English composition classes and held inter-class discussions of shared readings in Diversity University. Because the MOO environment was text-based, it offered students practice in articulating ideas in writing, which was reinforced in an inter-class LISTSERV. Harris and Wambeam discussed their experience and its effect on student writing skills in an article in \"Computers and Composition\".\n\nBecause the MOO created a virtual reality by describing its environment, it provided an excellent space for reenactments of literary texts, in which visitors can be \"immersed\" in the world of the novel or fictional work. One such project was a recreation of Dante's \"Inferno\" (the first book of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\"), also by students in courses taught by Leslie Harris. Students recreated some of the circles of Hell within the MOO, populated with virtual robots that could interact with one another and with visitors to the site. Since the rooms were interconnected, visitors could go down from level to level, experiencing parts of Dante and Virgil's journey. The fifth circle of hell was depicted virtually by students in Professor Harris' course.\n\nTwo similar projects on Diversity University were an interactive version of \"The Waste Land\" by T. S. Eliot, with rooms in the MOO world reflecting sections of Eliot's poem, and a \"MOO Bedford\" created by R. J. LaRoe that allowed visitors to the MOO to explore the world of Moby-Dick. Many English-related educational projects existed on the MOO.\n\nEducators in other fields brought students to Diversity University, taking advantage of the close fit between Constructivist teaching methods and the MOO environment. For example, Professor Tom Danford of West Virginia Northern Community College taught a microbiology course in the MOO. As Dick Banks explains, \"The constructivist assignments [in Professor Danford's microbiology course] include a student microscope slide set, an instructional object of some sort, and participation in a group project. The group projects are separate rooms, each devoted to a specific disease or pathogen. Students were divided into three member groups and the disease/organism was assigned in the beginning of the semester. At the end of the term, each group will present its room and contents to the class.\"\n\nWhen you visit a room in a MOO, you see its description as you enter and you can create virtual objects in a room that themselves can be described. In a room that is supposed to represent a bacterium or other pathogen, students need to describe the features of the room in very specific detail, so that the room is scientifically accurate. The students are thus learning in a creative way the structure of the organism they are studying, while indirectly teaching that structure to anyone who visits the room and more directly to their fellow students in the course.\n\nA team run by Marcus Speh ran a course on \"Object-oriented programming using C++\". This course had about 80 registrants and ran over about 8 weeks. Its value was recognised by a \"Best of the Web\" award in WWW1 in 1994 \n\nAnother notable project on DU was the Librarians' Online Support Team (LOST), led by Isabel Danforth, which held professional development workshops within the MOO environment for librarians who were trying to understand the growing significance of the Internet to librarianship. In an announcement for one of those workshops, Danforth explained the purpose of the group and the significance of Diversity University as a platform for such collaborations:\n\nThe Librarian's On-Line Support Team (L.O.S.T.) is an organization that is coordinated by a steering committee consisting of academic, research, public, and K-12 librarians from wide-spread locations. The group provides space for librarians, many of whom are being thrust into cyberspace with minimal training and support, to get both formal and informal instruction and mentoring. Librarians with various levels of background can meet to share ideas and experiences informally. The group is currently based at the virtual campus of Diversity University, a cyberspace location that offers both real-time and delayed interaction via computer and currently supports over 4,000 educators and students world-wide. Information about L.O.S.T. and its programs can be found at: http://admin.gnacademy.org:8001/~lost\n\nLOST epitomized Diversity University's ability to foster collaboration among educators, which was one of McWhorter's original purposes in creating the environment. Other initiatives included an online biology conference held simultaneously on Diversity University MOO and BioMOO, and a bilingual recreation of El Paso and Ciudad Juárez within the MOO environment, demonstrating the usefulness of the environment for foreign language education. Realizing the special importance of the immersive experience of visiting a MOO, foreign-language educators created other MOO spaces entirely in those target languages.\n\nBecause faculty members at universities were holding class sessions on DU MOO, the MOO wizards developed objects that provided some typical classroom capabilities. For example, faculty members on the MOO could use a \"Generic Slide Projector\" to \"project\" a series of text \"slides\" to everyone in the room, which allowed faculty members to give \"pre-recorded\" instructions to students, without having to type those instructions on the spot. An object called a $note (basically, a kind of text file) could be created to work like a blackboard. When students entered a room (for example, a separate room for small-group discussions), students could \"read\" the blackboard, which would give them questions to discuss or instructions on what to do during the class time. If faculty members wanted to record the discussions that took place in a room, they could use a \"Generic Recording Device\" to create a transcript of the session, for later review.\n\nAlthough similar tools have now been incorporated into learning management systems, Multi-User Virtual Environments, and other programs for online conferencing, some of those tools were subject to the criticisms leveled by Tari Fanderclai, who asserted that faculty using new pedagogical environments like a MOO should adapt their teaching techniques to take advantage of the special possibilities of the MOO, rather than trying to make a MOO more like a traditional classroom.\n\nThe online teaching tools did help faculty members conduct their classes in the decentralized and potentially chaotic MOO world, and they reveal as well the power and flexibility of the object-oriented programming environment. Faculty members did not need to possess programming skills to create objects in the MOO world that performed significant functions. If they wanted an object on which they could write notes, comparable to a course blackboard, they could create an object of that class, which would inherit all the features of the parent object. If they wanted a Generic Recording Device to record the student discussions that went on in the room, they could issue a relatively simple command (for example, @create #2978 named MyRecorder), which would create for them an object with those desired features. Faculty pioneers using the MOO could create lists of MOO help sheets — for example, MOO Help and Policy Texts, and the Composition in Cyberspace Project — making it easier for other faculty to use the environment. That cooperative spirit of users helping one another out — the recognition that \"everyone was once a newbie [that is, a new user of the technology]\" — informed Diversity University MOO. Its shared, collaborative, highly social environment made it an early example (along with other MOOs) of a Social network service, with a kind of network effect that resembled later Web 2.0 environments.\n\nDiversity University shut down in 2006. Its domain name, codice_1, was allowed to expire on October 26, 2006.\n"}

He is known for discovering – with Yves Coppens and Maurice Taieb – the fossil of a female hominin australopithecine known as \"Lucy\" in the Afar Triangle region of Hadar, Ethiopia.\n\nJohanson was born in Chicago, Illinois to Swedish parents, and is the nephew of wrestler Ivar Johansson. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1966, and his master's degree (1970) and PhD (1974) from the University of Chicago. At the time of the discovery of Lucy, he was an associate professor of anthropology at Case Western Reserve University. In 1981, he established the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, California which he later moved to Arizona State University in 1997. Johanson holds an honorary doctorate from Case Western Reserve University, and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Westfield State College in 2008.\n\nLucy was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia on November 24, 1974, when Johanson, coaxed away from his paperwork by graduate student Tom Gray for a spur-of-the-moment survey, caught the glint of a white fossilized bone out of the corner of his eye, and recognized it as hominin. Forty percent of the skeleton was eventually recovered, and was later described as the first known member of \"Australopithecus afarensis\". Johanson was astonished to find so much of her skeleton all at once. Pamela Alderman, a member of the expedition, suggested she be named \"Lucy\" after the Beatles' song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" which was played repeatedly during the night of the discovery.\n\nA bipedal hominin, Lucy stood about three and a half feet tall; her bipedalism supported Raymond Dart's theory that australopithecines walked upright. Johanson and his team concluded from Lucy's rib that she ate a plant-based diet, and from her curved finger bones that she was probably still at home in trees. They did not immediately see Lucy as a separate species, but considered her an older member of \"Australopithecus africanus\". The discovery, however, of several more skulls of similar morphology persuaded most palaeontologists to classify her as a species called \"afarensis\".\n\nJohanson and Maitland A. Edey won a 1982 U.S. National Book Award in Science\nfor the first popular book about this work, \"Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind\".\n\nAL 333, commonly referred to as the \"First Family,\" is a collection of prehistoric hominin teeth and bones of at least thirteen individuals that were also discovered in Hadar by Johanson's team in 1975. Generally thought to be members of the species \"Australopithecus afarensis,\" the fossils are estimated to be about 3.2 million years old.\n\n\nSince 2013, Johanson has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6485204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6485204", "title": "Internet scavenger hunt", "text": "Internet scavenger hunt\n\nAn Internet scavenger hunt or CyberHunt is an educational lesson which introduces the Internet to students. It is often used as tool for teaching students how to search the Internet and how to use the resources and information available on the Internet.\nIt is an online activity in the form of a scavenger hunt that focuses on gathering information from web sites to answer questions or to support a concept on a particular theme or content area. The intent is to hunt for facts or information to add details for the answer to the question. The questions themselves may vary from the simple fact or statement to the more complex, depending upon the age and skill level of the student. By completing CyberHunts, students learn how to navigate a web site, scan a page for detailed information, and then apply the facts or ideas to the question. A CyberHunt is an excellent way to teach beginning internet researching skills.\n\nAn Internet scavenger hunt is a fact-finding exercise where students answer a list of questions or solve problems as they practice information seeking skills. A hunt can serve as a powerful tool to introduce the study of a new subject or to supplement the exploration of various sides of an issue.\n\nAlthough hunts frequently move from web site to web site, some direct a student's exploration of a single, content rich site. The single site strategy is employed to introduce users to the elements of a highly sophisticated site like the Library of Congress site, the government site Congress.gov or the Smithsonian site. This permits the teacher to highlight the key areas of a web site.\n\nRecently, the Cyberhunt concept was expanded upon, by creating Extended Cyberhunts or Learning-by-Design Extended Cyberhunts by Dr André du Plessis and Prof Paul Webb of the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University. This newly developed strategy build on the Cyberhunt- or Scavenger hunt concept. These two academics named their extension of Cyberhunts the ‘Learner Centred Learning-By-Designing Extended Cyberhunts’ (LCLBDEC) strategy for teaching and learning in schools. The main focus of this strategy is to enable learners to become designers of an educational tool which assists them to learn during the design process, and also can be used by other learners or students to get a better understanding of a topic (see http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet27/duplessis.pdf). Learners are initially introduced to the ‘Learner Centred Learning-By-Designing Extended Cyberhunts’ (LCLBDEC) strategy by means of teacher designed Extended Cyberhunts. What makes this strategy different is the fact that there is a deliberate attempt to explore a topic by trying to answer questions that have been created based on the different cognitive levels as suggested by Bloom and the revised taxonomy of Anderson and Krathwohl. The focus is to elicit thinking on different levels and hence the teacher can indicate within brackets the level of thinking that is required. The teacher selects a topic from the curriculum and then search for appropriate web sites or web related resources that can range from pure text based online resources to online video related resources from www.youtube.com as an example. A memorandum is also created in order that the learners can ascertain whether they were on the right track. A teacher can thus create Extended Cyberhunts based upon topics that he/she might not be able to complete in class as a result of time constraints caused by whatever possible cause, but the questions to be explored be the learners have to be on different cognitive levels. However, what makes the ‘Learner Centred Learning-By-Designing Extended Cyberhunts’ (LCLBDEC) strategy unique further, is that the next step is that learners become the designers themselves as learning-as-design (see Perkins) is learning that requires a diverse range of skills. Learning-as-design undertaken by learners focuses not only on the product, but primarily on the learning that occurs as a result of seeing the design of a product or artefact as a learning opportunity where the process is just as important as the product. Learners can design Extended Cyberhunts individually or in groups on a topic related to the curriculum. This topic could a topic that has already been discussed or completed in class, but now deeper exploration can be the motive. In addition, the teacher could also identify topics that he/she has noticed that present a great challenge for learners and hence the additional Extended Cyberhunt that learners design by using different online resources that their peers can explore provide an opportunity for learners to possibly clarify their understanding. In addition, learners can also assist the teacher to design Extended Cyberhunts on a curriculum related topic that there is not time for to cover in class. In addition, learners as the designers also have to create a memorandum for the questions that they have created. Teacher designed or Learner designed Extended Cyberhunts can be designs in applications such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Libre Office or even on a wiki such as www.wikispaces.com. In order for learners to be able to create questions on different cognitive levels, teachers have to introduce the learners to the different levels of the taxonomy of Bloom and also provide them with the different key verbs that are associated with each level. In order to assist teachers (or even lecturers at tertiary level) to be able to design Extended Cyberhunts, the website www.nmmu.ac.za/cyberhunts/index.htm. The theoretical underpinnings of Extended Cyberhunts, as well as an in depth discussion of the process to follow, is available at http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet27/duplessis.pdf\n\nThe first Internet Scavenger Hunt was developed in 1992 by Rick Gates. He was a professor at the University of California at the time. He created the hunt to encourage adults to explore the resources on the Internet. Gates distributed the questions to various Usenet newsgroups, LISTSERV discussion lists, and Gopher and FTP sites. He offered a prize for successful completion. As time went by he developed themed and then highly challenging hunts like researching a single email address.\n\nBeginner hunts are highly directive taking the user via a link, to the specific web page. A moderately challenging activity takes the user to a web site that has the answer to a posed question and requires them to choose an appropriate link, use the site map, or site search engine to locate facts that support their answer. The most sophisticated activity may post several open ended questions that require the student to make many choices including search tool and method, web sites and finally the correct supporting information.\n\nHunts offer several advantages to using the Internet with younger web users. Since the developer chooses the web pages and links directly to them, this minimizes the risk of students being exposed to inappropriate material. With the student's web interaction highly scripted, misdirection by ads or video can be controlled.\n\nInstructors can target the rigor of the activity to challenge students by varying the level of abstraction of questions as defined by Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Relevance of instructional material may be addressed by using Internet based news resources to infuse current events into the lesson.\n\nA well-developed scavenger hunt that is based on a novel enriches literature studies. It harnesses online resources to extend exploration of the setting and the plot. Highlighting historical references and lending insight through author study are also possible.\n\nHaving students create an Internet fact hunt about a subject is one method for developing higher order thinking skills while reflecting knowledge and developing technology skills.\n\nThe use of online resources for instruction and research takes advantage of widely available access to the hunt and the site(s) to which it is linked. This diminishes the need for extensive investments in print resources that quickly become outdated or irrelevant. A single book can be used by only one student at a time. A single web page can be accessed by millions. Typos and misinformation in print materials are there until the next printing. Typos or erroneous information on web pages are easily remedied in a matter of minutes.\n\nMany educational hunts are posted on the Internet permitting users worldwide to use the activity. Hunts can also be crafted in some word processing software and run from the individual computer desktop. Some developers are providing hunt activities in pdf (portable document format). This provides for a more consistent product appearance when printed. Links embedded in pdf documents are active on computers that have access to the net.\n\nHunts are different from a webquest since the emphasis is on facts and finding information while webquest is inquiry-oriented activity that demands that students go beyond fact-finding.\n\nThere are thousands of hunts on the web that are content focused and grade level specific. When creating the CyberHunt, the teacher selects web sites that support their specific curriculum focus. The instructor has control over which sites have the best information to answer the questions. The students use only those sites in the activity. The intent is to focus on the material and not have students spend time using search engines or directories to accumulate numerous websites that must then be accessed, assessed and evaluated. Instead, students use their time to navigate to teacher-selected sites for the information. The CyberHunt lesson is streamlined to a simple fact-finding activity. For this reason, the typical activity takes one or more class periods to finish.\n\nThere are no firm CyberHunt rules about the number of sites, the type of questions, or the amount of activity time to be allotted. CyberHunts have been created in all shapes and forms and for all grade levels. They cover most subjects and have no set time limit. The teacher has control over the sites, the type of questions, and the final product.\n\nDu Plessis, A. & Webb, P. (2011). An extended Cyberhunts strategy: Learner centred learning-by-design.

The planetarium is the oldest of the three planetaria in Indonesia. The second planetarium is located in Surabaya, East Java. The third planetarium is located in Kutai, East Kalimantan. \n\nConstruction of the planetarium was an initiative of President Sukarno when in the early 1960s he envisaged a monumental large-scaled planetarium project. However, by the next half of the 1960s, the design was made more modest. The construction of Jakarta Planetarium and Observatory began in 1964 as part of the construction of the Taman Ismail Marzuki art complex. \nThe construction was funded by the Indonesian government and the Indonesian Batik Cooperatives Association (\"Gabungan Koperasi Batik Indonesia\" or GKBI). \n\nThe 22 meter dome of the planetarium was completed in 1968. On November 10, 1968, the building was officially inaugurated by the Governor of Jakarta Ali Sadikin together with the Taman Ismail Marzuki art complex. The planetarium was opened to public on March 1, 1969; the day was made the official birthday of the planetarium. The planetarium made use of the Carl Zeiss Universal planetarium projector\n\nIn 1975, a coudé telescope that was already a property of the institution since the 1964s was installed in a two-floored building not far from the planetarium. In 1982, the coudé telescope was moved closer to the present observatory because the land where the telescope stands earlier belongs to another owner. \n\nIn 1984, Jakarta Planetarium became officially the Jakarta Planetarium and Observatory. In 1991, the building was extended and facilities such as class rooms, were added. In 1994, a 31 cm star telescope was acquired to replace the older telescope. \n\nMajor renovation and technological upgrade of the planetarium was done in 1996. The previous Universal Projector was replaced with the computerized Universarium VIII Projector.

Related to their field of studies the students offer consulting services to the market; experiencing unique learning opportunities by doing professional project work on the one side and managing small- to medium-sized enterprises on the other, by doing this the students add practical experience to their theoretical skills and bridge the gap between academia and the business world. Most Junior Enterprises are linked to universities or business schools.\n\n\nThis is an opportunity for students to develop self-confidence and experience entrepreneurship at an early stage in their careers, to add practical experience to the theoretical skills and to provide private business with state-of-the-art knowledge from universities.\n\nDue to the particularity of the Junior Enterprise work, the students distinguish themselves for example by their soft skills such as entrepreneurial spirit, team-working, creativity, presentation skills, public speaking, networking and intercultural understanding, work experience, and project management.\n\n\nThe European Confederation of Junior Enterprises was created in 1992 in order to link all the National Confederations of Junior Enterprises in Europe. The founding members were the Netherlands (FNJE), Portugal (JEP), Italy (CIJE), Switzerland (USJE) and France (CNJE).\n\nToday, the network counts 20.000 student members in fifteen countries, organised in around 280 Junior Enterprises. JADE coordinates Junior Initiatives all over Europe and fosters their development. Together with Brasil Junior, the Junior Enterprise Network in Brazil, JADE is one of the largest student networks in the world.\n\nAs the voice of the Junior Enterprise Movement and youth entrepreneurship in Europe, JADE’s mission is to:\n\n• Represent the European Junior Enterprise (JE) Movement\n\n• Integrate the European Network of Junior Enterprises thus encouraging knowledge exchange and cooperation\n\n• Support the development of our members (Confederations and Consultative Members)\n\n• Foster the Junior Enterprise Concept to non-member countries\n\n• Encourage entrepreneurship among students in higher Education through the Junior Enterprise Concept.\n\nBased in Brussels, JADE works closely with the European Institutions, with international organisations (UNESCO, OECD, World Bank) to promote the importance of entrepreneurship education and youth entrepreneurship in young people, providing a valuable learning-by-doing experience and providing students with the skills they will need to be successful in the labour market.\n\nThe recognition and acceptance of the Junior Enterprise movement by politicians, public institutions and companies, confirms and proofs the concept of junior entrepreneurship:\n\nDiverse studies carried out by JADE, the European Commission and other parties, prove that participation in a Junior Enterprise dramatically improves a student’s career perspectives, employment and intentions towards entrepreneurship. \n\nBrasil Junior is the world's biggest junior enterprise confederation, composed by more than 320 confederated junior enterprises and more than 11,000 junior entrepreneurs. It has as purpose to represent the junior enterprises nationwide and develop the Junior Enterprise Movement as an agent of business education and generation of new business. It is currently formed by 19 state federations.\n\nBrasil Júnior works to bring together the state federations at meetings, and mainly, the junior enterprises at ENEJ (National Meeting of Junior Enterprises). In 2014, ENEJ happened at Espírito Santo with the attendance of 1,800 junior entrepreneurs.\n\nLast year, from 13 to August 17 ENEJ happened at Brasilia, Brazil's capital. Around 2,500 junior entrepreneurs went to the event.\n\nRecently, junior enterprises appeared also in China, especially on the campus of Peking University. The movement is also taking its first step in North America with the recent launch a cross-faculty Junior Enterprise at McGill University in Canada. Shortly after the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign launched the first JE in the US.\n\n"}

Many laboratory schools are still in operation in the United States and around the globe. They are known by many names: laboratory schools, demonstration schools, campus schools, model schools, university affiliated schools, child development schools, etc., and most have a connection to a college or university. Each university affiliated school has a unique relationship with a college or university and a different grade configuration. Some lab schools are only for preschool or kindergarten children, some are preschool through fifth or sixth grade, and some continue through high school. \n\nKhan Lab School in Silicon Valley is one of the few laboratory schools not affiliated with a college or university. It is affiliated with Khan Academy, a non-profit educational organization. The school's experimentation with abolishing grade levels was featured on Voice of America in 2016.\n\nLaboratory school classrooms may be observed by university professors to assess the student-teacher, but it is desired that the observation be done without the students or student-teachers aware of the observation, thereby avoiding creating a distraction or disruption of classroom activities.\n\nBefore the miniaturization and transistorization of electronic camera viewing systems, laboratory schools often included elaborate direct-view observation systems with special observation decks above classrooms or observation rooms alongside the classrooms. One-way mirrors and speaker/intercom systems allowed a professor to silently observe the classroom, but without being seen by the students or the student-teacher.\n\nA modern laboratory school does not need to do anything special with building construction, and is able to use a standard-design school as a laboratory school. The standard rooms are instead outfitted with CCTV cameras hidden inside black plastic domes on the ceiling. Complex lens optics and multiple cameras allow a single stationary dome to view 360 degrees in all directions with no mechanical noises or moving parts, and high-speed Internet connections allow for a professor at a college to remotely view and interact with student-teachers in a distant laboratory school.\n\nIn either case there is no hiding from students or student-teachers that observation may occur, as it is plainly obvious there are special mirrors or cameras in the room. But they do not know when observation may or may not be occurring.\n\n\n\n"}

It can be considered an antecedent of the University of Kinshasa.\n\nBefore the foundation of Lovanium, the Catholic University of Louvain already operated multiple institutes for higher education in the Belgian Congo. The \"Fomulac\" (Fondation médicale de l'université de Louvain au Congo), was founded in 1926, with the goal of forming Congolese medical personnel and researchers specialized in tropical medicine. In 1932 the Catholic University of Louvain founded the \"Cadulac\" (Centres agronomiques de l'université de Louvain au Congo) in Kisantu. Cadulac was specialized in agricultural sciences and formed the basis for what was later to become Lovanium.\n\nThe university was established in 1954 on the Kimwenza plateau, near Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). \nLovanium was founded by the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and was named after it (\"Lovanium\" being Latin for Leuven).\nWhen it opened, the university received heavy subsidies from the colonial government, it also received funding from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development and was lauded as the best university in Africa.

{"id": "1902244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1902244", "title": "Royal Commonwealth Society", "text": "Royal Commonwealth Society\n\nThe Royal Commonwealth Society is a non-governmental organisation with a mission to promote the value of the Commonwealth and the values upon which it is based. The Society upholds the values of the Commonwealth Charter, promoting conflict resolution, peace-making and democracy to improve the lives of citizens across the member states of the Commonwealth.\n\nWhat is now The Royal Commonwealth Society was founded in 1868, as a non-political, learned organisation; a royal charter was granted in 1869, and a clubhouse opened in 1885. The Society's name slowly evolved: from \"The Colonial Society\" (1868-1869), to \"The Royal Colonial Society\" (1869-1870), to \"The Royal Colonial Institute\" (1870-1928), to \"The Royal Empire Society (1928-1958)\"; \"The Royal Commonwealth Society\" was adopted in 1958.\n\nThe Society may be seen from early on to have been progressive in its time towards equality and diversity. A woman was first invited by The Royal Colonial Institute to read a research paper in 1894, and The Royal Colonial Institute was one of the first learned organisations to admit women as full Fellows, in 1922. The Society's first Asian member was Ji ju Sanjo, son of the Japanese prime minister (Sanjo Sanetomi), in 1872; the first African member was Samuel Bannerman, of the Gold Coast, in 1879.\nThe identity of the Society was for more than a hundred years inseparably bound up with its Library. At a meeting on 26 June 1868, Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue recommended \"the formation of a colonial library, to which all interested in the welfare of the colonies should have access,\" an aim affirmed by the Society's first elected chairman, Viscount Bury. The Society's first librarian was appointed in 1869, and the first salaried librarian, Australian-born Joseph Sylvester O'Halloran, in 1885. The person mainly responsible for the Library's remarkable development and international reputation was Evans Lewin, Master Librarian for thirty-six years, 1910-1946.\n\nThe Society’s first home was above a shirt shop at No. 15 The Strand, London, where it remained from 1870 until 1885. It was in this modest space that the organisation’s Library collection began to be assembled. The Society's Library quickly increased in size and reputation, and the organisation moved in 1885 to 25 Northumberland Avenue in Central London, where it would remain until 2013. The site was completely rebuilt in 1936 to the design of architect Sir Herbert Baker, providing a greatly extended Library. The expanded and renovated premises was formally opened on 12 November 1936 by the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Blitz had a devastating effect on the Society's Northumberland Avenue headquarters and Library. On the night of 16/17 April 1941 the building was struck by a two-ton bomb. Seventy-four people were present at the time; one member was killed and another injured, and two members of staff badly hurt. Fire ignited by the blast and the large quantity of water pumped in to extinguish it meant some unique collections were destroyed; examples, painstakingly assembled over more than seventy years, included: the Library of Overseas Law, the contents of the Newspaper Room, and sections covering the general British Empire, foreign colonies, the First World War, Malta and Gibraltar. The lost collections on the German colonial empire, the French colonial empire, the Dutch Empire, the Italian Empire, and Belgian overseas colonies - mainly in foreign languages and published overseas - were unique in the United Kingdom. Numerous early accounts of exploration, voyages and travel were likewise destroyed. Out of a collection of 260,000, total losses were estimated at approximately 35,000 books and 5,000 pamphlets. On the night of 10/11 May 1941, the hardest night of the Blitz, the Northumberland Avenue address was again severely damaged.\n\nThe Society persevered, adopting the ‘Business as Usual’ motto characteristic of Britons targeted in the Blitz. The subsequent issue of the Society's journal \"United Empire\", May-June 1941, reported the resumption of activities including its Saturday afternoon dances for members of the Overseas Armed Forces. Determined attempts were made to replace the Library’s losses, drawing helpful donations from institutions and individuals and an award from the War Damage Commission, but many items proved irreplaceable. Full restoration of the Society's Northumberland Avenue headquarters was completed in 1957; the building was officially re-opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a grand Festival organised to celebrate the event. \"The Sunday Times\" of 14 April 1957 noted that the nose of the 16/17 April 1941 bomb was displayed in a prominent position, reflecting \"the true spirit of British sportsmanship.\"\n\nThe name \"The Royal Commonwealth Society\" was adopted in 1958. Enthusiasm may seem to have surrounded the Commonwealth in the 1950s, but political tides began to flow against the Society; for example, newsroom space was taken for the fledgling Voluntary Service Overseas (1961-3), which began life under the wing of the Royal Commonwealth Society.\n\nThe Society's library, despite the damage caused by the German bombing offensive in World War II, grew to over half a million items; \"The Contemporary Review\" described the collection as \"the most comprehensive single source for the history of the world's greatest empire from its 16th century beginnings to its present fifty-nation Commonwealth.\" Cambridge University Library recognised the collection as a \"treasure-trove\" of information on the Commonwealth and Britain's former colonial territories, comprising over 300,000 printed items, about 800 archival collections (including manuscript diaries, correspondence, pictures, cine films, scrapbooks and newspaper cuttings) and over 120,000 photographs. From 1956 to 1987 the society's librarian was Donald Simpson (1920-2002), who had joined the staff in 1945. He was in advance of other librarians of his time in recognising the importance of photographs and ensured that photographic collections were identified and catalogued. He was the author of \"Dark Companions\" (1975), a book about the indigenous associates of explorers.\nFrom the late 1960s, however, increasing financial problems, combined with severe flood damage, led to the conclusion that it was no longer viable for the Society to maintain its Library. Cambridge University Library acquired the Library's collection in 1993. There had been a sign of things to come when a notable chairman of the Library, Sir Alan Burns (who in 1948 had published a study called \"Colour Prejudice\", a groundbreaking contribution to the subject), resigned from his post in protest at the Society's attempt to sell off Library books in order to supplement its income.\n\nCambridge Library's intervention enabled the Society to clear its debts and, in 1994, to redevelop the Northumberland Avenue site, to the design of architect Linda Morey Smith.\n\nBy 2012, unfortunately, financial pressures again presented a challenge. The Society found it necessary in 2013 to sell its longstanding headquarters at Northumberland Avenue, and it moved in 2014 to a new London office, at Pall Mall, London, with a view to focusing on its charitable work.\n\nThe Royal Commonwealth Society is now the centre of an international network of more than 10,000 members, spread across 100 countries and territories, and linked by around seventy self-governing Society branches and Commonwealth societies, in forty-three countries and territories. Through its educational, youth and outreach programmes, the Society aims to encourage young people to develop skills and, with an increased understanding of their role as global citizens, to engage with challenges facing the international community. It aims to bring alive the principles of the modern Commonwealth - tolerance, diversity, freedom, justice, democracy, human rights, and sustainable development - to a generation living in an increasingly interconnected world. Society projects aim to enable young people to engage with their counterparts across the Commonwealth in youth leadership programmes, and creative writing and film-making projects. Through its charitable programmes and its international network, the Society's remit is to work towards the continued growth and resilience of Commonwealth civil society.\n\nThe Society is one of three bodies supporting The Queen's Commonwealth Canopy, a project launched in 2015 to preserve and promote forested areas throughout the Commonwealth.\n\n"}

{"id": "5937432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5937432", "title": "Social learning (social pedagogy)", "text": "Social learning (social pedagogy)\n\nSocial learning (social pedagogy) is learning that takes place at a wider scale than individual or group learning, up to a societal scale, through social interaction between peers. It may or may not lead to a change in attitudes and behaviour.\n\nSocial learning is defined as learning through the observation of other people’s behaviors. It is a process of social change in which people learn from each other in ways that can benefit wider social-ecological systems. Different social contexts allow individuals to pick up new behaviors by observing what people are doing within that environment. Social learning and social pedagogy emphasize the dynamic interaction between people and the environment in the construction of meaning and identity.\n\nThe process of learning a new behaviour starts by observing a behaviour, taking the information in and finally adopting that behaviour. Examples of environmental contexts that promote social learning are schools, media, family members and friends.\n\nIf learning is to be considered as social, then it must:\nIt is a theoretical system that focuses on the development of the child and how practice and training affect their life skills. This idea is centered around the notion that children are active and competent.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau brings forth the idea that all humans are born good but are ultimately corrupted by society, implying a form of social learning.\n\nThe literature on the topic of social pedagogy tends to identify German educator Karl Mager (1810-1858) as the person who coined the term ‘social pedagogy’ in 1844. Mager and Friedrich Adolph Diesterweg shared the belief that education should go beyond the individual’s acquisition of knowledge and focus on the acquisition of culture by society. Ultimately, it should benefit the community itself.\n\nDevelopmental psychology focused on the theories of behaviorism from B.F. Skinner and Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory to explain how humans learn new behaviours.\n\nThe founding father of social pedagogy, German philosopher and educator Paul Natorp (1854-1924) published the book \"Sozialpädagogik: Theorie der Willensbildung auf der Grundlage der Gemeinschaft\" (Social Pedagogy: The theory of educating the human will into a community asset) in 1899. Natorp argued that in all instances, pedagogy should be social. Teachers should consider the interaction between educational and societal processes.\n\nThe field of developmental psychology underwent significant changes during these decades as social learning theories started to gain traction through the research and experiments of Psychologists such as Julian Rotter, Albert Bandura and Robert Sears. In 1954, Julian Rotter developed his social learning theory which linked human behavior changes with environmental interactions. Predictable variables were behavior potential, expectancy, reinforcement value and psychological situation. Bandura conducted his bobo doll experiment in 1961 and developed his social learning theory in 1977. These contributions to the field of developmental psychology cemented a strong knowledge foundation and allowed researchers to build on and expand our understanding of human behavior.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712 - 1778), with his book \"Emile, or On Education\", introduced his pedagogic theory where the child should be brought up in harmony with nature. The child should be introduced to society only during the fourth stage of development, the age of moral self-worth (15 to 18 years of age). That way, the child enters society in an informed and self-reliable manner, with one's own judgment. Rousseau's conceptualization of childhood and adolescence is based on his theory that human beings are inherently good but corrupted a society that denaturalize them. Rousseau is the precursor of the child-centered approach in education.\n\nKarl Mager (1810 - 1858) is often identified as the one who coined the term social pedagogy. He held the belief that education should focus on the acquisition of knowledge but also of culture through society and should orient its activities to benefit the community. It also implies that knowledge should not solely come from individuals but also from the larger concept of society.\n\nPaul Natorp (1854 - 1924) was a German philosopher and educator. In 1899, he published \"Sozialpädagogik: Theorie der Willensbildung auf der Grundlage der Gemeinschaft\" (Social Pedagogy: The theory of educating the human will into a community asset). According to him, education should be social, thus an interaction between educational and social processes. Natorp believed in the model of Gemeinshaft (small community) in order to build universal happiness and achieve true humanity. At the time, philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Immanuel Kant were preoccupied by the structure of society and how it may influence human interrelations. Philosophers were not solely thinking of the child as an individual but rather at what he/she can bring to creating human togetherness and societal order.\n\nNatorp's perspective was influenced by Plato's ideas about the relation between the individual and the city-state (\"polis\"). The \"polis\" is a social and political structure of society that, according to Plato, allows individuals to maximize their potential. It is strictly structured with classes serving others and philosopher kings setting universal laws and truths for all. Furthermore, Plato argued for the need to pursue intellectual virtues rather than personal advancements such as wealth and reputation. Natorp's interpretation of the concept of the \"polis\" is that an individual will want to serve his/her community and state after having been educated, as long as the education is social (\"Sozialpädagogik).\"\n\nNatorp focused on education for the working class as well as social reform. His view of social pedagogy outlined that education is a social process and social life is an educational process. Social pedagogic practices are a deliberative and rational form of socialization. Individuals become social human beings by being socialized into society. Social pedagogy involves teachers and children sharing the same social spaces.\n\nHerman Nohl (1879 - 1960) was a German pedagogue of the first half of the twentieth century. He interpreted reality from a hermeneutical perspective (methodological principles of interpretation) and tried to expose the causes of social inequalities. According to Nohl, social pedagogy's aim is to foster the wellbeing of student by integrating into society youth initiatives, programs and efforts. Teachers should be advocates for the welfare of their students and contribute to the social transformations it entails. Nohl conceptualized a holistic educative process that takes into account the historical, cultural, personal and social contexts of any given situation.\n\nRobert Richardson Sears (1908 - 1989) focused his research mostly on the stimulus-response theory. Much of his theoretical effort was expended on understanding the way children come to internalize the values, attitudes, and behaviours of the culture in which they are raised. Just like Albert Bandura, he focused most of his research on aggression, but also on the growth of resistance to temptation and guilt, and the acquisition of culturally-approved sex-role behaviors. Sears wanted to prove the importance of the place of parents in the child's education, concentrating on features of parental behaviour that either facilitated or hampered the process. Such features include both general relationship variables such as parental warmth and permissiveness and specific behaviours such as punishment in the form of love withdrawal and power assertion.\n\nAlbert Bandura advanced the social learning theory by including the individual and the environment in the process of learning and imitating behaviour. In other words, children and adults learn or change behaviours by imitating behaviours observed in others. Albert Bandura mentions that the environment plays an important role as it is the stimuli that triggers the learning process. For example, according to Bandura (1978), people learn aggressive behaviour through 3 sources: Family members, community and mass media. Research shows that parent who prefer aggressive solution to solve their problems tend to have children who use aggressive tactics to deal with other people. Research also found that communities in which fighting prowess are valued have a higher rate of aggressive behaviour. Also, findings show that watching televisions can have at least 4 different effect on people: 1) it teaches aggressive style of conduct, 2) it alters restraints over aggressive behavior,3) it desensitizes and habituate people to violence and 4) it shapes people’s image of reality. The environment also allows people to learn through another person’s experience. For example, students don’t cheat on exams (at least no openly) because they know the consequences of it, even if they never experienced the consequences themselves\n\nHowever, still according to Banduras, the learning process does not stop at the influence of the family, community and media, the internal process (individual thoughts, values, etc.) will determine at which frequency and which intensity an individual will imitate and adopt a certain behaviour. Indeed, parents plays an important role in a child’s education for two reasons: Firstly, because of the frequency and intensity of the interactions and secondly because the children often admire their parent and often take them as role models. Therefore, even if the stimuli is the parents' interactions with their children, if their child did not admire them, their children would not reproduce their behaviour as often. That is the main difference between early social learning theory and Bandura’s point of view. This principle is called reciprocal determinism, which means that the developmental process is bidirectional, and that the individual has to value his environment in order to learn for it. Bandura also states that this process starts at births; indeed, research shows that infants are more receptive to certain experiences and less to others. Albert Bandura also says that most human behaviours are driven by goals and that we regulate our behaviour through weighing the benefits and the troubles that we can get into because of a particular behaviour.\n\nSocial learning and social pedagogy has proven its efficiency with the application in practical professions, like nursing, where the student can observe a trained professional in a professional/work settings, and they can learn about nursing throughout all its aspects: interactions, attitudes, co-working skills and the nursing job itself. Students who have taken part in social learning state that they increased their nursing skills, and that it could only be possible with a good learning environment, a good mentor, and a student who is assertive enough. It means that social learning can be achieved with a good mentor, but one needs to be a good listener too. This mentoring experience creates what Albert Bandura called observational learning, when students observe a well-trained model/teacher and the students's knowledge and understanding increase.\n\nExperiences in the field for student teachers are a good way to show how social pedagogy and social learning contribute to one's education. Indeed, field experiences are part of a student's life in their route to their teaching degree. Field experiences are based on the social learning theory; a student follows a teacher for some time, at first observing the cooperating teacher and taking notes about the teaching act. The second part of the field experience is actual teaching, and receiving feedback from the role model and the students. The student teachers try as much as they can to imitate what they have learned by observing their cooperating teacher.\n\nCyberbullying being an issue in schools, social pedagogy can be a solution to decrease this trend. Indeed, the bullied pupil can build a relationship with a particular mentor or role model, which in return can empower the student to deal with issues such as cyberbullying. This can work both on the victim and the bully, since both may lack confidence and affection. Using social pedagogy instead of punishments and reactive actions is also a way to derive from the traditional model of raising children, and teaching, which relies on punishments and rewards.\n\nParent education is also based on social learning. From birth, children look at their parents and try to model what they do, how they talk, and what they think. Of course, a child’s environment is much larger than only their familiar environment, but it is an influential part. A study by Dubanoski and Tanabe, was made on parenting and social learning, where parents had to attend classes that would teach them social learning principles to improve their children’s behaviour. The classes taught the parents how to record objectively their children’s behaviour, and to deal with them by teaching the correct behaviour, not by punishing the wrong one. A significant number of parents improve their children behaviour by the end of the study.\n\nThe issue of how long social learning takes is important for the design of learning initiatives, teaching experiences and policy interventions. The process of going beyond individual learning to a broader understanding situated in a community of practice can take some time to develop. A longitudinal case study in Australia looked at an environmental group concerned about land degradation. The whole project was led by a local committee, Wallatin Wildlife and Landcare. They wanted to \"encourage social learning among landholders through field visits, focus groups, and deliberative processes to balance innovative 'thinking outside the box' with judicious use of public funds\". They found that social learning was documented after approximately fifteen months, but was initially restricted to an increased understanding of the problem without improved knowledge to address it. Further knowledge necessary to address the problem in focus emerged during the third year of the program. This suggests that learning initiatives could take around three years to develop sufficient new knowledge embedded in a community of practice in order to address complex problems.\n\nSocial pedagogy is in fact the interaction between society and the individual, which create a learning experience. Therefore, if talking about the current development of social pedagogy and social learning, the recent trend in term of learning in our society, is the use of social media and other forms of technology. On one side, if well designed within an educational framework, social media can surely help with the development of certain essential skills:\n\n\nTherefore, it can be seen that social media can be extremely useful for developing some of the key skills needed in this digital age. For instance, “the main feature of social media is that they empower the end user to access, create, disseminate and share information easily in a user-friendly, open environment\". By using social media, the learning experience becomes easier and more accessible to all. By allowing social media in the pedagogical program of our young students, it could help them to grow and fully participate in our digital society.\n\nWith the growing use of technology and different social platform in many aspects of our life, we can use social media at work and at home as well as in schools. It can be seen that social media now enables teachers to set online group work, based on cases or projects, and students can collect data in the field, without any need for direct face-to-face contact with either the teacher or other students.\n\nThe benefits of social media in education stipulate how easier the communication between individuals becomes. However, others will argue that it excludes the vital tacit knowledge that direct, face-to-face interpersonal contact enables, and that social learning is bound up with physical and spatial learning. Social learning includes sharing experiences and working with others. Social media facilitates those experiences but make it less effective by eliminating the physical interaction between individuals. The more time students spend on social sites, the less time they spend socializing in person. Because of the lack of nonverbal cues, like tone and inflection, the use of social media is not an adequate replacement for face-to-face communication. Students who spend a great amount of time on social networking sites are less effective at communicating in person.\n\nWith the omnipresence of technology in our life and the easy access to unlimited source of information, the difference between using technology as a tool and not as an end in itself needs to be understood.\n\n\nThe following are links that will help researchers locate additional information about editing social pedagogy.\n\n\n"}

Founded in Connecticut in early 2009, SAFE \"facilitates the professional development of aviation educators [and] seeks to create a safer aviation environment through enhanced education.\" SAFE is governed by a Board of Directors composed of nine members, all of whom are elected by the SAFE membership in a rotating three year cycle.\n\nSAFE introduced scenario-based training into aviation in 2009 with the creation of the Pilot Proficiency Program. Using the (then brand new) Redbird Flight Simulator, this program challenged pilots with adventurous skill and risk-management story lines. This program expanded to become the popular (EAA) Pilot Proficiency Center that is a highlight of AirVenture every year. \n\nIn 2011 SAFE transformed the flight training system in the United States with the Pilot Training Reform Symposium. This meeting attracted users, partners and major FAA officials including FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt and led to extensive changes in FAA guidance and policy. One significant outcome of this symposium was the introduction of the Airman Testing Standards (ACS) in June 2016. This revolutionary change introduced the third pillar of flight safety, risk management, into the previous skill and knowledge test requirements of the Practical Test Standards (PTS). The ACS also integrated the knowledge and flight testing components into a more efficient and valid evaluation formatted into a real-life scenario structure. \n\nSAFE was also revolutionary in developing their own aviation educator insurance program to protect their members. This program, launched in collaboration with STARR insurance, provides comprehensive insurance specifically for flight instructors, including all categories and class aircraft they are rated to fly. Significant discounts are available to Master Flight Instructors and FAA Wings participants to incentivize professional development and the pursuit of excellence. \n\nSAFE has signed letters of understanding with a number of organizations, including Cessna Aircraft Company and the FAA Safety Team. SAFE is also a sponsor of the General Aviation Awards Program. The organization is proactive on issues that affect aviation educators and has partnered with others to develop a mentoring program for aviation educators. In July 2010, SAFE launched a flight instructor liability insurance program developed for its member-instructors. In November 2010, SAFE announced plans to chair the GA Pilot Training Reform Symposium.\n"}

In academic contexts the full form, socioeconomic decile or socioeconomic decile band may be used.\n\nThis system was initially implemented in 1995, but its exact nature has changed since then. In 2017, the then-current Fifth National Government announced plans to replace it \"...as early as 2019...\" by a system of targeted funding based on how many \"at risk\" children a particular schools has enrolled.\n\nA school's socioeconomic decile is recalculated by the Ministry of Education every five years, using data collected after each New Zealand census of Population and Dwellings. Current deciles came into force in 2008 following the 2006 census. Following the 2013 census (delayed two years due to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake), work started to determine new school deciles in time for the beginning of the 2015 school year. They are calculated between censuses for new schools and merged schools, and other schools may move up or down one decile with school openings, mergers and closures to ensure each decile contains 10 percent of all schools.\n\nBefore the deciles are calculated, Statistics New Zealand calculates the following factors in each individual meshblock (the smallest census unit, consisting of about 50 households each), disregarding any household in the meshblock that does not have school-aged children:\n\n\nEach school provides a list of the addresses of its students to determine which meshblocks are used. For each of the five factors, the average for the school is found by adding together the factor in each of the applicable meshblocks, adjusting for the number of students at the school living in each meshblock. All schools in New Zealand are then listed in order for each factor, and given a percentile for that factor. The percentiles for each factor are then added together to give a score out of 500. When the score is ordered, the list of schools is divided into ten, giving one of the ten deciles.\n\nThis gives a broad measure of the relative poverty, or aggregated socioeconomic (or social class), of the parents or care-givers of students at the school, with decile 1 schools being the 10% of schools with the lowest socioeconomic communities and decile 10 schools being at the other end of the scale.\n\nNote that some types of schools acquire a decile rating regardless of the socioeconomic status of the school community. For example, teen-parent units always \"belong\" in decile 1, because of the inherent effect teenage pregnancy and parenthood has on teen parents' socioeconomic status, regardless whether the teen-parent unit is in a high SES area or attached to a high-decile school.\n\nDecile ratings apply only for the funding of compulsory education, but a number of different central-government funding-streams and support services to schools are strongly affected by the decile rating of a school, with more funding available to lower-decile schools. The funding and support measures include:\n\n\nFor the 2015 year, the decile-based funding rates are as follows:\nStatistical data about primary and secondary schools and their students can be broken down into socioeconomic deciles. For example, data released by the Ministry of Education shows correlations between high decile schools and higher rates of attaining NCEA Level 2, higher rates of tertiary education entrance, and lower rates of truancy. (Note that socioeconomic decile alone does not necessarily cause these statistics).\n\nThe following table lists the decile ratings of thirty state secondary schools in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.\nThe decile system has come in for criticism from teacher and principal associations in recent years for fomenting destructive competition between schools and the exacerbation of white flight. Data from the Ministry of Education indicated that 60,000 Pakeha/NZ European students attended low-decile schools in 2000, but that number had halved by 2010, while high-decile schools had a corresponding increase in Pakeha students. The Ministry claimed demographic changes were behind the shifts, but the Secondary Principals Association and PPTA have attributed white flight to racial and class stigmas of low-decile schools, which commonly have majority Maori and Pacific Islander rolls.\n\nA visiting Fulbright Scholar, Professor Chris Lubienski, carried out research that found discrepancies in 36 of the 49 secondary school zones in Auckland. According to Prof Lubienski, principals of schools in the 36 zones anonymously confessed to deliberately skewing their zone boundaries, in order to encourage the enrolment of students from wealthier backgrounds, while preventing the enrolment of poorer students to these schools. In response, Mount Albert Grammar School headmaster Dale Burden countered that school zones \"cannot be easily manipulated and changing them is a transparent process\". The Ministry of Education issued the following statement:\n\n\"The purpose of an enrolment zone is to ensure the selection of applicants for enrolment is fair and transparent and makes the best use of the school network.<br>\n\"As far as possible, an enrolment scheme must not exclude local students so that no more students are excluded from a school than is necessary to avoid over-crowding.<br>\n\"The ministry has recently updated guidelines on enrolments zones. They make clear that before drawing up an enrolment zone boards are required to consult parents and the wider community as well as other schools.<br>\n\"Householder income should not be considered when zones are drawn up.<br>\n\"The law requires a board to ensure all students can attend a reasonably convenient school while ensuring other schools do not experience enrolment problems.<br>\n\"If a school board is unable to agree a boundary arrangement the ministry can step in to resolve the matter. If necessary, the ministry has powers to require a board to amend a proposed enrolment zone.\"'\n\nIn July 2017 Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced plans to replace the system \"...as early as 2019...\" by a system of targeted funding based on how many \"at risk\" children a particular schools has enrolled – but few details are yet known.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2275505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275505", "title": "Swaraj", "text": "Swaraj\n\nSwarāj ( \"swa-\" \"self\", \"raj\" \"rule\") can mean generally self-governance or \"self-rule\", and was used synonymously with \"home-rule\" by Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati and later on by Mohandas Gandhi, but the word usually refers to Gandhi's concept for Indian independence from foreign domination. Swaraj lays stress on governance, not by a hierarchical government, but by self governance through individuals and community building. The focus is on political decentralisation. Since this is against the political and social systems followed by Britain, Gandhi's concept of Swaraj advocated India's discarding British political, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military, and educational institutions. S. Satyamurti, Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru were among a contrasting group of Swarajists who laid the foundation for parliamentary democracy in India.\n\nAlthough Gandhi's aim of totally implementing the concepts of Swaraj in India was not achieved, the voluntary work organisations which he founded for this purpose did serve as precursors and role models for people's movements, voluntary organisations, and some of the non-governmental organisations that were subsequently launched in various parts of India. The student movement against oppressive local and central governments, led by Jayaprakash Narayan, and the Bhoodan movement, which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India, and which ultimately led to India's discarding of the Zamindari system of land tenure and social organisation, were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj.\n\nSwami Dayanand Saraswati, founder of the Arya Samaj and a Hindu reformer, defined \"swaraj\" as the \"administration of self\" or \"democracy\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, \"swaraj\" was the basis for freedom fighting. Dadabhai Navroji said that he had learnt the word \"swaraj\" from the \"Satyarth Prakash\" of Saraswati.\n\nSwaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a \"soulless machine\" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind. The \"raison d'etre\" of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus in South Africa and in India strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the Congress and its leaders confirmed his fears about the corrupting influence of political power and his skepticism about the efficacy of the party systems of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the British parliamentary systems convinced him that representative democracy was incapable of meting out justice to people.\n\nGandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action).\n\nAlthough the word \"Swaraj\" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: \"At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.\" Politically, swaraj is self-government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with \"moksha\" or salvation.\n\nAdopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: \"Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time.\" This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own self and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: \"In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.\" He summarised the core principle like this: \"It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves.\"\n\nGandhi explained his vision in 1946: \n\nGandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a utopian vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: \"It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realisable in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want before we can have something approaching it.\"\n\nAfter Gandhi's assassination Vinoba Bhave formed the Sarva Seva Sangh at the national level and Sarvodya Mandals at the regional level to the carry on integrated village service — with the end purpose of achieving the goal of Swaraj. Two major nonviolent movements for socio-economic and political revolution in India: the Bhoodan movement led by Vinoba Bhave and the Total Revolution movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan were actually formed under the aegis of the ideas of Swaraj. These movements had some success, but due to the socialist tendencies of Nehruvian India were not able to unleash the kind of revolution that was aimed at.\n\nGandhi's model of Swaraj was almost entirely discarded by the Indian government.

The model has two basic tenets: educational freedom and democratic governance. Small and independent, The Beach School was a community of self-motivated learners, aged 4–19, who determined their own curriculum, and each had an equal voice in school governance. Located at 42 Edgewood Ave near Kingston Road and Dundas Street East, the school opened in the fall of 2003 and closed in June 2008 owing to a shortage of students. The Beach School was incorporated as a co-operative and, at the time of closing, was one of two Sudbury schools in Canada; the only one in Ontario.\n\nSome participants of The Beach School are part of a group attempting to open a similar school called Reach Sudbury School of Toronto.\n\nModelled after the Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts, which opened in 1968, The Beach School community believed that learning which is initiated and pursued by the learner happens naturally, meaningfully, and enduringly. As such, there was no set curriculum at the school; instead individual curiosity and self-initiation directed learning. Beach School students were trusted with their own education and were free to draw from the school’s resources as much or as little as they saw fit. The Beach School encouraged self-evaluation; there were no grades, tests, or assignments unless desired. This educational approach was based on the Sudbury belief that everyone is instinctively curious; therefore, when trusted to do so, they will discover independently the knowledge and experiences they need, becoming self-aware and resourceful in the process.\n\nBecause the Ontario Ministry of Education does not fund independent schools, The Beach School charged tuition in order to fund the basic operations of the school. The decision on what amount to charge was made each year by the assembly. The Beach School was recognized by the Children’s First Foundation through the Fraser Institute, which provides grants for education to disadvantaged families.\n\n\n"}

It is the second sequel to \"The Substitute\" (1996). The film was later released on DVD and in 2000 it bundled with the first film.\n\nStudents at a local college have become unusually antagonistic, and when a teacher is attacked by a gang of steroid-pumped students, Karl Thomasson—having earned a teacher's degree to facilitate his actions in the previous film—returns to the classroom to uncover the truth.\n\nWhat he finds is shocking: the college's football coach is involved in a steroid-doping scandal, and his 'juiced' students were responsible for the attack on the teacher. Thomasson recruits his old team, planting surveillance equipment in a jukebox inside a local sports-bar that hosts a number of the coach's football players.\n\nIt turns out that the coach was doping his players, and rigging football games, to pay off his backers—a local crime syndicate. When the audio equipment draws the attention of the syndicate's thugs, one of Karl's team is killed in the van, and Karl's calm and collected mask begins to slip.\n\nWhen one of Thomasson's students dies from a steroid overdose, Thomasson finally loses his jovial nature, confronting the coach and telling him that he knows how the student died, that he knows the coach is responsible, and that he has audiotape to prove his allegations.\n\nIn one last showdown, Karl defeats the syndicate and reveals the doping scandal—as he leaves, and the credits roll, a radio news report reveals that the football coach committed suicide in disgrace.\n\n"}

Its additional aim is to increase the adoption of free and open-source computing platforms, like itself, within higher education and secondary schools. It is designed around a \"core academic skills approach to student success,\" which it describes as \"the research and writing, reading, studying, and self-management skills that are essential to all students regardless of their academic major.\"\nUberStudent has been described by reviewers as \"highly in tune with student needs\", \"loaded with student-friendly tools and customizations\", \"perfect for the higher education environment\", succeeding at its aims \"with aplomb, elegance, and power\", \"a smart pick for getting your actual schoolwork done\", and \"fantastic and delicious\". It received a positive review in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", which cited UberStudent's completeness for doing core academic work, user-friendliness, and free and open-source nature. Sixty days after UberStudent's official 15 July 2010 release of UberStudent 1.0 Cicero Full Edition, its first non-beta, DistroWatch ranked it the most popular Linux distribution for education worldwide and the 32nd most popular overall out of the 316 varied distributions tracked by the organization. Weeks after the 4.1 release, it ranked as the fifth-most popular Linix distribution in the world.\n\nUberStudent's current release is 4.3, dubbed Heraclitus. The distribution uses its own dedicated software repository. It can be run from a live CD or USB flash drive, or installed on to a computer's harddrive from either one of those mediums.\n\n5.0 is being delayed due to Stephen Ewen's son being diagnosed with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nUberStudent's founder and lead developer is Stephen Ewen, a U.S.-based educator who specializes in postsecondary literacy, academic success strategies, and educational technology. He began UberStudent, he has said, as \"a way to place a set of smart and dedicated computing tools, and just the right amount of support, into the hands of students, whether currently within higher education or preparing for it in secondary school.\" His stated goal through UberStudent is for students to \"learn to really excel at the core skills and habits they need to become everything they can academically be, and on into professional life.\" Ewen has stated that UberStudent is, in part, inspired by his own experiences achieving top academic performance with the assistance of educational technology. \n\nEwen has described UberStudent's overarching design philosophy as one that provides a \"unified system for learning, doing, and teaching academic success\". Within this, he has said that UberStudent takes what he calls a \"core academic skills\" approach, which he has delineated as \"the skills in research and writing, studying, and self-management required of students across all academic majors\". He has stated that UberStudent can be \"easily extended\" for specific majors via additional software. Ewen has additionally asserted that, in part due to UberStudent's open source and cross-platform nature, as well as its Unix-like base, it is geared to produce \"computer fluency\" among its users as a \"more or less natural outcome\".\n\nEwen has argued that academic institutions can increase both their student learning outcomes and economic efficiency by more broadly adopting open source application and system software for everyday student academic computing needs. He has additionally argued for academic institutions to increase their involvement in developing open source tools, such as UberStudent, citing successes such as the bibliographic manager Zotero by George Mason University, included among UberStudent's set of core academic programs.\n\nNearly all of UberStudent's software is free and open-source and its core programs cross-platform so its adopters can avoid vendor lock-in, whether with Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. The tech review site Dedoimedo reviewed UberStudent as containing a \"superb\" collection of \"smartly selected\" programs, \"probably the best when it comes to serious work\", with each \"stitched into the fabric of the operating system\". Tech columnist Jack Wallen said UberStudent \"contains so many education-specific tools you will be spending your first days with it just marveling at what the developers have packed into one single operating system.\"\n\nUberStudent's core programs for academic work are clustered within an applications menu entry, Education, where they are organized by sub-categories, including for Reading, Research and Writing, Self-Management, Study Aids, Subjects, and Utilities, which themselves have sub-categories. In addition to its academic-specific application set, reviewers have noted UberStudent's inclusion of templates for academic work and \"tons\" of on-board how-to guides as \"welcome additions\" that are \"often missing\" from other operating systems. UberStudent also contains a full range of student-oriented programs in the Multimedia, Games, Graphics, Internet, and several other categories. Within a separate menu, it contains select cloud computing applications that have been described as containing additions \"you don't often see elsewhere\".\n\nWithin its stated intent to couple user-friendliness with security and stability, UberStudent production releases are based on Xubuntu Long Term Stable releases, which stems from the Debian of Linux. UberStudent also includes numerous self-developed programs, as well as its own Update Manager and the Deb file format to manage and update its platform.\n\nUberStudent main editions are distributed as a DVD image or pre-made disc. The full edition features the Xfce desktop environment, and the lightweight edition the LXDE desktop environment. The LXDE lightweight edition is greatly scaled down and is intended solely \"to re-invigorate low-specification or older computers\" and fits on a single CD.\n\nAmid his decision to feature Xfce in UberStudent full editions, Ewen stated that \"UberStudent must prefer stability, dependability, and traditional usability over the novel when it comes to such a major thing as the basic desktop environments it uses; and it will.\"\n\nDuring UberStudent's 2.0 release cycle, Ewen criticized the designs of both the Ubuntu Unity and GNOME 3 Shell Linux desktop environments as hindrances to student academic computing productivity. In a 2011 April Fools' Day satire, he announced an \"UberStudent Dumbed Down Edition\" featuring the GNOME 3 Shell. Pointing to what he called \"the enforced helplessness\" leading to \"learned helplessness\" that he says the GNOME 3 developers designed into their new desktop environment, he stated that the intent behind the spoof UberStudent edition was to \"obscure what is not obvious and easy so it can be continually avoided\" by students and thus never learned. In a May 2011 interview, Ewen expanded his criticisms of Unity and GNOME 3 by citing specific usability issues, and stated that UberStudent had no plans to adopt either Unity or the GNOME 3 Shell.\n\nAmid UberStudent's 3.0 release cycle, Ewen criticized the Cinnamon desktop environment, developed by Linux Mint, pointing out what he called \"major shortcomings\" in Cinnamon, which he stipulated as its failure to honor certain fundamental freedesktop.org standards. Ewen stated that, while the desktop environment holds promise, \"Cinnamon as of its full May 2013 version 1.8 release is actually beta-quality software.\" As such, he characterized Cinnamon as \"not at all yet suited for a serious and stable workstation.\n\nAccording to Ewen, \"UberStudent dubs each of its major releases after a famous historical thinker\", a practice he describes as \"only fitting\" in light of UberStudent's educational mission. So far, the thinkers have been Greek and Roman. UberStudent's version 0.9, the first beta, was released on 15 January 2010 and named after Thales. Version 1.0, released on 15 July 2010, was named after Cicero. 1.0 also had a brief pre-release edition, once inadvertently reviewed as the release edition. UberStudent 1.0 Cicero Lightweight Edition was released on 4 September 2010 and inherited the name Cicero from the full edition. UberStudent 2.0 was dubbed \"Plato,\" UberStudent 3.0 was dubbed \"Aristotle,\" and the 4.0 release \"Socrates. The current release, 4.3, is dubbed \"Heraclitus.\"\n\n5.0 is being delayed do to his son being diagnosed with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nLink to the post:\n\nhttp://uberstudent.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1315\n\n\n"}
