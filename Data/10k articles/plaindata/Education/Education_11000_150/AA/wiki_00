Established in 1919 by the Parliament of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the University started with faculties of history and philology; physics and mathematics; law and medicine with an initial enrollment of 1094. The first rector of BSU was V.I.Razumovsky, a former professor of surgery at Kazan University.\n\nIn 1930, the government ordered the University shut down in accordance with a reorganization of higher education, and the University was replaced with the Supreme Pedagogical Institute. However, in 1934 the University was reestablished again, and continued to work through the difficult years of World War II experiencing a shortage of faculty members.\n\nBy its 40th anniversary in 1959, the University already had 13 faculties. The Azerbaijan Medical University and Azerbaijan State Economic University were both spun-offs of the original respective faculties at BSU.\n\nAmong the graduates of BSU were two former presidents of Azerbaijan, Abulfaz Elchibey and Heydar Aliyev. The former graduated from the Faculty of Arabic Language and Literature, while the latter, who dominated Azerbaijan's political life for over 30 years, from the Faculty of History. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Lev Landau studied at BSU between 1922 and 1924.\n\nBSU is the only university from Azerbaijan Republic ranked by international ranking organizations, such as University Ranking by Academic Performance and currently ranks at 1872 in the University Ranking by Academic Performance.\n\nBSU was established on September 1, 1919 by the decision of the Parliament of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. In its first year, the university had two faculties — Faculty of Philology and the Medical Faculty — and an enrollment of 1094 students.\n\nAmong the leading professors in 1920-40 were Azerbaijani writer Abdurrahim bek Haqverdiyev, Orientalist Professor P.K. Juze, Professor A.O. Makovelski, Professor A.O. Mishel and other scholars. During that period the administration of the university invited to Baku such teachers as N.Y. Marr, V.V. Bartold, the academician of the Eastern Science Academy Fuad bek Kuprulluzade.\n\nIn 1930 the university was liquidated according to the decision made by Council of the People’s Commissar on reorganization. The High Pedagogical Institute was created. Only in 1943 the state university resumed its activity and very soon became the republic’s scientific-pedagogical center. Despite the great shortage of university teachers because most of teachers went to the Second World War, the university managed to keep its leading position. In 1945 the teachers took an active part in founding the Azerbaijan Academy of Science. Most of the republic's universities — such as Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan University of Economy, Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University and others — were founded on the basis of Baku State University.\n\nThe years after 1969 can be considered as the years of development in the direction of knowledge and science. Covering a wide historical period, in those years there were founded faculties on modern specialties, departments and about 30 scientific research laboratories started. As a result, there was created a strong assurance of future development. University began to develop further after Heydar Aliyev came to power. Modern specialities, departments and scientific laboratories started to operate at university. With its rich historical background, Baku State University has always been a major scientific and educational center of Azerbaijan. Famous scientists, intellectuals and politicians and Azerbaijan's outstanding politician, Heydar Aliyev graduated from Baku State University. Currently, Baku State University has 16 majors with 55 bachelor and 153 master's degrees.\n\nThrough time, the university builds its international relations. Currently BSU has membership in various associations and institutions as Association of Universities of Eurasia, which unites most universities of the former USSR. Between 2002-2004, BSU led the Association of Universities of Black Sea States. Furthermore, the university has signed agreements on scientific and technical co-operation, student-teacher exchange programs with Moscow State University, Middle East Technical University, Nice-Sofia Antipole University, Indiana University, Kiyev National University, Vienna University and other high-ranking universities.\n\nAs a result of these collaborations, the university holds joint scientific conferences, workshops as well as publishing of textbooks.\n\n\nAcademic Council of Baku State University aims to contribute to the education, its quality, representation of university as well as establishment of international relations. The council mainly focuses on the following issues: \n\n\n\n\nThe university is a member of the Caucasus University Association.\n\n\n"}

It related to \"certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\", was decided by the European Court of Human Rights in 1968.\n\nThe applicants submitted six applications (Applications No: 1474/62, 1677/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, 2126/64) between 1962 and 1964 on their own behalf and on the behalf of their children, alleging that Belgian linguistic legislation, relating to education, infringed on their rights under the European Convention, namely Article 8 (family life) in conjunction with Article 14 (non-discrimination), and Article 2 of the Protocol 1 (right to education) of March 1952. \nThe Acts they brought litigation against basically stated the language of education shall be Dutch in the Dutch-speaking region, French in the French-speaking region and German in the German-speaking region.\n\nThe applicants, whose children totalled more than 800, asserted that the law of the Dutch-speaking regions where they lived did not include adequate provisions for French-language education. They also complained that the Belgian state withheld grants from institutions in these regions that did not comply with the linguistic provisions set out in the legislation for schools and refused to homologate certificates issued by these institutions. Further, the state did not allow the applicants’ children to attend French classes in certain places, forcing applicants to enrol their children in local schools, contrary to their aspirations, or send them further afield, which entailed risks and hardships.\n\nThe Government argued that the right to education in one’s own language was not included in the Convention and the Protocol, and that the applicants did not belong to a national minority within the meaning of Article 14.\n\nThe Court found by a majority of 8 to 7 that one of the Acts violated Art 14. But the Court also found unanimously that there had been no breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, and Article 2 of the protocol, with regard to the other contested legislation and points at issue. In reaching its decision the Court considered that the principle of equality of treatment enshrined in Article 14 was violated if the distinction had no objective and reasonable justification, did not pursue a legitimate aim, and was not proportionate to the aim pursued. Further to this, the Court opined that the right to education implied the right to be educated in the national language, and did not include the provision that the parent’s linguistic preferences be respected.\n\nThe operative part of the Court's judgment read as follows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47781139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47781139", "title": "Board of Education v. Walters", "text": "Board of Education v. Walters\n\nBoard of Education v. Walters was a 1979 Ohio Supreme Court case relating to the funding of primary and secondary schools in Ohio. The Court ruled that the method of funding public schools at the time was constitutional despite disparities in per-pupil education spending between different districts. Article VI of the Ohio Constitution states that the state must provide an \"adequate system of public schools.\" The ruling overturned a previous trial court ruling that the State's school-funding system violated the Constitution of Ohio's requirement of providing a thorough and efficient system of public education. \"Board of Education v. Walters\" is one of the cases that played a role leading to \"DeRolph v. State of Ohio\" in 1997, which found the model of funding for public schools in Ohio to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe plaintiffs of this case brought suit claiming that Ohio held the responsibility to fund its public schools. The Cincinnati school board filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Ohio school districts that believed they were underfunded. The plaintiffs believed that the system of funding, a mixture of state and local funding, violated the constitutional requirement to provide sufficient funding to operate a school district. Furthermore, they argued that forcing a school district to adequately fund its district violated the education provisions of the State Constitution. At the trial court level, the method of funding for public schools was deemed unconstitutional. However, on appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court reversed that decision and upheld the constitutionality of the school funding method.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court justices argued that despite the inequalities that existed between school districts in terms of funding and ability to raise local revenue, there was no basis to strike down the funding method. They agreed with the defendant, in this case the Cincinnati Board of Education, that local control of school districts served as a rationale to defend the funding inequalities. The court stated that the local control of school districts \"meant not only the freedom to devote more money to the education of one's children but also control over and participation in the decision-making process as to how those local tax dollars are to be spent.\"\n\nThe court did not answer the questions of whether the Ohio General Assembly at the time fulfilled their constitutional requirement to provide a \"thorough and efficient\" system of public schools, despite the trial court's ruling stating that the Assembly did not. Furthermore, the court declined to state what constitutes a \"thorough and efficient\" system of public education. By leaving these questions unanswered, whether intentionally or not, the court allowed for the school funding model to be revisited in future court cases.\n\nIn addition, the court defended their decision by explaining that the state had taken steps to close the disparities in school funding. The state of Ohio gave extra money to school districts that levied 20 mills of property tax up to a maximum of 30 mills. The court used this rationale to explain that the inequalities were not unconstitutional because the state made an effort to even out funding through that policy. Despite upholding the method of funding, the court kept the possibility of further court cases regarding education funding alive. The Court stated that the structure of funding would become unconstitutional if a school district failed to receive enough funding from all sources that it could not operate adequately. This made it possible for the funding of schools in Ohio to be struck down in the case \"DeRolph v. State\".\n"}

It was founded in 1919, shortly after the creation of Czechoslovakia. It is named after Jan Amos Comenius, a 17th-century Czech teacher and philosopher.\n\nIn 2006, Comenius University had more than 30,000 students and 2,000 faculty members. As are most universities in Slovakia, it is funded mostly by the government. Although there have been plans to establish tuition fees for university students in Slovakia for years, another attempt failed to gain sufficient support in parliament in May 2005.\n\nThe Comenius University was established in 1919 with assistance from the more established University of Prague. It was meant to replace the former Elisabeth University which was located in Bratislava since 1912 as the latter has been forcefully disbanded in 1919 by Samuel Zoch, plenipotentiary župan of Slovakia, at that time in the First Czechoslovak Republic. This has caused the majority of the university's professors (and some of the students) to take refuge in Budapest, where the Elisabeth University was reestablished. It has been later moved to Pécs and renamed to University of Pécs. This persecution of former (predominantly Hungarian) pillars of education in Bratislava necessitated the recruitment of Czech academicians. Therefore, many professors of the newly established university, including its first rector, Prof. MUDr. Kristian Hynek, were Czechs, since Slovakia at that time did not have enough educated Slovak speakers who could serve as faculty members. In spite of personnel, financial, and space difficulties, the university developed research and teaching programs. The Faculty of Medicine opened in 1919, and was quickly followed by the Faculties of Law and Philosophy in 1921. The Faculty of Philosophy, besides offering programs in the humanities and social science, also educated much-needed teachers for Slovakia's high schools.\n\nIn 1937, a new university building for the Faculties of Law and Philosophy was opened in the centre of Bratislava. The building includes the Aula (hall) used for graduation ceremonies and other formal functions.\n\nDuring World War II, Slovakia became nominally a republic, but was actually under the sway of Nazi Germany. The government reduced academic freedoms at the university, and the Czech professors were forced out. The university was renamed \"Slovak University\" in 1939, though the original name was reinstated in 1954. The Faculty of Science opened in 1940 and the Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was established in 1941. Academic freedom returned after the end of the war in 1945 but was again cancelled in 1948 as the communists took power in Czechoslovakia, enforcing the ideology of Marxism-Leninism at Czechoslovak universities. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was taken under direct control of the Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, the university continued to grow, and new faculties were established (mostly by splitting the existing faculties):\n\nAfter the \"Velvet revolution\" in 1989, the university created a democratic self-government, and mandatory courses on Marxist ideology were abolished. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology and the Evangelical Theological Faculty joined the university.\n\nThe transformation of Slovakia into a market economy created a need for professionals in management and financial sciences. As a result, the\nuniversity established the Faculty of Management 1991 and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences in 2002. In 2000, the European credit transfer system was implemented to improve student mobility and facilitate more ties with other European universities.\n\nThis is a list of faculties of Comenius University in Bratislava with their official English names.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1967, Evergreen offers a non-traditional undergraduate curriculum in which students design their own paths of study. Full-time students enroll in interdisciplinary academic programs instead of classes. Programs typically offer students the opportunity to study several disciplines in a coordinated manner. Faculty write narrative evaluations of students' work in place of issuing grades.\n\nEvergreen's main campus spans 1,000 acres of forest bordering the southernmost waters of Puget Sound, and it also has a satellite campus in nearby Tacoma. The school offers a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and Bachelor of Science, Master of Environmental Studies, Master in Teaching, Master of Public Administration, and Master of Public Administration in Tribal Governance. As of 2018, there were 3,327 students, 3,018 of whom were undergraduates, and 223 faculty.\n\nEvergreen was one of many alternative colleges and programs launched in the 1960s and 1970s, often described as “experiments.” While the vast majority of these have either closed or adopted more mainstream approaches, Evergreen is one of the few that have remained steadfast in pursuing its original mission. \n\nIn 2017, protests over claims of racial discrimination and free speech issues repeatedly shut down the school, and led to the resignation of two professors, Bret Weinstein and his wife Heather Heying. Evergreen later paid the couple $500,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging that the college failed to protect them from race-based threats and hostility.\n\nIn 1964, a report was issued by the Council of Presidents of Washington State baccalaureate institutions stating that another college was needed in the state to balance the geographical distribution of the existing state institutions. This report spurred the 1965 Washington legislature to create the Temporary Advisory Council on Public Higher Education to study the need and possible location for a new state college.\n\nIn 1965–66, the Temporary Advisory Council on Public Higher Education (assisted by Nelson Associates of New York) concluded \"at the earliest possible time a new college should be authorized\", to be located at a suburban site in Thurston County within a radius of approximately from Olympia. Evergreen's enabling legislation – HB 596 (Chapter 47, Laws of 1967) – stated that the campus should be no smaller than , making it then the largest campus in the state as well as the first public four-year college created in Washington in the 20th century.\n\nOn January 24, 1968, \"The Evergreen State College\" was selected from 31 choices as the name of the new institution. On November 1, 1968, Charles J. McCann assumed the first presidency of the college. McCann and the founding faculty held the first day of classes October 4, 1971 with 1128 students. McCann served from 1968 until stepping down to join the faculty June 6, 1977 when former Governor Daniel J. Evans, who signed the legislation creating Evergreen, assumed the presidency. Evans left the president's office in 1983 when he was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by the death of Senator Henry M. Jackson. The largest building on campus is named in honor of Evans, the Daniel J. Evans Library Building. The entrance to the campus bears McCann's name, the Charles J. McCann plaza.\n\nIn the 1992-93 school year, students chose Leonard Peltier to give the address at commencement, which was the first with a graduating class of more than 1,000. The selection was described as \"perhaps the most unconventional commencement speaker\" in a published round-up of the most controversial graduation speakers on campuses nationwide that year. Peltier, who was in federal prison, submitted his remarks in writing, to be read by a graduating senior.\n\nIn 1999, Mumia Abu-Jamal was invited to deliver the keynote address by audiotape for the graduating class at the college. The event was protested by some. \n\nIn 2004, the college completed the Seminar II building, and a significant remodel of the Daniel J. Evans Library was completed.\n\nIn 2015, George Sumner Bridges became the sixth president of Evergreen State College, not counting interim appointments. Bridges had previously served as president of Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA. He followed Thomas L. “Les” Purce (2000–2015), Jane L. Jervis (1992–2000), and Joseph D. Olander (1985–1990).\n\nEvery April since the 1970s until 2018, Evergreen has held a daylong event called \"Day of Absence\", inspired by the Douglas Turner Ward play of the same name, during which minority students and faculty members voluntarily stay off campus to raise awareness of the contributions of minorities and to discuss racial and campus issues. , approximately 25% of Evergreen students were racial minorities. Since 1992, the \"Day of Absence\" has been followed by the \"Day of Presence\", when the campus community reunites.\n\nIn 2017, the \"Day of Absence\" was altered after students of color voiced concerns about feeling unwelcome on campus following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. For that year's event, white students, staff, and faculty were invited to stay off campus. Events for students of color were held on the Evergreen campus. Bret Weinstein, a professor of biology at Evergreen, wrote a letter in March to Evergreen faculty explaining his objections to the change in format: \"On a college campus, one’s right to speak — or to be — must never be based on skin color.\" and \"There is a huge difference between a group or coalition deciding to voluntarily absent themselves from a shared space to highlight their vital and under-appreciated roles [...] and a group or coalition encouraging another group to go away.\" Weinstein's emails were leaked and widely shared among conservative media outlets such as \"Breitbart\" and \"Heat Street\", which led to harassment and threats towards school officials. In late May 2017, student protests—focused in part on the comments by Weinstein—disrupted the campus and called for a number of changes to the college. Weinstein says he was told that campus police could not protect him and that they encouraged him not to be on campus, which caused Weinstein to hold his biology class in a public park. Weinstein and his wife, Professor Heather Heying, later resigned and reached a $500,000 settlement with the university after having sued it for failing to \"protect its employees from repeated provocative and corrosive verbal and written hostility based on race, as well as threats of physical violence\".\n\nA June 1 threat to \"execute\" people at Evergreen led to an evacuation and two-day closure of the campus. Vandals with sticks and baseball bats caused approximately $10,000 in damage to the campus and forced closure of the school for an additional day. A June 15 protest on campus by the far-right group Patriot Prayer led to campus being closed early. The following day, Evergreen's 2017 commencement ceremony was also moved off-campus because of safety concerns.\n\nA report from the college suggested that the protests may adversely affect Evergreen's enrollment, which has been declining over the last decade. Consequently, the college cut its budget by 10% and increased student fees.\n\nEvergreen is unique in that undergraduate students select one 16-credit program for the entire quarter rather than multiple courses. Full-time programs will encompass a quarter's worth of work in everything related to that program concentration, by up to three professors. There are no \"majors\": students have the freedom to choose what program to enroll in each quarter for the entire duration of their undergraduate education, and are never required to follow a specific set of programs. Evergreen is on the \"quarter\" system, with programs lasting one, two, or three quarters. Three quarter programs are generally September through June.\n\nAt the end of the program the professor writes a one-page report (\"Evaluation\") about the student's activity in the class rather than a letter grade, and has an end-of-program Evaluation conference with each student. The professor also determines how many credits should be awarded to the student, and students can lose credit.\n\nIn order to obtain a Bachelor of Arts, a student must complete 180 credits.\n\nIn order to obtain a Bachelor of Science, a student must complete 180 credits, 72 of which need to be in science, with 48 of those noted as upper division. This requirement can be satisfied by one year of upper-division science.\n\nEvergreen's Evening and Weekend Studies Program makes it possible for students who cannot attend full-time, day classes to get a Bachelor of Arts degree by attending on a part-time basis through night and weekend interdisciplinary programs.\n\nUnlike the undergraduate programs, the graduate programs require that students have taken a certain rotation of courses. Evergreen graduate studies consist of the following three programs:\n\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report's 2018 college rankings, Evergreen is ranked #33 in Regional Universities West, and #1 in Regional West Best Undergraduate Teaching. US News ranked Evergreen as #33 in the nation for offering first-year experiences to freshmen, which entails building into the curriculum first-year seminars or other programs that bring small groups of students together with faculty and staff on a regular basis. Author and former education editor for \"The New York Times\" Loren Pope cites Evergreen as one of two public colleges in the United States in his book \"Colleges That Change Lives\".\n\nThe Evergreen State College has an admission rate of 97%.\n\nThe main library on The Evergreen State College campus is the Daniel J. Evans Library, named after the former governor who signed the legislation that founded Evergreen, and was also the school's second president. The library is home to some 428,000 volumes and 750,000 print and media items overall. The library hosts a number of small viewing rooms and also maintains special collections of rare books, archival material, and government documents. The Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning Center (QuaSR), a tutoring center for the sciences, is located on the first floor of the library. The library is located in the Information Technology wing of the Daniel J. Evans Library Building. This wing is also the home for Media Services and a large Academic Computing center.\n\nThe Evergreen State College has of land that is mostly second growth forest. The entire campus serves as a natural laboratory for scientific field research and provides inspiration for creative work. Throughout the forest there are multiple trails leading to a variety of locations throughout the reserve and to Evergreen Beach. The coastal habitat is characterized by steep bluffs, gravelly beaches with many washed-up logs, and the marine intertidal zone which extends up to out into Puget Sound's Eld Inlet during low tides. Evergreen has approximately of untouched beach and of southern Puget Sound tidelands. . Students use the beach and tidelands for scientific study and as a place to get away from their studies and relax. There are multiple trails leading to the beach and a small road that leads to the only building at the beach and small boat ramp. The bluffs range from 15 to 60 feet (5 to 20 m) in height.\n\nThe Evergreen Organic Farm annual crop bed space comprises , slightly less than . The farm also produces apples and other perennial food crops, and tends to a flock of hens. Produce is sold to the Evergreen community through CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) shares, or from a farm-stand on Red Square every Tuesday and Thursday from 11am to 5pm during the growing season. Produce is sometimes sold to campus food services Aramark and the Flaming Eggplant Cafe. Excess produce is available to students in the interdisciplinary program, titled \"The Practice of Sustainable Agriculture\".\n\nProceeds from the sale of the crops are used to finance farm projects, as well as purchase seeds and equipment. Two of the greenhouses, the cooler, compost shed, farm fencing and orchard are just a few projects made possible from farm sales. Another use for money generated on the farm is to fund student projects. Many of these projects are related to horticultural aspects of food crops.\n\nThe farm production area is divided into sections that are used to delineate cropping areas for specific types of crops. The farm practices a strict five year crop rotation. The rotating of crops creates plant diversity over time as opposed to plant diversity in space. The rotation has four general crop categories with each category occupying a given space for one growing season.\n\nCrop rotation is just one method the farm uses to maintain diversity in the field. Other methods employed are the use of undersown ground covers and inter-cropping different types of vegetable crops. Creating diversity in the field is one of the cornerstones of sustainable agriculture. Diversity provides non-toxic, sustainable crop protection against plant diseases and insect pests.\n\nThe Evergreen Organic Farm hosts a large composting facility that composts all compostables from the campus. It also hosts a Biodiesel facility, a community garden, demeters garden, and a large farmhouse that was partially built by students.\n\nThe Evergreen State College is the home of the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. The Longhouse exists to provide service and hospitality to students, the college, and surrounding Native communities. With a design based on the Northwest Indigenous Nations' philosophy of hospitality, its primary functions are to provide a gathering place for hosting cultural ceremonies, classes, conferences, performances, art exhibits and community events. The Longhouse provides the opportunity to build a bridge of understanding between the regions' tribes and visitors of all cultures. The public service mission of the Longhouse is to promote indigenous arts and cultures through education, cultural preservation, and economic development.\n\nIt is also the administrative home for the Washington State Institute for Public Policy. The Institute's mission is to carry out practical, non-partisan research—at legislative direction—on issues of importance to Washington State. The Institute conducts research using its own policy analysts and economists, specialists from universities, and consultants. Institute staff work closely with legislators, legislative and state agency staff, and experts in the field to ensure that studies answer relevant policy questions.\n\nOther notable public service centers on campus are:\n\nEvergreen teams, nicknamed athletically as the Geoducks, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, crew, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, crew, track & field and volleyball. A geoduck is a clam native to the region.\n\nFormer men's soccer star Joey Gjertsen, who led the Geoducks to the 2004 NAIA National quarterfinals, has gone on to have professional success with the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. Shawn Medved previously had success in the MLS, playing for D.C. United and the San Jose Clash. Medved scored the tying goal in the 1996 MLS Cup as D.C. went on to the championship.\n\nEvergreen also had a strong run in men's basketball during the first decade of the 21st Century, winning the 2002 Cascade Collegiate Conference championship and reaching the NAIA national tournament in '02, '09 and '10. Forward Mike Parker from the '02 team has become one of the top professional players in Japan and several other basketball players have gone on to professional careers overseas.\n\nStudent media include \"The Cooper Point Journal\" (Student-run newspaper) and KAOS-FM (Evergreen's community radio station).\n\nAmong notable alumni are mycologist Paul Stamets; cartoonists Matt Groening, Craig Bartlett, and Lynda Barry; comedians Josh Blue and Michael Richards; musicians Macklemore, Carrie Brownstein, Corin Tucker, Kathleen Hanna, Tobi Vail, Conrad Keely, Tay Zonday, John Wozniak, and Martin Courtney; reality television star Steve Thomas; writers Benjamin Hoff, Judith Moore, Tom Maddox and Wendy C.

She is a Visiting Professor of Literature at Bard College, and was formerly president of PEN American Center.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Prose graduated from Radcliffe College in 1968. She received the PEN Translation Prize in 1988 and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1991. Prose's novel \"The Glorious Ones\" has been adapted into a musical with the same title by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. It ran at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center in New York City in the fall of 2007.\n\nIn March 2007, Prose was chosen to succeed American writer Ron Chernow beginning in April to serve a one-year term as president of PEN American Center, a New York City-based literary society of writers, editors and translators that works to advance literature, defend free expression, and foster international literary fellowship. In March 2008, Prose ran unopposed for a second one-year term as PEN American Center president. That same month, London artist Sebastian Horsley had been denied entry into the United States and PEN president Prose subsequently invited Horsley to speak at PENs annual festival of international literature in New York at the end of April 2008. Prose was succeeded by philosopher and novelist Kwame Anthony Appiah as president of PEN in April 2009.\n\nProse sat on the board of judges for the PEN/Newman's Own Award. Her novel, \"Blue Angel\", a satire about sexual harassment on college campuses, was a finalist for the National Book Award. One of her novels, \"Household Saints\", was adapted for a movie by Nancy Savoca.\n\nProse received the Rome Prize in 2006.\nIn 2010, Prose received the Washington University International Humanities Medal. The medal, awarded biennially and accompanied by a cash prize of $25,000, is given to honor a person whose humanistic endeavors in scholarship, journalism, literature, or the arts have made a difference in the world. Other winners include Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk in 2006, journalist Michael Pollan in 2008, and documentary filmmaker, Ken Burns, in 2012.\n\nDuring the 2015 controversy regarding American PEN's decision to honor \"Charlie Hebdo\" with its annual Freedom of Expression Courage Award, she, alongside Michael Ondaatje, Teju Cole, Peter Carey, Rachel Kushner and Taiye Selasi, withdrew from the group's annual awards gala and signed a letter dissociating themselves from the award, stating that although the murders were \"sickening and tragic,\" they did not believe that \"Charlie Hebdo\"s work deserved an award. The letter was soon co-signed by more than 140 other PEN members. Francine Prose published an article in \"The Guardian\" justifying her position, stating that: \"the narrative of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" murders—white Europeans killed in their offices by Muslim extremists—is one that feeds neatly into the cultural prejudices that have allowed our government to make so many disastrous mistakes in the Middle East.\" Prose was criticized for her views by Katha Pollitt, Alex Massie, Michael C. Moynihan, Nick Cohen and others, most notably by Salman Rushdie, who in a letter to PEN described Prose and the five other authors who withdrew as fellow travellers of \"fanatical Islam, which is highly organised, well funded, and which seeks to terrify us all, Muslims as well as non-Muslims, into a cowed silence.\"\n\nOn January 7, 2018, in a Facebook post, Prose accused the author Sadia Shepard of plagiarizing Mavis Gallant's \"The Ice Wagon Going Down the Street\", which had appeared in \"The New Yorker\" on December 14, 1963. Shepard's piece had been published online by \"The New Yorker\" and was scheduled for release in the January 8, 2018 issue. Though Shepard's story reimagines the original in a new context, with added detail and altered character dynamics, Prose contended that the similarities between the two stories constituted theft, writing in her original post that the story is a \"scene by scene, plot-turn by plot-turn, gesture by gesture, line-of-dialogue by line-of-dialogue copy—the only major difference being that the main characters are Pakistanis in Connecticut during the Trump era instead of Canadians in post-WWII Geneva.\" In a letter to \"The New Yorker\", Prose maintained her original stance, asking, \"Is it really acceptable to change the names and the identities of fictional characters and then claim the story as one's own original work? Why, then, do we bother with copyrights?\" Responding to Prose's accusation, Shepard acknowledged her debt to Gallant but maintained that her use of Gallant's story of self-exile in postwar Europe to explore the immigrant experience of Pakistani Muslims in today's America was justified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He worked in Japan as an English teacher and also travelled through Australia and Central America. He began to sculpt in the United States, when he made his first assemblage of scrap metal. After a short stay in Greece, he moved to London and became technical assistant at the London College of Printing. In London, he participated in several group exhibitions.\n\nHis first solo exhibition, \"Gnomes\", was mounted at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1971. Makkink worked with his brother Kees Makkink, at the St Katharine Docks complex in London, a former industrial complex that was converted by the SPACE Foundation as a studio complex. There, in 1969 he was discovered by Stanley Kubrick who used two of his works in his film \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971): Rocking Machine and Christ Unlimited. Coincidentally, the Italian filmmaker Tinto Brass also used Rocking Machine in his film \"Dropout\", starring Vanessa Redgrave.\nMakkink's partner was the British author, Julia Blackburn. \nIn 1972 Makkink settled in Amsterdam, while making regular visits to Deia, Majorca. His first solo exhibition in the Wetering Gallery in Amsterdam took place in 1982, and the gallery has continued to feature his work ever since.

Makkink worked alternately in Bramfield (Suffolk), Molini di Triora-Agaggio and Amsterdam. In Amsterdam Makkink shared, for many years until his death, a studio with his former pupil Adriaan Rees. Makkink was controversial in Amsterdam. One of his sculptures - a tubular shape executed in brick at the Spinozahof - was demolished in 1994 because, according to local residents, it obstructed their view.\n\nHe died in Amsterdam on October 20, 2013.\n\nThe following are commissioned public works in the Netherlands:\n\n\nHe was married and divorced twice.

The events are designed to introduce students to the richness and beauty of mathematics in a collaborative and non-competitive forum.\n\nIn the 1970s, Saint Mary's College of California produced a mathematics contest that was popular with secondary schools throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2005, Nancy Blachman attended an education forum sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) and remembered how the Saint Mary's contest had inspired her as a student. Unfortunately, the contest no longer existed. Seeking to possibly resurrect the contest, Blachman and MSRI development director Jim Sotiros reached out to colleagues in the educational community. One response was from local high school math teacher Joshua Zucker, who also remembered the contest and even had saved a book of problems from it. Sotiros suggested that Blachman and her husband David desJardins fund MSRI in order to hire Zucker to recreate a program in the style of the Saint Mary’s Math Contest. Blachman and Zucker became co-founders and organized their first event in 2007. They called it a festival rather than a contest because they wanted to emphasize collaboration, creativity and fun rather than competition. They named the festival after Julia Robinson, a mathematician renowned for her contributions to decision problems. In fact, her work on Hilbert's 10th problem played a crucial role in its ultimate resolution. Blachman felt that such a woman would provide a role model for young girls and would show that one need not be male to be a great mathematician.\n\nWhen they sent out invitations to local schools, the response was so overwhelming that, in order to have enough space, they prevailed upon Google in nearby Mountain View to host the first festival. A second festival was hosted in 2008 by Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville. Enthusiasm and interest have spurred strong growth, and since then, there have been festivals at Princeton University (and its greater community); Stanford University; and University of California, Berkeley, and throughout the United States, as well as in Europe and Asia.\n\nSince its founding, JRMF has had the support of many people and organizations, including dedicated mentors and volunteers, the founding host MSRI, and the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM), which has been a fiscal sponsor since 2013.

Such exams in courses can be important factors in the determination of final grades and therefore scholarships, college, and university admissions. However, policies of post-secondary institutions in Canada vary concerning whether the blended exam and class grade are used or the class grade.\n\nA unique situation of primary and secondary examinations is that of Canada's territories. The territories primarily, but not entirely, elect to follow the curriculum of their most closely related adjacent provinces. This includes adopting the related provinces examination policy. The Yukon primarily follows the British Columbian Curriculum. Meanwhile, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut primarily follow the Alberta curriculum. Therefore, exams in these territories are developed and adjudicated by the aforementioned adjacent province but are administered by the territorial educational ministry.\n\nFor the purposes of the list, the 'course grade' is defined as the grade assigned by the teacher during classroom instruction. 'Final grade' or 'blended grade' are defined as the combined examination and course grade.\n\n\nSome universities choose to raise Albertan students marks because of their provincially required exams. For example, the University of British Columbia automatically raise Albertan students average by 2%.\n\n\n\n\nIn Ontario, province wide assessment is administered by the crown corporation called the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO).

In his research, Radelet focuses on his interests in criminology, deviance, capital punishment, societal reaction to crime, racial disparities in death sentencing and crime victims. Radelet has taught at the Universities that he worked for courses covering introductory sociology, criminology for both undergraduate and graduate levels, capital punishment for both undergraduate and graduate levels, sociology of mental health and illness for both undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate seminar on health professions, social and ethical issues in medical practice, human development, statistics, and social problems. He is the author of the book \"Facing the Death Penalty\" that was published in 1989, in which he describes the realities of capital punishment to those of the condemned.\n\nRadelet has been a professor at many universities and has taught in many fields of study throughout his career. Before his work at University of Colorado Boulder, Radelet worked as a professor and the chair of the department of sociology at the University of Florida, where many of his works originated. He has taught all over the U.S. in places like the University of Florida, Florida State, University of Colorado, Indiana University, Eastern Michigan University and Wisconsin University. Radelet has lectured and taught: Mental Health Administration, Sociology of Mental Health and Illnesses, Criminology, Special Topics on Capital Punishment, and Human Development.\n\nRadelet throughout his career has studied the impact that the death penalty has on the mind, and on society. In the midst of the ongoing debate on whether or not the death penalty is more deterrent than long-term imprisonment, Radelet's studies revealed findings that could alter the system. His works surveyed many, coming up with multiple conclusions regarding the issue, these results are displayed in his article 'Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates: The Views of Leading Criminologists.' One of the main statistics projected in this article states that 88% of criminologists do not believe that capital punishment is an effective deterrent to homicide. Radelet's knowledge in Psychology and Criminology helped him produce his book \"Facing the Death Penalty.\" This book portrays what Michael experienced while working with those who are facing the death penalty. It talks a lot about the benefits and inhumanities of the death penalty and how Radelet's experience may change people’s views.\n\nRadelet has uncovered many facts and statistics relating to the problem of racial disparities in the federal death penalty. He has statistics dating back to 1991 during the first federal death penalty prosecution. In the history of those who were prosecuted and sentenced to the death penalty, most were of color. These injustices continue today, more and more whites are able to evade the death penalty better than blacks.\n\nThese injustices revealed by Radelet made the notion that racism is apparent in the justice system. These studies triggered an uprising of debate on whether the death penalty is a fair punishment.\n"}

National Air College is also an FAA Certified Repair Station, employing its own mechanics.\n\nNug Madariaga, owner and operator of National Air College, bought his first airplane (Model B Funk) in 1942, before serving 4 years in the U.S. Navy during WWII. After his enlistment, Nug headed to Flabob Airport in Riverside, of which his brother Flavio was part owner (Flavio's business partner was Bob Bogen - hence \"Flabob Airport\"). After completing his own flight training, Nug soon set up the first official flight training school at Flabob Airport. Then, in 1957, Nug opened National Air College at Montgomery Airfield in San Diego. Operating in the same location ever since, NAC is the longest surviving civilian aviation training facility in San Diego. As well as being the owner of NAC, Nug himself holds certifications in all FAA Ratings (including... SEL, MEL, CFII, ATP, Helo), and served as an FAA Flight Examiner for 25 years.\n\nGregg Madariaga\nFollowing in his father's footsteps early on, Gregg Madariaga was setting records at the age of sixteen. Montgomery Field was buzzing, not just with airplanes but with the media, when Gregg became the youngest pilot in the United States to solo in 38 different aircraft types. Then, at the age of 18, Gregg became not only the youngest helicopter pilot in the U.S., but also the youngest helicopter instructor as well! With his father as his CFI, Gregg received all of his ratings from NAC, and joined his father there as a flight instructor. The father & son pair flew air-taxi and military flight operations for some time to San Clemente and San Nicholas Islands. Gregg later became a Corporate Pilot and has since advanced from the Gulfstream-4 aircraft to the Global Express. And like his father before him, Gregg has now been an FAA Designated Examiner for over 25 years.\n\nNational Air College offers training opportunities for every level of pilot proficiency. From Student Pilot to Airline Transport Pilot...\n\nNational Air College provides training which produces the finest quality aviators.

{"id": "166518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166518", "title": "Pub quiz", "text": "Pub quiz\n\nA pub quiz is a quiz held in a pub or bar. These events are also called quiz nights, trivia nights, or bar trivia and may be held in other settings. Pub quizzes may attract customers to a pub who are not found there on other days. The pub quiz is a modern example of a pub game. Although different pub quizzes can cover a range of formats and topics, they have many features in common. The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s by Burns and Porter and became part of British culture. The Great British Pub Quiz challenge is an annual event. In continental Europe, pub quizzes are a staple event at Irish pubs, where they are usually held in English.\n\nIn the U.S., trivia nights are sometimes used as fundraisers for nonprofit organizations, and these are very common in the Greater St. Louis area. \n\nThe pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s, mainly by a company called Burns and Porter, to get people in to pubs on quieter nights. Popularity grew and grew over the next few years from just 30 teams to 10,000 playing each week in a Burns and Porter quiz. Redtooth runs an annual Great British Pub Quiz challenge, with more than 600 pubs taking part in 2012.\n\nA 2009 study put the number of regular weekly pub quizzes in the UK at 22,445, and one website has counted approximately 2,000 regular weekly quizzes in the US.\n\nOn 4 May 2017 the first ever online pub quiz took place, run by Primordial Radio in the United Kingdom. It used existing technologies of a YouTube live stream and the answer sheet by survey monkey.\n\nPub quizzes (also known as live trivia, or table quizzes) are often weekly events and will have an advertised start time, most often in the evening.\n\nWhile specific formats vary, most pub quizzes depend on answers being written in response to questions which may themselves be written or announced by a quizmaster.\n\nOne format for quizzing is called \"infinite bounce\". This format is generally used when the number of teams in the quiz is large – usually around 8–10. Every question is addressed to the team succeeding the team that answered the previous question. If no team answers the question, the next question is addressed to the team succeeding the team to whom the previous question was addressed.\n\nGenerally someone (either one of the bar staff or the person running the quiz) will come around with pens and quiz papers, which may contain questions or may just be blank sheets for writing the answers on. A mixture of both is common, in which case often only the blank sheet is to be handed in. Traditionally a member of the team hands the answers in for adjudication to the quiz master or to the next team along for marking when the answers are called.\n\nIt is up to the quizzers to form teams, which are generally based on tables, though if one table has a large group around it they may decide to split up. Some pubs insist on a maximum team size (usually between six and ten). The team members decide on a team name, often a supposedly humorous phrase or pun, which must be written on all papers handed in.\n\nPeople often have to pay to participate – ranging from around 50p to £5 per person. This is often pooled to provide prize money. Many pub quizzes require no payment at all, as the event is simply a way to get paying customers into the venue, typically on less busy nights of the week.\n\nThe person asking the questions is known as the quizmaster. Quizmasters also mark and score answers submitted by teams, although formats exist where teams will mark each other's answer sheets.\n\nThe questions may be set by the bar staff or landlord, taken from a quiz book, bought from a specialist trivia company, or be set by volunteers from amongst the contestants. In the latter case, the quiz setter may be remunerated with drinks or a small amount of money.\n\nOften questions may be drawn from the realm of 'everybody knows' trivia, therefore leading to controversies when the answers are false or unverifiable. In addition, as the quizzes are not formal affairs, slight errors in wording may lead to confusion and have led to a 2005 court case in the UK.\n\nThere may be between one and more than half a dozen rounds of questions, totalling anything from 10 to upwards of 80 questions. Rounds may include the following kinds (most common first):\n\n\nIn some quizzes teams are able to select one or two rounds as \"jokers\", in which their points will be doubled (or otherwise multiplied). Teams usually select their joker rounds before the start of the quiz, although some rounds may be excluded. Teams who consider themselves to be particularly strong on certain subjects can improve their chances with a good joker round, but risk wasting the joker if the questions are unexpectedly difficult. The idea of using a joker in a game may come from the BBC television programme \"It's a Knockout\".\n\nSome quizzes include a bonus question, in which a single answer is required with one or more clues given each round making the answer progressively easier to solve. In some variants, the first team to hand in the correct answer wins either a spot prize or additional points to their total score. In others, the questions continue until all teams have the correct answer with each team been given progressively fewer additional points the longer it takes them to submit the correct answer.\n\nSome quizzes add a small, separate round of questions to the end of a regular quiz, with the chance to win a jackpot. Each week an amount of money is added to the jackpot, and if no team answers the questions correctly, the money rolls over to the next quiz. The maximum amount of the jackpot may be limited by local gaming regulations.\n\nCash jackpots may be won by a variety of methods including one-off questions and dance-offs.\n\nIn some cases, the papers are marked by the bar staff. Alternatively, teams may have to mark their own answers and the handed-in papers are consulted only to check that prize claimants have not cheated by altering their answers. Another method is to have teams swap papers before marking, though this can be divisive.\n\nOne or two points are scored for each correct answer; some quizzes allow half marks for \"nearly right\" answers (such as a celebrity's surname when their full name was required). In some quizzes, certain questions score higher marks, particularly if they are unusually difficult.\n\nWith the mass use of mobile phones and mobile internet access, cheating has become a problem for some pub quizzes, with covert calls and texts made in the toilets, recent newspapers and magazines brought along especially for the event, ringers and so on. Though a maximum number of members set for teams may help to prevent large numbers of people collaborating, groups posing as several distinct teams are quite common. Some quizzes now ban the use of mobiles and nullify the score of any team found to be cheating. Though more prevalent where large sums of money are at stake, cheating can be observed even for relatively low stakes.\n\nSome quizzes also now ban re-entry to the pub after the quiz has started, in order to prevent team members from using public internet stations, public telephones and mobile devices out of sight of the quizmaster. Generally, though, a pub runs its quiz alongside its normal operation, making such a measure impractical.\n\nPrizes are awarded to the highest scoring team, and often to runners-up. Prizes are usually one of the following:\n\n\nIn a digital pub quiz wireless handsets replace the more usual pen and paper. A computer receives and records the answers from each team's handset and the results are exported to a spreadsheet at the end of the quiz. A time limit can be set for each question (e.g. 60 seconds) and it is possible to determine which team answers in the fastest time for spot prizes and tiebreaks.\n\nAs the pub quiz concept spread to the US in the 1990s, several companies formed to provide services to bars and restaurants organizing quizzes. Different from the quiz league in the UK, US commercial pub quizzes typically involve more than just two teams and can have as many as 25–35 teams playing in a single location, with up to 6 people per team. Quiz companies charge bars a fee for hosting the quiz, which may range from $80 per week to $175 or more depending on attendance. At least 20 different pub quiz companies currently exist in the US, with most operating events concentrated in major metropolitan areas.\n\nA quiz league is an organisation that runs quizzes, normally in pubs, though such competitions are distinct from the standard pub quiz as they will normally involve two teams and often include a number of individual questions. No prizes are normally awarded at such a league match, but prizes and kudos may go to the quiz team winning a league or a competition. The National Trivia Association runs a nationwide contest involving various pub trivia games played around the US.\n\nTeams from throughout a region, county, state or country meet annually for more prestigious competitions, with greater prizes. Representative teams may either be the best team from each pub, or a team selected from the best individuals.\n\nBelieve it or Not Quiz Events in New Zealand have held an annual Champion of Champions quiz in Auckland since 1999. Initially open to teams from pubs within the greater Auckland region, it is now open to teams from throughout New Zealand. In practice, travel costs prevent most teams from the lower North Island and the South Island participating, although Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington have all provided teams.\n\nThe Australasian Pub Quiz Championships takes place annually since 2018. Open to teams from pubs and clubs from across Australia and New Zealand, the 2018 Championships is simultaneously run in Sydney, Canberra and Wellington in late April.\n\nIn the United States National Trivia Association presents \"The Riddle\", a finals event open to eligible teams who play the official NTA \"Quizzo!\" live trivia game. Approximately a thousand players attended the 2008 event in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nThe largest pub quiz, according to the \"Guinness Book of Records\", was the \"Quiz for Life\", held at the Flanders Expo Halls in Ghent, Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158479", "title": "Reverse discrimination", "text": "Reverse discrimination\n\nReverse discrimination is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Groups may be defined in terms of disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation, or other factors. This discrimination may seek to redress social inequalities under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. The label reverse discrimination may also be used to highlight the discrimination inherent in affirmative action programs. Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.\n\nConceptualizing affirmative action efforts as reverse discrimination began to become popular in the early- to mid-1970s, a time period that focused on underrepresentation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world.\n\nThe law in some countries, such as the UK, draws a distinction between \"equality of provision\" and \"equality of outcome\", based on the idea that identical treatment may sometimes act to preserve inequality rather than eliminate it. Opponents of this distinction may label it as an example of reverse discrimination.\n\nWhen members of a particular group have been barred from a particular employment, it is said that this group has received less than its fair share of employment, in question, and deserves to receive more by way of compensation. Thus, this group is being compensated for past lack of employment or opportunity. Therefore, a group already existing in the workplace will be discriminated against, even if they’ve never been denied employment previously. An example of this would be an organization's efforts to hire more women in order to meet federal guidelines. However in thus doing, the organization may deny opportunities of equal measures to men. If the point of reverse discrimination is to compensate a wronged group, it will hardly matter if those who are preferentially hired were not among the original victims of discrimination. Moreover, the current beneficiaries of reverse discrimination are not often the same persons as those who were harmed by the original discrimination, and those who now bear the burden of reverse discrimination are seldom the same persons as those who practiced the original discrimination. Because of this, reverse discrimination is argued to be both irrelevant to the aim of compensating for past injustices and unfair to those whose superior qualifications are bypassed.\n\nIt is often argued by majority groups that they are being discriminated for hiring and advancement because of affirmative action policies. However, critics of this argument often cite the \"symbolic\" significance of a job has to be taken into consideration as well as qualifications. Many feel that basing a decision to discriminate against a group of people should not be based on symbolism but on objective, verifiable fact. Thomas Sowell said that the meaning of \"qualified\" has been stretched to mean \"qualified to be trained\", and the \"available\" supply includes women who no longer work (usually because of their husbands' prosperity).\n\nIn European Union law, reverse discrimination occurs where a Member State's national law provides for worse treatment of its own citizens or domestic products than other EU citizens/goods under EU law. This can happen because of the legal principle of subsidiarity that EU law is not applicable in situations purely internal to one Member State.\n\nIn India, among the limited positions for higher education in Government institutions, 50 percent seats are reserved for members of economically disadvantaged castes and classes. Reserved category candidates can select a position from the Open 50 percent if he or she has good merit. This results in further reverse discrimination of Open/General/Non Reserved candidates. Further, since there are no economic criteria in classifying Reservation, poorer sections of reserved class often remain poor whereas the affluent section reap benefits for successive generations. Also, the poorer sections of Open/General Category become devoid of access to higher education for even slightly low merit on competitive exams. The difference in merit on entrance exams is often very wide between the reserved and unreserved classes. In India, the term is often used by citizens protesting against reservation and quotas.\n\nUK law draws a distinction between Equality of Provision and Equality of Outcome, particularly in respect to disability rights. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Equality Act 2010 make it clear that treating two people identically may not be sufficient to guarantee that they have been treated equally in law if the task, physical environment or service does not offer them equality of outcome. The law provides for disabled people to request the provision of 'reasonable adjustments' to ensure that they are able to access employment, services and the built environment with the same potential as non-disabled people.\nIn November 2007, David Rosin, a former vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons wrote in the magazine \"Hospital Doctor\": “It is time that someone spoke up concerning the reverse discrimination with respect to merit awards” and saying that \"female and ethnic minority consultants are being given preferential treatment to meet artificial quotas\".\n\nAffirmative action in the United States has been a subject of controversy and litigation. Supporters advocate for it as a way to end and correct the effects of discrimination. Opponents say it is itself a form of discrimination.\n\nThe number of reverse discrimination cases filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission doubled in the 1990s and continue to reflect a growing percentage of all discrimination cases.\n\nA study by S. K. Camara & M. P. Orbe collected narratives of individuals describing situations where they were discriminated against based on their majority-group status (cases of reverse discrimination).\n\nMany White respondents described discrimination based on their race, a smaller portion reported gender discrimination. A small number of heterosexuals reported experiencing discrimination based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIn 1996, University of Texas had to defer the use of racial preferences in their college admissions after the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit barred the school from considering race in admitting students. The ruling determined that diversity in education could not justify making race-based distinctions. Hopwood v. Texas was a lawsuit brought by four white applications to the Texas Law School, who were denied admission even though their grade point averages were greater than minority applications that were accepted. The four white students also had a greater Law School Admission Test scores This decision predicated a movement of banning affirmative action, seen in California in 1997, Washington in 1998, and Florida in 1999.\n\nHowever, in 2003, in Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court allowed the University of Michigan Law School to continue to consider race among other relevant diversity factors. The decision was the first and only legally challenged affirmative action policy to survive the courts. However, this ruling has rendered confusion among universities, and lower courts alike, regarding the status of affirmative action across the nation.\n\nIn 2012, Fisher v. University of Texas reached the Supreme Court. The University of Texas allegedly used race as a factor in denying Abigail Fisher's application, denying her a fair review. The lower courts upheld the program, but the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the lower courts and sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit to review correctly.\nColleges first started considering race in acceptance to correct discrimination, but in turn conflicted with the equal opportunity clause.\n\nAccording to a report prepared in 1995 for the Labor Department of the United States by Alfred W. Blumrosen, affirmative action policies have caused few claims of reverse discrimination by whites. The report found fewer than 100 reverse-discrimination cases among more than 3,000 discrimination opinions by Federal district and appeals courts from 1990 to 1994. The report indicated that a high proportion of the claims lacked merit. In Blumrosen's report, national surveys revealed only a few whites had experienced reverse discrimination, and only 5 to 12 percent of whites believed that they had been denied a job or promotion because of it. Blumrosen also indicated that the reports filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission offer additional evidence that reverse discrimination is rare: 2% of cases were of white men charging, sexual, racial or national origin discrimination and 1.8% were of white women charging racial discrimination.\n\nNewer reports by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have found that less than 10% of race-related complaints were filed by whites, only 18% of gender-related complaints and only 4% of the court cases were filed by men. Analysis of other evidence shows that when national samples of whites are asked if they personally have experienced the loss of job, promotion, or college admission because of their race, 2%-13% say yes.\n\nGeneral\n\nRace\n\nGender\n\nAge\n\nSocial\n\n"}

After her retirement, Koo turned to philanthropy and social activism. She has served in non-profits which assist senior citizens, such as Self-Help for the Elderly, in California, and those which assist girls trying to attain an education in China, through such organizations as The 1990 Institute and the All-China Women's Federation. Koo has been the recipient of numerous honors and was inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nRosalyn Chin-Ming Chen was born in 1929 in Shanghai, China After completing her studies at McTyeire School, Chen moved to the United States in 1947 to attend Mills College. She transferred to UC Berkeley and earned a degree in economics in 1953. By 1957, when she attained her permanent residency, Chen was married.\n\nIn 1958, Koo joined the architectural firm MBT Associates in the San Francisco Bay area, which had been founded in 1954. She served as Chief Financial Officer and was the only principal of the firm who was not an architect. The firm specialized in building commercial and university research and laboratory projects. In 1983, the firm was listed as one of the 500 fastest growing firms in the US by \"Inc.\" Magazine in spite of an overall industry downward trend of nearly 33% according to the American Institute of Architects. Among the many clients served were Allergan, Genentech, Merck, Stanford University, UC-San Diego, UC San Francisco, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington with numerous award-winning projects, like the Beckman Center for Molecular & Genetic Medicine at Stanford University, the Genencor International Technology Center in Palo Alto, California, and the Technical Headquarters Lab Building E of Chevron Research Company in Richmond, California. After 30 years at MBT, Koo retired in 1988.\n\nIn 1978, Koo returned to China for the first time and made contact with a former principal at her alma mater, then known as Shanghai Public High School No. 3. Koo committed that overseas investors would be found if the principal could convince the government to return the school to an all-girls facility. By 1984, the school had been restored to a girls school and an overseas alumni association was providing funding for new science laboratories. She soon joined her efforts with financing programs offered by The 1990 Institute and pledged to help 1,000 girls finish primary school. In 2000, Koo toured western China visiting the provinces of Gansu, Shanxi and Shaanxi. Upon her return, she and Institute partners began a Dragon Fund to help educate girls in western China. The initial three projects were a Women’s and Children’s Training Center in Gansu, a greenhouse in Zhang Xian, and the \"Spring Bud\" scholarship program to provide funds for elementary school of girls in Shaanxi Province. Koo returned each year to measure the girls' progress and soon extended the scholarship funds to secondary schooling. In 2008, after the earthquake in Sichuan Province, Koo extended her commitment to including girls in Sichuan Province as well. Since their school buildings had been destroyed, Koo partnered with Jennifer Devlin of EHDD in San Francisco, to build a seismically safe school to replace three which had been damaged by the quake. Working with local partners they built the school and provided input for new Chinese construction and seismic codes to ensure safety.

{"id": "9515044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9515044", "title": "Sanjaya Malakar", "text": "Sanjaya Malakar\n\nSanjaya Joseph Malakar (born September 10, 1989) is an American singer, who was a finalist on the sixth season of \"American Idol\". He gained national attention on the series, controversially advancing to 7th place with public votes, despite being poorly received by the show's judges, particularly Simon Cowell.\n\nAfter \"Idol\", Malakar made many television guest appearances and has been commonly parodied in popular culture. He placed 5th in season two of the reality television show \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\". He recently won the Remington's Got Talent in Whitefish, MT.\n\nMalakar was born in Capitol Hill, in downtown Seattle, the son of Jillian (Recchi) Blyth and Vasudeva Malakar. He later lived in the nearby suburb of Federal Way. His father, a musician, is a Bengali Indian immigrant born in Vrindavan, India. His mother is American-born, of Italian descent on one side and Dutch, English, and Irish ancestry on the other. His parents filed for divorce when he was three years old and had been separated for a year prior to doing so. When the divorce was filed, the family had almost no money coming in. His mother and the children were living in a Seattle apartment, and her only income was from welfare. His mother remarried, but his stepfather died soon afterwards. Although Malakar spent the majority of his formative years in the Seattle area, he has also lived in both California and Kauai, Hawaii, where he performed with the Hawaii Children's Theater group. While in Seattle, he spent three years with the Total Experience Gospel Choir.\n\nMalakar attended Martha Lake Elementary School in Lynnwood, Washington for elementary school, and the Seattle Waldorf School and Northshore Junior High School for middle school in Bothell, Washington. He attended Shorecrest High School in Shoreline, Washington during freshman year, and Todd Beamer High School in Federal Way, Washington during sophomore year. After his sophomore year, Malakar passed the General Educational Development test, in order to leave high school early and focus on a music career and on his participation in \"American Idol\".\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Malakar, a shy teen, entered the open audition for \"American Idol\" at the Seattle Center in Seattle, with his sister Shyamali. Simon Cowell commented that Sanjaya had a better voice than his sister. Both were advanced to the Hollywood round by the judges. Malakar cited Stevie Wonder as his idol, and sang one of Wonder's signature songs, \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" at his Seattle audition.\n\nFor his next performance, in Hollywood, Malakar sang \"Some Kind of Wonderful\". He was shown tearfully embracing his sister when she was cut, though he progressed to the Top 40. Next, Malakar sang \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\". The judges were largely critical of his performance, though Simon Cowell admitted that Malakar is popular with the voters while Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul gave a more positive appraisal of his \"You Really Got Me\" performance in the Top 11. A 13-year-old girl named Ashley Ferl was highlighted repeatedly during Malakar's performance in the Top 11 episode, crying tears of joy, although Ferl also cried for Melinda Doolittle, Jordin Sparks, and many other contestants.\n\nOn March 27, 2007, Malakar sang No Doubt's \"Bathwater\" wearing a fauxhawk made from multiple ponytails. The style was called the \"ponyhawk\" by host Ryan Seacrest. While singing, Malakar hesitated with some of the words to the song. Simon Cowell remarked, \"Sanjaya, I don't think it matters anymore what we say ... I think you are in your own universe and if people like you, good luck.\" The following night, host Seacrest walked out on stage wearing a wig with the same hairstyle, parodying Malakar.\n\nOn April 3, Malakar sang \"Cheek to Cheek\", wearing a white suit, donning a slick hairstyle (with a recent cut), and dancing with judge Paula Abdul. Abdul commented, \"I get it. I get why people love you. You are charming.\" On the following April 4 results show, it was revealed that Malakar had finished in the \"middle three,\" among nine contestants.\n\nMalakar's performance of \"Bésame Mucho\" in the Top 8 on April 10 was his first unanimously well-received performance by the judges in the finals of the competition. During rehearsals Jennifer Lopez remarked, \"I like this kid. I love Sanjaya!\" after hearing him sing in Spanish, the only one of the remaining eight contestants to do so on the Latin-theme night. Randy Jackson commented, \"You're one of the smartest contestants I've ever met. That was actually really good. It was,\" while Simon Cowell offered the halting, \"I'm going to hate myself for this. It wasn't horrible.\" Malakar continued on, entering the Top 7, following that performance on the April 11 results show.\n\nAfter performing \"Something to Talk About\" on the previous night, Malakar was placed in the bottom three and was subsequently eliminated in 7th place on April 18, 2007. Singing his farewell performance, after the line \"let's give them something to talk about\", he ad libbed \"other than hair\" in place of \"how about love\".\n\n\"American Idol\"'s ratings dropped 9% in the episode following Malakar's elimination, which was \"Idol Gives Back\", a charity episode featuring many celebrity guests. The music news website Moldolva.org reported that this was due to Malakar's departure.\n\nOn the May 23 \"American Idol\" finale, he performed with the top six males, introduced Smokey Robinson in the medley. Malakar performed \"You Really Got Me\" with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry on guitar.\n\n\nMalakar was the season's most talked about \"American Idol\" contestant, based on articles and searches conducted on the Internet. One \"American Idol\" fan on MySpace claimed to be on a hunger strike until Malakar was voted off; she later admitted that she was canceling her strike, after his stay was longer than expected. In her YouTube video, an advertisement for a dating site was prominently displayed, causing speculation her hunger strike was really for profit. Other members of the MySpace online community created a page entitled Team Sanjaya in support for him. However, members of the online community have contributed semi-fictional web sites, appearing to portray Malakar in a more satirical but supportive way. Websites parodying Malakar's success had also appeared.\n\nAn official fansite for Malakar was created with approval of and contributions by the entertainer and his mother Jillian Blyth, and archives include in-person reports for each 2007 American Idol Concert Tour event.\n\nSimon Cowell told \"Extra\" that had Malakar won, he would not have returned as a judge to the show, even though he was contractually obligated to return. The show's executive producer predicted that Malakar would not win. Some commentators have remarked that the judges seemed to have stopped giving thoughtful critiques of Malakar's performances. The judges seemed stunned by his large following of voters. Randy Jackson went as far to remark that \"I cannot even say anything on the vocals anymore\", in his critique of Malakar after his performance during the top nine. Chris Ayres of \"The Times\" speculated that it would have been a turning point leading toward decline and eventual cancellation for \"American Idol\" if Malakar had won. Others, however, believe that the franchise benefited from the publicity, which was more popular than previous seasons of \"Idol\". On the April 17 broadcast of \"American Idol\", Cowell further said of the controversy, \"I know this has been funny for a while, but based on the fact that we are supposed to be finding the next American Idol [Malakar's performance] was hideous.\"\n\nThe weblog Vote for the Worst had Malakar as its current \"pick\" for the sixth season top 12 until he was eliminated. On March 19, 2007, Howard Stern campaigned for his radio show listeners to join the weblog in voting for Malakar \"to corrupt the No.1 show on television\". Some Stern regulars claimed to have voted for Malakar over 300 times—largely in hopes of tormenting \"American Idol\" traditionalists on the show. Later, when asked for a reaction, Malakar told Jimmy Kimmel that his aunt had voted 1100 times.\n\nThe fan reaction of Ashley Ferl was satirized on the March 24, 2007 broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\", during the \"Weekend Update\" segment. Malakar was portrayed by Andy Samberg, and the crying girl was portrayed by Kristen Wiig. Also feigning tears in the audience were Fred Armisen and Dan Aykroyd. Samberg portrayed Malakar again during the monologue of the April 21, 2007 episode, singing the song \"Something To Talk About\" as a duet with host Scarlett Johansson. The controversy spawned colloquialisms associated with Malakar's name, such as \"Sanjayamania\" and \"Fanjaya\" to denote a Sanjaya fan.\n\nThe Federal Way City Council, initially unable to find his address or whereabouts, announced plans to honor Malakar. Sanjaya Malakar was greeted by screaming fans at The Commons at Federal Way, and was praised by the city's Mayor Michael Park and King County Council member Peter von Reichbauer for serving as a great role model, with Park stating \"Sanjaya's charismatic personality, contagious smile, positive attitude and enthusiastic pursuit of his dreams are qualities to be admired.\" Malakar was presented a Certificate of Appreciation from the city and declaration of \"South King County Sanjaya Malakar Day\". In May 2007, he was also honored at Seattle Center in Seattle, Washington,\nwhere he was greeted by fans, signed autographs and answered questions. The council had received 200 e-mails from around the country asking the city to honor Malakar.\n\nSince Malakar placed in the top 10, he qualified to perform as part of the 2007 American Idol Concert Tour, which, over three months, visited over 50 cities in Canada and U.S. He performed Michael Jackson's \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" during the tour.\n\nShortly after his run on \"American Idol\" ended, Malakar attended the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner as a \"People\" magazine guest, where he saw then-President George W Bush. Malakar was popular among the press and fans at the dinner, and was even prompted for an autograph by then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer.\n\nSeveral magazines honored the singer, including \"Us Weekly\", \"People\", \"TIME\", and \"Teen\". He was featured in \"Us Magazines April 20, 2007, issue in an article entitled \"Sanjaya Speaks\", where he was asked about his reactions to the parodies, Simon Cowell, Howard Stern and to his new celebrity status. He was featured in the May 7, 2007, issue of \"People\", where he talked about his \"American Idol\" run, his younger years, and future aspirations. The article mentions that he was raised vegetarian, a diet he no longer follows. In \"TIMEs 2007 \"TIME 100 POLL for The Most Influential People of the Year\", based on online public votes, he ranked third. He was nominated for \"Teen\"'s 2007 \"Top Ten Most Cutest\".\n\nAward shows acknowledged Malakar, as well. He won two of TV.com's Fashion Awards, in the categories of \"ON AIR: Best Hair – Male\", and \"OFF AIR: Best Trendsetter – Male\", by public votes. He was nominated for \"Best Reality Show Star\" in AZN Television's annual Asian Excellence Awards and was a presenter at the awards ceremony aired May 24, 2007 on E! and May 28, 2007 on AZN-TV. At the 2007 Teen Choice Awards on August 26, he was named \"Best TV Reality Star\". He grabbed a nomination and a win for Fox's 2007 Golden Realitini Awards. At the October 13, 2007 show, he was nominated for \"Most Memorable Reality Personality of the Year\", and he won the \"Favorite Reality Game Loser\" award at the awards ceremony, where he was a presenter. Malakar won Fox's 2007 Golden Realitini Award for Favorite Reality Game Loser aired. \"Sanjaya's Ponyhawk\" was ranked as No. 3 in the 2007 \"Top TV Moment\" video searches by AOL.\n\nIn 2017, he won the Remington's Got Talent, a local show in Whitefish, MT.\n\nIn the months following \"Idol\", Malakar appeared as a guest on multiple television shows, including \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", \"Access Hollywood\", \"The Today Show\", \"Good Morning America\", \"Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader\", \"Live with Regis and Kelly\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"The Morning Show\", \"Extra\", \"The Early Show\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"The Rachel Ray Show\". Additionally, he got \"slimed\" on Nickelodeon. He also appeared with the rest of the top 10 on \"Larry King Live\", \"Access Hollywood\", and \"Good Day L.A.\"\n\nUpon meeting Billy Ray Cyrus, Malakar reported discussing a guest spot on Disney Channel's \"Hannah Montana\" in an April 20, 2007 interview with Access Hollywood.\n\nOn May 22, 2007, a one-minute short \"I Am Art\", co-produced with Will Ferrell, was released online with Malakar playing Bill Vendall, a 25-year-old graduate student of the arts, who created the character \"Sanjaya Malakar\" to appear on \"American Idol\", as an installment of his thesis. Malakar released a follow-up video explaining it was a joke, since some believed Bill Vendall was real.\n\nMalakar also hosted an \"American Idol\" show on the \"TV Guide\" channel called \"Idol Stars: Where Are They Now?\", talking about what past \"Idol\" stars are currently doing. Malakar also mentioned that he was continuing music and he helped write the book, \"Chicken Soup for the American Idol Soul\". Malakar also wrote an autobiography entitled \"Dancing to the Music in My Head: Memoirs of the People's Idol\" in 2009. He reported that he received a $100,000 advance for the book. In India, Malakar received his first acting role, where he starred in a Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company commercial, where he seeks help from a guru.\n\nIn May–June 2009, he starred in the reality show second season of the reality television show \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" along with Torrie Wilson, Holly Montag, Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, Stephen Baldwin, Daniel Baldwin, Janice Dickinson, Lou Diamond Phillips, John Salley, Frangela, and Patti Blagojevich. On the show he earned the nickname \"Jungle Boy\" in recognition of how comfortable he appeared in the jungle. He developed a close friendship with the older Holly Montag, as such, her sister Heidi had dubbed them \"SanJolly\". They have stated that they are not in a relationship, but do spend considerable time together.\n\nIn May 2010, \"Seattle Weekly\" reported that Malakar was working as a singer for Pagliacci Pizza, a Seattle-based pizzeria chain.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Malakar joined the off-Broadway musical \"Freckleface Strawberry\" at New World Stages.\n\nOn February 26, 2011, Malakar was a guest judge for the finals of local Seattle talent competition, \"Seattle Superstar Search.\"\n\nIn July 2011 Malakar toured the United States with the band, The Brave Chandeliers.\n\nAs of May 2012, Malakar is now a bartender living in Queens, New York. Of the money he made, Malakar admits most has been lost: \"I was young. I didn't know anything. Some people took advantage. Some skimmed a little off the top, financially.\"\n\nAs of April 2014, Malakar quit working at an East Village bar to have more time and energy to focus on his music, including his work-in-progress, \"Life ~ Love ~ Music\", and his focus on studio covers.\n\nOn July 14, 2016 he performed at the Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort in Suquamish, Washington as part of their Free Summer Lawn Concert series.\n\nMalakar sings seven jazz standards on the album \"Good Merlin\" by The Chaz Lipp Groove Tripp. The album releases June 23, 2017 and Malakar has received positive reviews for his performance.

It is Australia's first accredited Disability Service based on the principles of Japanese Budo. Compass is a registered member of the National Disability Services, providing post-school services for young people with an intellectual disability. \n\nCompass has been operating as a not for profit organisation since the early 90's. It began in 1991 as 'The Aikido Institute' providing alternative education and intervention programmes to school-aged children. Between 1992 and 2006 over 7000 children participated in the intervention programmes. In 2003 The Aikido Institute became The Compass Institute Inc., and began providing post-school education, training and vocational opportunities to young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities.\n\nIn 2013 Compass is a registered charity employing 30 specialist staff and supporting over 70 young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities through 6 centres from Gladstone to Gympie. One of these centres is a working farm, which provides opportunities for around 20 young people to gain access to further training in animal husbandry, horticulture, nursery work, and property maintenance.\n\nThe Compass Institute Inc. provides further education in a broad range of subjects. The goal of the Institute is to provide real life skills with a focus on personal development and independent living. This includes literacy, numeracy, communication, fitness, social skills, food preparation, personal grooming, transport and community participation.\n\nCompass employs staff in roles such as teachers, trainers, coaches and mentors, similarly those that attend Compass are students or 'Trainees' and not referred to as 'clients'.\n\nThe organisation works on making pathways for disabled young people to become increasingly independent. Central to Compass training and vocation units is the provision of \"real further education, skills-based training and vocational opportunities as part of a structured pathway to social and economic participation\". Through the vocational pathways Compass provides, people with a disability have successfully been placed into appropriate and rewarding work. The Compass Institute Inc. is involved in setting up social enterprises as vocational pathways for its trainees. These are ‘real life’ businesses that are integrated into the local community, including lawn and garden maintenance, Vehicle detailing, business support services, art and craft markets and the Compass Farm.\n\nThe purchase of an 8 hectare property enabled the organisation to set up an innovative educational and vocational setting, known as the Compass Farm. At this facility trainees can undertake vocational training, work experience and therapy. In 2011, 20 people with disabilities, ranging in ages from 20 to 30 undertook training and work programs at the property. Activities range from animal husbandry, mixed horticulture, nursery work and property maintenance work.\n\nUnderpinning the structure and organisation of both the service provision and management of Compass are the philosophies of Japanese Budo. The early work of the Aikido Institute (now The Compass Institute Inc.) involved running intervention programs and life skills classes that used Aikido and Budō to help students with goal setting, anger management, time management, and self-defence. These “unique experiential programs” employed the principles of traditional martial arts philosophy and practice to engage students. From here Compass branched out into the disability service, but the role of Aikido and budo philosophy has never ceased to have an important role in the running of Compass.\n\nCompass CEO David Dangerfield has been using martial arts to help build physical skills and self-confidence in people for over 30 years.

It can be used to help students form individual ideas, discuss and share with the others in-group. It can be used before reading or teaching a concept and works better with smaller groups.\n\nIn think-pair-share strategy the teacher acts as a facilitator, and poses a question or a problem to the students. The students are given sufficient time to think and gather their thoughts, after which the teacher asks them to pair themselves and share their thoughts with each other.\n\nAs the students begin to share their thoughts and views, each learns to see the different perspective of thinking among their peers. By doing so the students learning is enhanced by the formation and articulation of an idea. This also enables the students to have clarity of thought and have the ability to communicate their thoughts and ideas to another student.\n\nIf time permits the paired students can share their thought with other paired students, and teachers can ask one or two pairs to share their ideas with the entire class.\n\nThink-pair-share is designed to help the student to understand the concept of the given topic, develop ability to filter the information and formulate an idea or thought, and draw conclusions. The most important aspect of the think-pair-share is that students will develop the ability to consider and appreciate the different viewpoints of their peers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30518856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30518856", "title": "Training simulation", "text": "Training simulation\n\nIn business, training simulation is a virtual medium through which various types of skills can be acquired. Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonly used in corporate situations to improve business awareness and management skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course.\n\nThe word simulation implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a lifelike experience. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide. They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games; their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain.\n\nCompanies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees. With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on making decisions in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or product design, and these are called \"Functional Simulations\". Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called \"Total Enterprise Simulations\". In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors.\n\nTraining Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to \"think outside the box\" and see the bigger picture. This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful.\nAlthough the most common use for training simulations is in a corporate setting, simulation games are increasingly being used to educate young people about the importance of business. From secondary school age all the way up to MBA students, anyone can benefit from the first-hand experience of running a company and making decisions that directly affect performance. This will allow the participants to gain an overall understanding of the business world, and give some insight into the type of skills that are necessary to succeed. It is also important to note that ‘beating the game’ should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives. If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice. Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation. This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period.\n\nThe concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years, but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called \"The Top Management Decision Game\", and was created by the American Management Association. Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are computer based, and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered. Most simulations are based around a real industry, and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge.\n\nMost corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme. This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows:\n\n\nThis integrated training will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client, to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible.\n\nSince training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include:\n\nIf every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.\n\n"}

It consists of two faculties: the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education and the Faculty of Natural and Health Sciences. The university offers bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D.'s in both faculties. The student body is small, having almost 600 students. The university organizes an annual dissertation competition open to all students. The educational language of the university is Faroese, making it the only university in the world to conduct classes officially in that language. The university works closely with the University of Copenhagen and the University of Iceland for research projects and is a member of UArctic.\n\nThe University of the Faroe Islands was founded in 1965 by members of the Faroese Scientific Society, founded in 1952. Among their activities, the Society published a scientific periodical and carried out comprehensive work on the compilation of Faroese vocabulary.\n\nThe university began with one professor, Christian Matras, and a registrar, Maud Heinesen. In its first years the school offered one-year courses in natural history and Faroese for teachers. In addition to the yearly courses, the university arranged for a collection committee with the task of preserving all Faroese folk culture. Today this material is in the archives of the Faculty of Faroese Language and Literature.

{"id": "4865950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4865950", "title": "Université Grenoble Alpes", "text": "Université Grenoble Alpes\n\nThe Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA, French: meaning \"Grenoble Alps University\") is a public research university in Grenoble, France. Founded in 1339, it is the third largest university in France with about 45,000 students and over 3,000 researchers.\n\nEstablished as the University of Grenoble by Humbert II of Viennois, it split in 1971 following the May 1968 events. Three of the University of Grenoble's inheritors—Joseph Fourier University, Pierre Mendès-France University, and Stendhal University—reunited in 2016 to restore the original institution under the name Université Grenoble Alpes. The university is organized around two closely located urban campuses: Domaine Universitaire of 175 ha which straddles Saint-Martin-d'Hères and Gières, and Campus GIANT of 250 ha in Grenoble. UGA also owns and operates facilities in Valence, Chambéry, Les Houches, Villar-d'Arêne, Mirabel, Échirolles, and La Tronche.\n\nThe city of Grenoble is one of the largest scientific centers in Europe, hosting facilities of every existing public research institution in France. This allows UGA to have hundreds of research and teaching partnerships, including close collaboration with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). Overall, Grenoble as a city is the largest research center in France after Paris with 22,800 researchers.\n\nUGA is traditionally known for its research and education in the natural sciences and engineering, but also law, linguistics, and psychology. It has been cited among the best and most innovative universities in Europe. It is also renowned for its academic research in humanities and political sciences, hosting some of the largest research centers in France in fields such as political science, urban planning or the sociology of organizations.\n\nThe University of Grenoble was founded in May 12, 1339 by Humbert II of Viennois, the last independent ruler of Dauphiné, a state of the Holy Roman Empire. Its purpose was to teach civil and canon law, medicine, and the liberal arts. It was considered a leader in the Renaissance revival of the classics and development of liberal arts.\n\nHumbert's actions were inspired by his granduncle Robert, King of Naples, at whose royal court Humbert spent his youth. King Robert, known as the Wise, skillfully developed Naples from a small port to a lavish city and had a reputation of a cultured man and a generous patron of the arts, friends with such great minds as Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Giotto.\n\nSuch rich experience contributed to Humbert's intention to create a university in his own state, and to do so he visited Pope Benedict XII to get a papal bull of approval.\n\nHumbert cared deeply about his students, offering generous aid, protection, and even providing a hundred of them with free housing. Humbert's financial losses during the Smyrniote crusades, Black Death, and Dauphiné's attachment to France have greatly decreased the activity of the university leading to its closure, since a small mountainous town couldn't support its activity on its own.\n\nIt was reopened again by Louis XI of France in 1475 in Valence under the name University of Valence, while the original university was restored in Grenoble in 1542 by Francis de Bourbon, Count of St. Pol. The two universities were finally reunited in 1565. At that point Grenoble was an important center of law practice in France, thus law practice was at the center of the university education.\n\nThe French Revolution, with its focus on the end to inherited privilege, led to the suppression of most universities in France. To revolutionaries, universities embodied bastions of corporatism and established interests. Moreover, lands owned by the universities and utilized for their support represented a source of wealth and therefore were confiscated, just as property possessed by the Church.\n\nIn 1805–1808, Napoleon reestablished faculties of law, letters, and science. The Bourbon Restoration had temporarily suppressed the Faculty of Letters and the Faculty of Law, but by the 1850s the university's activity had begun rapidly developing again.\n\nThe development of the sciences at the university was spearheaded by the transformation of Grenoble from a regional center to a major supplier of industrial motors and electrical equipment in 1880s. The faculties were formally inaugurated as the University of Grenoble in 1879 in the newly constructed Place de Verdun. There were around 3000 students in 1930. Significant enrollment growth in the 1960s created pressures on the academic infrastructure of the university; the library Suzanne Dobelmann helped expand facilities, especially those relating to science and medicine.\n\nFollowing riots among university students in May 1968, a reform of French education occurred. The Orientation Act \"(Loi d’Orientation de l’Enseignement Superieur)\" of 1968 divided the old faculties into smaller subject departments, decreased the power of the Ministry of National Education, and created smaller universities, with strengthened administrations.\n\nThus, sharing the fate of all French universities in 1970s, the University of Grenoble was split into four institutions. Each university had different areas of concentration of study and the faculties were divided as follows:\n\n\nOn 1 January 2016, the first three institutions reunited to restore the original common institution under the name Université Grenoble Alpes. Although Grenoble-INP remains separate, it is an active member of the Community Université Grenoble Alpes and cooperates very closely with the university not only in research projects, but also by sharing labs, offering mutual courses and training for students and researchers.\n\nThe Université Grenoble Alpes is a public institution of scientific, cultural and professional relevance, which, similar to other universities in France, is governed by a board of directors and an academic council elected every four years. The president of the university is elected by the board of Directors after each renewal, and is eligible for re-election once. On 3 December 2015, staff and students from Joseph Fourier University, Pierre Mendès-France University, and Stendhal University voted to elect representatives to the central councils of the new university. On 7 January 2016, the Board of Directors of the Université Grenoble Alpes elected Lise Dumasy as president. It was the first time a woman has been elected to head a merged university in France.\n\nThe university is also a member of the Community Université Grenoble Alpes, a COMUE whose current president is Patrick Lévy. The association allows the humanities and social sciences and natural and formal sciences to be represented in the governance of the entire university system of Grenoble.\n\nThe Université Grenoble Alpes is made up of 23 departments, schools and institutes.\n\n\nIn addition, there is Grenoble Institute of Political Studies - an autonomous institute of the Université Grenoble Alpes, focusing on rigorous training of students in political sciences.\n\nCovering all disciplinary fields, the Université Grenoble Alpes has 106 research departments spread out in six centres bringing together different types of organisations (joint research departments, host teams, platforms, etc.) in the same scientific field.\n\nUGA has a considerable number of notable alumni in several different fields, ranging from academics to political leaders, executives, and artists.\n\nMany European politicians have studied law, economics, and languages in UGA, including:\nReinhold Maier; Helene Weber;Walther Schreiber; Michel Destot; Louis Besson;Thierry Repentin; André Vallini; and Geoffrey Acland.\n\nOther political leaders include: Gaétan Barrette, Minister of Health and Social Services of Canada; Paul Kaba Thieba, Prime Minister of Burkina Faso; Abderrahmane Benkhalfa, Minister of Finance of Algeria; Hazem El Beblawi, Prime Minister of Egypt; Richard E. Hoagland, US Ambassador; Abdoulaye Wade, President of Senegal; Driss Basri, Interior Minister of Morocco; Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, Ambassador for Mauritania; Şenkal Atasagun, Chief of the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey; Ignas Jonynas, Lithuanian diplomat; Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of Laos; Ali Al Shami, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lebanon; Fathallah Sijilmassi, Moroccan politician and economist; Mohammed al-Dairi Minister of Foreign Affairs of Libya.\n\nUGA alumni also include American journalist Warren D. Leary, French journalists Éric Conan, Olivier Galzi, Françoise Joly, Laurent Mauduit, Philippe Robinet, Caroline Roux, British Joanna Gosling and Safia Shah, and German Jona von Ustinov, who worked for MI5 during the time of the Nazi regime.\n\nAmong social activists who attended UGA, one could find Léo-Paul Lauzon, Léa Roback, Austin Mardon, and the former CEO of the Chicago Urban League James Compton.\n\nNumerous prominent scientists have studied at the Université Grenoble Alpes since the development of the hydro-power in the region in 1880s. Prominent fields include physics, material sciences, and computer sciences with alumni like Yves Bréchet, member of the French Academy of Sciences; Rajaâ Cherkaoui El Moursli, who worked on the Higgs Boson discovery; Patrick Cousot, French computer scientist; Joseph Sifakis, Turing Award laureate; Claude Boutron, French glaciologist; Jean-Louis Coatrieux, French researcher in medical imaging; Michel Cosnard, French computer scientist; Paul Trendelenburg, German pharmacologist; Yousef Saad, computer scientist; Maurice Nivat, Catherine Ritz, French Antarctic researcher; Eric Goles, Chilean mathematician; Pierre Colmez, French mathematician; René Alphonse Higonnet, French engineer; Marlon Dumas, Honduran computer scientist; Claire Berger, French physicist.\n"}

Often working within a Writing Center or Writing Across a Curriculum program, they typically provide oral and/or written feedback on papers to students in an upper-division writing class. A Writing Fellow is most often a peer tutor; however, the term “Writing Fellow” is also sometimes used for faculty members who advise others on teaching, assigning and responding to student writing in their specific disciplines.\n\n\n"}
