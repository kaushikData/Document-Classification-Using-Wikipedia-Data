There are eighteen different sites in Asia that host Asia Regional Final and Dhaka is one of them. Each year the winner of the \"Asia Regional Final Dhaka Site Contest\" advances to the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Like other sites of ICPC, Dhaka site contest is also sponsored by IBM and operated under the auspices of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).\n\nACM ICPC Dhaka site contest started in 1997 with the initiative of Professor A. L. Haque of North South University (NSU). Its first event was held on 18 November 1997 with the participation of 18 teams from 11 institutions. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology - BUET Bengal Tigers team became the champion and moved to the world final which was held on 28 February 1998 at Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Champion BUET team of Suman Kumar Nath (now at Microsoft Research), Rezaul Alam Chowdhury (UT Austin) and Tarique Mesbaul Islam (Waterloo) occupied 24th position in the world final among 54 teams tying with Stanford University. Same year, NSU team received a wild card for being the host of the Dhaka site regional contest and participated in the world final.\n\nNorth South University hosted this event 12 times from 1997 to 1999, 2004 to 2006, 2008 to 2011, 2013 and 2015 while Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology hosted thrice from 2001 to 2003.

She has been described as a trusted aide to the former president and governor and, during his absence due to his presidential campaign, was credited with running Arkansas' daily business. She cites her life experiences as the mother of a child with a disability as motivation for her political advocacy and influence and has most recently worked most with literacy projects. \n\nRasco was born in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1948, to Frank Barnes Hampton, a pharmacist, and Ruby Hampton, a stay-at-home mother. The family returned to DeWitt, Arkansas, after Barnes returned to take over his family's drugstore.\n\nRasco skipped the 12th grade and enrolled in Hendrix College, though she would later transfer to the University of Arkansas, where she would graduate. She began as a drama major but later changed her major to education due to an interest in children's psychology. On campus, she became a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority and also displayed an interest in politics. She was involved in fellow student Mack McLarty's campaign for student body president, who would become Clinton's chief of staff under the same administration in which she would work. She married husband Terry Rasco in 1969.\n\nAfter teaching for several years, Rasco went to the University of Central Arkansas for her Masters degree in Elementary Couseling and Psychology, graduating in 1972. In Bryant, Arkansas, she set up a psychological counseling system for the public school system, where she would continue working when her first son was born.\n\nIn 1973, Rasco's son was born with cerebral palsy and brain damage, which she believed may possibly have been prevented if the hospital staff had been less inattentive and performed a Caesarean section to prevent a traumatic and extended labor. She states that working with her son's disability and development gave her \"empathy with those who were reliant on government, from the elderly to young mothers on welfare.\" In 1981, she gave birth to a daughter. Rasco stated that, \"as I began to learn about all the different agencies and entities you have to try to coordinate to raise a child like this, I became very interested in how we could better design systems to help children and families.\"\n\nDuring her early career, Rasco taught elementary school in the public school system and was a middle school counselor. She volunteered with arts organizations, disability rights groups, and the United Methodist Church. In 1976, she met the Clintons during a coffee chat as Bill ran for state Attorney General, and she would later work with disability rights coalitions to lobby the Arkansas legislature to integrate and provide education for disabled children in school.\n\nRasco began as the Director of Policy for the Arkansas Governor's Office, serving for ten years from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1992. From 1985 to 1992, she served as Liaison to the National Governor's Association under Bill Clinton's terms as Arkansas governor; in this position, she worked primarily on child care, welfare reform, and healthcare reform, but in a profile by \"The New York Times\", she was described as running \"much of the state's daily business\" during the year Clinton was absent campaigning for president. During these terms, she helped create consensus on welfare legislation and managed the state's human service policies during a federal lawsuit on insufficient and failing child welfare programs. \n\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Rasco then served as Director of the Domestic Policy Council under President Clinton and also served on the United States Department of Education's Education Goals Panel. As a trusted aide to President Clinton, she played a role in immunization policy and continued to push for a more helpful government, especially towards families and for disability rights. She also influenced other areas of policy, such as family preservation, immigration, and healthcare coverage, and emphasized to her staff that policy should not forget individuals and reasons behind why individuals may be affected by an issue.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2000, she became the senior adviser to United States Secretary of Education Richard Riley and became the director of Clinton's childhood literacy initiative, the America Reads Challenge, which she and Riley designed and implemented.\n\nIn 2001, Rasco briefly worked for College Board as a consultant on government relations before joining Reading Is Fundamental (RIF), the largest literacy non-profit organization in the United States, as its president and CEO that November. She had previously become familiar with the organization while implementing the America Reads Challenge, and while at the organization, its communications department encouraged her to start blogging. During her leadership, the organization experienced federal budget cuts and celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 2016, she began working as a Child Advocate for Three Boys with Books.\n\n"}

She received a MPhil. in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1970 in English from Yale University. Her late husband, Paul Alpers, was a scholar of Renaissance English literature and the founding director of UC Berkeley‚Äôs Townsend Center for the Humanities, until his death in 2013. She has two grown children, Jonathan and Elizabeth Sklute, from a previous marriage, as well as two grandchildren. She lives in Berkeley.\n\nIn 1970, Christ joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, and was chair of the English department from 1985 to 1988. In 1988, she was appointed dean of humanities, mathematics, and natural sciences. She also served as provost and dean of the College of Letters and Sciences. In 1994, Christ was appointed vice chancellor, assistant manager, and provost (and later became executive vice chancellor) at Berkeley. Christ was the highest-ranking female administrator at Berkeley until she returned to full-time teaching in 2000.\n\nChrist became the 10th president of Smith College in 2002. At Smith, Christ led an energetic and wide-ranging strategic planning process to identify the distinctive intellectual traditions of the Smith curriculum and foster initiatives to further develop students‚Äô essential capacities. Throughout her administrative career, Christ has maintained an active program of teaching and research. She has published two books: \"The Finer Optic: The Aesthetic of Particularity in Victorian Poetry\" and \"Victorian and Modern Poetics\". She also edited a Norton Critical Edition of George Eliot‚Äôs \"The Mill on the Floss\" and co-edited the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature and Victorian Literature\" and \"The Victorian Visual Imagination\".

On March 13, 2017, Christ was named by University of California President Janet Napolitano as the new Chancellor-elect of the University of California, Berkeley. On March 16, 2017, the Regents of the University of California confirmed her appointment. On July 1, 2017, Christ became the 11th UC Berkeley Chancellor and the first woman to serve in this role, succeeding Chancellor Nicholas B. Dirks.\n\nAt the start of her first academic year as chancellor, Christ responded to the 2017 Berkeley protests in which protests against conservative speakers led to violent outbreaks. In a letter to the campus which quoted John Stuart Mill, she affirmed the administration's commitment to free speech and urged the community to remember its roots as part of the free speech movement. She later took other steps in this direction which included moderating a panel on free expression and committing $800,000 to providing security for controversial speakers. In a September 2017 interview, she stated that some students find the concept of free speech objectionable.\n\nChrist serves on the board of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) and is a trustee of Sarah Lawrence College and Dominican University of California.\n\nChrist was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004 and a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2013. Additionally, she was awarded Yale University's Wilbur Cross Medal in 2007, and in 2011, the American College of Greece awarded her an honorary doctorate.\n\n"}

The 3-day CFE is also reputed to be among the world's most challenging professional exams where students are required to use an integrative business thinking model to obtain the designation. Previously known as the Uniform Evaluation (UFE), the UFE has been discontinued following the unification of the three accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA) in Canada and Bermuda in June 2015.\n\nAdministered nationally by CPA Canada, and conducted regionally by the provincial/regional orders, the CFE is written over the course of three sequential days and is the culmination of years of study in financial accounting, management accounting, corporate finance, performance management, taxation and other business-related university courses. Writing the CFE requires successful completion of preliminary education requirements including CPA preparatory courses and Professional Education Program (PEP). Upon passing the CFE and 30 months of approved practical experiences, the candidate will become a Chartered Professional Accountant.\n\nThe Common Final Exam is typically offered once per year in September (Fall). Sometimes, it may be offered twice a year in Spring and Fall (such as May and September 2016). The upcoming CFE dates are: September 11 - September 13, 2019.

Students answer questions which are presented in the form of business cases that include a combination of both explicit and implicit requirements for each case's \"users\", followed by a list of exhibits that provide case facts from which observations, suggestions and conclusions are derived. Common scenarios include providing advice on how to conduct an audit, advising a client on the pros and cons of investing funds in a given business venture, and providing support to an organization as an internal accountant or auditor. \n\nAll students must demonstrate \"depth\" in financial reporting or management accounting for the CFE, and one of the elective areas.

{"id": "391167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391167", "title": "Curator", "text": "Curator\n\nA curator (from , meaning \"to take care\") is a manager or overseer. Traditionally, a curator or keeper of a cultural heritage institution (e.g., gallery, museum, library, or archive) is a content specialist charged with an institution's collections and involved with the interpretation of heritage material.\n\nA traditional curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort ‚Äî artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections. More recently, new kinds of curators have started to emerge: curators of digital data objects and biocurators.\n\nIn smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for collections care. The curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper packaging of art for transportation, and shares research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.\n\nIn larger institutions, the curator's primary function is that of a subject specialist, with the expectation that he or she will conduct original research on objects and guide the organization in its collecting. Such institutions can have multiple curators, each assigned to a specific collecting area (e.g., curator of ancient art, curator of prints and drawings, etc.) and often operating under the direction of a head curator. In such organizations, the physical care of the collection may be overseen by museum collections-managers or by museum conservators, with documentation and administrative matters (such as personnel, insurance, and loans) handled by a museum registrar.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"curator\" also applies to government employees who monitor the quality of contract archaeological work under Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (PPG 16) and manage the cultural resource of a region. In the museum setting, a curator in the United Kingdom may also be called a \"keeper\".\n\nIn Scotland, the term \"curator\" is also used to mean the guardian of a child, known as curator \"ad litem\".\n\nIn the US, curators have multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. But in recent years the role of the curator has evolved alongside the changing role of museums. As US museums have become increasingly more digitized, curators find themselves constructing narratives in both the material and digital worlds. Historian Elaine Gurian has called for museums in which \"visitors could comfortably search for answers to their own questions regardless of the importance placed on such questions by others\". This would change the role of curator from teacher to \"facilitator and assistor\". In this sense, the role of curator in the United States is precarious, as digital and interactive exhibits often allow members of the public to become their own curators, and to choose their own information. Citizens are then able to educate themselves on the specific subject they are interested in, rather than spending time listening to information they have no desire to learn.\n\nMore recently, advances in new technologies have led to a further widening of the role of curator. This has been a focus in major art institutions internationally and has become an object of academic study and research.\n\nIn contemporary art, the title \"curator\" identifies a person who selects and often interprets works of art. In addition to selecting works, the curator is often responsible for writing labels, catalog essays, and other content supporting exhibitions. Such curators may be permanent staff members, \"guest curators\" from an affiliated organization or university, or \"freelance curators\" working on a consultancy basis. The late-20th century saw an explosion of artists organizing exhibitions. The artist-curator has a long tradition of influence, notably featuring Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), inaugural president of the Royal Academy of Arts, London, founded in 1768.\n\nIn some US cultural organizations, the term \"curator\" may designate the head of any given division. This has led to the proliferation of titles such as \"Curator of Education\" and \"Curator of Exhibitions\". The term \"literary curator\" has been used to describe persons who work in the field of poetry, such as former 92nd Street Y poetry-director Karl Kirchwey. This trend has increasingly been mirrored in the United Kingdom in such institutions as Ikon, Birmingham, UK and Baltic, Gateshead, UK.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand the term also applies to a person who prepares a sports ground for use (especially a cricket ground). This job is equivalent to that of groundsman in some other cricketing nations.\n\nIn France, the term curator is translated as \"conservateur\". There are two kinds of curators: heritage curators (\"conservateurs du patrimoine\") with five specialities (archeology, archives, museums, historical monuments, natural science museums), and librarian curators (\"conservateurs des biblioth√®ques\"). These curators are selected by competitive examination and attend the INP (Institut National du Patrimoine). The \"conservateurs du patrimoine\" are civil servants or work in the public service; the use of the title by private workers is not possible.\n\nCurators hold a high academic degree in their subject, typically a Doctor of Philosophy or a master's degree in subjects such as history, history of art, art, archaeology, anthropology, or classics. Curators are also expected to have contributed to their academic field, for example, by delivering public talks, publishing articles, or presenting at specialist academic conferences. It is important that curators have knowledge of the current collecting market for their area of expertise, and are aware of current ethical practices and laws that may impact their organisation's collecting.\n\nThe increased complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted the emergence of professional programs in fields such as public history, public humanities, museum studies, arts management, and curating/curatorial practice. In 1992, the Royal College of Art established an MA course co-funded by the Royal College of Art and the Arts Council of Great Britain, the first in Britain to specialise in curating with a particular focus on contemporary art. The course is now funded by Arts Council England, and in 2001 the course title was amended to Curating Contemporary Art to more accurately reflect the content and primary focus of the programme. Similarly, a number of contemporary art institutions launched curatorial study courses as an alternative to traditional academic programs. Established in 1987, the √âcole du Magasin is a curatorial training program based at the art center Le Magasin in Grenoble, France. Similarly, the Whitney Museum of American Art, through its independent study program, hosts a curatorial program as one of its three study areas, and de Appel arts centre has hosted a curatorial programme since 1994. Other institutions that run programs in curating include Norwich University of the Arts; The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK, Kingston University; Goldsmiths, University of London; Birkbeck, University of London; Chelsea College of Arts; University of the Arts London; California College of the Arts; University of Southern California; Bard College; School of Visual Arts; the √âcole du Louvre; the Institut national du patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage), University of Rennes 2‚ÄîUpper Brittany; OCAD University; and University of Melbourne. (See \"‚ÜíExternal links\" for further information on courses.)\n\nCommunity curation - alternately known as public curation - is a movement in US museums and public humanities organizations to involve community members in various curatorial processes, including exhibit development and programming. Community members involved in community curation are likely not trained as museum professionals, but have vested interests in the outcomes of curatorial projects. Community curation is a response to the 19th century ‚Äúinformation transmission‚Äù model of learning, in which museums are sources of expert knowledge and visitors are the recipients of that expertise. Community curation seeks not to abandon expertise, but to broaden definitions of expertise to ‚Äúinclude broader domains of experience‚Äù that visitors bring to museums. \n\nCommunity curation practices are varied. The Wing Luke Museum conducts community outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, and convenes community advisory committees at various stages in the curatorial process. The Brooklyn Historical Society has accepted exhibit proposals from community members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. Such efforts to allow communities to participate in curation can require \"\"more\" not less expertise from museum staff.\" \n\nIn the same way that a museum curator may acquire objects of relevance or an art curator may select or interpret a work of art, the injection of technology and impact of social media into every aspect of society has seen the emergence of technology curators.\n\nTechnology curators are people who are able to disentangle the science and logic of a particular technology and apply it to real world situations and society, whether it is for social change, commercial advantage, or other purposes. The first UK \"Wired\" Conference had a test lab, where an independent curator selected technology that showcased radical technology advancements and their impact on society, such as the ability to design and \"print\" physical objects using 3D printers (such as a fully working violin) or the ability to model and represent accurate interactive medical and molecular models in stereoscopic 3D. \n\nMLOVE, a Confestival started in 2010, celebrated the disruption of the perception of what a tech conference should be, using a radically more interactive format that drew on a variety of influences outside of the traditional world of technology, including religion, micro-banking for developing countries, and interactive art installations/workshops such as the Future Cube and a giant interactive video projection.\n\n\n\n"}

The apprentices generally started at age 16 with some passes at ‚ÄúO‚Äù level General Certificate of Education and were indentured to the company. The indenture took the form of a formal written agreement signed by both the apprentice and the company and bound the apprentice to work for the company for a full five years without leaving their employment or going on strike. The company on its part undertook to pay the apprentice and provide both work experience and college education for as long as the apprentice continued passing annual examinations. Failure in the examinations resulted in the apprentice having to work full-time with only the work experience content of the agreement until completion of the five years.\n\nTypical pay for a first year apprentice between 1955 and 1959 was around two pounds five shillings (¬£2.25) for a 44-hour week (8am to 6pm Monday to Thursday and finishing at 5pm on Fridays). Special ‚Äòclocking in‚Äô clocks were used to record arrival and departure time with penalties of 15 minutes deduction of pay for clocking in late at any time ‚Äì even one minute - after the correct starting time. Many apprentices needed a state subsistence allowance in the early years since lodging (digs) typically cost about two pounds ten shillings a week. Nearly all apprentices were living away from their home town.\n\nInitially apprentices typically spent 3 to 4 months working on production lines producing components for radios and TV‚Äôs such as transformers, deflection coils, printed circuit boards, 13 channel tuners and various other sub-assemblies. These departments predominately employed women between 16 and 60 years old, many of whom were bussed daily to the factory from the surrounding Cambridgeshire villages. Further time was spent in the machine shop operating power presses, fly presses, and capstan lathes. Some apprentices spent time in the toolroom, others in the maintenance department helping senior engineers maintain the plant and equipment throughout the factory. In the later stages of their apprenticeship, apprentices might spend six months to a year in research departments, the ‚Äòmodel shop‚Äô, the drawing office or at other Pye facilities which allowed or encouraged original thought. The Pye \"Service Centre\" in Cambridge as well as Centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh also provided hands on expericence with the help of experienced technicians.\n\nApprentices attended the Cambridgeshire Technical College and School of Art (later Cambridge College of Arts and Technology and now Ruskin Anglia University) for one day and one evening a week during term time to study engineering. Study was for City and Guilds Examinations or Ordinary National Certificate followed by Higher National Certificate in electrical or mechanical engineering. Some apprentices managed to voluntarily attend college for extra evenings to study complementary courses, typically radio and TV servicing or Telecommunications. Further study led some apprentices on to become members of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Institute of Measurement and Control.\n\nThe apprentices were members of the Association of Pye Limited Apprentices (APLA) Association which arranged weekend educational visits to the Radio Show at Earls Court, the National Physical Laboratory and other educational venues. On the lighter side they also organized a number of ball room dances in Cambridge and some very popular events featuring the Jazz Bands of Chris Barber and Acker Bilk who were in their heyday at that time. In 1959 they participated in the annual Poppy Day collection running a flat-bed lorry (truck) around Cambridge with a closed circuit camera and multiple monitor hook-up.\n\nPye also employed a smaller number of Graduate Apprentices who usually were at least 18 years old and had some A level Certificates. These apprentices typically started in a research department.\n\nAround 1960 Pye apprentices started participating in newly offered Sandwich Courses at the College of Arts and Technology (CAT). Apprentices spent six months at the CAT and then six months working at Pye Cambridge Works Limited. After three years a Higher National Diploma was awarded. Later a fourth year was added which qualified participants for the entry requirements for the Institution of Electrical Engineers (I.E.E. now the I.E.T.). Many apprentices continued with extra studies to later become a Chartered Engineer (UK) with full membership of their appropriate Institute.\n\nHistory of Anglia Ruskin University\n\n"}

The cause of the strike was under-funding of the state's educational system at a time when attendance was rising sharply, and low pay and benefits for teachers. The strike lasted from a few days in some school districts to three months in others. Although a special session of the Florida Legislature approved higher taxes to pay for more school funding, FEA members felt the funding hikes were not enough and voted to continue striking. No additional funding was forthcoming, however, and most local affiliates of the FEA settled their contracts and went back to work by March.\n\nThe 1968 Florida strike is considered the first statewide teachers' strike in United States history.\n\nThe primary causes of the strike were an increase in activism among Florida's teachers, leading to the transformation of the FEA into a labor union, and state underfunding of the Florida education system.\n\nThe Florida Education Association was established in 1886 as an affiliate of the National Education Association (NEA). It was an association rather than a labor union, and was opposed to collective bargaining and strikes.\n\nIn 1963, Pat Tornillo, a teacher in the Dade County school system, ran for the presidency of the Dade County Classroom Teachers Association (DCCTA). He won by calling for greater organizational militancy and the desegregation of teaching staff.\n\nTornillo's election was a sign of a wave of union-like militancy sweeping the NEA in Florida and nationally. Since its inception, the NEA had rejected collective bargaining and strikes as unprofessional. But after the American Federation of Teachers won collective bargaining rights for teachers in New York City and formed the United Federation of Teachers, many NEA members began to push for the association to act more like a union. In 1961, about 200 of the NEA's largest urban locals formed the National Council of Urban Education Associations to push the national organization toward collective bargaining. The caucus was successful: The same year, the NEA Representative Assembly (RA) passed a resolution establishing an \"Urban Project\", adopting a policy of \"professional negotiations\" akin to collective bargaining, and requiring the NEA to provide staff, research and financial assistance to locals involved in \"professional negotiations.\" By 1965, the NEA was providing nearly $885,000 a year to locals in support of \"professional negotiations\", up from a mere $28,000 in 1961. In 1962, pro-unionization forces in the NEA pushed to remove the organization's prohibition against strikes. They were unsuccessful, but did win approval of a \"sanctions\" policy. \"Sanctions\" included waging a public relations campaign against the school district, encouraging teachers to not accept teaching positions with the school system, refusing to provide unpaid services (such as tutoring or supervision of clubs), and political action to defeat anti-union politicians. \"Sanctions\" could be employed against any school district which, in the opinion of the local association, had engaged in \"unethical or arbitrary\" policies or which had refused \"sound professional practices.\" The first time the NEA voted sanctions against an entire state was in Utah in 1963.\n\nTornillo eagerly embraced professional negotiations and sanctions, and in 1966 he forced the Dade County school system to open negotiations with the DCCTA. Although the national NEA was obligated to provide assistance, the FEA was not and refused to become involved in Tornillo's professional negotiations. Nevertheless, the DCCTA won a contract. But FEA's reluctance to support the local association led Tornillo and other leaders to lobby the state association to become more militant.\n\nFlorida, like many American states, strictly regulates the way in which local school districts may fund education. Property taxes are the largest source of income, and may be levied by each local school district under a formula controlled by the state legislature. However, the state of Florida also provides funds for a variety of educational programs under formulas established by in state law. These programmatic funds are often funded by the state's sales taxes and so-called sin taxes.\n\nIn 1967, Florida's schools were suffering from a large influx of students. The post-World War II baby boom, U.S. migration, and emigration into the state had caused school enrollment to rise by more than 50 percent, yet little school building or hiring of new personnel had taken place. The underfunding of Florida public schools was acknowledged by most elected leaders, but there seemed little public demand for increased school funding.\n\n1966 was an election year. Republican Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ran for governor and won, becoming the first Republican governor since 1877. Kirk had campaigned heavily on a promise to improve funding for education, but he also made a pledge not to raise taxes.\n\nDuring the 1967 legislature session, the FEA lobbied the state legislature hard for more funding for public schools. State legislative action had often been the only way for NEA locals to win better pay and working conditions prior to the enactment of the professional negotiations policy, so FEA was no newcomer to politics. FEA asked for a minimum teacher salary of $5,000 a year and a more equitable means of funding schools than property taxes. The Democratic-controlled state legislature approved a higher sales tax to provide for more school funding. But Kirk vetoed the budget, and Republican legislators upheld the veto.\n\nMany Florida teachers were angered by the Gov. Kirk's veto. An August 1967 rally at the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando drew 30,000 teachers, who demanded state action. FEA leaders began talking of holding a statewide strike.\n\nSpot strikes occurred throughout the state after the August rally. Even though public employee strikes are illegal in Florida, teachers in Pinellas and Broward counties struck in September. Schools in many districts closed, although no school districts were shuttered. Courts ordered the teachers back into the classroom, but hundreds of teachers still stayed out‚Äîsome for several weeks.\n\nThe September spot-strikes galvanized public opinion into supporting the changes the teachers demanded. Gov. Kirk called a special session of the legislature in January 1968. In a bipartisan effort, legislators raised taxes to expand state funding for school building and to pay for higher teacher salaries. Gov. Kirk signed the tax and funding package immediately.\n\nBut most teachers felt the increases were not enough, and a statewide strike occurred. A special convention of the FEA voted to approve a resolution which condemned the increases as inadequate. In February 1968, FEA president Jane Arnold said the state association would support local teachers if they walked off the job. Thousands did. Since strikes were illegal, what actually happened were mass resignations.\n\nSchools closed in roughly two-thirds of Florida's counties. Many individual schools closed in those districts which managed to remain open and functioning. At the height of the strike, 25,712 educators‚Äîabout 40 percent of the state's teachers‚Äîwalked out.\n\nThe impact of the strike was not uniform, however. Strikes lasted only a few days in some districts, while in others teachers walked picket lines for weeks. In Pinellas County, the local education association stayed out for six weeks, and some small groups of teachers struck for as long as three months.\n\nGov. Kirk and the legislature stood firm, however, and refused to appropriate more money or raise taxes further.\n\nLocal school districts began taking action to break the strike. Arnold and other FEA leaders were threatened with arrest. Tornillo was fined $30,000 and given a two-year jail term (which, after appeal, he was not forced to serve). School districts hired substitute teachers as strikebreakers, and local businesses paid their employees to teach classes.\n\nMost teachers went back after only a few weeks, when it became clear that public support for the teachers, weak at the beginning of the strike, had shrunk dramatically. \"'We thought they (the public) would be with us,' Arnold said. 'We thought it would unite the community and the teachers. It did a little bit of the opposite. ... A lot of teachers lost their innocence. They thought the community liked them.'\" Local education associations began to negotiate their own settlements, often agreeing to not challenge school districts for terminating the most militant teachers. By the end of March, nearly all teachers were back at work, and the strike was over.\n\nThe strike was the nation's first statewide teachers' strike, keeping more than 40 percent of Florida teachers at home. Education funding rose significantly, but the organization felt that it did not rise enough to meet the needs identified by the teachers. From this perspective, the strike was not a success. However, FEA did obtain much higher funding for education and convinced Gov. Kirk to break his no-new-taxes pledge.\n\nThe strike had a profound effect on the national NEA. Following the 1968 Florida strike, delegates to the NEA Representative Assembly (the organization's national governing body) approved a resolution which‚Äîfor the first time‚Äîsanctioned teacher strikes (calling them \"withdrawal of services\") and denouncing state attempts to ban them. The resolution was a direct outcome of the statewide Florida strike.\n\nA longer-term effect of the strike was to dramatically improve the outlook for teachers' unions in Florida. FEA members were radicalized by the strike and the statewide federation later won significant court and legislative victories which legalized and promoted the formation of teacher and education unions in the state. Although the 1968 strike would lead to the fragmentation of the FEA in 1974, education unions merged back into one organization in 2000, and as of 2006 unions were recognized in school districts covering 90 percent of the state's education workers. FEA is now one of Florida's largest unions, and the second-largest in the Florida AFL-CIO.\n\n"}

In 1992 this network became the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) with Shackleford becoming their first president.\n\nIn 1998 IAFFE was made an NGO with special consultative status to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC).\n\nBy 2003 IAFFE had more than five hundred members from over thirty countries. The association's president from 2003 to 2004 was Lourdes Bener√≠a. Shahra Razavi paid tribute to Bener√≠a in a speech at the IAFFE conference in 2012 describing Bener√≠a's work as, \"not only empirically grounded and conceptually informed, but also contributing to a feminist critique that is systemic and connected to a broader critique of capitalism\".\n\nIAFFE was awarded a grant of $1.5¬†million in 2010 from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), to continue their work, including the publication of special issues of \"Feminist Economics\". Since then the association has gone on to number six hundred members in sixty-four countries.\n\nAt the same time as IAFFE was setting up, a separate group of women, including Edith Kuiper, in the Netherlands organized a conference on feminist perspectives on economic theory called \"Out of the Margins\". The conference brought many like minded people together who continued to network with one another and be involved in groups and activism, sometimes involving the IAFFE. (Another small group of Dutch economists founded another organization named FENN, the Feminist Economics Network in the Netherlands). In 1998, at a second Amsterdam conference, arrangements were made to hold the first meeting of IAFFE European chapter.\n\nThe first official meeting of IAFFE Europe took place in Brussels in November 1998, there were twenty-five participants from ten countries and, as a result of the meeting, an e-mail list was created. Information about futures sessions and a report of the first meeting was sent to those interested, this led to more IAFFE panels (in 1999 and 2000) being organized for meetings of the European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE).\n\nThe European chapter of IAFFE continued to meet and Ailsa McKay, professor of economics at Glasgow Caledonian University, was its chair until her death in March 2014.\n\nThe \"Out of the Margins\" conference resulted in a network of contacts being formed, one of these networks gradually became the Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE), a chapter of IAFFE. The chapter includes a small feminist economics group in Wellington, New Zealand led by Prue Hyman.\n\nThe American chapter of IAFFE hold sessions at the American Economic Association's (AEA) annual meetings.\n\nIAFFE offer a prize scholarship in memory of former associate editor of \"Feminist Economics\" (1994‚Äì1998), Rhonda Williams. In 2014 the amount awarded was $1,500 to be given out at their summer conference to allow underrepresented groups in IAFFE attend the conference and present a paper.\n\nAward winners must demonstrate a commitment to one or more of the following issues: inequalities; interrelationships (racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism); and connections between scholarship and activism. Funding is provided by both Routledge and, Taylor & Francis.\n\nIAFFE takes part in Allied Social Sciences Association's (ASSA) annual conference every year. It also has its own annual conferences.\n\nThis is list of who is sitting on the board of IAFFE.\n\nThis is a list of presidents of the IAFFE.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39690802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39690802", "title": "Interpersonal emotion regulation", "text": "Interpersonal emotion regulation\n\nInterpersonal emotion regulation is the process of changing the emotional experience of one's self or another person through social interaction. It encompasses both intrinsic emotion regulation (also known as emotional self-regulation), in which one attempts to alter their own feelings by recruiting social resources, as well as extrinsic emotion regulation, in which one deliberately attempts to alter the trajectory of other people's feelings.\n\nThe concept of interpersonal emotion regulation stems from earlier research into emotional self-regulation, which is the within-person process whereby people influence and change their own feelings. The field of psychology has traditionally focused on \"intra\"personal processes in which a person manages their own emotions individually outside of the social context. However, modern theories have expanded the concept of emotion regulation to include \"inter\"personal processes, in which emotion is regulated with or through other people. Interpersonal models emphasize that humans are social creatures who rarely experience emotions in isolation, and instead more commonly share, express, and manage their emotions with the help of others.\n\nIntrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves managing one's own emotions through social interaction, such as seeking social support or reassurance from others. Examples include calling a friend for advice, venting to a partner about a stressful situation, or engaging in conversation as a distraction from distress. In addition to regulating negative emotions, people also seek to amplify positive emotions by sharing good news with others. As with intrapersonal emotion regulation, people typically attempt to use interpersonal emotion regulation improve their affective state by decreasing negative emotions or increase positive emotions.\n\nExtrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation refers to the deliberate influence of others' feelings. It is one of the many ways how social factors influence an individual's emotions. Examples include trying to cheer up a friend who is upset, trying to make one's partner feel guilty for neglecting oneself, or trying to calm a stressed coworker. These examples illustrate that interpersonal emotion regulation may be used to make others feel better or worse, although making others feel better appears to be far more common.\n\nMany instances of interpersonal emotion regulation, such as those described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the feelings of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the feelings of a whole group of followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated. Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the feelings of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.\n\nInterpersonal emotion regulation is used in most of the important social relationships that we have. Within the fields of developmental and clinical psychology, researchers have long-recognized that people try to influence others' emotions (e.g., mothers influence the feelings of their babies, therapists try to alleviate the sadness of their clients). More recently, social and organizational psychologists have also documented the use of interpersonal emotion regulation within romantic and familial relationships and in a range of work settings (e.g., hospitals, law firms, debt collection agencies, and prisons). Interpersonal emotion regulation may even be used towards complete strangers as a way of making social interactions run more smoothly.\n\nInterpersonal emotion regulation overlaps with social support, which involves giving others emotional, informational, or practical support. Models of interpersonal emotion regulation specify social support within the framework of regulatory goals to improve the feelings of one's self (by seeking support) or another person (by providing support). Emotion regulation mechanisms of social support include attentional deployment (e.g. distraction away from negative thoughts and toward the conversation) and cognitive change (e.g. encouragement to \"look on the bright side\" or change one's negative interpretation of a given situation).\n\nInterpersonal emotion regulation also shares links with other processes by which people come to influence others' emotions, such as emotional contagion, in which the emotions of one person are 'caught' by another person as a result of mere contact (e.g., if someone was having a terrible day, they might 'infect' their friends with their bad mood). Similarly, the compulsion to tell other people about our emotional experiences (termed the social sharing of emotions) can also result in other people coming to feel what we feel. The difference between these processes and interpersonal emotion regulation regards the level of processing involved. Interpersonal emotion regulation is a controlled process, whereby a person intentionally tries to change the way others feel. In contrast, emotional contagion is thought to be relatively automatic, engaged without conscious awareness, while social sharing is somewhat more conscious but typically lacks the intent to influence others' emotions.\n\nInterpersonal emotion regulation relates to emotional labor, the regulation of emotion as part of one's job role. In emotional labor, an employee (usually in a service or care role) is required to manage his or her emotions as part of the job (e.g., 'service with a smile'). Because employees can also be required to manage the emotions of their customers or clients as part of their job (e.g., debt collectors are required to elicit anxiety in relaxed debtors to encourage them to make a payment), interpersonal emotion regulation can be performed as a form of emotional labor.\n\nAnother related process is interpersonal influence, which involves trying to change the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people. The key difference here is that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.\n\nDrawing from evolutionary psychology, social baseline theory purports that humans have adapted to function in a social environment. The brain acts under the assumption that proximity to other people is the norm, or baseline condition. As opposed to social isolation, which is associated with stress and poor health, social proximity is associated with attenuated cardiovascular, hormonal, and neural responses to threat, as well as longevity and physical health. The presence of others is theorized to help individuals conserve effort and metabolic resources through the social regulation of emotion. For example, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is less active during the down-regulation of negative affect while the presence of others. Social proximity is hypothesized to confer emotion regulatory benefits through three mechanisms: 1) risk distribution, 2) load sharing, and 3) capitalization. Risk distribution lowers vigilance towards threat because risks seem lower as group size increases. Load sharing involves the knowledge that close others can provide help and resources if needed. Finally, capitalization refers to the intensification of positive emotions when they are shared with others.\n\nA prominent model proposed by Jamil Zaki and Craig Williams (2013) conceptualizes different classes of interpersonal emotion regulation along two orthogonal dimensions. The first, intrinsic \"vs\" extrinsic, refers to the target of regulatory efforts. Intrinsic regulation involves an attempt to change one's own emotions through social contact, while extrinsic regulation involves trying to change the emotions of another person or group of people. The second dimension, response-dependent vs. response-independent, refers to whether or not the regulatory efforts depend upon the behavior of other people. Processes that rely upon how others respond or behave are considered response-dependent, while strategies that do not depend upon others' behavior are classified as response-independent. This model yields four classes of interpersonal emotion regulation:\n\n\nThere are potentially hundreds of strategies that people can use to influence others' feelings. A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique strategies that could be differentiated primarily according to whether they are used to improve or to worsen others' feelings. Another key distinction is between strategies that engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).\n\nResearch based on Niven and colleagues' classification has indicated that these distinct strategy types have different effects on the well-being of the people who use them and also on the people who they are used towards. They may even have different implications for the quality of the relationship between these two parties.\n\nA different way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to the stage of the emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion, some researchers have suggested that there is a difference between strategies that try to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies that try to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.\n\nPatterns of interpersonal emotion dysregulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders.\n\nAnxiety disorders are perpetuated by avoidance of feared stimuli. Avoidance behaviors can include the presence of \"safety people\", who reduce the anxious individual's distress while negatively reinforcing the avoidance. For example, an individual with panic disorder may ask her partner to drive her to work, which alleviates her fear of having a panic attack while driving. This pattern may lead to reliance upon others and contribute to continued avoidance (e.g. of driving a car alone). Another interpersonal strategy used in anxiety disorders is reassurance seeking. For example, someone with obsessive compulsive disorder may rely upon a roommate to assure them that the doors have been locked, or an individual with generalized anxiety disorder may ask a romantic partner for reassurances of love.\n\nIndividuals with depression experience maladaptive interpersonal interactions, which contribute to their depressive symptoms. These behaviors include greater expressed negativity (e.g. criticism, blaming, demanding, and disengagement) toward romantic partners, and negative feedback seeking. Excessive reassurance seeking is also a vulnerability factor for depression. However, Marroquin (2011) proposes adaptive interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of the positive effects of social support. Social interaction that diverts attention away from self-referential negative thinking and promotes cognitive reappraisal may help to alleviate depression.\n\nAccording to the biosocial model, individuals with borderline personality disorder develop intense emotional expression in part because they have been reinforced throughout development. For instance, a teenager with heightened emotional sensitivity is not taken seriously by her family until she threatens a suicide attempt. If her family responds with attention to extreme emotional expressions, she will learn to continue to express emotions in this way. Venting is another interpersonal emotion regulation strategy that is associated with personality disorder symptoms.\n\nCertain types of psychotherapy target interpersonal factors to improve well-being. Dialectical behavioral therapy, originally developed for individuals with borderline personality disorder, teaches clients interpersonal effectiveness, which includes a variety of skills for communicating emotions in a clear and socially acceptable manner. Assertiveness training is a behavioral intervention that teaches verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills to inhibit anxiety.\n\nSeveral questionnaires have been developed to measure people's self-reported use of interpersonal emotion regulation, including the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS), Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ), Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ), and the Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE).\n\nThe Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) questionnaire is a freely available measure that assess strategies used to improve or worsen either one's own or another person's emotions, yielding a two-by-two framework: 1) intrinsic affect-improving, 2) intrinsic affect-worsening, 3) extrinsic affect-improving, and 4) extrinsic affect-worsening. The \"intrinsic\" subscale measures emotion self-regulation using 10 items. The \"extrinsic\" subscale measures deliberate attempts to improve or worsen others' emotions using 9 items. There is low item endorsement for the affect-worsening dimension, suggesting that people rarely make deliberate attempts to worsen their own or others' emotions. However, extrinsic affect-worsening is associated with health-related impairments, suggesting detrimental effects of engaging in these strategies likely due to negative social repercussions. Additionally, the affect-improving factor is unrelated to current levels of affect, which may be attributed to the scale's psychometric properties or to a discrepancy between current mood state and strategy use (e.g., reporting use of affect-improving strategies more often while in a negative mood state).\n\nThe Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ) is a 20-item measure designed to assess how individuals regulate their own emotions through the use of others. The questionnaire was developed through qualitative interviews with participants (e.g., \"When you are feeling down, in what ways do you look to other people to help you feel better?\"), whose responses were quantitatively tested using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to derive 4 factors containing 5 items each. The 4 factors include Enhancing Positive Affect (seeking social interaction to enhance happiness), Perspective Taking (recruiting others to point out that other people are in a worse situation), Soothing (seeking comfort and sympathy from others), and Social Modeling (observing others for examples of how to cope).\n\nThe Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ) is a 16-item measure of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation that assesses individuals' \"tendency\" to recruit social resources in response to emotional events, as well as their perceived \"efficacy\" of how effective interpersonal strategies are in improving their emotional experiences. Because it is a less common for individuals to deliberately worsen their mood, the measure focuses on increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions. High interpersonal emotion regulation tendency and efficacy is related to greater emotional expressivity, empathy, social connectedness, and supportive relationships. Individuals who score high on efficacy are more likely to benefit from social support.\n\nThe Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE) is a self-report measure of maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies that may relate to psychopathology. Respondents rate how likely they would be to use a variety of strategies in response to three vignettes about stressful hypothetical scenarios (task-oriented, romantic, social). The DIRS consists of four factors, including two intrapersonal (Accept, Avoid) and two interpersonal (Reassurance-seek, Vent) classes of strategies. Reassurance-seeking is related to overall emotion dysregulation, as well as depression and anxiety symptoms. Both reassurance-seeking and venting are associated with negative affect, interpersonal problems, stress, and borderline personality disorder symptoms. \n\n"}

{"id": "21395141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21395141", "title": "Kahn Lectures", "text": "Kahn Lectures\n\nThe Kahn Lectures were series of lectures that took place from 1929 to 1931 at the Department of Art and Archaeology of Princeton University, sponsored by the New York banker Otto Hermann Kahn (1867‚Äì1934). Kahn had funded visits by European scholars to Princeton since 1925, and the new lectures were announced as a continuation of the earlier ones.\nIn 1923, shortly after Otto Kahn's son had entered Princeton, the banker was approached by the art historian Charles Rufus Morey, described by architectural historian Neil Levine as the prime mover of the Department of Art and Archaeology. Kahn agreed in 1924 to donate $1,500 a year for two years to finance extended visits by European scholars to the university. This was later extended for a third year.\n\nThe first of these scholars was the Russian classical scholar Michael Rostovtzeff, who had already settled in the United States in 1918, after the Russian revolution. His lectures were later published as \"The Animal Style in South Russia and China\". The second was the French byzantinist Gabriel Millet, who held the chair for √Üsthetics and Art History at the Coll√®ge de France. The third was the British archaeologist and hittitologist John Garstang.\n\nAfter Kahn had become a member of the Visiting Committee of the Department in 1927, he promised to continue supporting lectures there. These were to begin in 1928/29 and would run for five years. The donation was reported on the front page of the \"New York Times\", which quoted Professor Morey's statement that the money would be used for the \"continuation of the special lectures in art, archaeology, architecture and criticism which were initiated two years ago with Mr. Kahn's help\". The report described the intended plan for \"a course of eight lectures on different subjects given each year by a distinguished authority in his own field, while special emphasis will be placed on the selection of subjects not included in the Princeton curriculum.\"\n\nAfter considering Arthur Pillans Laurie, Eug√©nie Sellers Strong and Herbert Joseph Spinden, the Department settled on the Swedish art historian Johnny Roosval, professor at Stockholm University, as the first lecturer. Roosval's lectures on Swedish art, described by Levine as \"apparently not very exciting\", were published in 1932. According to Levine, Roosval had been asked to extend his lectures to the modern architecture of Sweden, an area outside the expertise of the Swedish scholar, who was known for his studies of medieval art.\nFor the second round of lectures, Morey originally invited the Dutch architect J.J.P. Oud, \"a star in the rising pantheon of younger European architects\". Morey had been influenced in this choice by an article on Oud by Henry-Russell Hitchcock in the magazine \"The Arts\" in February 1928. Oud accepted, although he would have preferred to hold his lectures later in the spring than was possible, but ultimately he had to cancel because of illness (one of his frequent periods of depression). After once again considering H. J. Spinden, Baldwin Smith, who was acting chair of the Department during Morey's absence in Europe, invited Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright had recently published a number of pieces on architectural theory, but had little to do at the time, and the recent Wall Street Crash had made it look unlikely that he would get any new commissions for the time being. Despite this, Levine suggests that Wright's reason for accepting the offer was not primarily financial, but rather the \"prestige of the venue and the bully pulpit it would afford him\". According to the original donation by Kahn, each series was to consist of eight lectures, but Wright proposed that he would instead hold six lectures and arrange an exhibition of his own recent work \"illustrating the ideas and principles involved in the ‚Äòcourse'\". According to Levine, Wright's Kahn lectures gave him a new and important experience and even \"opened a new career path\" for the architect, who continued to lecture extensively at universities and other institutions for the next year. His exhibition toured America in 1930 and Europe for six months in 1931. Wright's lectures were originally published in 1931 in the Princeton monograph series for art and archaeology. They were reprinted in 1987, and a new edition, with an introduction by Harvard professor Neil Levine, was published in 2008. In a contemporary review of the first edition of Wright's lectures, the critic Catherine Bauer described the book as \"the very best book on modern architecture that exists\".\n\nThe next two series of lectures in the series were held in January 1931 by Herbert Joseph Spinden, the expert in pre-Columbian American archaeology who had already been considered twice before, and in the fall of 1931 by Edward Denison Ross, director of (what was still known as) the School of Oriental Studies of the University of London, who talked about Persian art. Neither of these were published. Ross's lectures were described by Baldwin Smith as \"rather flat, as the Englishman thought he could chat along pleasantly on most anything to an American audience.\" For the fifth round of lectures, the Department invited the French architectural historian Marcel Aubert, but he had to cancel after a scheduling conflict appeared with his lectures at Yale. Morey suggested to Kahn that the remaining funds be given to a student in need. Because of the financial losses Kahn had sustained during the preceding years, he could not renew his gift. Otto Kahn died two years later.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1613569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1613569", "title": "La Leche League", "text": "La Leche League\n\nLa Leche League International (LLLI) (\"La Leche\" is Spanish for \"the milk\") is a non-governmental, nonprofit organization that organizes advocacy, educational, and training related to breastfeeding. It is present in about 89 countries.\n\nThe organization was founded in 1956 (OCt 17) by Marian Tompson, Mary White, Mary Ann Cahill, Edwina Froehlich, Mary Ann Kerwin, Viola Lennon, and Betty Wagner. Later, other professionals joined and supported the group - Herbert Ratner and Gregory White. Herbert Ratner was influential in expanding the organization's philosophy beyond breastfeeding. At the time, most women bottle-fed their babies. At the time the organization was founded, only 20% of babies were breastfeeding in the United States. The first formal La Leche League meeting was held in October 1956. The seven Leaders originally held meetings in private homes; more recently, hospitals, parenting centers, and other public venues have provided meeting spaces. In 1957, Dr. Grantly Dick-Read, considered the father of the natural childbirth movement, also came to speak with them. The first La Leche League Group outside of the United States formed in 1960 in Jonquiere, Quebec, Canada. The La Leche League became La Leche League International, Inc. (LLLI) in 1964 with groups in Canada, Mexico and New Zealand. In 1964 the first international conference was held in Chicago with 425 adults and 100 babies in attendance.\n\nIn 1981 LLLI was granted consultative status with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In 1985 LLLI served on the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners, established to develop and administer a voluntary certification program for lactation consultants. The first IBLCE exam was administered in July 1985. The name \"La Leche\" comes from the Spanish word \"leche\" [pronounced leh-cheh] meaning \"milk\". It was inspired by a shrine in St. Augustine, Florida, dedicated to \"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Leche y Buen Parto\", meaning \"Our Lady of Happy Delivery and Plentiful Milk\".\n\nGroup meetings were held by a Leader, someone approved by LLLI to run the meetings and moderate the discussion that would take place. LLLI grew from a local, to a national, and then an international organization that has been helping thousands of mothers and babies all over the world for more than 60 years.\n\nThe mission of LLLI is \"to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, encouragement, information, and education, and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and mother.\"\n\nThe following are statements of LLLI's philosophy:\n\nThe primary purpose of LLLI is to encourage, inform, and support mothers primarily via meetings, telephone help, skype, Facebook, W app, helpforms and e-mail. Some Leaders also do home and/or hospital visits. LLLI leaders are accredited volunteers who have breastfed their own babies and have been specially trained to help mothers with breastfeeding. Leaders keep up-to-date through continued training and study of the most current medical research on breastfeeding.\n\nLeaders organize group meetings, where mothers are encouraged to share their own experiences with other mothers. A common theme repeated by Leaders at a LLLI meeting is \"take what you like and leave the rest,\" acknowledging that every mother-baby dyad is unique and each mother knows her own baby best. In most countries with a LLL-presence, Leaders also offer telephone help, online meetings, Facebook groups, email help and several types of personal help.\n\nIn some locales, there is a centralized phone number (for an entire country or a US state, for example) where mothers can either receive help directly or be referred to a Leader in her area. In other areas, these Leaders directly publicize their telephone numbers, and sometimes e-mail addresses, via the LLLI website, FB groups, telephone directories, and posters in parenting centres, libraries, physicians' and midwives' offices, health centres and other places where pregnant women and new parents might seek information. Mothers may also submit questions or concerns through online Help Forms available on the LLLI website.\n\nThe last LLLI International Conference took place July 2007 in Chicago, and included a seminar for health care professionals. Currently emphasis is on Area parenting and nursing conferences, held in many parts of the world every year. Some Areas offer continuing education seminars for health care professionals in addition to ongoing training for Leaders.\n\nCurrently LLLI publishes a bimonthly nursing and parenting journal, \"Breastfeeding Today\", available online and by link to members worldwide. LLLI's core publications are \"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\" (now in its 8th edition), \"Feed Yourself Feed Your Family\" and \"Sweet Sleep\".\n\nLa Leche League International is a core partner starting the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA).\n\nLa Leche League √ñsterreich was founded in 1979.\n\nLa Leche League Vlaanderen was founded in 2011.\n\nOlga Prominski founded La Leche League of Belarus in 2011 \n\nTanya Ruseva became the first La Leche League Leader in Bulgaria in 2005. This is the official birth year of La Leche League Bulgaria.\n\nLa Leche League of Bulgaria established the first website in the country dedicated solely to breastfeeding. They publish the first and only breastfeeding magazine for both parents and healthcare workers. They are the sole providers of breastfeeding webinars and organized the first international breastfeeding conference in Bulgaria.\n\nThe first LLL Group outside of USA, founded in Jonquiere, Quebec.\n\nLLL China has been active since 1995 and is currently in Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Suzhou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou with meetings offered in both English and Chinese.\n\nLiga de La Leche, Dominican Republic was born in 1990. The founding mothers of LLL in the country were Priscilla Stothers, a nurse and health educator from Florida, USA, and Yanet Olivares, who was accredited as a LLL Leader in Puerto Rico before she returned to her own country, the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe first meetings of LLL of France were held in 1973. LLL of France was officially created in 1979. The founding mother of LLL of France was Suzanne Colson. Dr. Colson, PhD, a midwife, is widely known for her research of neonatal reflexes in connection to breastfeeding.\n\nThe first meetings of La Leche League in Germany were held at American military bases in the 1970s. The first German Leaders were Edda Langmann from Fulda and Hannah Lothrop. April 30, 1977 is the official birthday of La Leche Liga Deutschland.\n\nLa Leche League came to Great Britain in the early 1970s. The first group in GB was started in Leicester in 1973 by an American Leader, Anne Harrison, who was living in Britain. Toward the end of the 1970s, it was suggested that LLLGB become an autonomous organization. It would remain affiliated to LLLI and would be identical or very similar in structure with the same commitments to the same mothering philosophy. The philosophy would remain intact, along with the structure of meetings, and Leader support.\n\nDuring 1980 discussions continued and a meeting in April decided that La Leche League could best meet the needs of mothers and babies in Britain as a fully autonomous organisation with a democratically elected Board of Directors, ideally affiliated with LLLI. There were approximately 70 Leaders at this time and this was the majority view with a minority feeling few changes were necessary.\n\nSome Leaders had gone ahead with a decision to set up a separate organisation and on July 2, 1980 the inaugural meeting was held of the Association of Nursing Mothers which then formed a break-away group.\n\nLLL GB maintains links with LLL Europe, including Future Areas in Europe, LLL International Division (ID) and the other Affiliates as well as LLL International. In the UK there are around 260 Leaders and 65 groups.\n\nLLL Greece or Syndesmos Thilasmou Ellados (Œ£œçŒΩŒ¥ŒµœÉŒºŒøœÇ ŒòŒ∑ŒªŒ±œÉŒºŒøœç ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ) was officially founded in 1979.\n\nLa Leche League Ireland was founded in Dublin in 1966 by the biologist and botanist Nora A.

She was also a voice teacher.\n\nThe future opera star's father, Karl-August Lehmann, was a singer (Heldentenor) while her mother, Maria Theresia L√∂w (1809‚Äì1885), was a soprano. Her younger sister, Marie, also went on to become an operatic soprano. Her first lessons were from her mother, who had been a prima donna under Spohr at the Cassel opera. After singing small parts on the stage, for example in Mozart's \"Magic Flute\" at Prague in 1866, and studies under Heinrich Laube in Leipzig, Lehmann made her proper debut in 1870 in Berlin as a light soprano in Meyerbeer's \"Das Feldlager in Schlesien\". She subsequently became so successful that she was appointed an Imperial Chamber Singer for life in 1876.\n\nLehmann sang in the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, singing in the first complete performances of The Ring Cycle as Woglinde and Helmwige. She performed in London in 1884, and appeared at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1885‚Äì1899. Together with her Met colleagues Fischer, Alvary, Brandt, and Seidl, she helped to popularise Wagner's music in America. By remaining in America beyond the leave granted her by the Berlin Opera, she faced a ban following her return to Germany. After the personal intervention of the Emperor, the ban was lifted.\n\nShe appeared at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1899 and sang in Paris and Vienna in 1903 and 1909 respectively. In 1905, she sang at the Salzburg Festival, later becoming the festival's artistic director. Lehmann was also renowned as a Lieder singer. She continued to give recitals until her retirement from the concert stage in the 1920s.\n\nHer mature voice, of splendid quality and large volume, gained for her the reputation of being not only one of the greatest Wagnerian singers of her day but also an ideal interpreter of Bellini's Norma and the operatic music of Mozart. She was considered unsurpassed in the roles of Br√ºnnhilde and Isolde but sang an astonishingly wide array of other parts. Indeed, across the span of her career, she performed 170 different parts in a total of 119 German, Italian and French operas. She was noted not only for her rendering of the musical score, but also as a tragic actress. She was also a noted voice teacher. Among her pupils were the famous sopranos Geraldine Farrar, Viorica Ursuleac, Edytha Fleischer, Olive Fremstad and the mezzo-sopranos Lula Mysz-Gmeiner and Marion Telva. Longtime Juilliard School professor of voice Lucia Dunham, who trained many other famous singers, was also one of her pupils.\n\nIn 1888, she married the tenor Paul Kalisch. \n\nLehmann founded the International Summer Academy at the Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1916. The academy's curriculum concentrated on voice lessons at first but it was extended later to include a wide variety of musical instruction.\n\nThe Lilli Lehmann Medal is awarded by the Mozarteum in her honour. Her voice can be heard on CD reissues of the recordings which she made prior to World War I. Although past her peak as an operatic singer when she made these records, they still impress.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1420232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1420232", "title": "M-learning", "text": "M-learning\n\nM-learning or mobile learning is defined as education or training through the use of portable wireless devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (pads), personal computers and small tablet PCs, to achieve the goal of mobility and interactivity. \n\nM-learning technologies include handheld computers, MP3 players, notebooks, mobile phones and tablets. M-learning focuses on the mobility of the learner, interacting with portable technologies. Using mobile tools for creating learning aids and materials becomes an important part of informal learning.\n\nM-learning is convenient in that it is accessible from virtually anywhere. Sharing is almost instantaneous among everyone using the same content, which leads to the reception of instant feedback and tips. This highly active process has proven to increase exam scores from the fiftieth to the seventieth percentile, and cut the dropout rate in technical fields by 22 percent. M-learning also brings strong portability by replacing books and notes with small devices, filled with tailored learning contents. M-learning has the added benefit of being cost effective, as the price of digital content on tablets is falling sharply compared to the traditional media (books, CD and DVD, etc.). One digital textbook, for instance, costs one-third to half the price of a paper textbook (AFD, 2012), with zero marginal cost. \n\nSome of the possibilities offered by this methodology, according to Fombona, Pascual-Sevillana and Gonz√°lez-Videgaray, are a greater and different access to information, along with transcendent innovations, such as the increase of informal and playful activities, iconic virtual, membership of specific groups, and networks of friendly interaction within new scales of values. \n\nMobile learning is the delivery of learning, education or learning support on mobile phones, PDAs or tablets.\n\nNew mobile technology, such as hand-held based devices, is playing a large role in redefining how people receive information. \"Numerous agencies including the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Intelligence community, and law enforcement are utilizing mobile technology for information management.\"\n\nConcepts of m-learning was given by Alan Kay in 1970's. He joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center and formed a group to develop \"Dynabook\", which is a portable and hands on personal computer. It aimed to let children have access to the digital world.This project failed eventually due to the lack of technological support at that time. Until 1994, first smart phone, IBM Simon, was created by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. It was defined as a handheld personal communicator.From then on, technological companies started to design the so-called \"smartphones\". The creation of smartphone provided the platform for mobile-learning, and current of mobile device innovation pushed mobile learning to project and research status.\n\nChronologically, m-learning research has been characterized into three phases: first phase is the focus upon devices; second is the focus on learning outside the classroom; third phase is the focus on the mobility of the learner.At its second phase, around year of 2005, tremendous amount of projects has been done, four major projects are \"The Leonardo da Vinci project From e-learning to m-learning led by Ericsson Education Dublin\", \"The Leonardo da Vinci project Mobile learning: the next generation of learning led by Ericsson Education Dublin\", \"The IST project M-Learning led by the United Kingdom government Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA)\" and \"The IST project MOBILearn led by Giunti Ricerca of Genoa, Italy\". These projects are mainly targeted on the effects of m-learning, like motivation to learn, engagement in learning activities and focus on special needs people; they set the tone for mobile learning, m-learning is prepared to transfer from project status to mainstream education and training.\n\nAnd M-learning research is globalized now: Africa , Asia, North America, Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand all have remarkable achievement on this field.\n\nApplications in classrooms and other learning spaces combine the use of handheld computers, PDAs, smartphones or handheld voting systems (such as clickers) with traditional resources .\n\nMobile devices in brick-and-mortar classrooms can be used to enhance student-centered learning, group collaboration among students through communication applications, interactive displays, and video features.\n\nIn a literature review conducted by FutureLab, researchers found that increased communication, collaboration, and understanding of concepts was a result of mobile technology applications.\n\n\nMobile devices can be used in online settings to enhance learning experiences.\n\n\nPodcasting consists of listening to audio recordings of lectures. It can be used to review live lectures and to provide opportunities for students to rehearse oral presentations.\nPodcasts may also provide supplemental information to enhance traditional lectures .\n\nPsychological research suggests that university students who download podcast lectures achieve substantially higher exam results than those who attend the lecture in person (only in cases in which students take notes) .\n\nPodcasts may be delivered using syndication, although this method of delivery is not always easily adopted .\n\nM-learning in the context of work can embrace a variety of different forms of learning. It has been defined as the \"processes of coming to know, and of being able to operate successfully in, and across, new and ever changing contexts, including learning for, at and through work, by means of mobile devices\".\n\n\nLearning for work, which could be also described as 'just-in-case' learning, involves classic and formal education activities, such as training courses, that prepare learners for future work-related tasks. A typical, corporate application is the delivery of mobile compliance training, which can be seen as a viable means to reach geographically mobile employees, such as consultants or staff in logistic and transport systems. Another application is mobile simulations that prepare learners for future situations, for example real-time SMS-based simulations for disaster response training.\n\nLearning at and through work, which could be labelled as \"just-in-time\" mobile learning, occurs in informal education settings at the workplace. Employees can use the mobile phone to solve problems via handheld devices in situ, for example by accessing informational resources (such as checklists and reference guides) prior to customer visits or mobile decision support systems. The latter are popular in clinical settings where they support highly mobile medical staff through rule-based algorithms in the decision regarding more complex patient cases. Their application was associated with learning and in particular with practice improvement of medical staff. Learning through work also occurs by interacting with distant peers via phone. \"People tagging\" is an approach whereby people assign topics they associate with co-workers. The aggregation of interests and experiences serves not only as a means to raise awareness but also to help find competent experts on demand, for example with context-sensitive expert location systems.\n\nCross-contextual learning that bridges the gap between work settings and formal education formats has perhaps the biggest potential for work-based mobile learning, especially with respect to tertiary education systems. This involves approaches in which learning in the workplace is facilitated and substantiated (for example through formative assessments, reflective questions or the documentation of personal achievements in multimedia learning diaries or portfolios) The so-created materials are later used in more formal educational formats, for example in the classroom or in the discussion with tutors. The value of these mobile phone-mediated learning practices lies in the integration and reconciliation of work-based learning and formal education experiences which otherwise tend to remain separated.\n\nMobile technologies and approaches, i.e. mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), are also used to assist in language learning. For instance handheld computers, cell phones, and podcasting have been used to help people acquire and develop language skills.\n\n\nIn Pakistan, the Rehan School was one of the first initiatives to offer remote courses that could be accessed from a basic mobile phone. The application offers short educational sequences, showing how to write common names and words and conveying mathematical and scientific concepts. Sometimes featuring television personalities, the teaching sketches are intended for viewing on small telephone screens. The films are sold for a few cents in the telecoms boutiques and can then be exchanged by Bluetooth. The Rehan School estimates that over 40,000 individuals follow its lessons, but the real number is certainly higher.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, the SMS Story project has improved teachers' classroom practices in teaching children to read by using short messages and sent by SMS.\n\nSince the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in Sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness. In Sub-Saharan Africa, teachers and students are faced with an extreme shortage of teaching materials. The number of textbooks available are limited, so few students have individual access to textbooks in class or at home. Given the shortage of textbooks in many African schools, tablets and mobile phones are being viewed by governments and international organizations as a solution to provide access to learning materials. In one example, the Tangerine mobile assessment and coaching system, deployed in Kenya, aims to help teachers in their assessment activities. With Tangerine, a student's reading level can be evaluated by recording the student's answers on a mobile phone or a tablet. The data gathered by the application also allows comparisons of the learning levels of students according to their age, geographical area and gender.\n\nTutors who have used m-learning programs and techniques have made the following value statements in favor of m-learning.\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of M-learning\n\n\nAspects of M-learning\n\nAlong with the development of m-learning, many theories about mobile educations are raised by researchers, major aspects are listed.\n\n\n\n\nMobile learning is widely used in schools, workplaces, museums, cities and rural areas around the world. In comparison to traditional classroom pedagogical approaches, mobile learning allows widened opportunies for timing, location, accessibility and context of learning.\n\nCurrent areas of growth include:\n\n\n"}

Pesce ( ; born 1962) is an American-Australian author, researcher, engineer, futurist and teacher.\n\nPesce was born in Everett, Massachusetts in 1962. In September 1980, Pesce attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a Bachelor of Science degree, but left in June 1982 to pursue opportunities in the newly emerging high-tech industry. He worked as an engineer for the next few years, developing prototype firmware and software for SecurID cards.\n\nIn 1988, Pesce joined Shiva Corporation, which pioneered and popularized dial-up networking. Pesce's role in the company was to develop user interfaces, and his research extended into virtual reality.\n\nIn 1991, Pesce founded the Ono-Sendai Corporation, named after a fictitious company in the William Gibson novel \"Neuromancer\". Ono-Sendai was a first-generation virtual reality startup, chartered to create inexpensive, home-based networked VR systems. The company developed a key technology, which earned Pesce his first patent for a \"Sourceless Orientation Sensor\" that tracks the motion of persons in virtual environments. Sega Corporation of America would use the technology on the design of the Sega VR, a consumer head-mounted display (HMD).\n\nIn 1993, Apple hired Pesce as a consulting engineer to develop interfaces between Apple and IBM networking products. In early 1994, while in San Francisco, Pesce, with software engineers Tony Parisi and Gavin Bell, spearheaded an effort to standardize 3D on the Web, and formed VRML Architecture Group (VAG), under the leadership of Pesce. The purpose of VRML was to allow for the creation of 3D environments within the World Wide Web, accessible through a web browser. Working in conjunction with such corporations as Microsoft, Netscape, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Sony, Pesce convinced the industry to accept the new protocol as a standard for desktop virtual reality. This development spring-boarded Pesce into a career which has included extensive writings for both the popular and scientific press, teaching and lecturing at universities, conferences, performances, presentations, and films appearances.\n\nIn 2003, Pesce relocated to Australia, where he continues to live, and became an Australian citizen on 4 February 2011. He is an Honorary Lecturer at the University of Sydney and is a judge on \"The New Inventors\", a nationally televised program in Australia.\n\nIn 2006, Pesce founded FutureSt, a Sydney consultancy, serving as an advisory to analytic's firm PeopleBrowsr, and The Serval Project.\n\nIn 2008, Pesce began writing an online column for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's \"The Drum Opinion\".\n\nMore recently Pesce has been designing and coding Plexus, a Web 2.0 address book and social networking tool, and is writing his next book, \"The Next Billion Seconds\". His current major project, however, is Light \"MooresCloud\", an ambient device of 52-LEDs which is a lamp with a LAMP-stack; the trademark pays homage to the inexpensive ubiquitous computing engendered by Moore's Law. Inspired by the GPIO of a borrowed Raspberry Pi, which he realized allowed web users anywhere on the planet to turn an LED on or off on his machine from their browsers, \"MooresCloud\" was brought from concept to prototype by a team in eight weeks. Highly configurable, the device has been touted as \"illumination as a service\".\n\nFrom January 2004 through January 2006, Pesce was the senior lecturer in Emerging Media and Interactive Design at the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS) in Sydney, Australia. He now holds an Honorary Appointment at the University of Sydney and has shared some of his lectures online.\n\nPesce began his teaching career in 1996 as a VRML instructor at both the University of California at Santa Cruz and San Francisco State University, where he would later create the school's certificate program in the 3-D Arts. In 1998, Pesce was asked to join the faculty of the University of Southern California, as the founding chair of the Graduate Program in Interactive Media at the USC School of Cinema-Television. \n\n\n\n"}

Students from the University of Helsinki were also invited, but were unable to attend, as the Emperor of Russia had imposed travel bans upon the Helsinki students.\n\nThe meetings were a part of the scandinavistic movement which sought to unify the Scandinavian countries politically and culturally.

The Nordic student cap was designed for this occasion, and was adopted as common headgear by all Scandinavian students at the subsequent meeting in Lund and Copenhagen year 1845. In 1851 the students at the university of Oslo invited to a third student meeting. However, the Uppsala students were unable to attend since the semester hadn't stopped.

It is widely considered to be the most prestigious public interest scholarship for law students in the country.\n\nThe Root-Tilden-Kern Program looks for students with a demonstrated commitment to the public interest, exceptional leadership ability, and a history of academic achievement. In assessing these criteria, the program looks at the whole person and considers previous life experience and professional work. The program values diversity and strives to select a class that is diverse in terms of race, sex, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, geographic origins, and ideology. Interested candidates should submit an application with their application to New York University School of Law. The application is reviewed by a student and faculty committee before recommendation for an interview. Each year, approximately 50 applicants are invited to interview with a panel composed of a faculty member, a judge, a practitioner and third-year scholars. Twenty scholars are selected for each incoming class. \n\nIn the 1950s, Dean Emeritus Arthur Vanderbilt conceived of the Root-Tilden Scholarship to transform NYU from a local law school to a nationally and internationally esteemed institution. Founded in 1951, the purpose of the program was to ‚Äútrain promising young men so as to help attain again for the American bar the high position which it once held as the reservoir of altruistic and competent public leadership.‚Äù \n\nThe program was named for two alumni, Elihu Root and Samuel Tilden, who exemplified Vanderbilt's ideal ‚Äì lawyers dedicated to public leadership. Twenty scholars were selected for the first class from each of the country's then ten judicial circuits. Scholars were at first required to take special courses in the humanities, social sciences, history and natural sciences and required to live together and share mealtimes five days a week. Scholars met with leaders in government, industry and finance. In 1969, after a campaign by student groups, the first women were admitted to the Root Program. To date, more than 800 Root-Tilden Scholars have graduated from NYU School of Law.\n\nIn 1998, then Dean John Sexton announced a precedent-setting gift of $5 million from an alumnus of the Root-Tilden Scholarship, Jerome H. Kern 1960, that began a major capital campaign to raise $30 million for the program. To honor Kern's generous contribution, the Law School renamed the program as the Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship Program. Kern is the chairman of Symphony Media Systems, LLC, and was formerly a senior partner of the law firm Baker & Botts. In 2004, under the leadership of Dean Richard Revesz, the Law School successfully completed its campaign goal of $30 million and now offers full-tuition scholarships to 20 students each year.\n\n"}

Barkley (born 27 December 1949) is a clinical psychologist who is a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and an author of books on ADHD. Involved in research since 1973 and a licensed psychologist since 1977, he is an expert on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has devoted much of his scientific career to studying ADHD and related problems like childhood defiance. He proposed to change the name of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) to concentration deficit disorder (CDD).\n\nAuthor of 15 books and more than 180 scientific papers, Barkley edits \"The ADHD Report\", a newsletter for clinicians and parents. Besides his clinical work, he is also an expert in the neuropsychology of executive function and self-regulation.\n\nBarkley was born in Orange County, Newburgh, New York. He was one of five children, born to Donald Stuart Barkley (27 February 1916 - 15 June 1999) and Mildred Minerva (10 September 1914 - 25 April 2008). Barkley had a twin brother, Ronald Foster Barkley, who was killed in a car crash on 24 July 2006. Barkley attributes his brother's history of dangerous and reckless behavior, including not wearing a seat belt and speeding at the time of his crash, to untreated ADHD. Ronald was several times over the drink drive limit, speeding and not wearing a speed belt at the time of his fatal crash.\n\nBarkley married his wife Patricia on 15 March 1969.\n\nBarkley earned an Associate of Arts from Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina in June 1972, and a BA in psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He earned an MA and Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. From July 1976 to 1977, Barkley was an intern at the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn 1978, Barkley founded the Neuropsychology Service at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Milwaukee Children's Hospital, and served as its chief until 1985. He then moved to the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where he served as Director of Psychology from 1985 to 2000. Barkley was professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. In 2005, he joined the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, where he was a research professor of psychiatry. He has been at the Medical University of South Carolina since 2003.\n\nOne of Barkley's rating scales for adult ADHD evaluates sluggish cognitive tempo.\n\nOn 16 November 1998 Barkley asserted that \"Ritalin will be classed as one of the leading developments for helping individuals\".\n\nHe has been a paid speaker and consultant for Eli Lilly, McNeil, Janssen-Orth, Janssen-Cilag, Novartis, Shire, and Theravance. These financial ties have led to public criticism for a perceived conflict of interest.\n\nBarkley, a leader in the burgeoning sluggish cognitive tempo research field has direct financial ties to Eli Lilly, a promoter of the condition (Barkley received $118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements from Eli Lilly). When referring to the \"increasing clinical referrals occurring now and more rapidly in the near future driven by increased awareness of the general public in SCT\", Barkley writes \"The fact that SCT is not recognized as yet in any official taxonomy of psychiatric disorders will not alter this circumstance given the growing presence of information on SCT at various widely visited internet sites such as YouTube and Wikipedia, among others.\" \n\nPeter Breggin and Fred Baughman are very critical of Barkley's work on ADHD, claiming that he exaggerates the benefits of stimulants and minimizes their hazards.\n\nBarkley himself edits the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Wikipedia page.\n\nGretchen LeFever Watson, a practising psychologist in south east Virginia began a program of ADHD research that included epidemiologic surveys. This research documented 15% rates of ADHD diagnosis and drug treatment in her community. Diagnosis rates also slammed and attacked by Keith Conners and Allen Frances. Upon hearing of this, Barkley intervened and struck back, asserting that too few people were being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. In 2004 Barkley claimed that LeFever‚Äôs findings from multiple peer-reviewed and published studies were so questionable that they ‚Äúdeserve investigation\".\n\nWithin weeks of Barkley‚Äôs call for an investigation of LeFever‚Äôs findings, someone submitted an anonymous complaint about LeFever‚Äôs work to EVMS (i.e., the complaint described above). In response, EVMS conducted an internal investigation of LeFever‚Äôs past and current research. Against EVMS policy and common protocol for investigation of allegations of scientific misconduct, the medical school confirmed to the media that LeFever was under investigation.\n\nBarkley's visit and actions resulted in Watson being dismissed from her position. Watson's community intervention programme, which was non-pharma based and had been effective, was dismantled.\n\nBarkley is a right-wing libertarian. He deeply believes in \"Limited government, individual rights, freedom of speech and association, and the nonaggression principle (no one, including the government, has a right to initiate force or fraud against another), and private property rights\". He has attacked \"the leftist, social democratic or socialist leanings of Facebook's founder and most mainstream media outlets\".\n\n\n\n"}

The latter went on to initiate a closely linked project, Liverpool Community Transport.\n\nAccording to the school's prospectus, Ord and Murphy wanted to establish \"a school run by children, parents and teachers together, without a headmaster, centralised authority or the usual hierarchies. It would be open when it was needed and lessons would be optional\". The prospectus added: \"The school will be a community school...totally involved with its environment...the vanguard of social change\". It was based in a former school building in Major Street, close to the Boundary Street/Scotland Road junction . The pupils were granted considerable freedom and responsibility, and they benefitted from frequent trips to outside venues. Summer camps were organised at Carrog and Coniston. Teachers and helpers were all unpaid volunteers, many \"on the dole\".\n\nThe \"Scottie Road\" Free School experiment took place while the world-wide \"free-schooling/de-schooling\" ideology was at its height. The School attained a certain notoriety, receiving visits from educationalists, researchers and social workers. Partly to raise funds and partly to spread \"the message\", teachers at the school would travel to give lectures at meetings and at colleges (including Leeds University and Bretton Hall College). The School became a forum that linked with other radical movements, such as a women's refuge in Seel Street, and (later) some housing association developments.\n\nBill Murphy moved on to concentrate on Liverpool Community Transport, which he established in nearby Leeds Street; but John Ord stayed with the school throughout. The Local Authority found the school's lack of formal curriculum unsatisfactory and were antipathetic to its existence; and the school closed after only a few years. After the closure, Ord later went on to become a \"Hattonista\" on the local Council; while Murphy emigrated to New Zealand to further his interest in alternative technology.\n\nIn 1971, John Walmsley, a photographer who specialises in education photos, captured a series of images which record the early days of the Free School. (Walmsley also wrote a \"pictorial study\" of Summerhill which Penguin published as an Education Special).\n\nIn July 2017 Liverpool's Bluecoat Gallery began staging a 10-week exhibition called \"Abacus\". It purpose was to be \"for and about children\", and one part of the exhibition featured John Walmsley's photographs of the school. John Ord was present and he announced that in 2020 a 50-year retrospective event of the Free School is proposed.\n\nHaving set up the Free School with John Ord, Bill Murphy went on to establish and concentrate on a new venture, Liverpool Community Transport. This began in ramshackle premises, but soon moved to a large disused transport depot in Leeds Street. A number of vehicles were acquired, including two Leyland PD2 double-decker buses, a coach, and a Luton van. The buses were used to take Free School children on school visits and camping trips to Carrog in Wales, and to Coniston in the Lake District, as well as giving local families and pensioners outings such as visits to the Blackpool Illuminations. Most notably, a double-decker took a busload of activists across the Snake Pass in the Pennines to support the Clay Cross councillors who were refusing to implement the rate-capping provisions of the Conservative government's Housing Finance Act.\n"}

They commissioned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to guide the layout of of farm, field and forest, and New York architect Robert Henderson Robertson, to design the buildings. The estate was created by purchasing a large number of mostly agricultural properties, and then adapting the existing roads and lanes (some of which were public ways the Webbs petitioned to have closed) to fulfill the Webbs' vision for the estate.

The agency can be included in the academic curriculum, allowing students to work in the agency for academic credit. Or, the agency can simply be housed within the academic unit, allowing students to work in the agency for volunteer experience. In other cases, the agency can operate as a student club within the broader organizational structure of the university. The student-run agency provides advertising and similar communications services to various organizations such as college departments, small businesses, and community-based non-profit organizations. Some agencies compete with professionals and charge for services. Other agencies do all their work without charge. Other agencies have a philanthropic focus whereby communications work is conducted for free for nonprofits, while for-profit entities are asked to make a charitable donation to the agency to support its learner-centered focus.\n\nAs is the case with communications agencies in the real world, student-run agencies typically offer a variety of support to clients, including public relations, marketing, promotions, and social media support. The main appeal of a student-run advertising agency for clients is that the agency can provide professional-quality work at no cost or very small cost. The primary appeal for students is that they gain real-world experience unlike anything that can result from a traditional classroom experience. Students working in this environment have to mentor each other. Students learn to engage in \"reverse mentoring\" whereby they typically have more experience and knowledge of communication than their clients - so they must educate the clients. In all agency environments, development of time management and teamwork skills is essential. Students must collaborate to produce work that satisfies the client and the agency supervisor (typically a faculty member). The work must be academically appropriate and professionally relevant. This balance of responsibilities and oversight makes the student-run agency an ideal learning experience and preparation for the professional workplace.\n\nSwanson, D. J. (2014, October 11).

{"id": "53874903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53874903", "title": "The Holocaust in textbooks", "text": "The Holocaust in textbooks\n\nThe Holocaust is conceptualized and narrated in textbooks worldwide in a variety of approaches to treating temporal and spatial scales, protagonists, interpretative paradigms, narrative techniques, didactic methods and national idiosyncrasies with and within which the Holocaust. There exist convergent trends or internationally shared narrative templates, and divergent trends or narrative idiosyncrasies, which generally establish links between the Holocaust and local events. Textbooks in most countries focus most closely, via photographs and legal documentation, on the perpetrators‚Äô point of view. This is a key component of education about the Holocaust.\n\nMany textbooks ascribe multiple spaces (ranging from local, national to European and worldwide) to the Holocaust via authorial texts and especially in maps which show either the sites of concentration and extermination camps or, less commonly, military man≈ìuvres during the Second World War. Transnational spaces are evoked in relation to the topics of collaboration (in France and Republic of Moldova, for example), emigration (in China, Argentina and the USA, for example) and in relation to mass atrocities or genocide in China and Rwanda, while textbooks from other countries, such as Brazil or El Salvador, do not allude to the significance of the Holocaust in their own countries. The event is generally named as one which occurred in Europe and Germany, while some textbooks domesticate the event, as in Belarus, Germany and Republic of Moldova, by providing details about the local repercussions of the Holocaust. Details of the occupying regime and administration of the General Government and of the role of satellite states are rare. Transcontinental connections are sometimes established which pit Europe against Asia where, for example, Indian authors refer to the threat of the ‚ÄòEuropeanization‚Äô of Asia, where authors of a Russian textbook qualify National Socialism as a ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô phenomenon, or where another textbook from the Russian Federation refers to a ‚Äòbattle of European culture against Russian and bolshevist barbarity‚Äô.\n\nThe temporal or historical context ascribed to the Holocaust is generally that of the Second World War; time spans given range from 1933 to 1945, with some mentions of key changes in 1938 or 1942 or the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943. References to deeper historical currents such as racial theories from the nineteenth century are mentioned in textbooks in Brazil, India, Germany and Namibia; Jewish history, emigration, or pre-twentieth century antisemitism are addressed in Argentinian, German, Japanese and American textbooks. Likewise, several textbook authors in Argentina, France, Germany, Namibia and the Russian Federation write about the aftereffects or memory of the Holocaust after 1945. Although human rights are frequently mentioned in connection with the Holocaust, textbook authors rarely explain or express in detail the universal legal or moral significance of the Holocaust. Some authors, of English textbooks for example, emphasize wider issues regarding how ‚Äòordinary people‚Äô became ‚Äòkillers‚Äô, and while authors in Singapore focus on the universal history of racism, no textbooks in any countries can be said to present an ahistorical or universal narrative of the Holocaust.\n\nPerpetrators are most frequently referred to as ‚ÄòNazis‚Äô, ‚ÄòGermans‚Äô and ‚Äòfascists‚Äô. Individuals commonly named include Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich, H√∂ss and Eichmann. Most striking is the extent to which Hitlercentrism pervades textbook narratives of the Holocaust, with Hitler functioning as a moral repository for the event, as embodied in portraits of Hitler, excerpts from Mein Kampf and the attribution of sole responsibility to Hitler in such phrases, found in Russian textbooks, as ‚ÄòHitlerian aggression‚Äô or the ‚Äòpolicy of Hitler-Germany‚Äô. By contrast, textbooks in France and Germany generally marginalize the role of Hitler in favour of an explanation of the event as a result of plural causes.\n\nVictims are most frequently named as Jews and ‚ÄòGypsies‚Äô in textbooks from almost all countries, while other groups of victims, such as Slavs, people with disabilities, political opponents and homosexuals, are named less frequently. Other categories of victims are named, for example, as ‚Äòblack victims‚Äô or ‚Äòblack people‚Äô in South African, Rwandan and Indian textbooks. Generic references to an ‚Äòinner enemy‚Äô (in one Russian textbook) or to so-called ‚Äòinferior‚Äô or ‚Äòundesirable‚Äô ‚Äòpeople‚Äô (in Chinese, Russian and Uruguyan textbooks) detract from the specificity of Nazi ideology, while some references to Jewish victims as ‚Äòopponents‚Äô (in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, for example) may mislead readers into believing that all Jews resisted or posed a threat to the National Socialist regime and that they were therefore a legitimate target of repression. Few textbooks depict Jewish life before 1933 or after 1945 (Germany is one example of a country whose textbooks do); most textbooks therefore largely present Jews as voiceless victims and as objects of perpetrators‚Äô volition. Textbook authors in some countries regularly define victims in terms of national groups (as Poles, Ukrainians and Russians in Russian textbooks, for example) or nationalize Jewish identity in terms of ‚ÄòPolish‚Äôand ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô (in Chinese textbooks), or ‚ÄòUkrainian‚Äô and ‚ÄòHungarian‚Äô Jews (in French textbooks). Numbers of victims are named in textbooks from approximately half the countries surveyed; most of these figures are accurate, although several textbooks draw attention not to the overall numbers of Jewish victims, but to the numbers of war victims generally (as in Russian textbooks), and to numbers of victims of specific nations or of specific camps. Images of the destroyed cities of Hiroshima and Dresden in French textbooks or of victims of apartheid in South Africa or of Chinese people during the Japanese invasion of 1937 extend the scope of victims to those of other atrocities.\n\nOther protagonists include members of the resistance, rescuers of the persecuted, the Allies, and local individuals who are named by their proper names, such as Janusz Korczak in Polish textbooks. Few bystanders or collaborators feature in the textbooks.\n\nThe general distinction between active and passive protagonists, which is underscored by the use of the passive mode in several textbooks, highlights a dichotomy which fails to acknowledge the day-to-day responsibilities and decisions with which protagonists such as Kurt Gerstein or members of the Sonderkommando (presented in Polish and German textbooks respectively) were faced. Moreover, the focus on concentration and extermination camps as places of systematic persecution and murder detracts from details of lives of individuals at all stages of the Holocaust and from complex relationships between individuals, between individuals and groups, and between one group and another. Gender roles and relations during the Holocaust, as embodied in the different treatment of male and female prisoners or in the behaviour of female camp guards, are addressed in none of the textbooks in this sample; Anne Frank and/or homosexual victims are mentioned in the textbooks, albeit without reference to gender roles and relations.\n\nTextbook authors generally present the Holocaust in the context of a political history of the Second World War (of the rise of the National Socialist Party, of Hitler, of nationalism, expansionism and appeasement), but also emphasize state racial policy, Hitler‚Äôs personal beliefs, totalitarianism, and concentration and extermination camps, while in some cases drawing on historiographical models such as a ‚Äòbreach in civilization‚Äô (in Chinese and Indian textbooks) and stages of ‚Äòdeportation‚Äô, ‚Äòconcentration‚Äô and ‚Äòextermination‚Äô (in the Ivorian textbook) which correspond to the concepts found in Dan Diner‚Äôs and Raul Hilberg‚Äôs work on the Holocaust.\n\nThe majority of textbooks in all countries name the event as the ‚ÄòHolocaust‚Äô, to which are added, in the course of the presentations, paraphrases of the event in terms of, for example, ‚Äòdiscrimination against Jewish people, sent to concentration camps‚Äô (in a Japanese textbook) or, characteristically, as ‚Äòsystematic killings‚Äô, ‚Äòextermination‚Äô, ‚Äòsystematic genocide‚Äô, the ‚ÄòFinal Solution‚Äô and ‚Äòmassacres‚Äô (in South African textbooks). The largely descriptive nature of history textbooks means that they generally adopt inclusive definitions of the event, that is, definitions which derive from the details of the event rather than from an exclusive a priori definition. Exceptions to this general rule are cases in which the Holocaust is not named or alluded to euphemistically, as in one Indian textbook, or in which it is paraphrased in partial terms, as in Egyptian and Syrian textbooks.\n\nMost commonly, in almost all countries, the personalization of the event (its explanation as stemming from the personal convictions of one person) in relation to Hitler is a central interpretative paradigm. The textbook currently used in Namibian schools is characteristic of this technique. In this book, the Holocaust is dealt with in a section entitled ‚Äòantisemitism‚Äô, on the first page of which the word ‚ÄòHitler‚Äô appears in a box in the middle of the page from which arrows point towards party organizations; the authors describe Hitler‚Äôs personal ‚Äòdetermination to remove Jews from Germany‚Äô. English textbooks also refer to Hitler‚Äôs irrational hatred of the Jews and to his personal desire for revenge against Jews.\n\nThe most frequently named cause of the Holocaust is ideology (racism, antisemitism, totalitarianism, authoritarianism, militarism, capitalism, fascism). Textbooks in Brazil, Germany, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Japan, Republic of Moldova and Rwanda also qualify the expansionist policy of Nazi Germany as a form of colonialism.\n\nMost textbook authors make use of one or more historiographical paradigms in order to explain the Holocaust. The two most common, and largely shared, paradigms are the identification of categories of protagonists in terms of perpetrators, victims and bystanders, and the attribution of moral responsibility to one or more individuals in what has become known as ‚Äòintentionalism‚Äô. Most textbooks in this survey conceive of protagonists as either perpetrators or victims, in addition to those who resisted the regime and, occasionally, bystanders and/or rescuers. No textbooks explore ambivalent roles beyond these categories. In some cases, as in French and Ivorian textbooks, Hilberg‚Äôs stages of the Holocaust, defined as identification, concentration and deportation, are reflected in textbook representations. Other paradigms include: the ‚Äòbreach of civilization‚Äô ascribed to Dan Diner, which is echoed in textbooks in China and India; the behaviour of ‚Äòordinary Germans‚Äô ascribed to Daniel Goldhagen in English textbooks; the effects of bureaucratization ascribed to Zygmunt Bauman, featured in textbooks in Argentina; the effects of peer pressure ascribed to Christopher Browning, discussed in textbooks in the USA; cumulative radicalization or functionalism ascribed to Hans Mommsen, raised in textbooks in England; and references to colonial aspects underpinning the Holocaust, made in textbooks from Brazil, Germany, Japan and Republic of Moldova. The large variety of historiographical authorities and works referred to in order to explain the event show that there is little consensus between textbook authors over explanatory models.\n\nA small number of textbooks, in Argentina, Poland, Spain and the USA, for example, complement their presentations of the history of the Holocaust with meta-historical commentaries in the form of glossaries of historic terms. Meta-narrative approaches are pedagogically effective when explaining the political expediency of commemorations of the Holocaust via monuments or in international relations, as in textbooks from Argentina, Germany, India and the Russian Federation. They also encourage a critical approach to such phenomena as the personality cult surrounding Hitler, as outlined in the Salvadorian textbook in our sample. In exceptional cases, authors not only apply historiographical paradigms, but also discuss their merits, as in the sketches of Hannah Arendt‚Äôs, Zygmunt Bauman‚Äôs and Daniel Goldhagen‚Äôs explanations of the Holocaust in Argentinian textbooks.\n\nComparisons between the Holocaust and other mass atrocities or genocides are often alluded to but not explained. Usage of the terms ‚Äòterror‚Äô and ‚Äòcleansing‚Äô in some Polish textbooks to describe historically different events detracts from their historical specificities. Similarly, the use of the term ‚Äòterrorist‚Äô to describe Hitler in one Brazilian textbook, ‚Äòterror‚Äô to describe the Holocaust in one German textbook, or even the definition of Zionist forces in Palestine as Jewish ‚Äòterror groups‚Äô in one Iraqi textbook lend themselves to semantic confusion if not anachronism. Similar semantic confusion arises when the term ‚Äòextermination‚Äô is used to describe the function of the Gulag in one Brazilian textbook or when a Belarussian textbook inaccurately claims that the National Socialist regime planned the ‚Äòextermination of the Soviet people‚Äô, or when different regimes are described collectively as ‚Äòtotalitarian‚Äô in Argentinian, Brazilian, French, Moldovan, Polish, Spanish, and briefly in English and Rwandan textbooks. The use of the term ‚Äòfascism‚Äô to describe the German and Japanese authorities during the Second World War and the use of the term ‚Äògenocide‚Äô (datusha) in Chinese textbooks to refer to crimes committed by both the Japanese forces in Nanjing and the National Socialists in the Holocaust detract from historical distinctions. Comparisons are also evoked by the use of images. The juxtaposition of images of different events, such as the images of Auschwitz and the Nanjing massacre in one French textbook, or of Dresden and Hiroshima in another French textbook, the association of suffering during the Holocaust with suffering caused by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in one Ivorian textbook, or the association of Auschwitz and life under apartheid in one South African textbook, similarly obscure historical differences rather than explaining them comparatively. While such indiscriminate use of terms and imagery to describe different historical events is commonplace, and while textbooks in some countries allude to similarities by juxtaposing images or textual association, some textbooks in Poland and Argentina, for example, avoid relativizing the Holocaust by providing clear explanations of the comparable motives, methods and aims of the perpetrators of different mass crimes.\n\nNarrative techniques found in a small number of the textbooks are ‚Äòclosed‚Äô, which means that the authorial perspective involves a single narrative voice without quotations or complementary documents (as in Albanian textbooks). At the other extreme, some authors apply, at least in part, an open technique by juxtaposing images of different historical events (of a man holding his passport during apartheid beside an image of prisoners arriving in Auschwitz in one South African textbook, for example) in order to allude to meanings without explaining them. The majority of textbooks apply a technique midway between these extremes, juxtaposing authorial texts with additional perspectives reflected in quotations and textual and visual documentation.\n\nThe predominance of textual and visual documentation produced by perpetrators, which generally assures considerable understanding of perpetrators‚Äô lives and motives, is frequently found in combination with emotive language expressing condemnation of their acts, often in pathological terms, such as the descriptions of them as ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô and ‚Äòunbelievable‚Äô in Chinese textbooks. In some cases authors inadvertently perpetuate the perpetrators‚Äô viewpoint. One Ivorian textbook, for example, presents victims primarily as ‚Äòopponents, especially the Jews and the Gypsies‚Äô, then as ‚Äòmillions of men, women and children‚Äô, then as ‚ÄòJews‚Äô, and thereby reinforces the idea that ‚Äòthe‚Äô Jews and ‚Äòthe‚Äô Gypsies (that is, all of them) were killed as a result of their role as ‚Äòopponents‚Äô, as if the killers, at least according to their own reasoning, therefore had a just reason to kill them. This conflation of members of the resistance, Jews and Gypsies effectively reproduces the perpetrators‚Äô view that the Third Reich needed to defend itself against an alleged threat.\n\nMost striking are the different ways in which authors lend moral value to the Holocaust. Most authors couch the history of the Holocaust in terms of decline followed by progress. However, the object of this progression varies from one country to another. Polish textbooks notably combine stories of national resistance to the German occupation of Poland with references to the Polish underground government, Polish helpers and Jewish resistance as exemplified by the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Russian textbooks, by contrast, as do those from the USA, focus on progression towards military victory in the Second World War and thus present allied military victory in the place of victory over the Holocaust, in particular over the camp system. The French textbook designed for the final year of secondary schooling even presents the history of commemoration of the Holocaust in progressive terms as one which shifted from national homage to national moral integrity via the acknowledgement of crimes. The most commonly found narrative of progression is one which ends with an allusion to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted by the United Nations in 1948.\n\nThe complexity of the presentation of, the values named in relation to, and the type of (local, national or international) framework in which authors place the Holocaust, reflects the prior knowledge of the textbooks‚Äô expected readers. North American textbooks, for example, emphasize liberal values and tolerance of difference; Chinese and Albanian textbooks praise local people who helped Jewish refugees; German textbooks extol democracy and the rule of law as opposed to dictatorship, and also assume that the Holocaust is a German event, the product of National Socialism in the absence of non-German collaborators.\n\nThese vary widely from, at one extreme, the lack of any exercises urging pupils to question and explore materials presented in the textbooks, to a wide variety of exercises including storytelling, document interpretation, role play, textual or pictorial analysis, and exercises requiring pupils to either find rational explanations of the events or else to empathize with protagonists via letter writing, biographical writing and analysis of protagonists‚Äô decisions. In some cases, exercises simply involve collating information provided in the textbooks (Rwanda) or comparing statistics (Republic of Moldova).\n\nThe textbooks testify to a trend towards stating and affirming values such as human rights (in India, Iraq, Namibia, Republic of Moldova and Rwanda, for example) or affirming the role of the United Nations in securing human rights after 1945 (in Brazil, El Salvador, Spain or Uruguay, for example), albeit without explaining the origins, meaning, history, implementation and effectiveness of the principles of human rights. Textbook authors adopt similar approaches by affirming democratic values (as in France, Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Uruguay) as a radical alternative to values associated with dictatorship or autocracy (El Salvador), while references to citizenship, moral norms, or genocide prevention are rare. No textbooks in our sample address human rights historically.\n\nMany textbooks link the Holocaust to local horizons by appealing to pupils to, for example, conduct interviews with Jewish survivors in Shanghai (in a Chinese textbook), explore the rescuing of persecuted people in Albania and compare the motivations of perpetrators in Romania and Germany (Republic of Moldova), or explore local historical and commemorative sites (Germany).\n\nAll of the textbooks, to varying extents, decontextualize and recontextualize the Holocaust in terms which are alien to the event itself or partial, in a process of (national) appropriation and ‚Äòdomestication‚Äô. Authors appeal to local readerships, in particular in countries whose populations have no direct experience or inherited memory of the event. These expedient idiosyncrasies are linked largely to the interests of authors writing in the present day within curricular guidelines for identifiable readerships, meaning that textbook representations of the Holocaust may subsume historical information to values or legal and political interests which are largely the product of the situation within and out of which the textbooks are written.\n\nSome Chinese, Rwandan and South African textbooks radically deviate from western historical perspectives by evoking the Holocaust in sections of textbooks devoted to other examples of persecution or genocide. Chinese textbooks, for example, treat the Holocaust briefly as an example by which to illustrate and measure the extent of the local massacre of 1937 in Nanjing. Experts agree that discussion of the Holocaust among peoples whose countries have only recently experienced mass atrocities, or in which little discussion of the event has hitherto taken place, is an effective way of broaching local persecution indirectly while avoiding the conflict which a direct discussion of the issues might provoke.\n\nBelarussian and Russian textbooks generally adhere to the notion that the Second World War involved a violation of national territories. The authors of Belarussian textbooks, for example, refer to ‚Äòthe occupied territory‚Äô and to that fact that ‚ÄòThe territory of Belarus was covered with a network of concentration camps‚Äô. Russian textbooks likewise largely displace the Holocaust behind a history of the suppression of Slavs and of Soviet heroism. Textbooks in Albania also appear to uphold the Holocaust as a measure of local heroism by defining the Holocaust as the ‚Äòage of upheaval 1914-1945‚Äô while drawing attention to heroic acts of Albanian citizens who rescued Jews, and to the humanitarian values of hospitality, religious tolerance, humanism and antifascism. Although Polish textbooks firmly focus on the Polish dimension of the Holocaust by presenting it as an event in Polish history with Polish figureheads and as a consequence of the occupation of Poland, the books in this sample no longer nationalize victimhood, but render multiple perspectives with meta-historical critiques. However, representations from countries of the former Soviet Union and former members of the Warsaw Pact do not conform to a uniform pattern. Research has shown that Baltic States traditionally depict a ‚Äòsymmetry between Nazi and communist crimes‚Äô. And in Ukraine, the famine known as the Holodomor continues to compete with and even displace representations of the Holocaust, which harbours more ambiguous recollections of both persecution and collaboration among Ukrainian citizens.\n\nBy defining crimes committed during the Holocaust as ‚Äògenocide‚Äô while defining local crimes euphemistically (as ‚Äòcruel acts‚Äô, for example), some Japanese textbooks play down the moral and legal repercussions of crimes committed locally. Thus ‚Äòexculpatory interpretations‚Äô of the Holocaust may be used as a ‚Äòmeasure‚Äô or ‚Äòbenchmark‚Äô of the putatively relatively minor significance of local persecution, by which attention is detracted from those responsible for comparable crimes.\n\nBy focusing on French collaboration and resistance rather than deportation, the authors of Ivorian textbooks adopt the viewpoint of, and thereby affirm a degree of loyalty to, the former colonial power. The Ivorian textbook, for example, adopts a ‚ÄòFrench‚Äô reading of the Second World War by emphasizing collaboration and resistance, and by subsuming Jewish victims to the legend of a nation united in resistance which pervaded public perceptions of the role of France during the Second World War until the 1980s.\n\nIn extreme cases, textbooks evoke the Holocaust marginally in a history which focuses entirely on the Second World War. One Indian textbook produced during the mandate of the government coalition led by the Left Front, for example, marginalizes the Holocaust in favour of the history of resistance to the Nazi war effort as an analogy to the struggle for Indian independence. Likewise, the total disregard for the Holocaust in another textbook may be ascribed to the fact that its authors appear to sympathize with the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and with its radical nationalism and the goal of territorial unity akin to that of the National Socialists. By contrast, liberal authors present Gandhi‚Äôs attempts to negotiate with Hitler in the hope that the regime may abstain from its racial policy.\n\nWhile no textbooks in the sample overtly question the history of the Holocaust, some present it in partial or abstract terms, such that the reader learns little about the event. A Syrian textbook, for example, refers to the event as ‚Äòconditions of oppression by the Nazis in Europe‚Äô; an Iraqi textbook similarly describes the violation of human rights and crimes against humanity committed under the National Socialist regime, but conceptualizes the event in purely legal terms as one which ended once perpetrators had been tried, punished or exculpated by the Nuremberg Tribunal. Jewish victims of Nazi oppression are named in these textbooks in association with the alleged lack of resolve of the British Mandate to stem Jewish immigration to Palestine.\n\nSouth African and Rwandan textbooks are examples of selective narratives which partly reduce the Holocaust to a form of racism, illustrated with images of Hitler and Darwin side by side, or evoke analogies between life under apartheid and persecution carried out by the National Socialists.\n\nThe Holocaust in curricula discusses the ways in which the Holocaust is presented in secondary school level history and social studies curricula worldwide. Curricula and textbooks, in particular those designed for history teaching, provide both a space for the formation of a condensed canon of knowledge which is considered to be relevant to a specific society, and a means by which claims to social legitimacy may be made. The study of curricula and textbooks enables the reconstruction of patterns of perception and interpretation, or the standards and values which hold sway at any given time. Moreover, they offer insights into the variety of ways in which national identities are conceived of and constructed.\n\nCurricula and textbooks provide reasonably reliable points of reference for educators. The complexity of the Holocaust and the sensitivity towards the social and political consequences of this event which continues to be felt in the present day mean that teachers are often uncertain about how they should teach the Holocaust. As a result, curricula and in particular textbooks are held by educators to provide secure sources of information and of methods to which teachers refer on the assumption that they provide accurate content and reliable didactic and methodological guidelines, which have been compiled by experienced historians, educational experts and authors.\n"}
{"id": "3664381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3664381", "title": "Total Communication", "text": "Total Communication\n\nTotal Communication (TC) is an approach to Deaf education that aims to make use of a number of modes of communication such as signed, oral, auditory, written and visual aids, depending on the particular needs and abilities of the child.\n\nIn the UK 'Total Communication' (also known as 'Inclusive Communication') is an approach used, mainly by Speech and Language therapists, to help children and adults with learning disabilities communicate using any mode of communication such as symbols, signing (usually Makaton), photographs as well as the spoken and written word and gesture. It has also been found to be useful for those recovering from a stroke or head injury where spoken language is impaired or for people whose language processing is affected, perhaps in old age or through dementia.\n\nTotal Communication not only helps deaf children learn to communicate but children who have down syndrome and other learning disabilities where it makes communication hard especially for school aged children and the families who are evolved. \n\nTotal Communication focuses on teaching children special tools to help them communicate better like finger spelling, how to use body language to tell people how you feel, sign language, lip reading and other natural gestures to communicate. Total Communication encourages children to use the little bit of hearing they may have to help make this process work better, with the help of hearing aids and other different kind of implants. Not being able to communicate can be very frustrating, this can cause behavior problems when a child is not able to communicate what her or she needs. \n\nTotal Communication uses both a visual aspect and hearing to help children communicate. When a child is in a classroom setting the teacher and the students may be speaking and using sign language at the same time. This is called simultaneous communication, this form of communication works best in a classroom setting. Teachers who teach these types of classes always emphasize learning the language first. There programs follow the sign language system based on the english system. \n\nSome things to always remember when using total communcation is that some children may process things at a slower pace, this mean you might have to wait up to 10 seconds to get an answer. The use of yes and no and short answer question are usually the best when asking questions they only require one answer a yes or no. Using print like pictures or symbols can also really help children understand what you are trying to say. \n\nTotal Communication includes: \n\nart \n\nmusic \n\ntaste \n\nobjects\n\ntouch \n\nhearing \n\nwritten words \n\nsigned words \n\nvocalisations \n\ncontextual clues\n\nTotal Communication along with sign and spoken language can be very effective when they are used together. To really help a child you need to understand his or her strengths and weaknesses. Cusacke494 \n\nAn approach very similar to Total Communication was developed by David Denton at the Maryland School for the Deaf in 1967. The term \"Total Communication\", though, and its specific philosophy, was first used by Roy Holcomb in California. It was adopted by the Maryland school as the official name for their educational philosophy. TC was supposed to find a middle ground in age-old disputes between oralism and manualism, and as an alternative to Simultaneous Communication. In practice, however, most Total Communication programs use some form of Simultaneous Communication.\n\nTotal Communication educational programs have been established in the UK, France, U.S., China, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, France, Germany and elsewhere. In the United States, TC was most popular during the 1970s and 1980s, when most schools and programs for children who are Deaf, as well as most major organizations in the field supported the TC philosophy. Today, the debate seems to be between TC programs and bilingual-bicultural education.\n\nThere is little research concerning that the use of total communication in child centers or his or her own natural environment . But it is considered to be best practiced in early intervention. \n\nTC's original intent was to provide children with the communication tools needed for children to develop complete language. But in later years the philosophy of TC has often been over-simplified and has been confused with simultaneous communication. (found very little research on the confusion) Cusacke494\n\n\n\n"}

Yousician currently supports guitar, piano, ukulele and bass, voice, and is available on iOS, Android, Windows and macOS platforms. Yousician analyses the users‚Äô playing on their real musical instruments, and provides them with instant feedback and guidance. Yousician claims to be the world‚Äôs largest music educator.\n\nYousician Ltd. is a Helsinki based music education company founded by Chris Th√ºr and Mikko Kaipainen in 2010 under the name Ovelin, and was part of the Startup Sauna accelerator programme at Aalto University. Yousician states its mission as \"Making musicality as common as literacy\". The company develops and operates a music service called Yousician, and a tuner application called GuitarTuna. As of December 2016, Yousician claims over 8 million monthly active users worldwide across their products. In 2012, the company raised $1.4m from Silicon Valley-based investor True Ventures.\n\nThe \"Yousician\" service is built on audio signal processing technology that can recognize notes and chords played by its users on their real instruments (both acoustic and electric). Users are shown either a gamified, colourful version of sheet music or tablature notation for an exercise, and hear a backing track as they play along. A major criticism of this app is its inability to display correct, standard, black and white music notation. Using the built-in microphone of the device, Yousician listens to the users play, gives feedback on accuracy and timing, and tracks users‚Äô progress over time.\n\n\"Yousician\" is currently available for four instruments: guitar, piano, bass and ukulele. For every instrument, Yousician features a syllabus developed and produced in-house by the company. Syllabi are made up of songs and exercises, tutorial videos and mini-games to learn new skills. Over all instruments, there are around 150 missions and over 25,000 exercises available. Yousician used to offer a user generated content platform where users can create their own content via an in-built editor for their own usage, or choose to share it with the community. There are some features available that do not require an instrument, e.g. ear-training or theory practice while people don‚Äôt have instruments at hand. Yousician operates under a freemium model where one lesson per day is given for free, while unlimited lesson time is offered via paid subscriptions.\n\n\"Yousician for Guitar\" was the first instrument launched on the platform when it was released in November 2014. The syllabus of guitar is divided into 3 paths: Lead, Rhythm and Knowledge. The standard visualization for guitar is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two.\n\n\"Yousician for Piano\" was the second instrument launched on the platform in November 2015. The syllabus of piano is divided into 3 paths: Classical, Pop and Knowledge. The standard visualization for piano is a simplified version of sheet music, but users can also choose to display songs as traditional sheet music.\n\n\"Yousician for Ukulele\" was the third instrument launched on the platform in December 2015. The syllabus of ukulele is divided into 3 paths: Lead, Rhythm and Knowledge. The standard visualization for ukulele is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two.\n\n\"Yousician for Bass\" was the fourth instrument launched on the platform in April 2016. The syllabus of bass is divided into 2 paths: Playing and Knowledge. The standard visualization for bass is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two.\n\n\"Yousician for Voice\" was the fifth instrument launched on the platform in August 2018. There's a single path in the syllabus. The visualization is a chromatic staff where notes are represented by bars, comparable to some other singing applications such as \"SingStar\".\n\n\"Yousician for Educator\"s is a service built on the Yousician platform for teachers using Yousician with their students, both for in-classroom and for the students to practice at home. Teachers are able to assign and monitor homework tasks and student progression from the \"Educator Dashboard\". As of February 2017, Yousician claims the service is being used by thousands of teachers around the world. Yousician has a ‚ÄúDistinguished Educators‚Äù section featuring teachers that help other teachers to utilize Yousician in their classrooms. Yousician for Educators uses a freemium model for teachers and their students, although they previously had a free model for teachers.\n\nYousician was released on November 2014, to mostly positive reviews. Guitar World called it ‚Äúmodern technology‚Äôs gift to music education‚Äù and in March 2015 it was featured as 'Editor's Choice' in the Apple iOS App Store. Critical voices usually do not question the product itself, but contrast it to the option of learning to play an instrument in private lessons. Voicesinc.org for example stated that ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre happy to learn from a digital screnen, then it‚Äôs great, but if you want a lot more human interaction and demonstration, there may be some better options.‚Äù As of October 2018, the Yousician app had 227,660 ratings on Google Play with an average 4.5 of the 5-star rating and on the iOS App Store 10,076 ratings with an average of 4.3 of the 5-stars.\n\nYousician was featured two times as 'Editor's Choice' in the iOS App Store and won a \"Best of 2016 Apps\" award from Google Play. Yousician was one of \"Wired's\" top 100 European startups in 2012, and were also featured in \"The Sunday Times\" \"World's Best Apps List 2012\". Yousician and its apps have won several technology and start-up competitions, including SXSW Accelerator 2012 (Music) and Midemlab 2012.\n\nAs of July 2018 Yousician has removed all user-generated content, an act some users regard as negating its worth completely.\n"}
