To ensure all students are ready for success after high school, the Common Core Standards establish clear, consistent guidelines for what every student should know and be able to do in math, English language arts, and history from kindergarten through 9th grade.\n\nThe Common Core standards focus on developing the critical-thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills students will need to be successful. The standards also provide a way for teachers to measure student progress throughout the school year and ensure that students are on the pathway to success in their academic careers. Forty-two states, the District of Columbia, four territories, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) have voluntarily adopted the standards.\n\nThe Albanian International School utilizes the NWEA MAP Growth evaluation for student growth assessment. AIS remains the only international school in Tirana to both test and publicly share its students international test scores.\n\nThe Albanian International School is also the first and only school in the Balkans to utilize Standards Based Grading (SBG) for its English and Math class assessments. SBG refers to systems of instruction, assessment, grading, and academic reporting that are based on students demonstrating understanding or mastery of the knowledge and skills they are expected to learn as they progress through their education. \n\nThe school is centrally located on the outskirts of downtown Tirana and is housed in the former French Embassy. The building was substantially renovated and improved over the last two years with small improvements ongoing. AIS has recently expanded the kindergarten classroom, added to the cafeteria, added a master fire alarm system, added an external emergency stairwell, added surveillance cameras, instructional technology to accommodate the MAP testing, and two main entry office spaces. The outdoor space fills one side of a city block directly across from the US Embassy, with high stucco walls topped with wrought-iron fencing surrounding the perimeter, with two large gates for vehicles to pass through. The perimeter defines a U-shaped, paved driveway that loops around the building allowing easy access for parents to enter and exit when picking up their children. There is a large outdoor playing field covered with artificial turf and enclosed with chain-link fencing all around and netting over the top. This field is fitted for soccer, basketball and volleyball.\n\nOutside next to the playing court is a small playground for preschool with swings, slides, playhouse, and other pre-school equipment. The school is licensed by the Ministry of Education and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Albanian Ministry of Education for education, health safety, and labor regulations.\n"}
{"id": "20903583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20903583", "title": "All-women shortlist", "text": "All-women shortlist\n\nThe use of all-women shortlists (AWS) is a positive action practice intended to increase the proportion of female Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom, allowing only women to stand in particular constituencies for a particular political party. Only the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats currently use this practice. Political parties in other countries, such as South Korea and Latin American countries have used practices analogous to AWS, especially in relation to government sex quotas. AWS and practices similar to it have had mixed impacts in terms of the percentage of candidacies and offices women hold as a result of their use.\n\nIn the 1990s, women constituted less than 10% of MPs in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. Political parties used various strategies to increase female representation, including encouraging women to stand and constituency associations to select them, and providing special training for potential female candidates.\nAnother strategy, the creation of all-women shortlists, is a positive discrimination strategy making it compulsory for selection of women candidates in some constituencies.\n\nThe strategy has been criticised as undemocratic, as \"bypassing competitive principles and hence as ignoring the merit principle,\" and as \"a form of discrimination against men.\" For the 1992 general election, the Labour Party had a policy of ensuring there was at least one statutory female candidate on each of its shortlists, however few of these women were successful in being selected in winnable seats (seats within a 6% swing). Following polling that suggested women were less likely to vote Labour than men, the party introduced All-women shortlists at their 1993 annual conference.\n\nLabour used all-women shortlists to select candidates in half of all winnable seats for the 1997 general election, with the aim of reaching 100 female MPs post-election; a goal that was achieved. The shortlists provoked controversy, however. In 1996, Labour Party branches in Croydon Central, Merthyr Tydfil & Rhymney, Bishop Auckland and Slough all submitted hostile motions criticising the policy.\n\nConcern about such sex discrimination was especially strong in Slough where the local party refused to even co-operate in selecting a candidate after having an AWS imposed. Another concern was that AWS were being used as a device to keep out certain men who might have made trouble for Tony Blair, Prime Minister at the time. then-Labour Party leader Tony Blair stated that AWS were \"not ideal at all\" in 1995.\n\nIn December 1995, Peter Jepson and Roger Dyas-Elliott, prevented from standing on Labour shortlists because of their gender, challenged the policy in court. Supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission, they claimed that they had been illegally barred from applying to be considered to represent the party and that the policy contradicted Labour's policy of aiming to promote equality of opportunity.\n\nThe 34 candidates who had already been selected by all-women shortlists were not required to seek re-selection, but all 14 unfinished all-women shortlist selections were suspended. Dr Jepson and Mr Dyas-Elliott did not seek compensation for their loss.\nAt the 1997 general election, 35 out of 38 Labour AWS candidates were elected.\n\nThe Conservative Party also opposed gender quotas, preferring to persuade constituencies to select female candidates in winnable seats.\n\nPrior to the 1999 European parliament elections, the Liberal Democrats used a system called \"zipping\" in which equal numbers of men and women were elected as MEPs.\n\nFollowing the reduction in female MPs after the 2001 general election and increased lobbying by gender equality advocates, Labour introduced the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002, which allows parties to use positive discrimination in the selection of candidates. They were to remain legalised until the end of 2015, due to the \"Sunset Clause\", but that deadline was extended to 2030 as part of the Equality Act 2010.\n\nIn contrast, the Liberal Democrats rejected a proposal to use AWS in 2001; suggesting such shortlists were illiberal and unnecessary. Prominent women MPs of the party opposed the use of all-women shortlists. Party members argued that the main problem was not discrimination, but a lack of female candidates. Instead the party set a target of having 40% female candidates in winnable seats.\n\nAt the 2005 general election, the shortlists helped to increase the number of female MPs in Parliament to 128, with the Labour Party's 98 women constituting 77% of the total. However, a Labour-controlled \"safe seat\" was lost when explicitly anti-AWS independent candidate Peter Law won the Blaenau Gwent constituency in Wales beating Maggie Jones who had been selected using Labour's All-women shortlist policy. The loss was widely blamed on controversy over AWS, though a scholarly analysis suggests that additional factors may have been at play, and noted that overall there was no significant anti-AWS backlash during the election.\n\nA Speaker's conference was set up in 2008 to study the reasons why MPs were predominantly White, male and able-bodied. An interim report released in July 2009 called for women to make up at least 50% of new candidates at the following general election. However, all-women shortlists continued to elicit criticism. Conservative Ann Widdecombe criticised the use of AWS stating that women in the past who fought for equality such as the Suffragettes \"wanted equal opportunities not special privileges\" and \"they would have thrown themselves under the King's horse to protest against positive discrimination and all-women shortlists\".\n\nDiane Abbott, one of the early supporters of all women shortlists criticised their failure to recruit ethnic minority women into politics, stating that they had in effect \"been all white women shortlists\" As evidence of this claim, she cited the 1997 Parliamentary intake; where none of the MPs selected using all women shortlists were Black.\nConservative Party leader David Cameron tried to institute AWS in 2006. There was opposition from some female Conservative MPs, such as Nadine Dorries and Ann Widdecombe.\n\nIn October 2009, David Cameron stated that the under-representation of women and ethnic minorities was \"a real problem for parliament and for my party\", and reversed his opposition to AWS. In February 2010, he indicated that he would impose AWS because the pace of change towards the selection of more female MPs had been too slow.\nIn 2009, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg stated that he would consider introducing all-women shortlists if the number of female MPs did not increase following the next election, but he did not see this as a long-term solution for the unrepresentative nature of parliament.\n\nAll-women shortlists had been credited with breaking down prejudices that impeded the selection of women and discouraged women from offering their candidacy. In both 1997 and 2005, 50% of women MPs elected were selected from all-women shortlists.\n\nThe increase in women in politics brought increased parliamentary priority to issues such as women's health, domestic violence, childcare. In addition, the increased number of women MPs and greater focus on women's concerns likely resulted in increased female support for Labour at the polls. AWS may also have made it easier for women to be selected non-all-women shortlist seats. The shortlists also gave rise to the appointment of the first British female Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith in June 2007.\n\nHowever, the United Kingdom has had two female Prime Ministers (Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) and Theresa May) (2016-present), both of whom were Conservatives, the only major political party not to use all women shortlists.\n\nIn May 2018, over 300 women were claimed to be quitting the Labour Party in protest at the inclusion of transgender women on all-women shortlists. In an open letter to The Times, ten members said that the policy \"reeks of male authority and male supremacy\".\n\nMany countries today use political gender quotas.\nAmong the first to use party reservations for female candidates by political parties were Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In 1983, the Norwegian Labour Party mandated that \"at all elections and nominations both sexes must be represented by at least 40 per cent\", and in 1994, the Swedish Social Democratic Workers' Party mandated \"every second on the list a woman\", which meant that male and female candidates would be alternated between each other on the party list of preferred candidates, a format known as a \"zipper quota\". The quota was imposed on 290 local parties by the national party organization. Furthermore, the party created a handbook for women with advice about how to seek political office. In 1988, the Danish Social Democrats \"each sex has the right to a representation of at least 40 per cent of the Social Democratic candidates for local and regional elections. If there is not a sufficient number of candidates from each sex, this right will not fully come into effect\"; however, this party law was abolished in 1996.\n\nIraq held its first post-Saddam parliamentary elections in January 2005 under an electoral law providing for compulsory integration of women on the candidate lists, like several European countries with a proportional electoral system.\n\nLatin American political parties’ gender policies for candidates often have a relationship to their respective countries’ legalized gender quotas for governing bodies. Fourteen Latin American countries have such a quota for their legislatures; these countries consist of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Political parties in Latin American countries utilize a variety of systems to pick their candidates for office, with Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay having “fairly informal selection rules” for their candidates, in which party elites have large amounts of influence, while those in Paraguay and Costa Rica use more stringent methods of selection described by formal and written rules within the political parties. Political parties with more bureaucratized, stricter candidate selection processes in Latin American countries with legislative-body quotas run women as, on average, 37.8% of their candidates for legislative bodies, while in those parties with less formalized selection processes, on average, women constitute 31.5% of candidates.\n\nSouth Korea has a system in which gender quotas exist for its single national legislative body, the National Assembly, with a requirement that women hold 30% of the National Assembly’s 246 single-member constituency seats and 50% of its 54 proportionally elected seats. However, “neither of the two major political parties has thus far nominated women to more than 10 percent of the single-member district seats,” resulting in women constituting 15.7% of National Assembly members. This situation is largely due to the candidate selection process of South Korean political parties, whose “rules governing candidate selection lack routinization,” allowing party leaders to have significant influence regarding candidates and the ability to circumvent gender quotas.\n\nAll-women shortlists and similar policies have largely drawn the same criticisms as the gender quotas of which they represent a subset. One category of criticism asserts that gender quotas represent a positive step, but do not accomplish enough. Some criticism in this vein asserts that quotas should include penalties for groups who do not follow them. Similarly, some critics argue that quotas in corporations in addition to those in governing bodies, should be instituted among other measures to improve public and private sector career opportunities for women.\n\nHowever, other critics believe that gender quota policies, like those of which all-women shortlists represent a subset, do not, no matter their requirements, provide a way for women to achieve equality in government. For instance, some critics in this arena believe that gender quotas and debate regarding them does not represent real or substantive gains for women. Similarly, some criticisms of gender quotas, including all-women shortlists, argue that even with quotas in place, societal norms discouraging women from holding leadership positions still prevent significant changes. More specifically, these critics assert that even when women do run for office under quota systems, they face a lack of monetary support and as a result often do not win elections.\n\n"}

Its formal German name is \"Prüfung für den Hochschulzugang von besonders befähigten Berufstätigen\" (Examination for College Attendance by Specially Qualified Workers).\n\nCandidates must be 25 or older, unable to enroll in an educational institution and take the non-student Abitur (see below) and not in possession of a field-specific Abitur with the possibility of upgrading it to the general Abitur, and have completed an apprenticeship, trade school training, or governmental/military training and then worked for 5 or more years in that profession, or completed secondary school with a non-college-bound certificate and then have seven or more years of employment and/or as a single head of household with dependents, and show evidence of independent preparation. Those who have failed the examination twice are ineligible to re-take it, subject to the right of individual states to grant exceptions.\n\nInstead of the Begabtenprüfung, the states of Brandenburg, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Saarland offer a \"Nichtschülerprüfung\" (examination for non-students) or \"Externenabitur\" (external Abitur), formally called a non-student Abitur, \"Abiturprüfung für Nichtschülerinnen und Nichtschüler\". This has a minimum age of 19 and requires the candidate not to have been enrolled in an educational institution during the preceding year, except for special cases such as Waldorf schools.\n\nThe Begabtenprüfung is regulated and administered at the state level by a commission.\n\nThe examination consists of an oral and a written component, to be graded at a standard corresponding to the Abitur.\n\nThe written examination consists of 3 components each of 4–5 hours:\n\nThe oral examination consists of\n\nThe Begabtenprüfung dates to before World War II. For example, Fritz Behrens, a communist who became a professor at the University of Leipzig immediately after completing his Habilitation in 1947, entered university after taking the Begabtenprüfung and received his doctorate in 1935.\n\nAfter the war, making further education available to those who had been unable to graduate from a \"gymnasium\" was a priority in both Western and Russian sectors of Germany, but in the Soviet zone and later the GDR responsibility for the Begabtenprüfung was placed with the college or university rather than the locality; institutions were required to provide \"Vorstudienanstalten\" (pre-study institutes) to prepare workers for the examination, and after 1949, to have integrated departments for workers and farmers.\n"}

The company is privately funded by a wide range of investors including Peter Thiel, founder and former CEO of PayPal, and Mark D'Arcy, Director of Global Creative Solutions at Facebook.\n\nThe idea for Booktrack arose in 2008 when co-founder Mark Cameron regularly commuted by ferry in Auckland. He realized that as he read, a song would regularly come up on his music player that would complement the passage, with a bright song serendipitously accompanying a lighthearted passage. As he looked around the ferry at other commuters who were also simultaneously reading and listening to music, he realized the potential for a company that could replicate this experience, melding sound with text to provide an immersive reading environment. He reached out to his brother, Paul, and they spent three years building the technology before launching the site in August, 2011.\n\nThe proprietary and patented technology behind Booktrack works by determining the speed at which any given reader is expected to progress through every word of a given text, and then matching music, sound effects, and ambient sound to every word. Using advanced algorithms, the audio is matched to readers' speed. Music, sound effects, and ambient audio tracks are recorded separately, allowing readers to set their own preferences.\n\nBooktracks incorporate both original and licensed music from a wide range of sources. To date, Booktracks have included original music composed by acclaimed sound artist Stephen Gallagher performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, as well as music licensed from Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Many authors work in conjunction with the composers to develop appropriate music for their books.\n\nBooktracks are available for download through the Booktrack Bookshelf app in the Apple App Store, Google Play and on a PC using a web browser.\n\nIn September 2013, Booktrack introduced Booktrack Studio allowing writers and creatives to add a synchronized movie-style soundtrack—including music, ambient audio and sound effects—to a story, with the audio paced to each individual’s reading speed. The platform enables writers to create and share stories and provides readers with a new type of reading experience.\n\nThe Booktrack Studio app was selected by Google to be featured on the re-launched Chrome Web Store. With Booktrack Studio anyone can easily add music, ambient sound and effects to any digital text, from a book or a short story to poetry or a travel blog. They can then immediately publish their work to the Booktrack Library for anyone to read and listen to. Versions are in development for mobile, all browsers and other e-reader platforms.\n\nThe first Booktrack download was a version of The Power of Six, the second book in the Lorien Legacies by Pittacus Lore and the sequel to I Am Number Four. The book was released in conjunction with HarperCollins and James Frey's transmedia publishing company, Full Fathom Five. The Booktrack edition of The Power of Six includes more than 70 originally scored compositions and was produced under the direction of John Neill, the head of sound at Park Road Post, and includes contributions by award-winning composer and sound editor Stephen Gallagher.\n\nThe company also provided a Booktrack edition of Sherlock Holmes' The Adventure of the Speckled Band. Since then, the company has published editions of Salman Rushdie's short story \" In the South \" and classics including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, The Ugly Duckling, The Selfish Giant, Hansel and Gretel, Peter Pan, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.\n\nBooktracks created by Booktrack Studio users can be read from the Booktrack Studio app.\n\nBooktrack was met with a great interest, with articles written about it in The New York Times, The Atlantic, Mashable, Business Insider, the \" Los Angeles Times \" and \" The Guardian \" among others. \" The Times \" called Booktrack \"An Advance in electronic publishing\" while \" The Huffington Post \" said it was \"Revolutionary\", \"TechCrunch\" called it \"An effort to create a whole new genre of e-books,\" and \"The Atlantic\" asked whether it might be \"the future of reading.\"\n\nWhile many praised the idea, several people criticized it as a bad idea that was counter to the entire purpose of a reading experience.\n\nThe Booktrack app was released on the iTunes Store, breaking into the top 100 free apps overall by downloads within two weeks of its launch.\n"}

A bystander is a person who is present at an event, party, or other setting who notices a problematic situation, such as a man making sexual advances on a drunk person. The bystander then takes on personal responsibility and takes action to intervene, with the goal of preventing the situation from escalating. \n\nThe bystander who is intervening has several options, including distracting either of the people, getting help from others, checking in later, or directly intervening. There are risks to bystander intervention; it can lead to fights, it can ruin the mood for the people who were \"intervened\" into, and it can lead to confrontations. Bystander intervention may also be called \"bystander education\", because the model is based on a system of educating trainers and leaders who will then go on to train people from their community.\nOne bystander intervention researcher suggests that a potential sexual assault be stopped by pretending to spill a drink on a drunk man who is trying to make sexual moves on an intoxicated woman, to distract him and \"...stop bad behavior before it crosses the line from drunken partying to sexual assault\". Advocates hope that bystander intervention programs can yield the same results on sexual assault that designated driver initiatives have had in reducing impaired driving; another similarity is that both programs do not discourage drinking itself, only the combination of drinking and law-breaking. Some US universities are introducing bystander education initiatives to comply with Title IX, which requires US universities which receive federal funding to not discriminate according to gender.\n\nA study on bystander intervention by the University of New Hampshire showed that 38 percent of the men who saw a bystander intervention campaign said they intervened to stop a sexual assault, versus only 12 percent of the control group (who did not see the campaign). An Ohio University study compared men who took a bystander intervention session with a group of men who did not have the training; 1.5 percent of the bystander intervention participants said they had committed sexual assault over the last four months, versus 6.7 percent from the untrained group. One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel \"less personal responsibility\" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.\n\n"}

Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with ethnic nationalism.\n\nErnest Renan is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.\n\nCivic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a \"civic nation\" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.\n\nIn theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another. German philosopher Jürgen Habermas argued that immigrants to a liberal-democratic state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. Constitutional patriotism).\n\nCivic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Membership of the civic nation is considered voluntary, as in Ernest Renan's classical definition in \"Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?\" of the nation as a \"daily referendum\" characterized by the \"will to live together\". Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in countries such as the United States and France (see the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, and the \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\" of 1789).\n\nThe Corsican nationalist movement organized around the FLNC is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation (\"destiny communauty\") in the continuity of Pasquale Paoli and the ideas of the Lumières.\n\nThe Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, which advocate independence of their respective nations from the United Kingdom, proclaim themselves to be civic nationalist parties, in which they advocate the independence and popular sovereignty of the people living in their nations society, not individual ethnic groups.\n\nThe Republican Left of Catalonia supports a civic Catalan independentism and defends a Catalan Republic based on republicanism and civic values within a diverse society.\n\nOutside Europe, it has also been used to describe the Civil War-era Republican Party in the United States.\n\n"}

{"id": "10534901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10534901", "title": "Education in Nicaragua", "text": "Education in Nicaragua\n\nEducation in Nicaragua is free for all Nicaraguans. Elementary education is free and compulsory although this is not strictly enforced. Many children are not able to attend if their families need to have them work. Communities on the Atlantic Coast have access to education in both Spanish and the languages of the native indigenous tribes that live in the more rural areas of Nicaragua. Higher education has financial, organic and administrative autonomy, according to the law. Freedom of subjects is recognized. The school year runs from February through November.\n\nThe oldest institution of higher education in Nicaragua is the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua, which was founded in 1812, which dates back to the Spanish colonial period. Nicaragua became a part of the Central American Federation in 1821 and declared its independence from Spain. It left the Federation in 1838 for full independence.\n\nThere are many commercial schools and eight universities throughout the country. Between 2002 and 2003, a total of 100,363 Nicaraguan students attended universities and other institutions of higher learning. The National Council of Universities is the body responsible for strategic planning in Nicaragua.\n\nAdmission to higher education is on the basis of the \"Bachillerato\", the leading secondary school qualification. Students are also subject to an entrance examination. The \"Licenciado\", the main undergraduate degree, is a four- or five-year course of study. A professional title may be awarded depending on the subject. Following the \"Licenciado\", the first postgraduate degree is the \"Maestria\", which lasts two years and culminates with the submission of a thesis.\n\nInstitutions of higher learning can offer two- or three-year courses in technical and vocational education. The main qualification studied for is the Tecnico Superior.\n\nThere are over 30 public universities and over 75 private institutions.\n\nWhen the Sandinistas came to power in 1979, they inherited an education system that was one of the poorest in Latin America. Under the Somozas, limited spending on education and generalized poverty forced many adolescents into the labor market and constricted educational opportunities for Nicaraguans. In the late 1970s, only 65% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school; of those who entered first grade only 22% completed the full six years of the primary school curriculum. Most rural schools offered only one or two years of schooling, and three-quarters of the rural population was illiterate.\n\nFew students enrolled in secondary school, in part because most secondary institutions were private and too expensive for the average family. By these standards, the 8% of the college-age population enrolled in Nicaraguan universities seemed relatively high. Less surprising was that upper-class families typically sent their children abroad for higher education.\n\nBy 1984 the Sandinista government had approximately doubled the proportion of GNP spent on pre-university education, the number of primary and secondary school teachers, the number of schools, and the number of students enrolled at all levels of the education system. \n\nAt the college level, enrollment jumped from 11,142 students in 1978 to 38,570 in 1985. The Sandinistas reshaped the system of higher education: reordering curricular priorities, closing down redundant institutions and programs and establishing new ones, and increasing lower-class access to higher education. Influenced by Cuban models, the new curricula were oriented toward development needs. Agriculture, medicine, education, and technology grew at the expense of law, the humanities, and the social sciences.\n\nA 1980 literacy campaign, using secondary school students as volunteer teachers, reduced the illiteracy rate from 50% to 23% of the population. (The latter figure exceeds the rate of 13% claimed by the literacy campaign, which did not count adults whom the government classified as learning impaired or otherwise unteachable.)\n\nIn part to consolidate the gains of the literacy campaign, the Ministry of Education set up a system of informal self-education groups known as Popular Education Cooperatives. Using materials and pedagogical advice provided by the ministry, residents of poor communities met in the evenings to develop basic reading and mathematical skills. The key large-scale programs of the Sandinistas included a massive National Literacy Crusade (March–August 1980), social program, which received international recognition for their gains in literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Sandinista education (and favored target of anti-Sandinista criticism) was the ideological orientation of the curriculum. The stated goal of instruction was the development of a \"new man\" whose virtues were to include patriotism, \"internationalism,\" an orientation toward productive work, and a willingness to sacrifice individual interests to social and national interests. Textbooks were nationalist and prorevolutionary in tone, giving ample coverage to Sandinista heroes.\n\nAfter the 1990 election, the Chamorro government placed education in the hands of critics of Sandinista policy, who imposed more conservative values on the curriculum. A new set of textbooks was produced with support from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), which had provided similar help during the Somoza era.\n\nDespite the Sandinistas' determined efforts to expand the education system in the early 1980s, Nicaragua remained an undereducated society in 1993. Even before the Contra War and the economic crisis that forced spending on education back to the 1970 level, the education system was straining to keep up with the rapidly growing school-age population. Between 1980 and 1990, the number of children between five and fourteen years of age had expanded by 35%. At the end of the Sandinista era, the literacy rate had declined from the level attained at the conclusion of the 1980 literacy campaign. Overall school enrollments were larger than they had been in the 1970s, however. Especially in the countryside, access to education had broadened dramatically. But a substantial minority of primary school-age children and three-quarters of secondary school-age students were not in school, and the proportion of students who completed their primary education had not advanced beyond the 1979 level. Even by Central American standards, the Nicaraguan education system was performing poorly.\n\nAcademic grading in Nicaragua works on a 100-point scale. For primary school and high school levels, a 60 is good enough to pass, while for further levels the pass grade is 70. Students who attain from 60 to the pass grade get the chance to take one extra test that reviews the year's topics and in which a 70 is needed to achieve a pass grade.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56263767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56263767", "title": "Effects of sleep deprivation on college students", "text": "Effects of sleep deprivation on college students\n\nSleep deprivation is simply a condition of having an inadequate amount of sleep. At least 50% of college students exhibit daytime sleepiness due to sleep deprivation compared to 36% of adolescents and adults. College students, on average, get about 6 to 6.9 hours of sleep per night. According to Stanford University's Department for the Diagnosis and Treatment for Sleep Disorders, the recommended amount of sleep needed for college students is around 8 hours. Most college students are sleep deprived, as 70.6% of students reported that they get less than 8 hours of sleep.There are various effects that sleep deprivation can have on college students, including lower academic performance, impaired learning, and decreased physical activity. One primary cause as to why college students experience a lack of sleep is improper sleep hygiene.\n\nInadequate sleep hygiene is one primary cause as to why college students experience sleep deprivation. Sleep hygiene is defined as habits or practices that allow for healthy amounts of sleep on a daily basis. Good sleep hygiene habits include keeping a consistent sleep schedule, having a quiet sleep environment, and avoiding consuming caffeine and alcohol before sleeping. Many students have inadequate sleep hygiene that leads to sleep deprivation. \n\nAccording to a study by the US Department of Health and Human Services, approximately 80% of college students have drunk alcohol, with nearly 40% of the students reporting to \"binge drinking,\" or the consumption of an excessive amount of alcohol over a short amount of time. While alcohol may help with faster sleep, it can affect the quality of the sleep. Alcohol may effect one's REM sleep, the stage of sleep where most dreams and memories occur and are stored. Without REM sleep, one would go straight into deep sleep. This may be why people who have insomnia resort to consuming alcohol in order to fall asleep. However, this can result in alcohol dependence. Relying on alcohol as a sleeping aid can lead to sleepwalk, sleep talk and memory problems. Drinking alcohol has also been linked to causing obstructive sleep apnea, where it causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep. In addition, it has been proven that alcohol can cause insomnia. Researchers from the University of Missouri School of Medicine observed the effects of alcohol on sleep. The results showed that drinking alcohol boosted the adenosine levels. Adenosine levels go up when one is awake and go down when one is asleep. The participants in this study had extended periods of regular drinking and as a result, sleep came quickly to them. However, the participants woke up in a few hours and suffered from insomnia.\n\nThe blue light that is emitted from the screens of phones, computers and other devices stops the production of melatonin, the hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle of the circadian rhythm. Reducing the amount of melatonin produced makes it harder to fall and stay asleep. In a 2011 poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundation, it reported that approximately 90% of Americans used technology in the hour before bed. The poll noted that young adults and teenagers were more likely to use cell phones, computers, and video game consoles. Additionally, the authors of the poll found that technology use was connected to sleep patterns. 22% of participants reported going to sleep with cell phone ringers on in their bedroom and 10% reported awakenings in at least a few nights per week due to their cell phones' ringers. Among those with the cell phone ringers on, being awakened by their cell phone was correlated to difficulty sustaining sleep.\n\nA study from the University of Kentucky depicted that more than 78% of college freshmen consume above the recommended amount of caffeine each day. In one group of researchers' study from the Henry Ford Hospital's Sleep and Research Center and Wayne State College of Medicine, they discovered that caffeine consumed at least six hours before bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep. Participants in this study who consumed caffeine right before bedtime, three hours before bedtime, and six hours before bedtime all experienced a shorter night's sleep, lower sleep quality and spent more time awake at night.\n\nThere is evidence that sleep is correlated with GPA. GPA is associated with the students' overall academic performances in their classes. Students who had longer amounts of sleep had higher GPAs than students who had shorter amounts of sleep. In another study, researchers from the Sleep Health Institute and Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorder at the Departments of Medicine and Neurology in the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, created a study to discover how irregular sleep patterns are associated with poorer academic performances. The students who participated in this study kept online diaries of their sleep schedules for 30 days. The researchers divided the participants into two groups: regular sleepers, or those who went to bed and woke up around the same time every day and irregular sleepers, or those who have different sleep patterns every day. Using a scoring index from zero to 100 to calculate a student’s sleep schedule, students with irregular sleeping patterns were given lower scores closer to zero while the students with regular sleeping patterns had scores closer to 100. The researchers found that for every score increase of 10 on the scoring index, the student had an average increase of 0.10 of their GPA. The researchers concluded that college students who do not go to bed or wake up at consistent time are likely to have lower GPAs. The study suggests that irregular sleeping schedules do indeed affect student’s GPA and academic performance.\n\nStudent's physical shape seems to be affected by sleep deprivation as well. Researchers from the Imperial College School of Medicine conducted a randomized controlled study to investigate the effects of a night of sleep deprivation on the physical performance in students. The participants were randomized into two conditions, normal sleep or one night of sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation was monitored using an online-time stamped questionnaire at 45 minute intervals, done in the participant’s homes. The results show that reaction time and exercise performance were significantly affected by sleep deprivation. The researchers concluded that sleep deprivation can affect physical performance in university students.\n\nDaytime naps offer a potential intervention for sleep deprivation in college students. Napping may improve certain memory tasks as students who were excelling in their academics were more likely to nap than those who had low academic success.\n\nIn one study, participants took a two-credit, 18-week course that included group discussions, lectures, and self-evaluation of topics that included circadian rhythms, sleep hygiene, muscle relaxation, and public sleep education. Participants reported that they had improved sleep quality and sleep hygiene throughout the course.\n\nIn one study, a revised type of cognitive behavioral for treating insomnia was sent to participating students by email. The email contained an attachment addressing several aspects of sleep, such as techniques for relaxation and methods to stabilize the circadian rhythm. This method was compared to another program called Breathe which was created in order to reduce symptoms of depression and to cope with high stress. Participants in the Breathe program showed improvements in sleep quality and a decrease in depressive symptoms.While this study only had a small number of participants, the final results showed hope as an effective method that can help with sleep deprivation for college students.\n"}

She was the first woman to ever hold that leadership position.\n\nRomero grew up in Barstow, one of six children. Her father worked in the railroad yards and her mother, who left school after sixth grade, stayed home and raised the kids.

Romero was supported by advocates of charter schools, while her two major opponents were supported by teachers unions and school administrators, respectively. Eventually, Romero finished third, receiving 17.0% of the vote in a crowded 12-person field.\n\nRomero leads the California chapter of Democrats for Education Reform, an interest group funded by Wall Street hedge fund managers who support charter schools. In the 2012 election, she is campaigning for California's Prop. 32 that would bar unions from withholding money from worker paychecks to finance political activities.\n\n"}

Within the United States, students compete in the comparable National History Bee and Bowl; the same organization, International Academic Competitions, oversees the International and National (i.e. American) tournaments. The International History Bee and Bowl debuted in the 2011-2012 school year in Europe and Asia. A European Championship has been held since 2012; the Asian Championships debuted in spring 2014. In the 2014-15 school year, the Australian and New Zealand Division debuted as did the Canadian Division. Tournaments are held in approximately 30 countries each year. IHBB also organizes the International History Olympiad, which debuted in 2015 at The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and was held in Hawaii in 2016 and Berlin in 2018. Students can qualify for the Olympiad by participating at IHBB tournaments around the world or by taking an official qualifying exam administered by a teacher if no IHBB tournament exists nearby.\n\nThe International History Bee and Bowl test knowledge of all aspects of history in a buzzer-based competition format, which bears a resemblance to some television quiz shows. However, unlike on a quiz show most IHBB questions are paragraph-length, and move from harder to easier information. When students think they know the answer, they ring in with the buzzer. If they are correct, they, or their team members get points, if incorrect, then the other students (in the History Bee) or the other team (in the History Bowl) has an opportunity to hear the rest of the question. All IHBB matches are conducted in English - tournaments in other languages may be added at some point in the future. \n\nThe International History Bee and Bowl World Championships are contested at the International History Olympiad. However, the International History Bowl World Championships features matches between teams of 2 or 3 students representing either a particular US state or country (or a mix of two or three of these) and is thus unlike any other International History Bowl competition. A full list of IHBB world champions is maintained on the International History Olympiad page\n\nRegional tournaments are held throughout Asia, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Any school or student may attend as long as they have not participated at an earlier regional tournament that school year. Each tournament features a Varsity division for students roughly 16–18 years of age, a Junior Varsity division for students roughly 13–15 years of age, and a Middle School division for younger students.\n\nEach tournament features a series of preliminary rounds for the History Bee for individual students and the History Bowl for teams. Students who finish in the top half in their age classification for the History Bee, and Bowl teams who finish the preliminary rounds with a .500 winning percentage or better qualify for their regional Championships, as well as the International History Olympiad. At the end of the preliminary rounds, the top Bee students advance to the Bee Finals, while Bowl teams are seeded according to their preliminary results and advance to the playoffs.\n\nStudents and teams who finish in the top half of their regional tournament earn the right to compete at the Canadian, European and Asian Championships. The Championships also feature a Consolation Bee for students attending with their History Bowl team who did not qualify for the Bee Championships, as well as a Geography Bee which is open to all. The Championships in Europe and Asia also feature a separate Sports and Entertainment History Bee which is open to all participants, including coaches and also an all-subject team quiz competition, the Academic Bowl of Asia (or Europe).\n\nThe 2012 European Championships were held in Grasse, France; the 2013 European Championships were held in Paris; the 2014 and 2017 Championships were in Rome, the 2015 Championships in Switzerland, the 2016 Championships were in Berlin, and the 2018 European Championships were held in Prague. The Asian Championships were held in Hong Kong in 2014, and in Khao Lak, Thailand in 2015 and 2016. The inaugural Canadian Championships were held in 2015 in Ottawa, and the 2016 Canadian Championships were held in Toronto.\n\nQualified students and schools from Middle Eastern countries are welcome to compete at either the IHBB European or Asian Championships, but not both in any given year.\n\n"}

Farquhar\n\nJohn Nicol Farquhar (6 April 1861 – 17 July 1929) was a Scottish educational missionary to Calcutta, and an Orientalist. He is one of the pioneers who popularised the \"Fulfilment theology\" in India that Christ is the crown of Hinduism, though, \"Fulfilment thesis\" in Bengal was built on foundation originally laid in Madras by William Miller.\n\nHe authored several books on Hinduism, notably, \"The Crown of Hindustan\", \"A Primer of Hinduism\", \"Gita and Gospel\", and many alike.\n\nFarquhar was born at Aberdeen in 1861. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Aberdeen University and served an apprenticeship as a draper, but he returned to school at an age of 21, and finished his studies at Oxford University. With no prior ordination, he was recruited by London Missionary Society as a lay educational missionary and sent to India in 1891.\n\nHe arrived at Calcutta and started his missionary work by teaching at Bhowanipur for eleven years from 1891. He joined Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1902 as a national student secretary; later, as a literary secretary, a post which he held until 1923. While working at YMCA, he strived to enable the association to widen its appeal to students through lectures, through personal friendships, and through production of whole new body of literature of the highest grade that India had ever known before.\n\nDue to ill-health, he left India in 1923. He spent last six years of his life working as a professor of comparative religion in the University of Manchester. He died in Manchester in 1929.\n\nDuring his stint at YMCA, he wrote several books; notably, \"The Crown of Hinduism\" in 1913, \"A Primer of Hinduism\" in 1914, and \"Modern Religious Movements in India\" in 1915, and edited many more.\nIn his famous publication \"The Crown of Hinduism\", he aspired to present Christ, rather than an organizational structure or intellectual system to India. He argued that Karma and Caste, traditional concepts enshrined in Hindu belief, are no longer essential in the construction of modern nation; instead, the message of Christ with high regard to freedom, progress, and civic virtue provides a better intellectual platform upon which to build a progressive India. He accepts that the Caste-system itself is a collective response to the pursuit of a structured and well-balanced society, still, he points at the caste-system for devoid of social justice and egalitarianism. However, he says a society that embraces the heart of Christ's message will inevitably develop social freedom for citizenry. According to Farquhar:\nHis work \"An Outline of the Religious Literature of India\" published in 1920, clearly demonstrates his excellent linguistic skills in both Bengali and Sanskrit languages.\n\nAs an editor for \"Religious life of India,\" he inspired missionaries to write to the highest standards of accuracy, sympathy, and Christian-centric; however, he was less fortunate in finding the right Indian Christian co-workers, and never agreed fully to terms with the changed climate of opinion in India after 1919.\n\n\nAccording to O. Kandaswami Chetty, biographer of Dr. William Miller, for Miller \"Christ was the friend of all that was good and true not only in Christianity, but in Hinduism.\". The idea of \"Christ the fulfiller\" was made familiar to the minds of South Indians of Madras Presidency long before Farquhar's \"The Crown of Hinduism\" published in 1913. Even the colleagues of Miller like Bernard Lucas and T.E. Slater, author of \"The Higher Hinduism in Relation to Christianity\" published in 1909, long before articulated \"Fulfilment theology\" at the World Missionary Conference held at Edinburgh in 1910 itself—Edinburgh conference is considered as the starting point for modern theology of mission and also a launch-pad of the modern ecumenical movement.\n\nAccording to Eric J. Sharpe, professor of Religious studies at University of Sydney; author of books like \"Not To Destroy, But To Fulfil:the contribution of J.N. Farquhar to Protestant missionary thought in India before 1914\", \"John Nicol Farquhar and the missionary study of Hinduism\", \"John Nicol Farquhar, a memoir\", and \"Faith meets Faith: Some Christian Attitudes to Hinduism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries\"; and who extensively wrote on Farquhar's theology and missiological approach to Indian religions, has observed that Farquhar, although fully worked out \"Fulfillment thesis\" in his seminal work, yet his work on \"Fulfillment theology\" in Bengal was built on foundations laid out initially at Madras by William Miller itself.\n\nHe was the pioneer in popularising his missionary theology \"Fulfillment theology\". Although, he didn't invent it by himself, but based his theology on William Miller \"Fulfilment theology\" that took its shape in Madras Presidency. According to this theology, \"Christ came to fulfill and bring to completion not only the law and the prophets(\"Matt.\"5:17) but all the world's higher religions.\"—in this sense, Christ is the \"Crown\" of Hinduism.\n\nHe popularised and expressed the idea that Christianity was the fulfilment of other religions; he advocated that Christianity was not out to destroy other religions but to fulfill. He intended to develop a workable apologetic to maintain a satisfactory relationship between Christianity and Hinduism—during his days, there was a radical change in Indian Christian thoughts against Western Christianity, sense of nationalism and self-consciousness was growing among Indians, Hindu nationalism started reasserting its opposition to Christianity, Christian missionaries were considering non-Christian religions as evil, and Church union movement towards Christian unity was growing for Indianisation and indigenisation of Church in its administration, liturgy and theology. With \"Fulfilment theology,\" he affirmed that Christianity or rather Christ, is the \"Crown\" of Hinduism. He hoped, progressive Hindus will embrace the Christianity; Christians, including Christian missionaries would be more sympathetic to other religions. With an intention of developing satisfactory relationship between Hinduism and Christianity, rather than of mere exclusion, he gradually worked out his idea of \"I came not to destroy but to fulfill.\"(Mathew 5:17)\n\nIn his publication \"The Crown of Hinduism\" published in 1913, Farquher argued that:\n\nFarquhar, though saw some amount of truth in non-Christian religions, yet he denounced some elements that Christianity cannot accept. Caste system is one among them, as he felt that equality, freedom, and justice are distinctive aspects of Christianity. According to Farquher, though, \"Fulfilment\" dictated sympathy and reverence as the only \"way of wisdom\" for the missionary to the Hindu, it indirectly spelt ultimate extinction for all non-Christian religions.\n\nEric Sharpe has remarked that Farquhar was \"more than any other individual responsible for bringing about a decisive change in the thinking of Christians over against the phenomena of other faiths.\"\n\nA.G. Hogg, professor at Madras Christian College and author of \"Karma and Redemption\" in 1904, criticised Farquhar's \"Fulfilment thesis\" that says \"Christianity fulfils all the noblest aspirations of the Hindus,\" as Hogg perceived that \"in Hinduism there was searching and finding, and that a Christian was not offering what a Hindu was searching. Under certain circumstances, a Christian however could make the Hindu feel the need for what is available only in Christianity.\" \n\nFarquhar's Fulfillment School has also been discussed, with praise and / or censor, by many writers on philosophy or theology of religion, including Gavin D'Costa, Jacques Dupuis, John Hick, David Marshall, Ivan Satyavrata, James Sharpe, and James Thrower: Satyavrata and Sharpe provide extended analyses. Farquhar is often taken as a leading representative of the Inclusivist School, though this would be more plausible if the focus were on ontology and ethics, which are Farquhar's foci, rather than on salvation.\n\n"}

He was the principal investigator on the multi-year NSF/College Board project that led to the release of the AP Computer Science Principles course and exam.\n\nAstrachan was born in New York City in 1956 to Gail Lovejoy and Anthony Astrachan. He has a younger brother, Joshua Astrachan. \n\nAstrachan graduated from Dartmouth College in 1978 with an AB degree in mathematics. He received a Master of Arts in Teaching from Duke in 1979, doing his initial teaching at Camp Lejeune High School, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 he taught math and computer science at Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina. During the summer of 1983 he attended a summer program for high school teachers at Carnegie Mellon University preparing to teach the new College Board AP Computer Science course. He joined the development team for the new exam.\n\nIn 1985 Astrachan began graduate studies in computer science at Duke. His thesis work was with Donald W. Loveland on automated theorem proving. His teaching responsibilities included curricular development for the first computer science course for majors and the introductory computer science course for non-majors. He spent the summer of 1991 as a research assistant at SRI International in Menlo Park, California working on automated theorem proving with Mark E. Stickel.

It was inspired by the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest but open to a wider range of students and required no travel, only access to email.\n\nIn 1993 Astrachan joined the Duke faculty in the Department of Computer Science as Assistant Professor of the Practice of Computer Science. That fall he became the Director of Undergraduate Studies. He changed the introductory computer science course to use C++ as the programming language and began writing an introductory textbook. The first edition of \"A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++\" was published in 1997 and was widely used. The second edition was published in 2000.\n\nAstrachan continued his work with the AP Computer Science Development Committee. He was part of the team developing the AP Computer Science AB and became the Chief Reader on that exam. Later he was a leader in the change of programming language from Pascal to C++ and again from C++ to Java. In 2007, he and Peter J. Denning were named NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering Distinguished Education Fellows for \"their outstanding efforts to revitalize undergraduate computing education in the United States.\"\n\nIn 2008 Astrachan became the principal investigator for the joint NSF/College Board project to develop a new Advanced Placement (AP) course, AP Computer Science Principles and the continuing grant to complete the development of the AP CSP exam. The new course was designed to broaden participation in computing. The first courses began in Fall 2016 and the first exam was given in May 2017. Over 50,000 students took the exam, setting a record for the largest initial AP exam participation.\n\nIn 2016 the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) awarded Astrachan its Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award for \"three decades of innovative computer science pedagogy and inspirational community leadership in broadening the appeal of high school and introductory-level college computer science courses.\" The citation ended by quoting \"Astrachan's Law\" as an example of his approach to teaching: \"never ask a student to use a computer to solve a problem that is more easily solved without it.\"\n\nAstrachan is married to Laura Heyneman and has two sons, Ethan, born 1999, and Adam, born 2002. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "56399112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56399112", "title": "Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy", "text": "Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy\n\nPaulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy is a book by historian Andrew J. Kirkendall published by the University of North Carolina Press in 2010. It discusses the involvement of Brazilian educator and critical pedagogy philosopher Paulo Freire (1921-1997) in literacy programs in Latin American during the Cold War, and analyzes the effect of politics on literacy programs. The book also details Freire's work with organizations such as the World Council of Churches and the spread of his ideas.\n\nThis book is an analysis of Paulo Freire's work in Latin American literacy campaigns during the mid 20th century. The first chapter, \"Entering History\", helps set the stage for the rest of the book. It summarizes Freire's early life and the historical context of Brazil in the 1940s and 1950s. It goes on to explain how the need for improving literacy rates was becoming apparent during this time, and describes Freire's ideas regarding education and politics.\n\nThe second chapter, \"The Revolution that wasn't and the Revolution that was in Brazil\", describes Freire's work in the northeast of Brazil during the presidency of Joao Goulart. It describes the literacy programs that he set up in the region, particularly in Angicos, and also discusses Freire's methods of education. It explains how the issue of literacy became increasingly prominent during the 1960s due to the government's need to define itself and expanding student movements. The chapter also argues that talk of a \"revolution\" in Brazil, which was common on in Goulart's party, was interpreted in widely varying ways with some fearing that it could lead to communist uprisings and others believing that it simply described rapid progress towards literacy and democracy. The involvement of the United States, which tried to promote literacy through the Alliance for Progress but also was preoccupied with preventing the spread of communism, was also discussed. The chapter ends with the 1964 coup, motivated by fears of a radical Left, that deposed Goulart and forced Freire to flee the country. \n\"Reformist Chile, Peasant Consciousness, and the Meaning of Christian Democracy\" describes Freire's time in Chile from 1964 to 1969. During this time, he served under the administration of Eduardo Frei, who made the eradication of illiteracy a central aspect of his vision for the county. This chapter argues that Freire experienced some of his most productive years in Chile due to the success of his programs in spreading literacy in the Chilean countryside. This helped him gain increased international recognition and ensured that his ideas would spread globally. However it also points out that many of the attempts to increase the political awareness of the illiterate were also designed to promote Christian Democratic views at the expense of other political parties. Frei's party also encouraged the formation of unions in rural areas in order to gain political support. By the end of the chapter the Christian Democratic party has lost much of its support despite its achievements, and failed to receive a mandate in the 1970 election. Freire, who now increasingly viewed himself as a revolutionary, left Chile.\n\nIn the fourth chapter, \"Paulo Freire and the World Council of Churches\", Freire travels extensively on behalf of the World Council of Churches (WCC). His brief visit to the United States, where he exchanged ideas with academics such as Jonathan Kozol and Denis Goulet, is summarized. Freire also spends time in Europe, particularly in Geneva, the base of the WCC. Freire also worked on literacy programs in many African countries, such as Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Tanzania. This chapter also describes the influence of Freire and his ideas on the WCC, particularly his belief that education should be for \"liberation and continuity\". The contradictions between Freire's political ideas and his reliance on American liberals, who often disagreed with his beliefs, for funding are also pointed out. Finally, Kirkendall points out that during this period in Freire's life, he started working with single party states rather than multiparty democracies.\n\nThe fifth chapter, \"The Sandinistas and the Last Utopian Experiment of the Cold War\", focuses on Freire's work in Nicaragua from 1979 to 1980. It gives an overview of the history of Nicaragua starting from the rise of the Somoza family dynasty in 1936. Kirkendall then describes the rise of the Sandinista party and describes the political importance of literacy within the revolution. Many Sandinistas believed that becoming literate was an important part of the process of self transformation that defined the revolution. After the Sandinista victory, education became an important part of their agenda and a \"National Literacy Crusade\" was started. Freire's help was requested and he arrived in Nicaragua in October 1979. Kirkendall states that one of the most important contributions of Freire was to legitimize the Sandinista literacy campaign. He also points out that the United States contributes a large amount to the literacy campaign despite being historically opposed to the Sandinistas. The literacy campaign was partially successful, but by 1985 illiteracy rates had risen back to 20 percent. Kirkendall argues that Freire remained proud of the accomplishments of the literacy campaign.\n\nIn the last chapter, \"The Long, Slow Transition to Democracy in Brazil\", Freire's role in restoring democratic government in Brazil is discussed. After his return was facilitated by the 1979 Amnesty Law, Freire helped found the Workers Party. Kirkendall describes the process of democratization and describes the Freire's work as education secretary during this time. The book ends with a description of the end of the Cold War.\n\nThroughout the book, Kirkendall makes the argument that politics and education significantly influenced each other in Cold War era Latin America. He claims that following the rise of Joao Goulart, \"national and international dynamics turned illiteracy into a national issue of great political importance\" He also argues that education itself was used by political parties as a tool to generate support. Indeed, according to Kirkendall, \"the Brazilian student Left in the early 1960s considered politicizing and raising the consciousnesses of the Brazilian popular class to be a central part of their own political activity\". He further claims that this phenomenon was not confined to Brazil but also manifested itself in Chile and Nicaragua. Frei's emphasis on education in the countryside, he claims, was \"hardly apolitical\" and probably motivated by the fact that \"the Christian Democrats lagged behind the Marxist parties in organizing the industrial and mining sectors\". Finally, Kirkendall claims that the United States involved itself in literacy programs for the purpose of stopping the spread of communism.\n\nKirkendall argues that Freire's ideas about education have gained international importance. He points out that Freire's belief in the importance of consciousness-raising among the lower classes and his idea that the illiterate should be the agents of their own education rather than mere recipients of knowledge have influenced literacy campaigns throughout the world. To corroborate these claims, Kirkendall points out that \"phraseology reminiscent of Freirean programs\" was used in Nicaragua even though Freire himself spent a very limited amount of time in the country. Kirkendall also argues that Freire's ideas contained some contradictions, such as the fact that he helped implement literacy programs supposedly designed to promote democratization in one party states, therefore legitimizing undemocratic governments.\n\nThe book has received positive reviews with many people citing its thoroughness and balanced commentary on Freire's life. Robert Arnove from Indiana University praises it as \"immensely informative and engaging\" and calls it \"the most authoritative account of the life and times of Paulo Freire\" Héctor Lindo-Fuentes also has a very positive impression of the work, praising it for \"illuminating an important aspect of the Cold War\" but points out that the style could be better adapted to convey a sense of the excitement of the times. Kirkendall's book also received a glowing review from Tanya Harmer from the London School of Economics and Political Science, who calls it \"an impeccably researched and thoughtful book\"\n"}

He was the older brother of the noted photographer and movie producer C. Cameron Macauley. His uncle owned and published the Hudsonville newspaper, \"The Ottawa Times\" (named for Ottawa County), and Macauley used the printing press to publish his first books of fiction and poetry. At age 18 he printed and bound a limited edition of \"Solomon's Cat\", a previously unpublished poem by Walter Duranty, setting the type and engraving the illustrations.\n\nAs an undergraduate at Olivet College, he was a student of Ford Madox Ford (describing him as \"my first teacher and editorial mentor.\") and then won a three-year literary prize scholarship and transferred to Kenyon College to be a student of John Crowe Ransom. There he lived in a writer's house with Robert Lowell, Peter Taylor, and Randall Jarrell. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa during February 1941, and the same year was awarded a fellowship to attend the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. He graduated \"summa cum laude\" from Kenyon in June 1941.\n\nHe was drafted in March 1942 and served in World War II as a special agent in the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) with the 97th Infantry Division, in the \"Ruhr Pocket\" and then in Japan after the war. On April 23, 1945 Macauley's division helped liberate Flossenbürg concentration camp. Macauley later said, \"I entered some concentration camps the day we liberated them-- the most horrifying days of my life. My job was to interview survivors. Most of the bodies that I saw had been stripped and it was impossible to tell which were those of Jews and which of Christians. Nazi murder was a great leveler, fully ecumenical... Hitler's bell tolled for all...\"\n\nMacauley wrote four autobiographical short stories based on his experiences doing intelligence work, collected in \"The End of Pity and Other Stories\", (1957). In \"A Nest of Gentlefolk\", (winner of the 1949 Furioso Prize) he describes the CIC's futile search for Nazi war criminals in the war-ravaged town of Hohenlohe; in \"The Thin Voice\" he describes the unlawful murder of a Russian prisoner by American troops in , Germany; in \"The End of Pity\" he tells the story of a woman's suicide after visiting her ruined house in a combat zone in Oberkassel; and in \"The Mind is its Own Place\" he describes his brief post-war encounter in Karuizawa, Japan with Captain Kermit Beahan, bombardier of the bomber \"The Bockscar\" who released the atomic bomb over Nagasaki. Macauley described Beahan as \"a young captain with a college-boy face [who] had suffered some strange mutation of feeling so deep and so destructive...\"\n\nAccording to Macauley's letters archived at the University of North Carolina, while in Karuizawa he was friends with former Japanese Ambassador to the US Saburō Kurusu and German Admiral Paul Wenneker, as well as pianist Leo Sirota and artist Paul Jacoulet. He was also acquainted with former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe, to whom he presented a copy of \"The American Leviathan: The Republic in the Machine Age\" by Charles A. Beard. In his capacity as CIC Station Chief he supervised the arrests, on October 30, 1945 of a number of major Nazi leaders who were in hiding in Karuizawa: Dr. Franz Joseph Spahn, Nazi Gruppenleiter in Japan; Paul Sperringer, a former SS Stormtrooper and assistant to Gestapo Chief Colonel Josef Meisinger; Karl Hamel, Meisinger's secretary; Charles Schmidt-Jucheim, a former San Francisco police officer and an ex-US Army sergeant who attended Gestapo training in Germany and renounced his US citizenship; Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, chief of the Nazi propaganda system in Japan; Heinrich Loy, a Gestapo spy who allegedly participated in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch; Dr. Karl Kindermann, Meisinger's Jewish interpreter who was an informant for the Gestapo; Alrich Mosaner, chief of the Hitler Youth in Japan; and Otto Burmeister, chief of the Nazi education system in Japan. Most of these individuals were later released by the CIC.\n\nRobie Macauley was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work in detaining members of the Gestapo in Japan.\n\nAfter the war he taught briefly at Bard College then worked at \"Gourmet\" Magazine and for Henry Holt and Company. During 1947 he taught at the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop with Paul Engle, Robert Lowell and Anthony Hecht (with whom Macauley had served during World War II), where he befriended Flannery O'Connor, advising her on drafts of her first novel, \"Wise Blood\". He completed his MFA at the University of Iowa in 1950 and spent the next three years at the Woman's College (now The University of North Carolina at Greensboro) where he taught modern American literature and writing.\n\nMacauley received a Rockefeller Fellowship and during 1953 Cord Meyer offered him a position in the International Organizations Division of the Central Intelligence Agency. With John Crowe Ransom's encouragement, Macauley accepted and relocated to Paris where he participated in the Congress for Cultural Freedom. Macauley assisted in the publication of \"Quadrant\" magazine (edited by James McAuley), an Australian literary journal that at the time had \"an anticommunist thrust\". Pybus, Cassandra, He was also U.S. representative to the International PEN Congress in Tokyo (1957) and Brazil (1960).\n\n During 1958 he returned to the US to succeed John Crowe Ransom as editor of \"The Kenyon Review\". Ransom described Macauley as \"wise and thorough, thoroughly experienced, an excellent critic...; a pretty good fiction writer who has just begun to get a lot better; and a person universally admired and liked.\" During the next seven years Macauley published works by John Barth, T. S. Eliot, Nadine Gordimer, Robert Graves, Randall Jarrell, Richmond Lattimore, Doris Lessing, Robert Lowell, V. S. Naipaul, Joyce Carol Oates, Frank O'Connor, V. S. Pritchett, Thomas Pynchon, J. F. Powers, Karl Shapiro, Jean Stafford, Christina Stead, Peter Taylor, and Robert Penn Warren, as well as articles, essays and book reviews by Eric Bentley, Cleanth Brooks, R. P. Blackmur, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Ellmann, Leslie Fiedler, Martin Green, and Raymond Williams. In 1964 he served as a fiction judge for the National Book Awards together with John Cheever and Philip Rahv. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship and took a sabbatical in 1964–65 as a Fulbright Research Fellow at the University of London.\n\n During 1966 Macauley became the Fiction Editor at \"Playboy\", where he published fiction by Saul Bellow, Michael Crichton, John Cheever, Roald Dahl, James Dickey, J. P. Donleavy, Nadine Gordimer, John Irving, Arthur Koestler, John LeCarre, Ursula K. Le Guin, Doris Lessing, Bernard Malamud, Vladimir Nabokov, Joyce Carol Oates, Seán Ó Faoláin, Anne Sexton, Irwin Shaw, Isaac B. Singer, John Updike, and Kurt Vonnegut as well as poetry by Yevgeny Yevtushenko. David H. Lynn, writing in \"The Kenyon Review\", said that \"in the years when he was fiction editor, \"Playboy\" was second only to \"The New Yorker\" in prestige as a place for serious writers to display their talents.\" During this period he also taught fiction at the MFA program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Circle Campus. In 1967 he co-initiated the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses together with Reed Whittemore (\"The Carleton Miscellany\", \"The New Republic\"); Jules Chametzky (\"The Massachusetts Review\"); George Plimpton (\"The Paris Review\"); and William Phillips (\"The Partisan Review\").\n\nIn 1978 he became a Senior Editor at Houghton Mifflin, where he was responsible for publishing \"The Mosquito Coast\", \"The Marrakesh One-Two\", \"Shoeless Joe\", and several works of nonfiction such as \"\", \"Techno-Bandits\", \"Getting to Yes\", \"The Puzzle Palace\", \"The Bunker\", \"The Dungeon Master\", and \"The Nine Nations of North America\". He later taught at the Harvard Extension School and during 1990 co-initiated and co-directed the Ploughshares International Writing Seminars, a summer program of the Emerson College European Center at Kasteel Well in the Netherlands.\n\nRobie Macauley died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Boston on November 20, 1995.\n\nDuring his life Robie Macauley published two novels, \"The Disguises of Love\" (1951), the story of a university professor's love affair with a student and how it affects his wife and son, and \"A Secret History of Time to Come\" (1979), an adventure thriller set in a devastated post-apocalypse America 200 years in the future.\n\nHis last two novels, \"\", (2014), and \"The Escape of Alfred Dreyfus\", (2016) were published posthumously.\n\nHis short fiction appeared in \"Furioso\", the \"North American Review\", \"The Kenyon Review\", \"The Sewanee Review\", \"The Southern Review\", \"Shenandoah\", \"Esquire\", \"Fiction\", \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\", \"Cosmopolitan\", the \"Virginia Quarterly Review\" and \"Playboy\", for which he was awarded the Furioso Prize (1949), The O. Henry Award (1951, 1956 and 1967), and the John Train Humor Prize (1990).\n\nIn spite of his expertise and experience, Macauley's own fiction received only moderate recognition. \"Robie Macauley's prose, like the best poetry, has a startling economy of means and precision of language\", declared Melvin J. Friedman in \"Contemporary Novelists\". \"The author's work\", continued Friedman, \"is the enviable product of years spent in close and sympathetic relationship with the best novels from Jane Austen through James Joyce.\" David H. Lynn, editor of \"The Kenyon Review\", described Macauley's fiction as \"subtle, stinging, disturbing, witty.\" Eugene Goodheart, commenting on \"The End of Pity and Other Stories\", said \"Macauley has all the gifts of a master short story writer: narrative power, a quick and vivid imagination of character...a capacity for delivering the scene that at once surprises and satisfies the reader's expectation, i.e., a fine sense for the significant scene or action, a felicity of phrase that is not merely decoration, but becomes perception.\"\n\nSince 2001 StoryQuarterly has awarded the annual Robie Macauley Award for Fiction.\n\nHe co-authored (with George Lanning) a textbook on writing, \"Technique in Fiction\" (1964, revised in 1989), and co-authored (with William Betcher) a book on marriage counseling, \"The Seven Basic Quarrels of Marriage\" (1990). He edited \"America and Its Discontents\" together with Larzer Ziff. Between 1942 and 1990 he contributed dozens of book reviews to \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"The Kenyon Review\", \"Furioso\", \"Vogue\", \"The New York Herald Tribune\", \"The Partisan Review\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"Encounter\", \"The New Republic\", \"The Chicago Sun-Times\", \"Dialogue\", the \"Boston Review\", and other publications. He also wrote a series of contemplative essays on writing, writers and literature which were published in \"Shenandoah\", \"The Irish University Review\", \"Transition\", \"The Texas Quarterly\", \"Ploughshares\", and \"The Paris Review\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57077190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57077190", "title": "SEA-PHAGES", "text": "SEA-PHAGES\n\nSEA-PHAGES stands for Science Education Alliance-Phages Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science; it was formerly called the National Genomics Research Initiative. This was the first initiative launched by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Science Education Alliance (SEA) by their director Tuajuanda C. Jordan in 2008 to improve the retention of Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. SEA-PHAGES is a two-semester undergraduate research program administered by the University of Pittsburgh's Graham Hatfull's group and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science Education Division. Students from over 100 universities nationwide engage in authentic individual research that includes a wet-bench laboratory and a bioinformatics component.\n\nDuring the first semester of this program, classes of around 18-24 undergraduate students work under the supervision of one or two university faculty members and a graduate student assistant—who have completed two week-long training workshops—to isolate and characterize their own personal bacteriophage that infects a specific bacterial host cell from local soil samples. Once students have successfully isolated a phage, they are able to classify them by visualizing them through Electron microscope (EM) images. Also, DNA is extracted and purified by the students, and one sample is sent for sequencing to be ready for the second semester's curriculum.\n\nThe second semester consists of the annotation of the genome the class sent to be sequenced. In that case, students work together to evaluate the genes for start-stop coordinates, ribosome-binding sites, and possible functions of those proteins in which the sequence codes. Once the annotation is completed, it is submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) DNA sequence database GenBank. If there is still time in the semester or the sent DNA was not able to be sequenced, the class could request genome file from the University of Pittsburgh that had yet to be sequenced. In addition to the laboratory and bioinformatic skills acquired, students have the opportunity to publish their work in academic journals and attend the national SEA-PHAGES conference in Washington, D.C. or a regional symposium.\n\nAll of the details regarding each student's phage is made public by entering it into the online database PhagesDB to expand the knowledge of the SEA-PHAGES community as a whole.\n\nStarterator creates a report by comparing the called start sites of genes in the same Pham in annotated phage genomes and other drafts; therefore, students can suggest an appropriate start for the auto-annotated genes in their actinobacteriophage genome. This is not usually a primary source for calling a gene start because it is not always supported by the information from other programs or the start-stop coordinates are not the same for a gene called by DNA Master.\n\nThese compare the amino acid sequence of a gene to other sequenced or annotated phage genomes within the database for students in the SEA-PHAGES community to predict starts and functions of their proteins.\n\nThis software generates a report with its algorithm that shows the coding potential for the six possible open reading frames of a specific genome, so the probability of a gene's existence can be assessed during annotation.\n\nDNA Master is a free software that students can download on a windows computer that utilizes the programs GLIMMER, GeneMark, Aragorn, and tRNAscan-SE to auto-annotate a genome that is uploaded as a FASTA format file. Since this is done by a computer algorithm that only uses three programs and may not be as updated as the online versions, each suggested gene has to be confirmed by student annotations.These go through several rounds of peer-review before it is accepted to be reviewed by experts from PhagesDB, then it can be submitted to GenBank.\n\nThese programs are used by DNA Master to predict the starts of the genes by assessing the probability of the six open reading frames (ORFs) and the ribosome binding site (RBS) signals. Often times, GLIMMER and GeneMark agree on the predictions during the auto-annotation, but sometimes they give different starts which have to be assessed during manual annotation; GLIMMER is currently the most updated software and is usually used for the final start coordinate.\n\nThis algorithm is utilized by DNA Master, and there is an online version that can be used to cross-reference the calls made by the software. It shows definitive tRNAs and tmRNAs within a genome by looking for very specific sequences that would fold into the distinctive cloverleaf secondary structure. Although this algorithm is considered very accurate considering how fast it produces results, it can miss some tRNAs that are not exactly within its search parameters.\n\nThis program allows students the ability to identify possible coding regions for tRNAs in sequence that would have been missed by Aragorn because it includes detection for unusual tRNA homologues; although, both programs have sensitivities between 99-100%. tRNAscan-SE does not detect tRNAs itself, but instead outputs the results of the information processed from three independent tRNA prediction programs: tRNAscan, EufindtRNA, and tRNA covariance model search.\n\nPhamerator shows a visual representation of the genes and their similarity to other selected phage genomes by marking them with colored rectangles based on the Phamily or Pham it groups it in. Students can then view, compare, save, and print color-coded genome maps during their annotations. Possible insertions or deletions can be seen through connecting lines between the selected phage genomes. Also, the nucleotide and protein sequences can be accessed through this program; however, the starts and stops do not always match that of DNA Master so the sequences may be incorrect.\n\nThese online programs are used to predict the functions of proteins by comparison of the amino acid or nucleotide sequences of all genomes sequenced, not just that of phages. HHPred detects homology in the sequences with other proteins that have had their functions called in any organism. Also, if the protein has been identified in another sequence, the computer-generated structure might be provided to visualize the possible folding of the amino acids.\n"}

It also encompasses the study and implementation of more modern teaching methods, such as active learning, cooperative learning, problem based learning, and others. SOTL scholars come from various backgrounds, such as those in educational psychology and other education related fields, as well as specialists in various disciplines who are interested in improving teaching and learning in their respective fields. Some scholars are educational researchers or consultants affiliated with teaching and learning centers at universities.\n\nInquiry methods in SOTL include reflection and analysis, interviews and focus groups, questionnaires and surveys, content analysis of text, secondary analysis of existing data, quasi-experiments (comparison of two sections of the same course), observational research, and case studies, among others. As with all scholarly study, evidence depends not only upon the methods chosen but the relevant disciplinary standards. Dissemination for impact among scholarly teachers may be local within the academic department, college or university, or may be in published, peer-reviewed form. A few journals exclusively publish SOTL outputs, and numerous disciplinary publications disseminate such inquiry outputs (e.g., \"J. Chem. Educ.\", \"J. Natural Resour. Life Sci. Educ.\", \"Research in the Teaching of English\", \"College English\", \"J. Economic Education\"), as well as a number of core SoTL journals and newsletters.\n\nSignature pedagogies are ways of learning in specific disciplines. Examples of signature pedagogies include medical residents making rounds in hospitals or pre-service teachers doing a classroom-based practicum as part of their teacher training. The notion of signature pedagogies has expanded in recent years, as scholars have examined their use in e-learning, for example. Some scholars contend that SoTL itself is a signature pedagogy of higher education.\n\nThe International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching & Learning (ISSOTL)] was founded in 2004 by a committee of 67 scholars from several countries and serves faculty members, staff, and students who care about teaching and learning as serious intellectual work. ISSOTL has held annual conferences since 2004, attended by scholars from about a dozen nations. The conferences sites include Bloomington, Indiana USA (2004); Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2005); Washington, DC, USA (2006); Sydney, Australia (2007); Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (2008); Bloomington, Indiana, USA (2009); Liverpool, UK (2010); Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA (2011); Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (2012); Raleigh, North Carolina, USA (2013); Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (2014).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29035470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29035470", "title": "The New Teacher Project", "text": "The New Teacher Project\n\nTNTP, formerly known as The New Teacher Project, is an organization in the United States with a mission of ensuring that poor and minority students get equal access to effective teachers. It helps urban school districts and states recruit and train new teachers, staff challenged schools, design evaluation systems, and retain teachers who have demonstrated the ability to raise student achievement. TNTP is a non-profit organization and was founded by Michelle Rhee in 1997.\n\nA national nonprofit organization founded by teachers, TNTP is driven by the belief that effective teachers have a greater impact on student achievement than any other school factor (even to the exclusion of social factors). In response, TNTP develops customized programs and policy interventions that enable education leaders to find, develop and keep great teachers. Since its inception in 1997, TNTP has recruited or trained approximately 43,000 teachers - mainly through its Teaching Fellows programs - who have taught an estimated 7 million students. TNTP has also released a series of studies of the policies and practices that affect the quality of the nation's teacher workforce, including \"The Widget Effect\" (2009), \"Teacher Evaluation 2.0\" (2010), and \"The Irreplaceables\" (2012). In 2013, TNTP is active in more than 25 cities, including 10 of the nation's 15 largest.\nIn a New York Daily News opinion piece, Timothy Daly, President of TNTP, advocated for \"making student test scores one of many factors in the tenure decision.\"\n\nTNTP was founded in 1997 by Michelle Rhee. It began with the aim of giving poor and minority students equal access to effective teachers, and during its first 10 years, TNTP initially focused on helping urban districts improve the way they recruited, trained, and hired new teachers. In 2000, TNTP began the Teaching Fellows and Academy programs, which served as alternate routes to teacher certification for high-need schools. Today, TNTP also works with states and public school districts in the areas of measurement and management of teacher performance.\n\nAs it became increasingly familiar with the needs of urban districts, TNTP began helping districts identify and address additional challenges, including hiring teachers earlier, staffing challenged schools and providing rigorous teacher certification training. It also began identifying policies counterproductive to overcoming these challenges and publishing reports to offer solutions and encourage reform.\n\nTNTP is a revenue-generating nonprofit. The majority of its revenue comes from contracts with districts and states to supply services; additional funding for new program development and research is provided by donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIn 2009, TNTP published \"The Widget Effect: Our National Failure to Acknowledge and Act Upon Teacher Effectiveness\". The report, which surveyed over 15,000 teachers and 1,300 principals in 12 school districts, concluded that the U.S. public education system treats teachers as interchangeable parts, rather than individual professionals. American Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten provided a public statement of support for the report, saying it “points the way to a credible, fair, accurate and effective teacher evaluation system that would improve teaching and learning.” The National Education Policy Center (NEPC) review of \"The Widget Effect\" praised the overall quality of the report but said, \"'it is unclear ... how and why particular districts were selected, and whether they represent the range of teacher evaluation practices being implemented in school districts and states across the United States.' Omissions in the report's description of its methodology (e.g., sampling strategy and survey response rates) and its sample lead to questions about the generalizability of the findings.\"\n\nThe National Education Policy Center was critical of TNTP's report \"Teacher Evaluation 2.0\", which, it said, contained \"recommendations for teacher evaluation [that] boil down, for the most part, to truisms and conventional wisdom, lacking a supporting presentation of scholarly evidence.\" The review also claimed that \"many of the ideas and recommendations are neither new nor innovative.\"\n\nIn 2012, TNTP published \"The Irreplaceables: Understanding the Real Retention Crisis in America’s Urban Schools\". The study identified the failure of public schools to keep more of their strongest teachers (or “irreplaceables”) in the classroom than their weakest as the fundamental problem with teacher retention in urban school districts. The report, which focused on four large urban school districts, also offered solutions for how districts and schools can help keep more of their best teachers.\n\nUpon \"The Irreplaceables\"’ release, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan publicly supported TNTP’s findings and the National Education Association (NEA) praised the report, noting that TNTP had “helped focus attention on one of our nation’s most valuable assets: the dedicated professionals who educate our children.” \n\n2008 data from Louisiana showed “that TNTP teachers outperform beginning and experienced teachers in math, reading, and language arts.” In 2010, a state-sponsored study assessed the effectiveness of newly certified teachers in Louisiana. Out of 17 teacher preparation providers, TNTP was the only one to earn top marks in 4 of 5 subject areas. A 2010 study out of Louisiana State University indicated TNTP Practitioner Program is one of a group of programs in that state “producing teachers who in aggregate appear to be making a positive contribution to student achievement from the time they complete their training program and begin teaching\" insofar as they are programs \"whose results were generally consistent with the student achievement results of experienced certified teachers\" (the other programs were The Louisiana State University - Shreveport NM/CO program and Southeastern Louisiana University Master's Alternate Certification program). In 2009, a report by the Center for American Progress, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the American Enterprise Institute included TNTP along with certain public school districts, charter school entrepreneurs, and other independent organizations as “addressing stubborn challenges by pursuing familiar notions of good teaching and effective schooling in impressively coherent, disciplined, and strategic ways.” In particular, it stated that TNTP has \"demonstrated a strong record, validated by independent research, of bringing nontraditional applicants into the classroom.\"\n\nIn June 2009, TNTP published its \"Widget Effect\" report on teacher evaluation, conducted in collaboration with over 50 district and state officials and 25 teachers union representatives. Although the American Federation of Teachers agreed that the “overall conclusions of the report are sound,” the union disputed the data on the number of teachers dismissed in Toledo, Ohio. Later, it was reported that at least some of the data were incorrect.\nAccording to a memorandum issued by TNTP, after the Toledo Federation of Teachers (TFT) contacted TNTP with concerns over their data, TNTP responded by reviewing new data provided by the TFT and then reconciling the Toledo Public Schools teacher dismissal data.\n\n\nFormer Sites\n\n\n"}

Its purpose is to encourage cooperation in the advancement of studies through collaborative research and joint publications in those branches of humanities and social sciences promoted by the Academies and Institutions represented in the UAI: philology, archaeology, history, moral sciences and political sciences. The UAI works to promote the advancement of knowledge and scientific exchanges and to support initiatives of all its academies.\n\nFrench is the official language of the union.\n\nThe UAI was founded in 1919 on the initiative of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. After four years of war, the world was longing for peace and understanding between nations. With this in mind, international cooperation was to be promoted in all areas and at all levels, including those of intellectual and scientific work. \nAt a meeting held in Paris in May 1919, the draft statutes were prepared. They were revised and adopted at a second meeting held again in Paris from 15 to 18 October 1919. The proposed project envisaged international academic cooperation in the area of the humanities. During these assemblies, representatives of National Academies from eleven countries adhered to the Union (Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and Russia, the United States) and National Academies of three other countries gave their agreement without being represented (Spain, Norway and Romania). Later in that year, Jugoslavia and Portugal adhered to the Union. Currently, the UAI has members from more than 60 countries all over the world.\n\nThe first general assembly was held in Brussels from 26 to 28 May 1920 where the Belgian historian Henri Pirenne was elected the first president. The administrative seat of the Union was established in the Palace of Academies in Brussels. The Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique is in charge of the secretariat of the UAI and its Permanent Secretary is \"ex officio\" the General Secretary.\n\nDuring this first session, three projects (in French, \"entreprises\") were submitted: the Corpus vasorum antiquorum, the \"Alchemical Manuscripts\", and publication of the \"Works of Grotius\". These projects of a real international character have since earned the thanks of scholars by the meticulous precision with which they have been executed. Up to the Second World War one can observe a slow development: 13 projects were adopted. Currently, the UAI has 81 projects completed or in progress. The UAI can only realize its projects through the international cooperation of its Member Academies.\n\nBetween 1937 and 1947 no General Assemblies were held because of the world catastrophe and all its consequences. In 1949, the UAI takes pride in having assisted in the foundation of the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies (ICPHS )in French: Conseil International de la Philosophie et des Sciences Humaines (CIPSH). In 1964, the UAI received the Erasmus Prize for its success in promoting international collaboration. In 1969, the 50th anniversary of the UAI was celebrated: a ceremony was held under the cupola of the prestigious Institut de France in Paris. In 1976, the UAI included 31 member countries and the number of its projects had risen to 32. In 1995, the 75th anniversary of the UAI was celebrated in Prague.\n\nThe 100th anniversary will be celebrated at the Institut de France in Paris in 2019.\n\nThe missions of the Union Académique Internationale are:\n\nTo achieve its mission, the UAI will work, in the years to come:\n\nTo fulfil its mission and to carry out its vision, the UAI will have the following objectives:\n\nThe Board (in French, \"le Bureau\") is responsible for organizing the General Assembly and presides over its deliberations; it controls the general administration and the progress of works. It is entitled to take urgent measures in the interval between General Assemblies and, if necessary, to convene an Extraordinary General Assembly. The Board has all the powers of management and administration that are necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the association, except those specifically reserved to the General Assembly.\n\nIt is composed of a President, two Vice-Presidents and six members, with Honorary Presidents in a consultative role. All are elected for a term of three years. The Secretary General is also a member of the Board.\n\nEach year, a representative (called \"delegate\") from every member academy attends a General Assembly to discuss and to cooperate in meetings. The General Assembly is always held at the seat of one of the UAI's Member Academies and each year at a different location: one year in Brussels, one year somewhere else in Europe, one year somewhere outside Europe.\n\nThe Secretary General attends to the coordination of the activities of the UAI, follows the progress of the various projects and supports the Bureau in its handling of the correspondence and agenda of the UAI and in the organization of annual sessions. Since its foundation the UAI has its seat in the Palace of Academies in Brussels. The Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique is in charge of the secretariat of the UAI and its Permanent Secretary is the \"ex officio\" General Secretary.\n\nSince 1919, the number of projects sponsored, supported or supervised by the UAI has steadily increased: from the first three projects adopted in 1919, to 81 projects completed or in progress today.\n\nAn initiative for a new project can only be taken by a Member Academy of the UAI (through its delegate mandated for this purpose) or by the Board of the UAI itself. The proposal must contain a precise definition of its subject, an explanatory memorandum, a work plan, a budget and a statement of the financial responsibility for its execution. The project must set and maintain high standards of scholarship, as well as possessing international character and interest.\n\n"}

{"id": "9765003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9765003", "title": "William Toomath", "text": "William Toomath\n\nStanley William (Bill) Toomath (12 November 1925 – 20 March 2014) was a Wellington (New Zealand) architect. He was a founding member of the Architectural Group in Auckland in 1946, a life member of the Wellington Architectural Centre and a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Architects. Both the founding of the Group and the Architectural Centre were important factors in New Zealand's modernist architectural history. \n\nBorn in Lower Hutt, Toomath studied architecture at the Auckland College of the University of New Zealand between 1945 and 1949. He graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture, and was awarded a UNZ two-year travelling scholarship which took him to Europe in 1951. Adding an early Fulbright Graduate Award in 1952 enabled him to complete a MArch at the Harvard Graduate School of Design where he was taught by I. M. Pei and was a co-student with John Hejduk. He briefly worked with Walter Gropius at the Architects' Collaborative and then with I. M. Pei before returning to New Zealand in 1954.\n\nOn his return from New York Toomath set up practice, and three years later was joined by Derek Wilson to establish Toomath and Wilson. Toomath and Wilson were later joined by Don Irvine and Grahame Anderson in 1972, forming the firm Toomath Wilson Irvine Anderson Ltd.\n\nToomath's work reflects an exploratory and intelligent engagement with modernist architectural ideas. A key architectural interest was the articulation of continuous space, which is particularly evident in his Toomath Senior house, Lower Hutt (1949), and the Mackay house, Silverstream (1961). The Toomath Senior house is famous as the site of a discussion Toomath and Lew Martin had with architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner about New Zealand construction. Pevsner found the detailing of a post in the carport unrefined. Toomath argued that it reflected an honesty in detailing, relevant to New Zealand architecture. The Mackay House, Silverstream is symmetrically planned and was designed for a couple without children. It was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) Bronze Medal in 1962. \n\nToomath's other key works include Wool House, Featherston Street, Wellington (1955, in association with Bernard Johns & Whitwell) and the Wellington Teachers' College, Donald Street, Karori (1966–1977). The Wellington Teachers College, Karori, Stage One was awarded an NZIA Silver Medal (1972), and an NZIA Local Award (Enduring Architecture) (2005). Wool House (also now known as Old Wool House) was recognised with an NZIA Wellington Branch Enduring Architecture Award (2002)and the residential Dobson House, Hankey St, Wellington received an NZIA Wellington Branch Enduring Architecture Award (2004)\n\nFollowing his return from studying architecture in the United States and working with Walter Gropius and I. M. Pei, Toomath spent the majority of his architectural career in New Zealand (including over 35 years in professional practice). He was an advocate for several heritage buildings (see below), and played key roles in the Wellington Architectural Centre's projects on Wellington's urban form, namely: \"Te Aro Replanned\" (1947), \"Homes Without Sprawl\" (1957), \"City Approaches\" (1959) and \"Wgtn 196X\" (1961). Toomath also presented professional evidence for the Wellington City Council on proposals for controlling building heights, protected viewshafts and urban form planning (1989–1990) in hearings before the Planning Tribunal.\n\nToomath led a small team whose report on the Old Town Hall stopped moves for its demolition. He wrote papers on conservation matters and presented evidence in support of a number of heritage buildings including: the AMP Head Office Building, the State Fire Insurance Building, Wharf Sheds 7 and 21. He had an active role in campaigns to save Old St Paul's.\n\nToomath was also the Head of the School of Design, Wellington Polytechnic (1979–1989), and a contributor of articles to the New Zealand journal \"Designscape\". He was a regular participant of the \"Designmark\" Advisory Panels, New Zealand Industrial Design Council from 1969, and a Judge of the Prince Philip Award for New Zealand Industrial Design (1981–1985).\n\nToomath is the subject of a documentary Antonello and the Architect, which reveals his influences, designs, ideas - and the painting that he built - Antonello da Messina's St Jerome in his Study.\n\n"}

The Youth Innovation Fund's primary purpose is to support youth, working in partnership with community institutions, and to create innovations that address public issues and problems using a service learning framework.\n\nEight sites were chosen nationwide to receive grants in Chicago, Cleveland, Mississippi, Hampton, Virginia, Nashville, Portland, Maine, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco and Ypsilanti, Michigan. These boards were to consist of diverse youth ages 12-19 that represented the wide variety of races and socio-economic backgrounds of the youth population at the site. Each youth board makes strategic mini-grants to youth-directed civic action projects that utilize a service-learning framework. The youth boards also develop impact plans to create the structures and policies to sustain systemic youth engagement in a city and/or school district.\n\n"}
