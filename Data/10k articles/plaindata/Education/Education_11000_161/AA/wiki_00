{"id": "998941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=998941", "title": "BlueJ", "text": "BlueJ\n\nBlueJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Java programming language, developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale software development. It runs with the help of JDK (Java Development Kit).\n\nBlueJ was developed to support the learning and teaching of object-oriented programming, and its design differs from other development environments as a result. The main screen graphically shows the class structure of an application under development (in a UML-like diagram), and objects can be interactively created and tested. This interaction facility, combined with a clean, simple user interface, allows easy experimentation with objects under development. Object-oriented concepts (classes, objects, communication through method calls) are represented visually and in its interaction design in the interface.\n\nThe development of BlueJ was started in 1999 by lord fury and John Rosenberg at Monash University, as a successor to the Blue system. BlueJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Blue was an integrated system with its own programming language and environment, and was a relative of the Eiffel language. BlueJ implements the Blue environment design for the Java programming language.\n\nIn March 2009, the BlueJ project became free and open source software, and licensed under GNU GPL with the classpath exception.\n\nBlueJ is currently being maintained by a team at King's College London, England, where Kölling works.\n\nBlueJ has a simpler interface than most professional IDEs, but its functionality is not a subset of those kinds of environment. While many of the standard development tools exist, such as an editor, compiler and runtime environment, it also offers tools that are specific to its educational goals and not found in this form in common professional environments. These includes interactive object creation and method invocation (via the \"Object Bench\"), simplified debugging and teamwork controls, interactive, line-based expression and statement evaluation (via the \"Code Pad\"), and automated creation of JUnit classes from recordings of interactive test sequences.\n\nThe BlueJ interface emphasises class structure (in preference of source code) by showing a UML-like diagram as its main screen. Class structures can be manipulated by the user, and the class relation display is generated automatically from the source code.\n\nSource level structure is visualised through \"scope highlighting\" (the visual emphasis of lexical scope through use of graphical frames and background colour).\n\nSupported interaction features include the ability to create objects interactively for ad-hoc testing and experimentation, and support for interactive invocation of public methods. Parameters may be passed and objects can be composed in interactive calls. \n\nInteractive tests may be recorded and stored as standard unit test classes. Code fragments can be evaluated interactively in the Code Pad, which provides a Java-based REPL.\n\nBlueJ supported programming in Java and in Stride . Java support was provided in BlueJ since its inception, while Stride support was added in 2017. \n\nSupport for teachers using BlueJ in their classroom is provided via the Blueroom , an educator community site offering teaching resources and discussion forums. An introductory textbook is available .\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32586635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32586635", "title": "Cow Clicker", "text": "Cow Clicker\n\nCow Clicker is an incremental social network game on Facebook developed by video game researcher Ian Bogost. The game serves as a deconstructive satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn \"clicks\" by clicking on a sprite of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's pasture allows the user to also receive \"clicks\" whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as \"Mooney\" allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks.\n\nIn the wake of a controversial speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed \"Cow Clicker\" for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used \"Cow Clicker\" to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.\n\nSome critics praised \"Cow Clicker\" for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.\n\nThe player is initially given a pasture with nine slots and a single plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a \"click\" is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as \"Mooney\" can be bought with Facebook Credits; it can be used to purchase special \"premium\" cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.\n\nAt the 2010 Game Developers Conference, Zynga's game \"FarmVille\" was awarded the \"Best New Social/Online Game\" at its Game Developers Choice Awards. Ian Bogost (who was also in attendance) was critical of Zynga's success, as he felt that its business model was focused on convincing users to pay money to progress further in their \"freemium\" games rather than treating gaming as an artistic experience. He also believed Zynga's vice president Bill Mooney was trying to attack \"artistic\" gaming during his acceptance speech for the award when he personally invited independent game developers to join his company. After the conference, Bogost coined the term \"cow clickers\" to describe games such as \"FarmVille\" which only involve performing tasks at certain intervals, since in these games, \"you click on a cow, and that’s all you do.\" Bogost compared the players of Zynga's games to the rats in B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning experiment, often receiving variable reinforcement rather than regular rewards. As one of the most vocal critics of Zynga's practices and business model, Bogost made further appearances at various events and panels to discuss his views on social gaming.\n\nIn July 2010, Bogost was scheduled to make an appearance at a New York University seminar, \"Social Games On Trial\", to discuss the controversial aspects of social network gaming. To clearly demonstrate what he felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of these games, Bogost quickly developed a Facebook game entitled \"Cow Clicker\". The game was designed to be a satire of what Bogost personally believed were the only points of \"FarmVille\": to encourage users to continue playing by inviting other users into the game, and to provide incentives for those who purchase virtual goods. The bulk of the code was written in three days.\n\n\"Cow Clicker\" is similar to the 2013 game \"Cookie Clicker\" by Julien Thiennot, which Ian Bogost describes as \"Cow Clicker\" \"logical conclusion\".\n\nUnexpectedly to Bogost, \"Cow Clicker\" became a viral phenomenon, amassing over 50,000 players by September 2010. In response to its sudden popularity, he committed to improving the game with new features. Updates to the game added awards for reaching certain milestones (such as the Golden Cowbell for 100,000 clicks), the ability to earn Mooney by clicking on other users' \"Cow Clicker\" news feed posts, and the chance to randomly gain or lose Mooney on every click. New cow designs were also introduced, such as an oil-coated cow to commemorate the BP oil spill, and the \"Stargrazer Cow\", which was only a mirror image of the original cow that cost around $20's worth of Mooney.\n\nAlthough continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used \"Cow Clicker\" to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; such as the addition of an API to allow websites to have their own clickable cows (in a process he dubbed \"Cowclickification\"), the spin-off game \"Cow Clicker Blitz\" (co-developed with PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka), \"My First Cow Clicker\" for iOS (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to \"train\" children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a \"Cow Clicktivism\" campaign where users could click on an emaciated cow to donate to Oxfam Americawith a goal of donating an actual cow to a third world country. The cow, known as the \"Cowclicktivist Cow\", could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.\n\nIn 2011, an alternate reality game known as the \"Cow ClickARG\" was held, where a series of clues from the \"bovine gods\" eventually revealed that a \"Cowpocalypse\" would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to supplicate with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month. After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been raptured. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the \"end\" of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that \"it wasn't very fun before.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bogost wrote an article for \"The Atlantic\" discussing the collection of data by Facebook apps, with reference to \"Cow Clicker\", following a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data. Bogost notes that Facebook apps appear to be part of the website itself, whereas they actually operate with almost no oversight. He claims that \"without even trying\", \"Cow Clicker\" stored its users' Facebook ID and any networks (such as workplaces) that the user was a part of, and that this information is still stored on his private server. Bogost notes that he could have used this data for malicious purposes, criticising Facebook's \"move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development\".\n\n\"Cow Clicker\" received critical attention soon after its release. One early commentator was Alexia Tsotsis of TechCrunch, who acknowledged the game's intent as a commentary on the impact of social network games. In an interview, Bogost foresaw the transformation of the internet into a \"compulsive virtual dystopia\" through Zynga's use of social gaming.\n\nNick Yee of the Palo Alto Research Center compared the players of games which do not provide \"meaningful opportunities for achievement, social interaction, and challenge\" to rats in a Skinner box. Accordingly, he compared Cow Clicker to being inside an \"incredibly clear Skinner box\"acknowledging how little effort the game took in order to keep users playing the game. Jason Tanz of Wired considered Cow Clicker as an example of the growth in the trend of gamificationwhere developers introduce elements influenced by games into their services without providing the normal \"experience\" a game traditionally incorporates.\n\nPopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka praised \"Cow Clicker\" for being the type of \"ironic, satirical, self-referential\" game that Facebook's game ecosystem was lacking, as he felt there were too many commercially driven games on the social network. Playdom's Scott Jon Siegel criticized the game for not going far enough in its satire, and putting too many highlights on the \"absurd monetisation practices and meaningless clicking which social games are all too well known for.\"\n"}

The main idea is for teams of students between the ages of 9 and 25 to design, build, and race their own electric powered race cars on top racing circuits such as Goodwood.\n\nThe trust originated from a study by Sussex Chamber of Commerce in 1998 which considered the needs of engineering companies in that region. The investigation revealed low levels of interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (the so-called STEM school subjects).\n\nThe Greenpower project started in 1999 to encourage students to design, build and race their own electric race cars within professionally drafted specifications and only a small helping hand from experienced adults. Events were organized for weekends at major motor circuits around the UK to facilitate attendance from the general public. Circuits included (and still include) Goodwood, Castle Combe and Dunsfold (top gear test track).\n\nGreenpower claims that it now works with 500 schools providing events around the UK. Its Headquarters are at Fontwell in Southern England and Greenpower national events were run at the nearby Goodwood Motor Circuit whose owner is a Patron of Greenpower. Between 2015 and 2018, the International Final was held at Rockingham Motor Speedway in the middle of October as a two day event. The final attracts some 170 cars from all over the UK and Ireland with a small number of entries from international teams in America, Poland and South Africa. The Corporate Challenge attracts entries from large companies and universities as far away as Poland, up to 2012 this had been held at Goodwood or Silverstone but in 2013 was amalgamated with the Final of the F24 championship.\n\nOn 30 June 2014, Greenpower announced a partnership with the FIA's Formula e racing series, running a support race for schools during the formula e race weekend.\n\nAll Greenpower classes use a 24V, 240W Framco motor and pairs of 12V REC36-12 or YPC33-12 AGM batteries. These batteries are selected to be reasonably easy to lift, leak-proof and their discharge characteristics determine how fast the cars can go. The motor and batteries are sealed and cannot be modified.\n The Goblin Kit Car is offered by as a suitable platform for primary school children aged 9–11. The rules state only this kit may be used which ensures safety for all those competing. The kit includes all parts and components required to build a complete car - except for the bodywork which is left to the creativity of the team.\n\nThe motor and battery, together with comprehensive instructions are included. Only basic hand tools are required to assemble the kit, which can be dismantled at the end of the season and reused by another group.\n\nRace days consist of many events, including that of a sprint race.\n\nThe kit is purchased from Greenpower and costs (2018) £1250.\n\n IET Formula 24 (F24) is the main racing category - 258 cars completed at least one competitive lap in 2018. It is open to 11- to 16-year-olds. Since then, the competition has grown to involve over 500 different schools, each hoping to race their way into the final at the Rockingham Motor Speedway.\n\nThe rules are built around the standard batteries and motor along with some safety-based rules. These are designed to be relatively open-ended and with room for innovation, leading to a huge variation in how the cars look. There is a kit car available to allow a simplified entry.\n\nUp to 2013, F24 races consisted of a 4-hour endurance race, and teams could use six batteries in that time (80 minutes per pair of batteries). A minimum of five drivers were required to drive for a maximum of 90 minutes each. Typical average speeds were around 20-30 mph.\n\nHowever, the rules were modified for the 2014 season to change the F24 race into a sprint style event. Teams are only allowed to use one pair of batteries per 90 minute race, with two races during the day. There must be a minimum of three drivers per race.\n\nPrices cover a wide range as different teams use different designs, materials and techniques. The highest costing car doesn't necessarily give the best results. Top cars have ranged from the price of £1200 (excluding batteries and motor) up to approximately £9000. The motor and six batteries cost a total of £404 + VAT, while the kit car is £2750 + VAT (October 2018, includes motor, batteries, team registration and entry to the first race)\n\nThe technology and attention to detail evident in a top level F24/F24+ car should not be under-estimated, equivalent energy consumption of >3000mpge is commonplace, as such they can be regarded as being the most efficient racing cars anywhere in the world by a considerable margin.\n\nStarting in 2014 an additional award has been given to the best kit car, this is unlike the main F24 championship in that the best result is taken from either of the two races per event as opposed to individual awards for each race. The inaugural kit car international championship was won by Megazord from Bristol Grammar School, with the chassis number 002 it is the first kit car ever sold.\n\nIET Formula 24+ is for young people aged 16 – 25 and is all about designing and building an electric car with technical regulations that are much the same as those for IET F24. Since 2013, the race has been incorporated with the Corporate Challenge (at some events where companies join the students racing).\n\nUp to 2013, 24+ races lasted 90 minutes while using four batteries (45 minute per pair of batteries) leading to significantly higher speeds than F24. Average speeds range from 25 mph to nearly 40 mph (depending on the car and driver). Most teams only used one driver, but some would change during the battery pit stop.\n\nThe new rules in 2014 shortened this race to 60 minutes, with each race using only one pair of batteries. A minimum of one driver is required.\n\nAny group of young people that fall into the age category can enter the Greenpower competition as a team (including units sponsored by private companies or public organizations such as primary schools and colleges, Institutes of secondary education, and also older people in youth groups, and universities etc.).\n\nThe F24 season has events held at race tracks around the UK, including Goodwood Circuit, Mallory Park and Dunsfold. The races last 90 minutes each (two in one day), and the distance completed in this time is submitted to a table of results. The car's greatest distance of the season ranks it in this table, with the top cars qualifying for the International Final, held in October.\n\nThe F24+ season consists of similar races, but a smaller number of events are held, in between the two F24 races. These races last 60 minutes, with points being awarded for position at the end of the race to the first 10 cars in the standard 1st = 25pts, 10th = 1pt system. Each cars best 2 regular season results, plus the result from the final round of the championship at the International Finals contribute to the points table.\n\nEach race sees a number of awards being presented for engineering, innovation, presentation, best new team and the \"Spirit of Greenpower\".\n\nGoblin events are run separately and each is slightly different depending on space and team numbers. At most events there are 3 tests that take place: a slalom, a drag and a sprint. The slalom is against the clock, as is the drag race. Each is completed six times which allows for a large group of students to all get the thrill of driving, with the lowest time from each team used. The sprint is a short race (typically three laps) with a few cars on track, run as heats followed by finals as necessary. Points are awarded for each test (1st place = 1 point, 2nd place = 2 points etc.). There are also awards at Goblin events and these carry negative points, helping to reduce a team's score. The lowest overall score wins the event.\n\nIn 1999, the only race held was at Goodwood Motor Circuit, and, as such, is considered the National Final, despite there having been no qualification events in that year. Greenpower regulations have changed to reduce speeds of cars over the years, meaning the 2006 final still has the greatest recorded distance and the greatest average speed of any final (and any race other than the 2006 Race of Champions).\nUntil 2006, cars could be fully enclosed, but for the 2007 season this was banned, followed by the wholesale ban on windscreens the next year, meaning all cars after this point have been fully open-cockpit. The 2006 season was also the last to feature 6 hour races.\nIn 2011, the batteries supplied were changed, with a large reduction in available energy, reducing speeds.\nIn 2014 the finals were restyled as the 'Greenpower International Finals', due to participation from teams from multiple countries, such as Silesian University of Technology.\nIn December 2014, it was announced that due to space requirements, the 2015 International Final was to be held at Rockingham.\n\nThe Patrons of Greenpower are:\n\nThe current complete list of partners is published by Greenpower.

Programs are available in the United States Army, the United States Navy, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCreated under authority of the Uniformed Services Health Professions Revitalization Act of 1972, the HPSP is the primary source of trained healthcare professionals entering the United States Armed Forces. Subject to eligibility for a commission (such as US citizenship, physical and academic qualifications, etc.), scholarship \"selectees\" are commissioned as second lieutenants in the US Army Reserve or the US Air Force Reserve, or ensigns in the US Navy Reserve. The selectees are then placed on inactive reserve status during their medical training.\n\nProspective students compete for scholarships that cover some or all of the medical school years. The Air Force offers one- to four-year scholarships, the Army offers one- to four-year scholarships and the Navy offers three to four year scholarships. While on scholarship, the financial expenses of tuition, certain academic fees, a monthly stipend, mandatory books and equipment, and a laptop rental are paid by the student's sponsoring service.\n\nAs inactive reserve officers, the students are required to serve 45 days of active duty for training (ADT) each fiscal year. While on active duty, they receive the same rights, privileges, and pay, and are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as any other active-duty officer. For the first two years of training, this duty is sometimes spent attending an officer basic course/school (Army, Navy, Air Force) or executing \"School Orders\" (participating in clinical training) at the student's university. For the 3rd and 4th years, the student will often carry out elective clinical rotations at a military hospital. Time spent in HPSP may count towards the 20 years required for a reserve retirement if the member participates in the selected reserve after separating from active duty, and is credited back on a one-for-one selected reserve / HPSP year basis. No HPSP time (active duty or not) counts towards an active duty 20-year retirement.\n\nUpon graduation, the students are promoted to the rank of captain in the Army and Air Force, or lieutenant in the Navy, and medical school graduates may be placed on active duty if matched for residency in a military or civilian hospital, while clinical psychology doctoral students have a similar arrangement for their one-year internship. In general, Army and Air Force medical residents are allowed to complete their residencies before proceeding to their first assignments, while Navy personnel complete an internship and then serve as a general medical officer (GMO), with the option of completing a residency following their GMO tour. Student must apply to military residencies and must accept these positions if they are offered. While wages for military residents are higher than for civilian, a military residency requires the student to fulfill further service obligations, which are paid back concurrently with the obligation from medical school.\n\nThe incurred service obligation is generally one-for-one for every service-paid year of schooling, with a minimum of two years for physicians and three years for other specialties. Additional time required for certain postgraduate programs, such as lengthy residencies, can result in longer service obligations. Fulfillment of the obligation begins only \"after\" postgraduate training is completed. For Navy officers, time spent as a GMO is credited towards the service obligation. However, physicians that serve time as a GMO or flight surgeon prior to residency (after internship) will incur additional commitment of one-for-one if they complete subsequent residency training. This usually results in a longer service commitment than if they entered residency directly (example: 4 year medical commitment - 3 year GMO tour + 4-year residency = 7 year total commitment versus only 4 years if residency was entered directly). It is important to note that longer initial commitments have a significant negative financial impact; medical officers may take certain multi-year bonuses (which may equal up to 40% of total pay) which will run consecutive with initial residency and certain other commitments, resulting in substantial lost income if residency commitment payback is delayed due to GMO/flight medicine tour or sponsored fellowship/residency.\n\nHPSP opportunities are not offered by the United States Marine Corps, since it receives its medical services from the U.S. Navy.\n\n"}

It provides a variety of public business seminars as well as custom executive education and coaching for all levels of management.\n\nFounded in 1956, the Institute has a full-time staff of learning design and program managers working with professors at McGill’s Faculties of Management, Law, Arts, Education and Medicine, external guest experts in specific fields, as well as visiting professors from universities worldwide. The Institute’s clientele includes businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government/public sector services.\n\nAfter establishing the first management diploma in 1906, McGill University began offering evening classes in business education in 1912. Following Canada's post World War II expansion, McGill University responded to the needs of senior executives by offering seminars in personnel management, marketing, and finance.\n\nConcurrent to business seminars offered by McGill, the Executive Development Institute, a private business education organization, began to offer the Executive Development Course (EDC) in 1949, in affiliation with the Montreal Board of Trade. It was developed with support from the Graduate School of Business at Harvard University. A precursor to the existence of many MBA and later EMBA programs, the EDC was designed to provide a comprehensive look at management practices in strategy, human resources, marketing, negotiations and financial acumen.\n\nIn 1956, the McGill Management Institute was founded to facilitate the more effective delivery of business seminars offered at McGill University. In 1973, the Executive Development Institute merged with the McGill Management Institute and, under the McGill banner, continued the facilitation of the EDC. The merger coincided with a move to its current home in the Bronfman building at McGill University on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, where it underwent a significant expansion of its offerings. By 1984, the McGill Management Institute was offering 70 day-time seminars and 20 evening courses each year, in addition to the EDC.\n\nIn 1993, the McGill Management Institute was renamed the McGill International Executive Institute. It took its current name, the McGill Executive Institute, in 2002. It is a division of the Desautels Faculty of Management.\n\nThe McGill Executive Institute has been noted for its approach to action-based learning, as well as for its international dimension. In his 2009 work, \"Executive Education in Canadian Firms\", Bruce Gordon R. Fowler states the following:\n\nEach year, the McGill Executive Institute provides approximately 20 to 40 open enrolment seminars addressing a number of business topics. The Institute’s longest running program is the Executive Development Course which was launched in 1949. The EDC has been expanded over the years, and is currently offered in three successive modules: the Executive Development Course, the Advanced Management Course, and Integrated Management Thinking. Together, these are referred to by the Institute as the Mini-MBA Series.\n\nThe McGill Executive Institute also designs and delivers customized learning solutions specifically for an organization’s team of managers or executives. Services range from short workshops delivered in English, French or bilingual formats to global initiatives with delivery of modules to participants across management levels over several years.\n\nThe McGill Executive Institute also offers an International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM), as well as the Advanced Leadership Program (ALP). These longer, global programs occur over several modules and across multiple international locations, in conjunction with other universities: The Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India; Lancaster University in the UK; Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management in Seoul, Korea; and INSEAD in France. Both the ALP and the IMPM were co-founded and are co-directed by Professor Henry Mintzberg.\n\nWell-known McGill faculty members include Professor Henry Mintzberg on advanced leadership issues and Professor Nancy Adler on organizational behavior. Recent guest speakers of note have included business leaders Daniel Lamarre, Larry Smith, Jim Cherry, Alan Allnutt, Paul Côté and Pierre Boivin.\n\nThe McGill Executive Institute partners with the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD) in Canada to deliver the Director’s Education Program. It is also a registered education provider with the Project Management Institute (PMI) and collaborates with the Canadian Corporate Counsel Association to deliver development programs for lawyers on financial literacy.\n\n"}

MQI established its centre in Norway and Denmark early in 1984. MQI has various community related projects which are supported by the Norwegian Government.\n\nOne of the main projects is the Minhaj conflict resolution or Minhaj Konfliktråd (MKR).\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran holds one of the largest annual Itikaf gatherings during the month of Ramadan with approximately 37,000 people sitting congregational Itikaf in 2007. It holds the largest Laylat ul Qadr night event on the 27th Ramadan with millions of attendees.\n\nOn 3 December 2005 Minhaj-ul-Quran established a full-time institution called \"Gosha-e-Durood\" where any individual can apply to sit for reciting salutations on Muhammad. In the last two years trillions of salutations have been recited. A building dedicated to this purpose with \"Mawlana\" Rumi style minarets is under construction.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran International is the first organisation of its kind that has initiated interfaith dialogues with religious minorities in Pakistan. Its founder is the Chairman of the 'Muslim Christian Dialogue Forum' to highlight and promote their citizen rights.\n\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has formally recognised and granted a 'Special Consultative Status' to Minhaj-ul-Quran International due to its services in promoting peace, tolerance, interfaith harmony and education, tackling extremism and terrorism, engaging with young Muslims for religious moderation, promoting women’s rights, and providing social welfare and promotion of human rights.\n\nIn September 2011, Minhaj-ul-Quran organised a major \"Peace for Humanity\" conference at Wembley Arena in London at which, under the auspices of Tahir-ul-Qadri, its 12,000 attendees announced a global declaration denouncing racism, interfaith intolerance, extremism and terrorism. Minhaj-ul-Quran strategist Joel Hayward wrote the declaration text for Qadri and was its second formal signatory after Qadri himself. Notably, senior Al-Azhar University leaders and dignitaries then signed it before Minhaj-ul-Quran opened it up via the internet for public signing. They aim to get one million signatures within a year. The London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism is intended as an interfaith document which unequivocally condemns all extremism and terrorism, ”because at the heart of all religions is a belief in the sanctity of the lives of the innocent.” The Declaration adds: “The indiscriminate nature of terrorism, which has in recent years killed far more civilians and other non-combatants than it has combatants, is un-Islamic, un-Judaic, un-Christian and it is indeed incompatible with the true teachings of all faiths.” The London Declaration also “unequivocally condemn[s] anti-Semitism (including when sometimes it is disingenuously clothed as anti-Zionism), Islamophobia (including when it is sometimes disingenuously dressed up as patriotism) and all other forms of racism and xenophobia.” Some extremists have already tried to prevent the success of the Declaration via cyber-attacks on the website hosting it.\n\nTahir-ul Qadri announced the largest March in modern times in Pakistan; a march to take place on 14th Jan 2013 at 'Tahrir Square' Islamabad. The agenda of long march is to voice elimination of feudalism, introduction of real democracy, rule of law and implementation of constitution.\n\n\n"}

Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed world.\n\n\nRelated to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered \"non-standard\" and making active use of them in the classroom. Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.\n\nA widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:\n\n\nMLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a \"two-way\" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.\n\nBased on the theories of Multilingual Education that are spelled out here, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has provided a space to the tribal children of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual Education in this approach emphasizes first language first in the child taking the socio- cultural curriculum in to classroom culture and then bridge to second language.\nIn addition to the basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian theory on education, Lev Vigostky's scaffolding and Piaget's theory of cognition is applied in the Multilingual Education. The unique thing in this approach is to involve the community in creating their own curriculum and minimise the theoretical hegemony, thereby creating a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating and sharing knowledge for the society than to limit it to the theoreticians.\nOdisha is a multilingual state having more than 40 ethnic language among the 62 scheduled tribes, along with the Modern Indian Languages like Hindi, Bengali and Telugu. To address the language- education of ethnic minorities children in schools, Odisha government started Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the Director of Multilingual Education and guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and Prof Khageswar Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual Experts, the state government started MLE programme in te tribal languages in 547 schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora, Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda and Ho. Culturally responsive curriculum and text books were prepared for class i to Class V to maintain mother tongue based multilingual education to educate the tribal children. State government appointed teachers from the same language community in the schools to teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie. The curriculum and text books were prepared by the tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups. It was initiated in 2005 and isnow running in 2250 schools with majority tribal children. This is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About 7 Asian countries have visited the MLE schools. \n\nMultilingual Education in India, The CAse For English Edited by Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra and Prof Anand Mahanand published by Viva Books, New Delhi 2016.\n\nid21 insights.

On the evening of 18 September 1992 he was walking down Memorial Drive by Hayden Library when he and his companion were attacked by three students of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School. Shon McHugh (aged 15), Joseph D. Donovan (aged 17), and Alfredo Velez (aged 18) robbed Raustein and his companion of $33, and McHugh stabbed Raustein, causing fatal injuries. MIT President Charles M. Vest issued a statement the next day. A memorial service for Raustein was held on 9 October 1992.\n\nRaustein's murder was the first of an MIT student for over a decade and sparked a Town and gown debate centering on the tension between the wealthy universities in Cambridge, MIT and Harvard University, and the poorer permanent Cambridge population. A vigil held the week after his death drew representatives from both communities. A permanent memorial award, the Yngve Raustein Award for Scholarship, Teamwork and Community, was established at MIT in 1993. Raustein has been memorialized in the Garden of Peace memorial in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMcHugh was tried as a juvenile, and was released from prison after less than 11 years. Velez testified against Donovan and was sentenced to less than 10 years in prison. Donovan was charged with felony murder and was sentenced to life without parole. Donovan (aged 33) in 2009 is appealing against his sentence of life without parole for felony murder on the grounds that, although he punched Raustein, he had no knowledge of a knife or planned robbery. Raustein's family have said that \"the life without parole sentence was way too harsh\". The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declined an appeal in 1996. In 2014 the Massachusetts Parole Board decided he should be released following six months in a rehabilitative program and one year in a lower level security prison.\n\nShon McHugh, who stabbed Raustein, spent 10 years in jail, and Alfredo Valez was released within 10 years after a plea bargain to testify against Donovan at the trial.\n\n"}

There is no military conscription in Nigeria, but since 1973 graduates of universities and later polytechnics have been required to take part in the National Youth Service Corps program for one year. This is known as national service year. Ahmadu Ali served as the first Director-General of the NYSC until 1975. The incumbent Director-General is Brig. Gen. Sule Zakari Kazaure.\n\nNYSC was created on 22 May, 1973 as an avenue for the reconciliation, reconstruction, and rebuilding of the nation after the civil war. It was established based on decree No. 24 that stated that the scheme was created \"with a view to the proper encouragement and development of common ties among the youths of Nigeria and the promotion of national unity\".\n\nCorps members (participants in the National Youth Service Scheme) are posted to states other than their state of origin where they are expected to mix with people from different ethnic groups, social and family backgrounds, and learn the culture of the indigenes in the location they are posted to. This action is aimed at bringing about unity in the country and help the youths appreciate other ethnic groups.\nThere is an \"orientation\" period of approximately three weeks spent in a military controlled \"camp\" away from family and friends. There is also a \"passing out ceremony\" at the end of the three weeks orientation camp after which corp members are posted to their Place of Primary Assignment (PPA). They are expected to work as full time staff at their PPA with exception of one working day devoted for the execution of community development service. After eleven months at their PPA, corp member are allowed a one month of vacation before their final passing out ceremony where they would be issued certificates of completion.\n\nNigerian graduates are ineligible for employment in governmental establishments (and most private establishments) until they have completed the mandatory one year service or obtained the relevant exemptions. Graduates who are exempted from the service include those above the age of thirty and those with physical disability. During the service year, Corps members have the opportunity to learn the cultures of other people.\n\nThe objectives of the National Youth Service Corps Scheme are clearly enumerated in Decree No.51 of 16th June 1993 as follows:\n\nThe program has been met with criticism from a large portion of the country and complaints from Corps members about their remuneration. Several youth carrying out the NYSC program have been killed in the regions where they were sent due to religious, ethnic or political violence. Besides the issue of security, many have questioned the continued importance of the scheme and have called for a dialogue in this regard. Many cite the fact that the program has failed to achieve any of its set objectives. They simply see it as a waste of time and a waste of Nigeria's resources. Some even argue that the program is a conduit for massive corruption, while others see it as government providing cheap labour for schools and its other agencies.\n\n"}

{"id": "51501681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51501681", "title": "Olivier Boissiere", "text": "Olivier Boissiere\n\nOlivier Boissiere (Olivier Boissière, born in 1939) is a French writer and commentator of contemporary art and architecture. His profiles, comments, features and interviews have been published in international magazines such as Domus, Abitare, L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui and Vogue Paris. Boissiere is the author of several books about the works of Jean Nouvel, Frank Gehry, Le Corbusier, Ron Arad and Philippe Starck. He has been on Jean Nouvel's team more than ten years and still serves as an advisor and consultant to different architecture projects such as the recent winning entry of the team Sou Fujimoto+Manal Rachdi for the \"Reinventer Paris\" competition.\n\nAs an assistant and neophyte of art critic Pierre Restany, Boissière witnessed the emerging of the avant-garde in the Sixties with Yves Klein, Raymond Hains, Cy Twombly, Christo and others, who held their exhibitions in Galerie J in Paris. Later his interests shifted to modern European and American architecture. He was close to the early Frank Gehry and familiar with the Californian art scene in the Seventies, privileged to encounter great artists such as Ed Ruscha, Larry Bell and Donald Judd. A close friend of Lewis Baltz, he still keeps strong bonds with the French art scene as a familiar of Sophie Calle, Jean Charles Blais, Daniel Buren, Bertrand Lavier, Olivier Mosset and Bernard Frize. A modest art collector himself, Boissiere gathers his works along some recent discoveries in his Un Cabinet d'Amateur in Sofia, devoted to Bulgarian and foreign contemporary art. He currently lives and works in Paris and Sofia.\n\nBoissiere’s introduction to the arts started from Gallerie J in Paris, where he worked as an assistant to Jeanine de Goldschmidt and art critic Pierre Restany. It was the home of the Nouveaux Réalistes - an artistic movement, founded by Restany together with Yves Klein, Arman, Raymond Hains and others. The gallery did present the first exhibition of Cy Twombly in Paris, the famous Daniel Spoerri dinners and the oil barrels of Christo on Rue Visconti. During this period Boissiere witnessed the opening of the first Ileana Sonnabend gallery in Paris, where American Pop art artists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were introduced in Europe for the first time.\n\nAfter being a partner in Atelier A, a short lived venture where artists like Arman and Robert Malaval designed objects and artefacts, Boissiere was cooped in a small institution under the French ministry of industry to take part in a program promoting French design. He did attend and reported about international design congresses in Moscow, Kyoto, Vancouver, Aspen and Berlin. Soon he was appointed an editor of Architecture Intérieure Cree Magazine, where he introduced the young lions challenging the International style who were at that time Archigram, Cedric Price, Renzo Piano, Norman Foster, the Radical architecture in Italy, the American “Post-moderns” after the provoking Learning from Las Vegas, the architectural theories of Aldo Rossi, Lucien Kroll, the works of Gordon Matta Clark.\nIn the US Olivier Boissière did multiple coast to coast trips, documenting the works of Frank Lloyd Wright or following the steps of art historian Aby Warburg, who had visited the world of the Hopis in Arizona at beginning of the century. At the eve of his journalistic career, he had encounters with Zaha Hadid, still a student of the Architectural Association, Tomas Maldonado, Buckminster Fuller, Philip Johnson, Jonas Salk and Frank Gehry. Back in Europe he was fortunate to attend the first great exhibitions by curator Harald Szeemann, the Bachelors Machines at UCAD in Paris and dokumenta V in Kassel with works by Beuys, Kienholz and Bruce Nauman.\n\nSpanning his life between Paris, Milan and Los Angeles, Olivier Boissiere became a regular culture and architecture writer for Domus, L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, Le Monde and some Condé Nast magazines such as Vogue, where he collaborated with photographer Donatella Brun. His journalistic travels ranged from accompanying Frank Gehry to the reception of his Gerit Rietweld Award in Utrecht through meeting Luis Barragán in Mexico, from paying visits to the buildings of Ralph Erskine in Stockholm to doing a series of interviews with Rem Koolhaas in the Netherlands and photographing the Norman Foster's HSBC Building just opened in Hong Kong. During this period he interviewed Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen in New York after meeting them in Utrecht and visited the studio of Ed Ruscha in Los Angeles. His encounter with great artist and photographer Lewis Baltz was the beginning of a long friendship, marked by a common interest both in art history and The Great Game. Boissiere wrote texts for some of Baltz's projects, such as Fos Secteur 80 at Tate, La Ronde de Nuit, shown at Centre Georges Pompidou and later Piazza Arnolfo in Tuscany. His first meeting with Jean Nouvel had happened during this time.\n\nThe competition for the Kansai International Airport in Japan in the late 80's did mark the beginning of an ongoing episodic collaboration with Jean Nouvel, according to projects, competitions and circumstances. Olivier Boissière acted as a researcher, commentator, advisor and publication editor on different projects in real time, which was full-time with Nouvel, the motto of his office being \"If you don’t come on Saturday, forget to come back on Sunday!\" In the intervals he worked both as author and director of the architectural collections for two publishing houses in Paris and did extensive trips in Europe and India, doing a close survey on the legacy of Le Corbusier along with Dominique Lyon and photographer Anriet Denis. The most significant ХХ century houses in Europe ranging from the Art Nouveau to the British high tech was the subject for another book. A trip to the South West Arizona and New Mexico provided for meetings with architects Antoine Predock and Bart Prince . As a guest of Donald Judd, Boissière did a large photo survey of the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas with major artworks and installations by Chamberlain, Oldenburg and Donald Judd himself.\n\nAt the beginning of 2000, Boissiere was a coordinator for Jean Nouvel's Morat site for the Expo.02 in Switzerland. Along with Federico Mazzoto he also coordinated Nouvel's project for Piazza Arnolfo in Colle d'Elsa, featuring artists Daniel Buren, Lewis Baltz, Alessandra Tesi, Bertrand Lavier. \nFollowing up Nouvel's projects for the Guggenheim Foundation, directed by Thomas Krens, he visited Baku and The Republic of Azerbaidjan, Rio de Janeiro and Oscar Niemeyer's office, and was granted private visits of the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\nSince 1997 Olivier Boissiere has been shifting between Paris and Sofia. Along with Anriet Denis he established Adob Design in Sofia - a showroom, promoting good design, which introduced for the first time in Bulgaria the furniture of the Eames, Jasper Morrison, Marc Newson, Ron Arad and Frank Gehry, the lights of Achille Castiglioni and Ingo Maurer and organized exhibitions where Gehry, Maurer and Nouvel were presented. For more than 15 years his voice has resonated as a commentator of the creative processes in Bulgaria. His ongoing commitment for sustainable architecture has been guiding a few of the young Bulgarian architects. In 2010 Olivier Boissiere has been the coordinator of the first ABITARE Talks Conference in Sofia “Do we need museums and galleries” with speakers Jean Nouvel, Italo Rota, David Cascaro and Monique Veaute. Under his proficient eye in 2011 the first Sofia Architecture Week was organized by One Magazine, where Boissiere introduced French architects like Anne Lacaton, Dominique Lyon, Frédéric Borel and Rudy Ricciotti.\n\nBeing a modest art collector himself, Olivier Boissière works closely with the emerging talents on the Bulgarian art scene, some of which he presents at his private apartment/gallery in Sofia. Un Cabinet d'Amateur, devoted to Bulgarian and foreign contemporary art, was established in 2012 and has exhibited works of Kalin Serapionov, Svetlana Mircheva, Marie Maillard, Stela Vassileva, Lewis Baltz, Jean-Charles Blais, Sophie Calle. Along with artworks, the Cabinet accommodates a small library with Boissere's personal collection of books, catalogs and documents from his longtime journey in the field. In 2015 Boissiere was an advisor to the team of architects Manal Rachdi and Sou Fujimoto in the \"Reinventer Paris\" competition. It was a winning entry for a block at Porte Maillot.\nHe is currently working on the book about Jean Nouvel's Louvre in Abu Dhabi and a second fiction novel.\n\n"}

{"id": "230025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230025", "title": "Pentagon Papers", "text": "Pentagon Papers\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, officially titled Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force, is a United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. The papers were released by Daniel Ellsberg, who had worked on the study; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of \"The New York Times\" in 1971. A 1996 article in \"The New York Times\" said that the \"Pentagon Papers\" had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration \"systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress\".\n\nMore specifically, the papers revealed that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the Vietnam War with the bombings of nearby Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which were reported in the mainstream media.\n\nFor his disclosure of the \"Pentagon Papers\", Ellsberg was initially charged with conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property, but the charges were later dismissed after prosecutors investigating the Watergate scandal discovered that the staff members in the Nixon White House had ordered the so-called White House Plumbers to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.\n\nIn June 2011, the entirety of the \"Pentagon Papers\" was declassified and publicly released.\n\nSecretary of Defense Robert McNamara created the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967, for the purpose of writing an \"encyclopedic history of the Vietnam War\". McNamara claimed that he wanted to leave a written record for historians, to prevent policy errors in future administrations. McNamara neglected to inform either President Lyndon Johnson or Secretary of State Dean Rusk about the study. One report claimed that McNamara planned to give the work to his friend Robert F. Kennedy, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. McNamara later denied this, although he admitted that he should have informed Johnson and Rusk.\n\nInstead of using existing Defense Department historians, McNamara assigned his close aide and Assistant Secretary of Defense John T. McNaughton to collect the papers. McNaughton died in a plane crash one month after work began in June 1967, but the project continued under the direction of Defense Department official Leslie H. Gelb. Thirty-six analysts—half of them active-duty military officers, the rest academics and civilian federal employees—worked on the study. The analysts largely used existing files in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In order to keep the study secret from others, including National Security Advisor Walt W. Rostow, they conducted no interviews or consultations with the armed forces, with the White House, or with other federal agencies.\n\nMcNamara left the Defense Department in February 1968, and his successor Clark M. Clifford received the finished study on January 15, 1969, five days before Richard Nixon's inauguration, although Clifford claimed he never read it. The study consisted of 3,000 pages of historical analysis and 4,000 pages of original government documents in 47 volumes, and was classified as \"Top Secret – Sensitive\". (\"Sensitive\" is not an official security designation; it meant that access to the study should be controlled.) The task force published 15 copies; the think tank RAND Corporation received two of the copies from Gelb, Morton Halperin and Paul Warnke, with access granted if at least two of the three approved.\n\nAlthough President Lyndon B. Johnson stated that the aim of the Vietnam War was to secure an \"independent, non-Communist South Vietnam\", a January 1965 memorandum by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that an underlying justification was \"not to help a friend, but to contain China\".\n\nOn November 3, 1965, McNamara sent a memorandum to President Johnson, in which he explained the \"major policy decisions with respect to our course of action in Vietnam\". The memorandum begins by disclosing the rationale behind the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965:\n\nMcNamara accused China of harboring imperial aspirations like those of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. According to McNamara, the Chinese were conspiring to \"organize all of Asia\" against the United States:\n\nTo encircle the Chinese, the United States aimed to establish \"three fronts\" as part of a \"long-run effort to contain China\":\n\nHowever, McNamara admitted that the containment of China would ultimately sacrifice a significant amount of America's time, money and lives.\n\nYears before the August 2, 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred, the U.S. government was indirectly or directly involved in Vietnam's affairs:\n\nIn a section of the \"Pentagon Papers\" titled \"Kennedy Commitments and Programs,\" America's commitment to South Vietnam was attributed to the creation of the country by the United States. As acknowledged by the papers:\n\nIn a sub-section titled \"Special American Commitment to Vietnam\", the papers emphasized once again the role played by the United States:\n\nMore specifically, the United States sent US$28.4 million worth of equipment and supplies to help the Diem regime strengthen its army. In addition, 32,000 men from South Vietnam's Civil Guard were trained by the United States at a cost of US$12.7 million. It was hoped that Diem's regime, after receiving a significant amount of U.S. assistance, would be able to withstand the Viet Cong.\n\nThe papers identified General Edward Lansdale, who served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as a \"key figure\" in the establishment of Ngo Dinh Diem as the President of South Vietnam, and the backing of Diem's regime thereafter. As written by Lansdale in a 1961 memorandum: \"We (the U.S.) must support Ngo Dinh Diem until another strong executive can replace him legally.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Pentagon Papers\", the U.S. government played a key role in the 1963 South Vietnamese coup, in which President Ngo Dinh Diem was assassinated. While maintaining \"clandestine contact\" with Vietnamese generals planning a coup, the U.S. cut off its aid to President Diem and openly supported a successor government in what the authors called an \"essentially leaderless Vietnam\":\n\nAs early as August 23, 1963, an unnamed U.S. representative had met with Vietnamese generals planning a coup against President Diem. According to \"The New York Times\", this U.S. representative was later identified to be CIA agent Lucien Conein.\n\nThe Director of Central Intelligence, John A. McCone, proposed the following categories of military action:\n\nHowever, McCone did not believe these military actions alone could lead to an escalation of the situation because the \"fear of escalation would probably restrain the Communists\". In a memorandum addressed to President Johnson on July 28, 1964, McCone explained:\n\nBarely a month after the Gulf of Tonkin incident on August 2, 1964, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy warned that further provocations should not be undertaken until October, when the government of South Vietnam (GVN) would become fully prepared for a full-scale war against North Vietnam. In a memorandum addressed to President Johnson on September 8, 1964, Bundy wrote:\n\nWhile maritime operations played a key role in the provocation of North Vietnam, U.S. military officials had initially proposed to fly a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over the country, but this was to be replaced by other plans.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg knew the leaders of the task force well. He had worked as an aide to McNaughton from 1964 to 1965, had worked on the study for several months in 1967, and Gelb and Halperin approved his access to the work at RAND in 1969. Now opposing the war, Ellsberg and his friend Anthony Russo photocopied the study in October 1969 intending to disclose it. Ellsberg approached Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, Senators William Fulbright and George McGovern, and others, but none were interested.\n\nIn February 1971, Ellsberg discussed the study with \"The New York Times\" reporter Neil Sheehan, and gave 43 of the volumes to him in March. Before publication, \"The New York Times\" sought legal advice. The paper's regular outside counsel, Lord Day & Lord, advised against publication, but in-house counsel James Goodale prevailed with his argument that the press had a First Amendment right to publish information significant to the people's understanding of their government's policy.\n\n\"The New York Times\" began publishing excerpts on June 13, 1971; the first article in the series was titled \"Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces Three Decades of Growing US Involvement\". The study was dubbed \"The Pentagon Papers\" during the resulting media publicity. Street protests, political controversy, and lawsuits followed.\n\nTo ensure the possibility of public debate about the papers' content, on June 29, US Senator Mike Gravel, an Alaska Democrat, entered 4,100 pages of the papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These portions of the papers, which were edited for Gravel by Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky, were subsequently published by Beacon Press, the publishing arm of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations. A federal grand jury was subsequently empaneled to investigate possible violations of federal law in the release of the report. Leonard Rodberg, a Gravel aide, was subpoenaed to testify about his role in obtaining and arranging for publication of the \"Pentagon Papers\". Gravel asked the court (in \"Gravel v. United States\") to quash the subpoena on the basis of the Speech or Debate Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the United States Constitution.\n\nThat clause provides that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, [a Senator or Representative] shall not be questioned in any other Place\", meaning that Gravel could not be prosecuted for anything said on the Senate floor, and, by extension, for anything entered to the \"Congressional Record\", allowing the papers to be publicly read without threat of a treason trial and conviction. When Gravel's request was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court denied the request to extend this protection to Gravel or his legislative aide, Leonard Rodberg, because the grand jury subpoena served on them related to a third party rather than any act they themselves committed for the preparation of materials later entered into the Congressional Record. Nevertheless, the grand jury investigation was halted, and the publication of the papers was never prosecuted.\n\nLater, Ellsberg said the documents \"demonstrated unconstitutional behavior by a succession of presidents, the violation of their oath and the violation of the oath of every one of their subordinates.\" He added that he leaked the Papers to end what he perceived to be \"a wrongful war.\"\n\nPresident Nixon at first planned to do nothing about publication of the study since it embarrassed the Johnson and Kennedy administrations rather than his. But Henry Kissinger convinced the president that not opposing the publication set a negative precedent for future secrets. The administration argued Ellsberg and Russo were guilty of a felony under the Espionage Act of 1917, because they had no authority to publish classified documents. After failing to persuade \"The New York Times\" to voluntarily cease publication on June 14, Attorney General John N. Mitchell and Nixon obtained a federal court injunction forcing \"The New York Times\" to cease publication after three articles. \"The New York Times\" publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger said:\n\nThe newspaper appealed the injunction, and the case \"New York Times Co. v. United States\" (403 U.S. 713) quickly rose through the U.S. legal system to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn June 18, 1971, \"The Washington Post\" began publishing its own series of articles based upon the \"Pentagon Papers\"; Ellsberg had given portions to \"The Washington Post\" reporter Ben Bagdikian. Bagdikian brought the information to editor Ben Bradlee. That day, Assistant U.S. Attorney General William Rehnquist asked \"The Washington Post\" to cease publication. After the paper refused, Rehnquist sought an injunction in U.S. district court. Judge Murray Gurfein declined to issue such an injunction, writing that \"[t]he security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone. Security also lies in the value of our free institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know.\" The government appealed that decision, and on June 26 the Supreme Court agreed to hear it jointly with \"The New York Times\" case. Fifteen other newspapers received copies of the study and began publishing it.\n\nOn June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court decided, 6–3, that the government failed to meet the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint injunction. The nine justices wrote nine opinions disagreeing on significant, substantive matters.\n\nThomas Tedford and Dale Herbeck summarized the reaction of editors and journalists at the time:\n\nEllsberg surrendered to authorities in Boston, and admitted that he had given the papers to the press: \"I felt that as an American citizen, as a responsible citizen, I could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the American public. I did this clearly at my own jeopardy and I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision\". He was indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of stealing and holding secret documents. Federal District Judge William Matthew Byrne, Jr. declared a mistrial and dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973, after it was revealed that: agents acting on the orders of the Nixon administration illegally broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist and attempted to steal files; representatives of the Nixon administration approached the Ellsberg trial judge with an offer of the job of FBI directorship; several irregularities appeared in the government's case including its claim that it had lost records of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg conducted by the White House Plumbers in the contemporaneous Watergate scandal. Byrne ruled: \"The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case.\" Ellsberg and Russo were freed due to the mistrial; they were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act.\n\nIn March 1972, political scientist Samuel L. Popkin, then assistant professor of Government at Harvard University, was jailed for a week for his refusal to answer questions before a grand jury investigating the Pentagon Papers case, during a hearing before the Boston Federal District Court. The Faculty Council later passed a resolution condemning the government's interrogation of scholars on the grounds that \"an unlimited right of grand juries to ask any question and to expose a witness to citations for contempt could easily threaten scholarly research\".\n\nGelb estimated that \"The New York Times\" only published about five percent of the study's 7,000 pages. The Beacon Press edition was also incomplete. Halperin, who had originally classified the study as secret, obtained most of the unpublished portions under the Freedom of Information Act and the University of Texas published them in 1983. The National Security Archive published the remaining portions in 2002. The study itself remained formally classified until 2011.\n\nThe \"Pentagon Papers\" revealed that the United States had expanded its war with the bombing of Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which had been reported by the American media. The most damaging revelations in the papers revealed that four administrations (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson), had misled the public regarding their intentions. For example, the Eisenhower administration actively worked against the Geneva Accords. The John F. Kennedy administration knew of plans to overthrow South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem before his death in a November 1963 coup. President Johnson had decided to expand the war while promising \"we seek no wider war\" during his 1964 presidential campaign, including plans to bomb North Vietnam well before the 1964 Election. President Johnson had been outspoken against doing so during the election and claimed that his opponent Barry Goldwater was the one that wanted to bomb North Vietnam.\n\nIn another example, a memo from the Defense Department under the Johnson Administration listed the reasons for American persistence:\n\nAnother controversy was that President Johnson sent combat troops to Vietnam by July 17, 1965, before pretending to consult his advisors on July 21–27, per the cable stating that \"Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance informs McNamara that President had approved 34 Battalion Plan and will try to push through reserve call-up.\"\n\nIn 1988, when that cable was declassified, it revealed \"there was a continuing uncertainty as to [Johnson's] final decision, which would have to await Secretary McNamara's recommendation and the views of Congressional leaders, particularly the views of Senator [Richard] Russell.\"\n\nNixon's Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold later called the \"Pentagon Papers\" an example of \"massive overclassification\" with \"no trace of a threat to the national security.\" The \"Pentagon Papers\"' publication had little or no effect on the ongoing war because they dealt with documents written years before publication.\n\nAfter the release of the \"Pentagon Papers\", Goldwater said:\n\nSenator Birch Bayh, who thought the publishing of the \"Pentagon Papers\" was justified, said:\n\nOn May 4, 2011, the National Archives and Records Administration announced that the papers would be declassified and released to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, on June 13, 2011. The release date included the Nixon, Kennedy, and Johnson Libraries and the Archives office in College Park, Maryland.\n\nThe full release was coordinated by the Archives's National Declassification Center (NDC) as a special project to mark the anniversary of the report. The NDC worked with the agencies having classification control over the material to prevent the redaction of the last 11 words of the \"Pentagon Papers\" that would not have been made available. It is unknown which 11 words were at issue.\n\nThe Archives released each volume of the \"Pentagon Papers\" as a separate PDF file, available on their website.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46234126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46234126", "title": "Planet Coaster", "text": "Planet Coaster\n\nPlanet Coaster is a construction and management simulation video game developed and published by Frontier Developments for Microsoft Windows. It was released worldwide on 17 November 2016. Frontier had previously worked in the amusement park construction and management genre with \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\" (to which \"Planet Coaster\" is a spiritual successor), \"Thrillville\", \"\", and \"Zoo Tycoon\".\n\nThere are three different modes in the game, namely Sandbox, Challenge, and Career. In the career mode, players assume the role of a theme park manager, and must complete tasks such as constructing unfinished roller coasters or hiring janitors. In Sandbox mode, players are tasked to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. The challenge mode is similar to the sandbox mode, but with added difficulty, as players need to take funds into account.\n\nOriginally called \"Coaster Park Tycoon\", the game was revealed on 29 January 2015 and was renamed during E3 2015. \"Planet Coaster\" is Frontier's second self-published franchise, following \"\". Frontier organized multiple alpha and beta testings before launching in November 2016. The game was supported with free post-release downloadable content upon launch. The title received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's sandbox mode and creation tools. Criticisms were mainly directed to the game's career mode. It was a commercial success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in its first month of release.\n\n\"Planet Coaster\" is a construction and management simulation video game. Similar to its spiritual predecessor, the game allows players to build different theme park rides and roller-coasters. These player-created attractions can be shared through a mechanic called \"global village\". The game also comes with ten mascots.\n\nBefore starting the game, the player must create their own avatar. Afterwards, the player is able to choose between three game modes: sandbox, challenge, and career.\n\nSimilar to Frontier's previous game, \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\", the Sandbox Mode enables players to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. In Sandbox Mode, all features and rides of the game are unlocked and your funds are unlimited. This is the mode most players use to create items (parks, coasters, scenery, etc.) and then post them to Steam's Planet Coaster Workshop.\n\nIn the Challenge Mode, the player must construct an amusement park on an empty lot (similar to Sandbox Mode) but with limited funds and research depending on chosen difficulty—Easy, Medium, or Hard. As the player develops their park, the game presents the player with challenges that the player must accept or decline. Upon completion of a challenge, the player is given a reward such as a park rating boost or a sum of money.\n\nIn the Career Mode, the player must complete objectives such as constructing roller coasters, achieving park ratings or hiring janitors. Similar to Frontier's previous game, \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\", Career Mode allows players to progress by completing scenarios with objectives in different difficulties.\n\nFirst unveiled at EGX 2016, the game also features a dedicated mode called the \"crash mode\" which allows players to construct incomplete coasters and let them crash into the park's visitors.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Frontier revealed the existence of several cheat codes that were previously undiscovered on their official forums. These included the ability to ride go-karts and the ability for security guards to plough through guests similarly to a bulldozer.\n\nBefore the development of \"Planet Coaster\", Frontier Developments had developed several other construction and management simulation video games, including 2004's commercial and critical success \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\", which sold over 10 million copies. \"Planet Coaster\" serves only as a spiritual successor to \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\" instead of a direct sequel, as the company considered the use of the brand \"Tycoon\" \"didn’t carry the cachet anymore\" due to the releases of mainly poorly-received \"Tycoon\" games in recent years. In a December 2016 interview with Cambridge News, David Walsh (the Chief Operating Officer of Frontier Developments) said that the success of \"\"\nenabled the company \"to bring Planet Coaster to the market, which is highly significant as it demonstrates we are not a single game company”. Frontier Developments spent £6 million on the game's development and an additional £1.5 million on marketing.\n\nThe game was announced on 29 January 2015 by Frontier Developments. Originally called \"Coaster Park Tycoon\", the game was renamed into \"Planet Coaster\" on 16 June 2015 during the PC Gaming Show at E3 2015. Frontier Developments aimed to turn the game into the company's second self-published franchise, along with the \"\" series. The game uses an advanced version of Cobra Engine, which is an in-house proprietary engine developed by Frontier previously used by games like \"Elite Dangerous\" and \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\". Features confirmed for the game include a hybrid spline/piece-by-piece coaster builder, modular structure building, a voxel terrain editor among others detailed through Q&A's and \"Dev Diaries.\" On the second live stream, the release date of the alpha was announced. Released on 22 March 2016, the alpha emphasized on modular building and paths. The alpha contained two themes: \"Planet Coaster\" and \"Pirate\". Although disabled by default, Coaster Building was included in the first alpha through a cheat code.\n\nOn 24 May 2016, Frontier released the second alpha build. This build included finances, terrain tools, improved path building, and the official release of a coaster builder. Also, on 25 August, Frontier discontinued further alpha purchases. On 24 September, Frontier announced at EGX 2016 that players who had pre-ordered the \"Thrillseeker Edition\" would be able to test the game that October. At Gamescom 2016, Frontier announced that the game would be released on 17 November 2016. The game was released with Denuvo's anti-tamper technology.\n\nTo record the audio for the game, sound designer Watson Wu took over the Holiday World & Splashin' Safari theme park in Santa Claus, Indiana to record the sounds of various attractions. Guests in the park and park staff speak their own fictional language, known as \"Planco\". According to James Stant, Frontier's senior audio designer, the language contains about 7,000 words. After the game's release, Frontier Developments released an official Planco dictionary.\n\n\"Planet Coaster\" features a dynamic soundtrack composed by Jim Guthrie and JJ Ipsen, released under the album titled \"You, Me & Gravity: The Music of Planet Coaster\". Additionally, players may upload their own sound files to use in their parks.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, Frontier launched paid DLC for the game featuring props inspired by \"Back to the Future\", \"Knight Rider\", and \"The Munsters\".\n\nIn August 2017, Frontier partnered with the Cedar Point amusement park to provide an in-game version of the park's upcoming Steel Vengeance roller coaster before the ride officially opened in 2018.\n\nOn 21 September 2018, Frontier announced the \"Thememaker's Toolkit\". This toolkit will enable players to export custom 3D models into Planet Coaster itself. This will be released on the 20th of November.\n\nThe game was met with praise upon release of the alpha. Andy Kelly of \"PC Gamer\" commented that Frontier was \"off to a tremendous start\", adding that creating buildings with the creation tools hinted at \"immense possibilities\". However, Mark Walton of \"Ars Technica\" noted several small flaws including the \"hard to navigate\" menus and the lack of custom built roller coasters. On 27 April 2016, about a month after the release of the alpha, Frontier announced that \"Planet Coaster\" had grossed nearly two million dollars.\n\nMatt Wales of \"Eurogamer\" recommended the game, concluding that the game is \"the finest simulator yet\". Meanwhile, Ben Reeves of \"Game Informer\" praised the game for its creative mode but criticized the game's career mode, referring it to as \"boring\" and \"tedious\". TJ Hafer of \"IGN\" compared the game's integration of Steam Workshop to \"Minecraft\" and \"Second Life\". Edmond Tran of \"GameSpot\" praised the game for its accessible creative tools and for its evocative tone. Jonathan Leack of Game Revolution claimed that the game \"resurrected the [theme park simulation] genre\". In a critical review of the game, Jody Macgregor of \"PC Gamer\" praised the game's challenge mode but criticized the game for not innovating enough from \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\". The original score (70/100) was retracted due to miscommunication between Frontier Developments and \"PC Gamer\" with the game version they received; its reevaluated score is 75/100. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid noted that the game suffers frame rate issues in larger parks. Furthermore, \"Edge\" noted that the game's \"fiddly\" camera makes some actions harder.\n\nUpon release, the game topped the Steam \"top sellers\" charts. The game sold over 400,000 copies in the first month of its release. Despite being released later in the year, \"Planet Coaster\" was featured on Steam's \"Top 100 Best Sellers of 2016\" chart as a \"silver tier\" title. In August 2017, the game has sold over one million copies. In July 2018, a leak in Valve’s API revealed that over 1.68 million Steam users owned Planet Coaster.\n\n"}
{"id": "42380964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42380964", "title": "Planned Obsolescence (book)", "text": "Planned Obsolescence (book)\n\nPlanned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy is a book by Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Director of Scholarly Communication at the Modern Language Association and Visiting Research Professor of English at New York University, published by NYU Press on November 1, 2011. The book provides an overview of issues facing contemporary academic publishing, including the closing of academic presses and the increased pressure on faculty to publish to achieve tenure. Fitzpatrick's central argument is that academia should embrace the possibilities of digital publishing, which will in turn change the culture of academic writing and publishing.\n\nThe book is divided into five chapters, not including the introduction and conclusion: Peer Review, Authorship, Texts, Preservation, and The University.\n\nFitzpatrick starts the book by deconstructing one of the most important steps in the academic publication process - peer review. Drawing on a wide-ranging history of and problems in the process of academic peer review, she argues that much of the peer review process is about credentialing rather than about encouraging good ideas. Digital technologies allow for a review process that is more in-line with promoting good ideas: \"putting them on the digital table, welcoming diverse attitudes toward them, selecting, shaping and reconfiguring them “curatorially” in imaginative response to freely offered and serious opinions\". Keeping this in mind, Fitzpatrick offers a new model for peer review - 'peer-to-peer review'. She uses MediaCommons as an example of a community-filtered web platform that can function as a site to comment on a draft of scholarly work. On such an online platform, authors can post a draft manuscript and invite comments from their peers or the public, or both. \"Planned Obsolescence\" itself was posted on MediaCommons Press as a draft and comments were invited from the general public.\n\nWith digital publishing, Fiztpatrick envisions a shift in the accepted conception of authorship from a solitary enterprise with a definite endpoint in the creation of the text to one of writing within a community as part of an ongoing process. This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, process-oriented work taking place in a community of interested readers.\n\nAnother aspect of community or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores is related to remix culture. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating ways. To be viable, this would require institutional acknowledgement that this kind of work is as valuable as the traditional scholarly monograph, and also the participation of the scholarly community in a gift economy with their work. She suggests that scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.\n\nFitzpatrick acknowledges that online writing, and particularly the use of platforms that enable reader comments, will require authors to develop a different relationship to their work. They must be committed to supporting online discussions without dominating them, and they must accept that this will increase the amount of time that they must invest in their writing, both because online discussions require regular participation and because their duration is indeterminate.\n\nFor Fitzpatrick, blogs, hypertext, and databases suggest directions in which digital scholarly publishing might move. She sees early attempts at hypertext writing as ultimately about the thought process of the author rather than the reader, but locates a possible future in the use of databases as platforms to create works by pulling together writing and media elements to create “new forms of networked arguments driven by the juxtaposition of digital objects and their analysis.” Such texts might be multimodal, Fitzpatrick’s term for texts that do not simply include media objects but instead incorporate media into their analysis or use media as analysis.\n\nFitzpatrick continues to develop her ideas of the importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and our social practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with digital preservation are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points out that this is not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means permanent and digital text is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves. Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that digital preservation efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as part of the process of their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”.\n\nIn addition to community cooperation and coordination, Fitzpatrick shows that the incorporation of open standards and built-in extensibility are crucial to the development of successful digital text preservation practices. Included in these practices are three key components: the development of standards for text markup, so that digital texts can be read across a variety of platforms; the inclusion of rich metadata, so that digital texts can be located reliably; and the preservation of access to digital texts themselves. To support her argument for social solutions, Fitzpatrick examines several successful projects concerned with the development of text markup, metadata, and access standards and practices (including TEI, DOI, and LOCKSS) and shows that each is based in the creation of a community organization that values openness and extensibility.\n\nAt the heart of scholarly text production, preservation, and dissemination lies the university. In a time of unfavorable economic conditions, Fitzpatrick suggests that the university may continue to fulfill its role in these endeavors only by rethinking its mission and repurposing its operational units. While the university press may have originally functioned to disseminate the work of an institution’s faculty to the larger community, in recent years, the university press has become a market-driven entity that is separate from the academic core of the university. Though university presses typically do not turn a profit and must depend on university subsidies to operate, they are often expected to be financially self-sustaining and, driven by this expectation, function to fulfill a mission much different from that of the university. Fitzpatrick attributes the recent trend of shuttering university presses to shrinking university budgets and the unsustainable business models in which many presses are forced to operate.\n\nFor Fitzpatrick, the key to establishing financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, in addition to the production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.\n\nFollowing this restructuring, Fitzpatrick suggests that the mission of the university may be further strengthened by creating new partnerships and modes of operation between the university library, the IT department, and the university press. As argued throughout the book, scholarly publishing in its current as well as future forms stands to benefit from various forms of cooperation and each of these units may contribute something unique to enhance the production of scholarly work. These new interactions may lead to roles for the library, the press, and IT as service units that provide guidance during and add value to the scholarly production process.\n\nLastly, Fitzpatrick suggests that these shifting locations and roles of the university press may remove the financial concerns previously restricting their abilities to experiment with new modes of publishing, perhaps allowing presses to explore alternative, more sustainable and open publishing models, including open access publishing.\n\nTwo years before publication \"Planned Obsolescence\" was openly peer-reviewed online at MediaCommons Press. The manuscript is still available for open discussion on the website. Putting up a draft manuscript of the book up for open public review and debate allowed Fitzpatrick to demonstrate one of the key points of the book - that scholars have a lot to gain from openly sharing their work on digital platforms, and that open debates should become a part of the publishing process itself.\n\n\"Planned Obsolescence\" has been reviewed or discussed in a number of publications by a range of writers.\n\nCritics have written positively on Fitzpatrick's treatment of authorship. Houman Barekat in the Los Angeles Review of Books described Fitzpatrick's reluctance to understand authorship as an effect of technologies and processes of production as \"a sobering antidote to the vulgar technological determinism that characterizes so much of the hype around the digital revolution.\" Alex Halavais notes that Fitzpatrick \"masterfully\" threads history, questions, and practical implications of technologies for writers, while neither ignoring nor relying too heavily on the theoretical concept of \"the death of the author\".\n\nFitzpatrick's exploration of academic peer review has received less favorable criticism. In particular, her critique of the traditional mores of academic publication, whereby texts are first reviewed by colleagues and only published if they meet certain criteria, lacks clear \"requirements for a proposed alternative system\". Fitzpatrick's outline of post-publication peer review, the suggested alternative to pre-publication peer review, has been met with mixed appraisal: One reviewer deemed her proposal \"riddled with flaws\", while another reviewer commended the public scholarship potential of such an open method.\n\n\"Planned Obsolescence\" has also been listed as required reading for courses on the digital humanities, new media, and/or interactive technology and pedagogy in institutions such as the University of Maryland, Emory University, the CUNY Graduate Center, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1946, operating jointly with the Yerevan State Institute of Theatre and Cinematography, the Fine Arts Academy had become independent since 1994.\n\nThe academy is located on 36 Isahakyan street of the central Kentron District of Yerevan.\n\nThe rector of the academy is Professor Aram Issabekyan.\n\nRenowned sculptor Ara Sargsian and the father of Armenian fine arts Martiros Saryan made several trips to Moscow for negotiations with the committee leaders to get permission. Finally, in the spring of 1944 a permission by the USSR relevant committee to open Fine Arts Institute was granted, which was approved in July 1945 by a decree of the Armenian Central Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars.\nFirst entrance exams were held in the summer of 1945. The sculptor Ara Sargsian was appointed the first rector of the Institute. \nTwo departments were opened from the outset: painting and sculpture with Martiros Saryan and Ara Sargsian as the deans of each. The two departments included chairs of painting, drawing, printmaking, theory and history of fine arts, which were founded and headed by Gabriel Gyurjyan, Ara Sargsian, Hakob Kojoyan, Vramshapuh Shakaryan and Yeghishe Martikyan. They were assisted by both acclaimed masters and young artists, among them Suren Stepanyan, Aharon Khudaverdyan, Ararat Gharibyan, Ruben Drambyan, Grigor Aharonyan, Eduard Isabekyan, Ara Bekaryan, Mher Abeghyan, Arpenik Nalbandyan, Vahan Harutyunyan, Karapet Metsaturyan, Eda Abrahamyan and Tereza Mirzoyan.\nIn 1952 Theatre and Fine Arts Institutes were merged and moved to a former school building in Isahakyan Street by decree of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. \nThe new Institute of Fine Arts and Theatre reorganized into two departments: fine arts and theatre arts each with its subdivisions. \nThe opening of ceramics department in 1955 was a major achievement in 50s and 60s. Famous decorative-applied arts master Hripsime Simonyan was the founding head of the department. Participation in the graduate exhibition of the Soviet Union Republic art universities held in Moscow (1956), the opening of the department of textile and tapestry, folk art and traditional crafts (1961), as well as the establishment of a new chair of design (1963) marked the series of important events of the period. Chief painter of Yerevan Opera and Ballet Theatre Ashot Mirzoyan became the first Head of the Chair.\nIn 1994 Fine Arts and Theatre Institutes split up. Fine Arts Institute remained in the old building in Isahakyan Street. Aram Issabekyan was appointed as the rector of the new institute. \nIn 1997 a new building next to the main one was acquired through great efforts. Dilapidated building was repaired and given to the Department of Design and Decorative-Applied Arts.\nThe branch of Fine Arts Institute opened in Gyumri in 1997 and in Dilijan in 1999.\nAs an encouragement to the institute’s research activity and promotion of its students’ potential, Fine Arts Institute launched post-graduate studies in 1999. \nIn 2000 after long and persistent efforts of Aram Issabekyan and by decree of the RA Government, Fine Arts Institute was renamed into Yerevan State Fine Arts Academy and entered a new development phase through the Bologna Process.\nOpening of the Albert and Tove Boyajian Exhibition Hall in 2001 next to the institute building marked another important step to promote artistic life of the Institute (Irina Isabekyan - Head of “Alber and Tove Boyadjian” Exhibition-Hall).\nScientific research is very important for any university. It enables professors to combine pedagogical skills with science activity. The result of the research is the Collection of Scientific Articles issued since 1971, which was reissued in 2004 as a Yearbook. Other than that, in 2013 a Fine Arts Academy Yearbook: Art Historical and Humanitarian Researches was published in a new format and layout.\n\nIn 2017 Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts was renamed into State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia.\n\nThe Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts is a three-tier system that offers bachelor, master and researcher programmes with four, two and three-years courses respectively.\n\nThe academy has 2 faculties: the Faculty of Fine Arts, and the Faculty of Design and Decorative Applied Arts.\n\nCurrently, the following bachelor and master programmes are the offered by the academy:\n\nConcerned with psychological recovery, creation of job opportunities for young people and as an encouragement of the population in the disaster area in 1988, the branch of Fine Arts Institute opened in Gyumri in 1997. It has five chairs: Painting, Sculpture and Decorative-applied Arts, Printmaking, Outfit Modeling, Arts and Humanities\nThe second branch opened in Dilijan in 1999, which aimed at promoting the arts and crafts typical of the region. The main focus of studies is carpet weaving, ornamental art, stylized textiles and outfit modeling.\n\nAlongside its branches, the Academy adopted the cycles of higher education since the year 2004-2005 (YSAFA has moved onto a three-tier system that offers bachelor, master and researcher programmes (four, two and three years respectively)). Educational programs were sufficiently upgraded aimed at the development of students’ analytical and critical skills, as well as encouragement of independent research. The system of credits was introduced; international collaboration of universities was launched and developed.\n\n\n\n\nYSAFA Student Council is a self-governed body, an elective representative structure aimed at uniting students and protecting their interests. It is designed to ensure the processes of student autonomy and self-government, to contribute to students’ social, cultural, scientific, creative, intellectual, moral and spiritual development.\nAs a student self-governed body it was formed in September, 1993.\nStudent Council has so far been presided by Emin Petrosyan, Arman Tsaturyan, Hayk Martirosyan (2005-2007), Gevorg Soghomonyan (2007-2009), Margarita Sirekanyan (2009-2012).

David (born 1951) is Professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University. He specializes in international politics and security issues.\n\nDavid earned his B.A. in political science from Union College in 1972. In 1975, he completed his M.A. in East Asian studies from Stanford University, and in 1977 received an M.A. from Harvard University in political science. In 1980, David earned his Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University. He was a post-doctoral fellow in Harvard's National Security Program for the following year.\n\nIn 1981, David came to Johns Hopkins University as an Assistant Professor of political science. In 1987 he became as Associate Professor, and became a full professor in 1991. From 1983–2007, David was director of the International Studies Program at JHU; he held the Chair of JHU's Political Science Department. From 1998–2003, Steven David was Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and from 2003–04 he served as Special Assistant to the Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 2005, David became the Vice Dean for Centers and Programs at JHU, providing oversight for ten centers and programs, and in 2007 he became the director of Jewish Studies at JHU. David served in that role until 2010, when he was named Vice Dean for Undergraduate Education at JHU.\n\nDavid's areas of expertise include: International Relations with emphasis on theories of alignment, defining American interests, and third world politics; International Security with emphasis on third world security issues and low intensity conflict; Comparative Government with emphasis on the Middle East and the People’s Republic of China; and American Government with emphasis on foreign policy. Regarding targeted killing, David said: \"For a region going through a horrendous time, targeted killing is the worst possible policy–except for all the others.\"\n\nDavid is regarded as an effective, enthusiastic Professor. In 1989, David became the first member of the Johns Hopkins faculty to receive the George E. Owen teaching award twice. He won the award for a third time in 1998. In an interview with a University newspaper following his receipt of the award, David said, \"I like the students...Someone once asked me, 'Do you want to spend your life with 18- to 22-year-olds?' and I kinda do. They're enthusiastic, they're fun and they're open-minded. I like that.\"\n\nCatastrophic Consequences: Civil Wars and American Interests\n\n\"In the post-Cold War world, war between states has been extraordinarily rare, but civil war and armed conflict within states has been widespread. Indeed, in the last two decades, fully one-third of all countries have endured some form of civil conflict. In this sobering study, David argues that domestic upheaval and state collapse are replacing rising states and great-power rivalry as the chief threats to U.S. interests and global security. In one sense, this book offers an eloquent statement of a widely shared view—namely, that in the age of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, it is the weakness of states, rather than their strength, that is most threatening. What is distinctive about David's book is its focus on four critical states—China, Mexico, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia—in which civil war or political upheaval could \"unleash catastrophic harms that transform global politics and endanger vital American interests.\" In each case, David sketches a portrait of regime breakdown and ensuing chaos. Blazing oil fields, loose nuclear weapons, refugee floods, and great-power collapse are catastrophes that could upend global stability and bring peddlers of violence to the United States' doorstep. Provocatively, David argues that spreading democracy or intervening to build better states are not good options. Rather, civil war must be seen as a problem akin to natural disasters: you assume disasters will occur and prepare for the worst. \"\n\n-Professor G. John Ikenberry, Princeton University\n\n\"Foreign Affairs\", May/June 2009\n\nChoosing Sides: Alignment and Realignment in the Third World\n\n\"A book that seeks to explain why third world leaders change alignment between the USA and the USSR may well seem redundant in the post-Cold War world. In fact, this welcome and stimulating study remains highly relevant to the analysis of third world foreign policies. David's central argument is that alliance decisions must be considered in relation, not merely to a classical 'balance of power' theory concerned only with national security, but rather to the overall balance of political forces with which the leader has to contend, including domestic threats which are often more important than external ones. Given this perspective, which he awkwardly entitles 'omnibalancing', David concludes that changes in alliance can generally be explained as a rational response to the ruler's personal security needs. Though much of the argument is slanted to appeal to US policymakers operating in a bipolar framework, this theme remains as relevant as ever, and could equally be applied to third world states' reactions to IMF structural adjustment policies or demands for democratization. The case studies, taken from northeast Africa in the 1970s, are also convincingly handled.\"\n\n-Professor Christopher Clapham, Professor of Politics and International Relations, Lancaster University\n\n\"Political Studies\", June 1994\n\nThird World Coups d'État and International Security\n\n\"Coups provide a cheap and inviting means to promote external interests in Third World states, where foreign policy-making is generally the preserve of a small governing elite which is sometimes easy to topple. So cheap they are, indeed, that this means is available not only to the major powers but even to a tiny state like Libya, which would be quite unable to exercise similar influence through conventional military methods. Since all this is obvious enough, and external involvement in coups is frequently alleged, it is surprising that no one has apparently thought to look in any systematic way at the international factor in Third World coups. This is a gap which Steven David has now filled.\nOne of the problems, of course, is data. David wisely confines himself to cases where there is reasonably firm public evidence of external involvement. On this basis, out of a total of 183 successful and 174 attempted coups between 1945 and 1985 he identifies a significant foreign role in backing twenty-four and suppressing fourteen – a total of just over 10 per cent. This is a minimum figure, but the overwhelming majority of coups are evidently internal affairs – though even so they may have significant foreign policy implications. The ‘external’ coups nonetheless include some important cases, such as the Anglo-American-orchestrated overthrow of Mossadeq in Iran in 1953 or the US involvement in the Brazilian coup of 1964. One finding that may well be due to the availability of data is that nine coups have been backed by the United States, Britain, and France and only two by the Soviet Union, the remaining thirteen cases involving mercenaries, or other Third World states. Surprisingly, the most recent coup for which David can find good evidence of US involvement is Cambodia in 1970, and he shows convincingly (by a comparison of Iran in 1953 and 1979, and of Guatemala in 1954 with Sandinista Nicaragua) that US capacity to promote coups has significantly declined. Nor has the United States been notably successful in protecting its allies against coups, though it has been better at deterring right-wing than left-wing ones. The Soviet Union has only been able to foment coups in states where it already has a strong presence, but has been extremely effecting in protecting its allies, at any rate against anti-Soviet coups. No Third World state with a Soviet-style vanguard party has yet been overthrown by a right-wing coup, though states with regimes which already lean towards the Soviet Union of Marxism–Leninism may be subject to coup attempts intended to put a move reliably pro-Soviet regime in power.\nWorkmanlike rather than outstanding, this study also exemplifies the most exclusive concern of American academics with subjects of interest to US policy-makers. Three of the six chapters are explicitly about the American role, one is about the Soviet Union, and even the other two are couched on the whole in East-West terms. The role of the Third World states in destabilizing their neighbours is largely neglected. But within these limits the book is fair and well presented, and a useful contribution to the literature.\"\n\n-Professor Christopher Clapham, Professor of Politics and International Relations, Lancaster University\n\n\"International Affairs\", 1987\n\nDavid, Steven. “Explaining Third World Alignment.” World Politics 43, no. 2 (1991). www.jstor.org/stable/2010472.\n\n"}

ASPnet schools conduct their own projects, often linking with schools from other countries, or may become involved in a UNESCO-coordinated activity, such as the \"World Heritage in Young Hands\" project. A national coordinator, typically housed at the National Commission, serves as the liaison between the schools and UNESCO.\n\nIn 2014-2015, the American International School in Dubai carried out the project “I have the right to...?” that promoted human rights and freedom of expression. The ASPnet school developed an action plan to raise students’ awareness of their rights in relation to learning, health care and expressing their opinions.\n\nSinging together to make a difference – an inspiration for 53 students from the UNESCO ASPnet school Atheneum Koekelberg in Brussels, Belgium to found a choir and participate in the international project “Thousand voices for peace”. “Thousand voices for peace” brought together 39 choirs from 18 countries for a series of concerts in Belgium in November 2014 in commemoration of World War I. One hundred years ago, their countries were confronting each other in World War I. Now, more than 1,000 professional and non-professional singers were standing side by side to raise their voices for peace.\n\nInspired by a workshop with the Thousand voices for peace project manager Anthony Heidweiller and Brussels Philharmonic first cellist Luc Tooten, 53 ASPnet students started their own choir “Colom” (dove in Catalan) in spring 2014. Singing can make a real difference, they discovered, when discussing how the Baltic states regained their independence through the 1989 Singing Revolution. Even though they had never sung or listened to classical music before, the diverse group of young students from Brussels set out to prepare their participation in the international project.\n\nFrom 3 to 9 November 2014, the young singers mingled with the Estonian choir Voces Musicales. A week of exchange and singing together culminated in a common concert. All 1,300 participating singers, accompanied by the Brussels Philharmonic, joined in an inspired plea for peace in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Koekelberg Basilica) in Brussels.\n\nSchools from London, the United Kingdom and Algarve, Portugal used school radio broadcasting as a means to promote global citizenship. Two new radio programmes in Lagos school clusters were set up during the project, Radio Naus and Radio Tecnodantas FM. The “school radio for learning” project was designed to support teachers in developing the necessary ICT skills and methodologies to undertake broadcasting activities with their students. Students and teachers focused on producing content on peace and global citizenship education for their school radio. As part of the project, schools from both regions celebrated World Radio Day on 13 February. Teachers networked and exchanged good practices at joint conferences. The Aculco Radio of London (Ambassadors for Peace), and the Dr Rui Grácio Teacher Training Centre of Lagos (UNESCO Associated School) provided training for the schools’ teachers.\n\nEcological projects created by students from Colegio Carol Baur in Mexico City aim to offer sustainable solutions to the problems the world faces today. Starting in kindergarten, children actively discover the joys of learning and knowledge through games. They observe, investigate and research, becoming creative and innovative. Activities are focused on transforming our environment, using science to serve humanity and helping to preserve the planet. Some Carol Baur high school students, for example, constructed a hydroponic river, making compost with organic trash, and then planted vegetables and strawberries. Given increasing pollution and a fast- growing population, they tried to find solutions not only to reduce trash and promote recycling, but also provide a cheap alternative way to produce healthy food. Other students developed a project on the domestic production of mushrooms as an alternative food source related to urban water management. Their homegrown mushrooms are easy and cheap to produce. After 30 to 35 days the mushrooms, rich in protein and low in fat, can be harvested and used for many dishes, including tortillas. Yet another group of students produced ecological homemade tiles, which at the same time help diminish air and water pollution. Highlighting the importance of relating to nature to inspire feelings of love and responsibility for its protection, the Piensa Verde project takes students out of the classroom to clean the lake in the Carol Baur Ecological Park, using canoes to reach and collect the trash.\n\nThe Gambian ASPnet developed the Adopt a Village Project for inland ASPnet schools to raise awareness in village schools and communities on local climate and environmental changes and on ways to preserve and conserve natural resources. Targeting non-coastal communities that are affected by environmental problems like sand and gravel mining, deforestation, bush burning, hunting and waste management, the project aims to build capacities of local teachers, students, youth and senior citizens to reduce human activities that promote climate change in the village, and to empower them to observe, analyze and wisely manage their environment. The Adopt a Village Project was a key activity under the 2012-2013 UNESCO Participation Programme in the Gambia that mobilized ASPnet schools in the country to address issues relating to Education for Sustainable Development and to strengthen their capacities to respond to contemporary challenges such as climate change.\n\nTo raise the awareness of students and the local population in Quimper, Brittany (France) regarding the protection and development of the local coastal areas at the tip of Western Europe, the ASPnet school Le Likès has been partnering with the Iroise Natural Marine Park. Every year, Le Likès students start off the project with a visit to local companies and the Marine Life center Haliotika in Le Guilvinec, to get their first insight into sea protection activities on Brittany’s coasts. Afterwards, all participating teachers discuss various aspects of coastal protection with their students in the classroom. This includes not only science teachers, but also those teaching economics, history, geography and English. The classroom activities are followed by a one-day workshop session with scientists from the Iroise marine park, giving students the opportunity to meet different park staff members, learn from their experience and also exchange ideas with people living in and around the park.\n\nOn World Philosophy Day 2014, students from the ASPnet school Nesibe Aydın, Turkey engaged in discussions on what it means to be a global citizen and reflected on how to take action to help find solutions to current and future global challenges. Issues discussed included the responsibility for helping others, respecting the rights of others, learning new things about the world, and treating people fairly.\n\nO.P. Jindal School-Raigarh, India undertakes a wide range of activities related to environmental protection, responsible consumption and ecological awareness. With ecological sustainability being a mainstay of the school’s curriculum, O.P. Jindal provides its students with an inspiring educational environment. Its “green school” project comprises different activities throughout the year on water conservation, biodiversity and consumer education. For example, the environmental service learning programme helps to improve students’ academic performance in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM subjects) by inspiring students’ reflection on their environment and innovative greening methods. As part of an exchange with the Abbey Grange Church of England Academy in Leeds, United Kingdom, students designed and presented posters on the importance of preventing water pollution, saving electricity etc. Within the “green school” project, students produce green bags to help their community replace plastic grocery bags, thus reducing waste and promoting recycling. To increase the activity’s impact, O.P. Jindal students encourage partner schools to participate in the green bag production. Students also visited the local consumer forum to learn about its activities in support of consumer protection. After the interactive exchange with the president and two members of the forum, many students resolved to be more aware of their rights and duties as consumers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1515964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1515964", "title": "Wedge strategy", "text": "Wedge strategy\n\nThe Wedge Strategy is a creationist political and social action plan authored by the Discovery Institute, the hub of the pseudoscientific intelligent design movement. The strategy was put forth in a Discovery Institute manifesto known as the Wedge Document. Its goal is to change American culture by shaping public policy to reflect politically conservative fundamentalist evangelical Protestant values. The wedge metaphor is attributed to Phillip E. Johnson and depicts a metal wedge splitting a log.\n\nIntelligent design is the religious belief that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not a naturalistic process such as natural selection. Implicit in the intelligent design doctrine is a redefining of science and how it is conducted (see theistic science). Wedge strategy proponents are opposed to materialism, naturalism, and evolution, and have made the removal of each from how science is conducted and taught an explicit goal. The strategy was originally brought to the public's attention when the Wedge Document was leaked on the Web. The Wedge strategy forms the governing basis of a wide range of Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns.\n\nThe Wedge Document outlines a public relations campaign meant to sway the opinion of the public, popular media, charitable funding agencies, and public policy makers. \n\nThe document sets forth the short-term and long-term goals with milestones for the intelligent design movement, with its governing goals stated in the opening paragraph:\n\nThere are three Wedge Projects, referred to in the strategy as three phases designed to reach a governing goal:\n\nRecognizing the need for support, the institute affirms the strategy's Christian, evangelistic orientation:\n\nThe wedge strategy was designed with both five-year and twenty-year goals in mind in order to achieve the conversion of the mainstream. One notable component of the work was its desire to address perceived social consequences and to promote a social conservative agenda on a wide range of issues including abortion, euthanasia, sexuality, and other social reform movements. It criticized \"materialist reformers [who] advocated coercive government programs\" which it referred to as \"a virulent strain of utopianism\".\n\nBeyond promotion of the Phase I goals of proposing Intelligent Design related research, publications, and attempted integration into academia, the wedge strategy places an emphasis on Phases II and III advocacy aimed at increasing popular support of the Discovery Institute's ideas. Support for the creation of popular level books, newspaper and magazine articles, op-ed pieces, video productions, and apologetics seminars was hoped to embolden believers and sway the broader culture towards acceptance of intelligent design. This in turn would lead the ultimate goal of the wedge strategy; a social and political reformation of American culture.\n\nIn 20 years, the group hopes that they will have achieved their goal of making intelligent design the main perspective in science as well as to branch out to ethics, politics, philosophy, theology, and the fine arts. A goal of the wedge strategy is to see intelligent design \"permeate religious, cultural, moral and political life.\" By accomplishing this goal the ultimate goal as stated by the Center for Science and Culture (CSC) of the \"overthrow of materialism and its damning cultural legacies\" and reinstating the idea that humans are made in the image of God, thereby reforming American culture to reflect conservative Christian values, will be achieved.\n\nThe preamble of the Wedge Document is mirrored largely word-for-word in the early mission statement of the CSC, then called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. The theme is again picked up in the controversial book \"From Darwin to Hitler\" authored by Center for Science and Culture Fellow Richard Weikart and published with the center's assistance. The wedge strategy was largely authored by Phillip E. Johnson, and features in his book \"The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism\".\n\nDrafted in 1998 by Discovery Institute staff, the Wedge Document first appeared publicly after it was posted to the World Wide Web on February 5, 1999, by Tim Rhodes, having been shared with him in late January 1999 by Matt Duss, a part-time employee of a Seattle-based international human-resources firm. There Duss had been given a document to copy titled \"The Wedge\" and marked \"Top Secret\" and \"Not For Distribution.\"\nMeyer once claimed that the Wedge Document was stolen from the Discovery Institute's offices.\n\nDiscovery Institute co-founder and CSC Vice President Stephen C. Meyer eventually acknowledged the Institute as the source of the document. The Institute still seeks to downplay its significance, saying \"Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the urban legend of the 'Wedge' document\". The Institute also portrays the scientific community's reaction to the Wedge document as driven by \"Darwinist Paranoia.\" Despite insisting that intelligent design is not a form of creationism, the Discovery Institute chose to use an image of Michelangelo's \"The Creation of Adam,\" depicting God reaching out to impart life from his finger into Adam.\n\nAccording to Phillip E. Johnson, the wedge movement, if not the term, began in 1992:\n\nNancy Pearcey, a CSC fellow and Johnson associate, acknowledges Johnson's leadership of the intelligent design movement in two of her most recent publications. In an interview with Johnson for World magazine, Pearcey says, \"It is not only in politics that leaders forge movements. Phillip Johnson has developed what is called the 'Intelligent Design' movement.\" In \"Christianity Today\", she reveals Johnson's religious beliefs and his animosity toward evolution and affirms Johnson as \"The unofficial spokesman for ID.\"\n\nIn his 1997 book \"Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds\" Johnson summed up the underlying philosophy of the strategy:\nAt the 1999 \"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference\" called by Reverend D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, Johnson gave a speech called How the Evolution Debate Can Be Won. In it he summed up the theological and epistemological underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for winning the battle:\n\nJohnson cites the foundation of intelligent design as The Gospel According to Saint John, in the New Testament, specifically, Chapter 1:1: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (King James Version).\n\nThe 1999 establishment of the Michael Polanyi Center at Baylor University by Baylor president Robert B. Sloan was a major step forward in the wedge strategy the center was by William Dembski and Bruce L. Gordon, with funding from the John Templeton Foundation via the Discovery Institute. The center was disbanded the next year in the face of protests from Baylor's faculty and the recommendation of an outside advisory council. By 2005 Baylor had also hired two other wedge proponents, Walter Bradley and Francis J. Beckwith.\n\nElaborating on the goals and methods of wedge strategy, Johnson stated in an interview conducted in 2002 for Touchstone Magazine that \"The mechanism of the wedge strategy is to make it attractive to Catholics, Orthodox, non-fundamentalist Protestants, observant Jews, and so on.\" He went on to elaborate:\n\nOther statements of Johnson's acknowledge that the goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic and creationist agenda cast as a scientific concept.\n\nCritics claim that Johnson's statements validate claims leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping religious content from their anti-evolution, creationist assertions as a means of avoiding the separation of church and state mandated by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The statements, when viewed in the light of the Wedge document and the US District Court's Kitzmiller decision, show ID and the ID movement is an attempt to put a gloss of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief.\n\nThe wedge strategy details a simultaneous assault on state boards of education, state and federal legislatures and on the print and broadcast media. The Discovery Institute has carried out the strategy through its role in the intelligent design movement, where it aggressively promoted ID and its Teach the Controversy campaign to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Intelligent design proponents, through the Discovery Institute, have employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in their furtherance of their goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents.\n\nThe Discovery Institute has provided material support and assisted federal, state and local elected representatives in drafting legislation that would deemphasize or refute evolution in science curricula. The DI has also supported and advised individual parents and local groups who raise the subject with school boards. During school board meetings in Kansas, Ohio, and Texas, the political and social agenda of the Discovery Institute were used to call into question both the motives of the intelligent design proponents and the validity of their position.\n\nThe Discovery Institute fellows have significant advantages in money, political sophistication, and experience over their opponents in the scientific and educational communities, who do not have the benefit of funding from wealthy benefactors, clerical and technical support staff, and expensive advertising campaigns and extensive political networking.\n\nThe Discovery Institute's \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign is designed to leave the scientific establishment looking close-minded, appearing as if it is attempting to stifle and suppress new scientific discoveries that challenge the status quo. This is made with the knowledge that it's unlikely many in the public understand advanced biology, or can consult the current scientific literature or contact major scientific organizations to verify Discovery Institute claims. This part of the strategy also plays on undercurrents of anti-intellectualism and distrust of science and scientists that can be found in particular segments of American society.\n\nThere is a noticeable conflict between what intelligent design backers tell the public through the media and what they say before conservative Christian audiences. This is studied and deliberate as advocated by wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson. When speaking to a mainstream audience and to the media, ID proponents cast ID as a secular, scientific theory. But when speaking to what the Wedge Document calls their \"natural constituency, namely (conservative) Christians,\" ID proponents express themselves in unambiguously religious language. This in the belief that they cannot afford to alienate their constituency and major funding sources, virtually all of which are conservative religious organizations and individuals such as Howard Ahmanson.\n\nHaving written extensively about ID, philosopher of science Robert Pennock says \"When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about the identity of the designer. It is ironic that their political strategy leads them to deny God in the public square more often than Peter did.\"\n\nThe term \"intelligent design\" has become a liability for wedge advocates since the ruling in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\". Because of the success of the Discovery Institute's public relations campaign to make \"intelligent design\" a household phrase, and the ruling in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" that ID is essentially religious in nature more people recognize it as the religious concept of creationism. Having come closest to accomplishing getting ID into public school science classes in Kansas and Ohio where they succeeded in getting the State Board of Education to adopt ID lesson plans, intelligent design proponents advocated \"teach the controversy\" as a legally defensible alternative to teaching intelligent design. The Kitzmiller ruling also characterized \"teaching the controversy\" as part of the same religious ploy as presenting intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. This prompted a move to a fallback position, teaching \"critical analysis\" of evolutionary theory. Teaching \"critical analysis\" is viewed as a means of teaching all the ID arguments without using that label. It also picks up the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what they say are the \"strengths and weaknesses\" of evolutionary theory and \"arguments against evolution,\" which they falsely portray as \"a theory in crisis.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Registering with USA Hockey and for a coaching clinic can be completed online at USA Hockey.com. Formal coaching education programs are not the only way coaches develop. Other learning opportunities, such as playing experience, mentoring, and discussions with other coaches play a significant role.\n\nA coach should focus his/her attention on individual skill development first. Individual skill development should be mastered prior to focusing on competition. For players to become successful in a team situation, they should develop their skating, stick handling, passing, and shooting skills. Individual skill development is the foundation for every player and of primary importance before advancing in competitive situations.\n\n"}
