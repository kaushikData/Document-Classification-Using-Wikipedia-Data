It is located in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, though it was originally located in Zomba, Malawi. In addition to subsidiary departments that are funded for the future studies or for the exploration of the future, INADEP has funded a Centre for the exploration of the past, named Diop's Center for Egyptology. INADEP is a member of the National Research Council of Congo and one of the National Government Organizations devoted exclusively to scientific research and to the training of new researchers.\n\nIn 1976 the United Nations, through its Economic Commission for Africa (EGA) launched the idea of founding an African Institute for Studies of the Future. In 1977, the IXth Conference for ECA ministers defined the objectives of the Institute. In 1980m Professor Mahdi Elmandjra conducted a feasibility study entitled Report on the Desirability and Feasibility of Establishing an African Institute for Advanced public Policy Analysis and Future Studies. In 1981, the OAU summit held in Nairobi approved the idea of founding an Institute for decolonising the future. In 1982, the Conference for EGA Ministers approved the idea of establishing the Institute. In 1987 the book \"Reconquering the Future\" was published at the request of UNDP.\n\nIn 1985, the International Symposium on Africa and its Future thinks it is appropriate to start an African Centre for Studies of the Future. President Mobutu Sese Seko agrees to the idea and offers to provide initial infrastructural facilities in Kinshasa.\n\nOrdinance 89–287 of 9 November 1989 prescribed the foundation of a public institution called \"Institut Africain d'Etudes Prospectives\" (INADEP), and in 1990 the Center for Egyptology was added. The chairman of the Centre for Egyptology is Mubabinge Bilolo.\n\nThe Institute is an Africa-oriented study centre and, as such, pursues the following main objectives:\n\nThe INADEP receives support and encouragement from international institutions such as UNDP, OAU, EGA, UNESCO, UNICEF, ABDA, ABD, EEC, and the World Bank. It also receives support from specialised centres in France, Great Britain, Germany, the United States, Scandinavian Countries, Japan, and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe programme includes a campaign for the cohesion of African countries and for obtaining of assistance expected from international organisations.\n\n\n\n"}

Atkinson\n\nAlatau Tamchiboulac Atkinson (November 16, 1848– April 24,1906) was the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Territory of Hawaii, and Inspector General of Schools under the administrations of Kalākaua, Liliʻuokalani and Sanford B. Dole. A journalist and newspaper owner, he is believed to have been one of two authors of satirical works lampooning Walter Murray Gibson cabinet regime under Kalākaua.\n\nHe was born in the small town of Kapal in the Kazakh steppes of Central Asia, to British explorers Lucy Atkinson and Thomas Witlam Atkinson, and spent the first ten years of his life in Siberia, Central Asia, and St Petersburg. After his father's death in Kent, England when Alatau was 10 years old, a public fund-raising appeal by Sir Roderick Murchison, President of the Royal Geographical Society, helped finance Alatau's education at Rugby School. After a brief career in Russia as Secretary of the Turko-Russian boundary commission, he changed careers to become a writer for the British newspaper the \"Newcastle Courant\". He briefly held a teaching career in England at Durham School.\n\nAn 1854 treaty for Hawaii's annexation to the United States had been submitted to Kamehameha III, but he never signed it. During the 1863–1872 reign of Kamehameha V, the Hawaiian language was still the predominant communication in Hawaii's schools. Increasing exposure to the outside world was being brought by the sea trade, missionaries, and foreigners operating sugar plantations in the islands. In 1867, a proposed reciprocity treaty, tax relief for sugar planters, had gotten as far as the United States Congress, but was defeated in the Senate.\n\nAtkinson was offered a position by Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley in 1868, to become instructor and principal at St. Alban's College in Pauoa, Hawaii. He left England together with his wife Annie (nee Humble) and his daughter Zoe in 1869 for the long sea journey to Hawaii. St. Alban's would later merge with ʻIolani School. Atkinson would later also be given charge of the Fort Street School. He believed that fluency in a common language used by the outside world was a vital tool for the coming generations of Hawaiians. It became his life's career to convert Hawaii's schools into using English as the predominant language.\n\nIn 1887 he was appointed Inspector General of Schools for the Kingdom of Hawaii. He served in that position under both Kalākaua and Liliʻuokalani. He remained in that position under Dole during the Republic of Hawaii. When Hawaii became a territory, Atkinson was appointed Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\nAtkinson represented the Fourth District of Hawaii in the Legislature of the Republic of Hawaii for the February 16 – July 7, 1898 session. Hawaii was annexed by the United States on August 12 1898.\n\nAtkinson was editor of the \"Hawaiian Gazette\", and was president of Hawaiian Star Newspaper Association. He and/or Vice Chamberlain Edward William Purvis are to believed to be the authors of \"The Grand Duke of Gynbergdrinkenstein\", a 3-act burlesque originally published in 1886 as a satirical jab at Kalākaua's cabinet under the helm of Walter M. Gibson. The character of Herr Von Boss was believed to be wealthy sugar baron Claus Spreckels. A second version was published in 1887 as \"The Gynberg Ballads\". British Commissioner James Hay Wodehouse believed the satire rang true to the king's cabinet under Gibson, and made sure numerous officials in London received copies.\n\n\nAtkinson married Annie Humble in England in January 1868. They sailed to Hawaii in 1869, by way of Panama and San Francisco. He died April 24,1906 as a result of a series of strokes after a lengthy illness. Upon his death, all schools were closed in his honor. Atkinson Drive in the Ala Moana area of Honolulu is named for him. Annie Atkinson died of pneumonia in 1911.\n\nThe couple had four daughters and three sons:\n\n1. Zoe Lucy Sherrard Alatau Atkinson (1868–1940) was their only child born in England; all her brothers and sisters were born in Hawaii. She became a teacher at the Royal School in Hawaii. Zoe married scientist Robert Cyril Layton Perkins in 1901, and the couple permanently moved to England after their wedding.\n\n2. Alatau Leonard Charles (Jack) Atkinson (1871–1927) was appointed to the US presidential cabinet post of Secretary of Hawaii in 1903 by Theodore Roosevelt. During an extended absence of territorial governor George R. Carter, Jack Atkinson became Acting Governor of the Territory of Hawaii. As a youth, he enlisted in the Honolulu Rifles. A graduate of Yale Law School and the University of Michigan, he maintained a law practice in Honolulu, and was active in the Republican Party. He married Ina Marie Taft of Chicago in 1921. \n\n3. Edith Kapiolani (Lani) Atkinson (c. 1871– 1959) married British naval officer Captain Frederick Kenrick Colquhoun Gibbons in 1895 and permanently relocated to England.\n\n4. May (Maisie) Kathleen Atkinson (1874–1923) married Arthur M. Brown in 1897, future high sheriff of the Territory of Hawaii.\n\n5. Molly (Ethel Mary) Alatau Atkinson (1875–1931) married Samuel Gardner Wilder Jr. in 1896.\n\n6. Robert Witlam Atkinson (1877–1939) was co-founder, along with Walter F. Dillingham, of Hawaiian Dredging. In 1907, he married Helen (Nellie) Kitchen and was widowed in 1917. Two years later, he married her widowed sister Alice Mackee Kitchen Schultz. His wives were granddaughters of sugar planter James Makee.\n\n7. Kenneth Alatau Atkinson (1885–1953) relocated to New South Wales, Australia where he spent the rest of his life in a variety of occupations.\n\n\n"}

Authentic assessment can be devised by the teacher, or in collaboration with the student by engaging student voice. When applying authentic assessment to student learning and achievement, a teacher applies criteria related to “construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and the value of achievement beyond the school.” \n\nAuthentic assessment tends to focus on contextualised tasks, enabling students to demonstrate their competency in a more 'authentic' setting. Examples of authentic assessment categories include:\n\nAccording to Meg Ormiston, \"Authentic learning mirrors the tasks and problem solving that are required in the reality outside of school\".\n\nThis framework for assessment begins the same way curriculum design begins, with the question: What should students be able to do? Once the instructor answers that question, they can then devise a rubric to evaluate how well a student demonstrates the ability to complete the task. Because most authentic assessments require a judgement of the degree of quality, they tend toward the subjective end of the assessment scale. Rubrics are an \"attempt to make subjective measurements as objective, clear, consistent, and as defensible as possible by explicitly defining the criteria on which performance or achievement should be judged.\"\n\nTraditionally, assessment follows curriculum. Authentic assessment is an example of \"backwards design\" because the curriculum follows from the assessment.\n\nOne case study was presented by Edutopia's Schools That Work series on New York based institution, School of the Future. This school stresses the process of authentically assessing students rather than focusing solely on test results or term papers. The school measures the full range of student ability through formative assessments, presentations, exhibitions, and tests that focus on authentic tasks to assess students' skills and knowledge as they relate to real-world endeavors and skills such as effective group communication and presentation. 98% of students at this school go on to college after graduating.\n\nTeachers from The School of The Future in New York utilize authentic assessment in their school and recommend that other teachers can do the same by following the guidelines outlined below:\n\nA goal of authentic assessment is to determine if student knowledge can be applied outside of the classroom. This means that a physics assessment should involve doing physics by performing experiments and solving problems the same way that a real-life physicist would. An authentic history assessment requires students to ask questions, do independent research, and formulate answers to their questions, just like a real-life historian does. \nWhat else is authentic assessment meant to do?\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37103142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37103142", "title": "Budapest School (Lukács)", "text": "Budapest School (Lukács)\n\nThe Budapest School (; ) was a school of thought, originally of Marxist humanism, but later of Post-Marxism and dissident Liberalism that emerged in Hungary in the early 1960s, belonging to so called Hungarian New Left. Its members were students or colleagues of Georg Lukács. The school was originally oriented towards developing Lukacs' later works on social ontology and aesthetics, but quickly began to challenge the paradigm of Lukacsian-Marxism, thus reconstructing contemporary critical theory. Most of the members later came to abandon Marxism. The School also critiqued the \"dictatorship over needs\" of the Soviet states. Most of the members were forced into exile by the pro-Soviet Hungarian government.\n\nIn a letter to the \"Times Literary Supplement\" of February 15, 1971, Georg Lukács drew attention to “The Budapest School of Marxism,” and helped attract attention to the school from Western Marxism.\n\nMembers of the school include Ágnes Heller, Ferenc Fehér , György Márkus, István Mészáros, Mihály Vajda and Maria Márkus, among others. The Budapest School's writings have been read and researched widely since the 1960s.\n\nThe 1956 Hungarian Revolution was one of the most important political events of Agnes Heller's life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist critical theory as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller’s ideas that what Marx really intended is for the people to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.\n\nLukács, Heller and other Marxist critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and socialism needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the Soviet Union in Hungary’s future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of János Kádár: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the Hungarian Academy as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). \nFrom 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the “Budapest School”, a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of actually existing socialism and its theories. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with looser connections to the school (such as András Hegedüs, István Eörsi, János Kis and György Bence). The School emphasized the idea of the renaissance of Marxism, described by radical philosophy scholar Simon Tormey as \"a flowering of the critical, oppositional potential they believed lay within Marxism and in particular within the ‘early Marx’ ... the Marxism of the individual ‘rich in needs,' of solidarity and self-governance ... they hoped to precipitate a crisis in those systems that had the temerity to call themselves 'socialist'.\"\n\nHeller’s work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from “the bottom up,” and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of \"everyday life\". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of aesthetics in \"The Concept of The Beautiful\" (1998), \"Time Is Out of Joint\" (2002), and \"Immortal Comedy\" (2005).\n\nThe Budapest School carried out research on the Political Economy of both the Soviet Union and Western Capitalism. The School accepted many of the critiques of Soviet planning and inefficiency from Neoclassical Economics, as well as the connection between markets and freedom. The Soviet system was condemned as a dictatorship over needs. The school also analyzed the mixed economies of modern capitalism. Most traditional Marxist economics was jettisoned. Sweden and the Nordic Model was held as a model of the mixed economy and managed capitalism. The School advocated Radical Democracy as a solution to the authoritarian and undemocratic features of the mixed economy.\n\nHeller was born in 1929. It is well known that she is the most prominent philosopher and aesthetician from Budapest School, and one of the most representative critical theorists from Eastern European Neo-Marxists. She has published more than forty books on social theory, the theory of history, the philosophy of ethics and moral and political philosophy. Since 1990s, she has been paying more attention to issues of aesthetics.\n\n\nFehér wrote an important book called Paradoxical poet in the early 1970s under the influence of Georg Lukács's The Theory of the Novel, and later published some writings about aesthetics and political philosophy with Agnes Heller in Australia and the U.S. He died in 1994.\n\nMárkus left Hungary for Australia in the late 1970s, just like Agnes Heller and Ferenc Fehér. His books include:\n\nMihály András Vajda is a Széchenyi Prize-winning Hungarian philosopher, professor, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, full member.

Students prepare for the exams and papers by engaging in all-night studying sessions, often with the aid of stimulants such as coffee, caffeine tablets, energy drinks, adderall, or other prescription amphetamines. During this period, some students suffer from sleep deprivation, increased irritability, and vomiting. At some schools, this week is referred to as \"Hell Week\", \"Reading Period\", or \"Reading Week\".\n\nMany campus dormitories/residence halls require near silence for most of the day during the week before finals, to aid to those studying for their finals or writing papers.

{"id": "3306437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3306437", "title": "Expulsion (education)", "text": "Expulsion (education)\n\nExpulsion, or permanent exclusion, refers to the removal or banning of a student from a school system or university due to persistent violation of that institution's rules, or in extreme cases, for a single offense of marked severity. Laws and procedures regarding expulsion vary between countries and states.\n\nVarious colloquialisms refer to this practice (for example, being \"kicked out of school\" or \"sent down\"). The alleged practice of pressuring parents to voluntarily withdraw their child from an educational institution is a comparable exercise.\n\nIf a student(s) has been expelled from two schools, then any state school is legally allowed to refuse admittance of that student. (Schools on special measures may refuse to admit a student who has been expelled from only one school.) Therefore, a student who has been expelled from two schools might be totally removed from the state education system. As a result, it is rare for a pupil to be expelled (or \"permanently excluded\") in the UK's state sector.\n\nThe exclusion of pupils is governed by the Education Act 2002.\n\nThe Secretary of State's guidance states that exclusion is a serious step. Exclusion should be used only in response to serious breaches of a school's discipline policy and only after a range of alternative strategies to resolve the pupil's disciplinary problems have been tried and proven to have failed; and where allowing the pupil to remain in school would be seriously detrimental to the education or welfare of other pupils and staff, or of the pupil himself or herself.\n\nIn practice, a student can usually be subject to permanent exclusion for a total of five disciplinary breaches, for which the student does not have to receive formal 'warnings'. Depending on his or her offence, a child can be excluded from the school system within any range of time after his or her misdeed. Though the teaching staff may recommend a pupil to be expelled, only the headteacher is legally empowered to exclude a student; he or she is not permitted to delegate that power to another person, but if he or she is ill or otherwise unable to perform his or her duties, another staff member may become the acting headteacher and inherit the power to expel students.\n\nWhen kicking a student out, the headteacher must inform the pupil's parents of the duration of the exclusion (whether it be temporary or permanent), reasons for exclusion, and the procedures which a parent may take to make an appeal. The headteacher must also inform the local education authority of the circumstances surrounding permanent exclusions, fixed-term exclusions exceeding five days, and exclusions which result in a student being unable to take a public examination.\n\nA headteacher might kick a pupil out for a first or one-off incident of appropriate severity. For a single case of one of the following, a pupil can be expelled permanently for:\n\nIf a student has a history of breaking other school rules, that too could result in expulsion. In these cases, expulsion is used as a last resort if the student's behaviour has not improved. Some offences which may lead to expulsion when repeated persistently include:\nSince many violent students often rebel against school rules, some head teachers may choose to expel a student who has performed an act of violence against another pupil for \"persistent defiance\" rather than violence. This is in order to protect the victim from being assaulted again as revenge for the excluded student's expulsion. Some regard this \"totting up\" process of persistent defiance to be unfair, as the pupil will have often been punished once already for each act, and expulsion can be seen as a second punishment imposed after the matter had been settled.\n\nThe pupil and his or her parents can appeal to the school governors against the expulsion. If the appeal fails to reinstate the pupil, a further appeal can be made to an appeals board (which sits on the behalf of the local education authority).\n\nThe parents of an excluded pupil are entitled to appeal against expulsion or an exclusion exceeding five days to a panel of school governors acting as a court.\n\nThe panel, which consists of parents and staff and cannot include the headteacher, is not legally able to exclude a pupil or extend a term of exclusion; but it can convert a permanent exclusion to a fixed-term one, reduce the length of a fixed-term exclusion, or cancel an exclusion.\n\nThe appeal must occur no sooner than six days after and no more than 15 days after the exclusion begins. The panel considers oral, written, or physical evidence from the school detailing the case for expulsion, and from the parents of the excluded pupil. The pupil and his or her parents may argue that the excluded pupil was not responsible for the act for which he or she has been excluded, or that the punishment was disproportionate to the offence.\n\nIf the appeal to the governors is unsuccessful, an expelled or excluded student and his or her parents may go to an appeals board. This panel, which is appointed by the local education authority, must be autonomous of the authority, the school, and the parents of the excluded student.\n\nThe majority of the appeals that these panels hear are not against exclusions, but are for the admission of pupils into schools. Although the local education authority are in theory obligated to provide education to a pupil under school-leaving age (Year 11 and below), in practice (usually when the pupil is denied access to other schools and/or the pupil referral unit) the local education authority employs techniques such as appointing a single tutor for one lesson a week.\n\nThere are a number of projects that provide free legal representation to pupils who are appealing against their permanent exclusion from school. The institution cited in letters detailing the reasons for permanent exclusions is the Coram Children's Legal Centre.\n\nThere are voluntary groups who provide trainee lawyers to represent parents at both governing body appeals and independent appeal panels. The City / Matrix Chambers School Exclusions Project is one such project.\n\nIn the independent sector, a pupil can be ‘permanently excluded’ at the discretion of the headteacher.\n\nWhereas expulsion from a UK independent school means permanent removal from the school, rustication or suspension usually means removal from the school for a set period, for example, the remainder of the current term.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, expulsion criteria and process vary from state to state or province. Depending on local school board jurisdiction, approval from that school's local school board may be required before a student can be expelled, as opposed to a suspension, which may require approval from the principal or a school board member, including the superintendent. Students who have been expelled from the school face numerous restrictions, in which they are no longer eligible to attend or visit the school, and are also disallowed from attending or performing any activity with any students or staff who are active with the school. Students who breach an expulsion, which includes visiting the school they have been expelled from, or perform or attend any activity with any students or staff who are active with the school, will be arrested for, and charged with trespassing. Students are usually not expelled for academic violations such as plagiarism that would be punishable in college. However, in some jurosdictions such as California, vulgarity (which is not defined anywhere within California law) is enough of a reason for a student to be expelled from any school.\n\nWhile in the Criminal or Juvenile Justice one has enumerated and unenumerated rights upon accusation, pupils do not have such rights when within an expulsion process. For example, in California, pupils have the following rights:\n\n\nHowever there are rights that pupils do not have during the expulsion process that they would have in a court of law:\n\n\nWhile at one time it was difficult for a student to be expelled from public school, that is no longer the case. A 2001 report from Justice Policy Institute showed that expulsions nearly doubled from 1974 to 1998; despite student victimization rates remaining stable. Expulsion is especially high for students of color, even when their behavioral infractions are the same as those of white children, and teachers need to identify and combat bias to ensure all students are treated with equity. Beginning with the Gun-Free School Zones Act, and following the Columbine shooting tragedy, schools have become increasingly willing to suspend or have expelled students for minor behavior offenses. For example, in Maryland during the 2006-2007 school year, while 2% of suspensions were for weapons, 37% were for disrespect, insubordination, or disruption. The Task Force on the Education of Maryland’s American Males noted that \"high suspension and expulsion rates do little more than increase court referrals for minor misbehavior\", and those actions put \"a child on the path toward delinquency or accelerates his journey there\". These policies are more generally known as zero tolerance.\n\nStudents who have been expelled from a building in primary and secondary schools typically are forced to attend class at an alternate location. Alternative schools are usually owned by the expelling school district for expelled students to attend daily lessons. Students have other options, such as boarding schools, private schools, and online courses, such as APEX or K-12. In some states, such as Wisconsin, other public school districts are not required to enroll students who are currently serving a term of expulsion. In some cases, such as permanent expulsion from a district, this type of statutory authority can have the effect of displacing an expelled student from the public education system of an entire state, effectively ending their educational career. When it comes to student discipline, there is a marked difference in procedure between public and private institutions. With public schools, the school must provide the student with constitutional due process protections as public educational institutions operate as an extension of state governments. With private schools, on the other hand, the student can be expelled for any reason – so long as the expulsion was not “arbitrary and capricious.” Generally, as long as a private school follows the procedures in its student handbook, a court will not view its actions as arbitrary and capricious.\n\nSome states (like Texas) report expulsion to the juvenile court system - the model in Texas was passed in 1995.\n\nIn New Zealand, Expulsion and exclusion are both terms for removing a student from a school for misconduct. The difference is students under 16 years of age are excluded and those 16 or over are expelled, but both are commonly referred to as expulsion. For students excluded, because they are under the minimum school leaving age, the excluding school is required to find an alternative school for the student to attend, or reinstate the student if another school cannot be found. For students that are expelled, the expelling school is not required to find an alternative school, as the student is over the minimum school leaving age.\n\nExclusion/expulsion cannot be directly done by the principal. It must be done through suspending the student, and requiring the school's board of trustees, or a standing disciplinary committee of the board, to independently assess whether or not the situation is serious enough to justify exclusion or expulsion of the student.\n\nIn 2009, exclusions and expulsions rates were 2.41 and 2.01 per thousand students respectively. Students were more likely to be excluded or expelled if they were male, of Maori or Pacific Island descent, and/or attended a school with a low (1-4) socioeconomic decile.\n\nThe most common reasons for exclusions and expulsions in 2009 were:\n\nArson, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and smoking were the other main reasons for exclusion and expulsion recorded.\n\nIn mainland China, expulsions of compulsory education schools are completely banned under the Article 27 of the Compulsory Education Act.\n\n"}

Neill is a 1972 intellectual biography of the British pedagogue A. S. Neill by Ray Hemmings. It traces how Homer Lane, Wilhelm Reich, Sigmund Freud and others influenced Neill as he developed the \"Summerhill idea\", the philosophy of child autonomy behind his Summerhill School. The book follows Neill's early life and career in rural, Calvinist Scotland and continues through the influence of his mentors, Lane and Reich, and the origins of Summerhill after World War I. Written fifty years from Summerhill's founding, \"Fifty Years\" is a sociological and historical analysis of Neill's ideas in the context of intellectual and educational trends both during Neill's life and at the time of publication. Hemmings also surveyed progressive school leaders about Neill's impact on the field, and reported their perception of influence on teacher–pupil relations. \"Fifty Years\" was first published in England in 1972 by George Allen and Unwin, and was later renamed Children's Freedom: A. S. Neill and the Evolution of the Summerhill Idea for its 1973 American publication by Schocken Books.\n\nContemporary reviewers considered \"Fifty Years\" to be the best available biography of Neill. They largely praised its clarity and biographical detail and insight, but found the book's philosophical sections comparatively weak and the author biased, as a former teacher from the school.\n\n\"Fifty Years of Freedom\" is an intellectual biography of the British pedagogue A. S. Neill that traces the influence of Homer Lane, Wilhelm Reich, Sigmund Freud and others on his thought. Released fifty years after the school's founding, the book is a sociological and historical analysis that presents the development of Neill's \"Summerhill idea\"—the philosophy of his Summerhill School—in context of related social, political, educational, and intellectual trends. Hemmings himself saw the work as less of a biography than an analysis of Neill's ideas in development and of the outward reception of these ideas. The book was first published in England in 1972 by George Allen and Unwin as \"Fifty Years of Freedom: A Study of the Development of the Ideas of A. S. Neill\", and was later renamed \"Children's Freedom: A. S. Neill and the Evolution of the Summerhill Idea\" for its 1973 American publication by Schocken Books. The book includes photographs.\n\nThe book follows the course of Neill's life sequentially from his youth in \"rural, Calvinist Scotland\" to the start of Summerhill between the two World Wars. Hemmings focuses on Neill's relation to education but also minds other biographical detail: the influence of Freudian psychoanalysis and Homer Lane's theories in the 1920s, and of Wilhelm Reich's psychological theories in the 1930s. Hemmings compares Neill's thought with that of Maria Montessori, Bertrand Russell, Fred Clarke, Erich Fromm, Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Benjamin Spock, and contemporaries Paul Goodman, Ivan Illich, R. D. Laing, and Herbert Marcuse. Compared to pedagogues such as Russell, who advocated for the inculcation of certain virtues in a child's education, Neill instead insisted that the child be left to make its own values and decisions apart from adult influence and manipulation. Hemmings also reviews the roles of freedom, authority, and anarchy throughout the maturation of Neill's thought. The final sections explain Summerhill's internal processes, philosophy, and position in both British and global social order. Hemmings contends that Summerhill has remained consistent to its principles while it cycled through roles as one of many 1920s educational experiments, a bastion in the 1930s, and an advocate for \"children's freedom\" throughout the post-World War II movement for informal' education\".\n\nHemmings conducted a study that surveyed 102 progressive heads—broadly defined—of infant, elementary, and secondary schools about Neill's influence. Their responses indicated that Neill had significant impact on how the profession perceived teacher–pupil relations. The respondents also reported significant influence from Neill on moral and sex education. Contrarily, Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.\n\nHemmings had previously taught at Summerhill. In 1973, he was lecturer in Education at the University of Leicester. Other contemporaneous and significant biographies of Neill include Neill's autobiography (\"Neill! Neill! Orange Peel!\", 1972) and Robert Skidelsky's Part Three of \"English Progressive Schools\" (1969). Jonathan Croall's \"Neill of Summerhill\" (1983) later cited Hemmings's book.\n\nThough Hemmings did not think of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (\"Comparative Education Review\") said it essentially was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it \"comprehensive\", \"objective\", and \"sympathetically thoughtful\". In comparison, Neill's autobiography \"rambles\" and Skidelsky's biography \"preens\" over \"small insights\", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize \"a complex man in a complex world\". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest \"comparative educators\" most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work \"too long and detailed\". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book \"a struggle to work through\", though more complete compared to Neill's \"easy\", \"stream-of-consciousness\" prose. Leonard W. Cowie (\"British Journal of Educational Studies\") said that \"Fifty Years\" was written with \"great competence\" and would be both \"interesting and essential\" for those interested in understanding Neill. \"\" recommended the \"excellent volume\" for \"all readership levels\", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (\"Library Journal\") agreed that Hemmings's \"admiring ... historical biography\" remained \"clear, cool, and evenhanded\". Sarah Curtis (\"The Times Literary Supplement\") wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was \"the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic\" published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.\n\nCommenting on the book's survey study, Cowie (\"British Journal of Educational Studies\") wrote that it was hard to ascertain Neill's true pedagogical influence when state schools, which constitute the majority of schools, had a poor response rate. He added that the progressive education topics reported to be most influenced by Neill continued to be controversial in 1973. Cowie asked whether challenges to authoritarian education were replaced by Neill's methods or by chaos. Hopkins (\"Comparative Education Review\") said the sociological study was more descriptive of Neill's role than contributive to the evolution of his philosophy. Hopkins wrote that the book functioned best as a biography, and that its philosophy sections were \"piecemeal\" and \"sketchy\" rather than \"comprehensive and coherent\". Indeed, he felt that the study and the philosophical portions were more illuminative of Neill's life than of \"any broader picture\". Robert B. Nordberg (\"Best Sellers\") appreciated some of the book's \"important points\", such that many advocates for educational freedom, in practice, instead seek more insidious techniques for controlling children. While Curtis (\"The Times Literary Supplement\") felt that the book added little new content, she appreciated the book's detail, such as that Neill's \"A Dominie's Log\" was based in fact, not fiction.\n\nMultiple reviewers highlighted Hemmings's association with the school. Cowie (\"British Journal of Educational Studies\") wrote that although Neill did not want disciples, Hemmings \"accepts generally the 'Summerhill idea and would fit the role. Nicholas Tucker (\"New Statesman\") too noted the book as \"very one-sided, verging on the uncritical\" despite its readability and signs of thorough research. He said that a balanced account of Summerhill was elusive because of the \"sensationalized\" press and \"rosy\" recollections of Neill and his former pupils, similar to the memoirs of \"Old Boys' clubs elsewhere\". He wrote, however, that Hemmings's position was understandable when considering the criticism that Summerhill and Neill withstood from \"conventional educational wisdom\" and \"horrified hearsay\", which had turned the school into \"a type of scholastic folk myth\" to set straight. Still, Tucker saw less cause for Summerhill's defense by the time of publication as Neill had wider acceptance. He had become a powerful figure in education and his school a template for the American free school movement. Cowie wrote that Neill seemed to be enjoying greater acceptance in his later life as Summerhill was \"losing its uniqueness as 'that dreadful school. Nordberg (\"Best Sellers\") said that while Hemmings has some criticism for Neill and \"open education\", \"he is basically an enthusiast\" who wrote a \"sympathetic portrayal\". Even from this sympathetic angle, Nordberg felt that Neill came across as \"the child of an overly strict and demanding father who has spent the rest of his life in a rather one-dimensional crusade, more visceral than rational, against authority in all forms.\" Altogether, Nordberg wrote, \"Fifty Years\" succeeds in its \"systematic, scholarly look at the Summerhill idea\" but fails to provide \"a balanced, profound look\" at its counterpart: \"need for restraint, rationality, and responsibility in the world\".\n\nNeill himself \"liked\" \"Fifty Years\" and thought Hemmings had done a \"wonderful job\" but \"wasn't critical enough\". He noted that the work received few reviews compared to his own.\n\n"}

{"id": "493992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493992", "title": "Latin honors", "text": "Latin honors\n\nLatin honors are Latin phrases used to indicate the level of distinction with which an academic degree has been earned. This system is primarily used in the United States, many countries of continental Europe, and some Southeastern Asian countries with European colonial history, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, although some institutions use translations of these phrases rather than the Latin originals. The honors distinction should not be confused with the honors degrees offered in some countries.\n\nGenerally, a college's or university's regulations set out definite criteria to be met in order for a student to obtain a given honors distinction. For example, the student might be required to achieve a specific grade point average, to submit an honors thesis for evaluation, to be part of an honors program, or to graduate early. Each university sets its own standards. Since these standards may vary widely it is possible for the same level of Latin honors conferred by different institutions to represent contrasting levels of academic achievement . Similarly, some institutions may grant equivalent (or additional) non-Latin honors to undergraduates. The University of Wisconsin–Madison, for example, has a series of plain English grading honors based on class standing.\n\nThese honors, when they are used, are almost always awarded to undergraduates earning their bachelor's, and, with the exception of law school graduates, much more rarely to graduate students receiving their master's or doctorate degree. The honor is typically indicated on the diploma. Latin honors are often conferred upon law school students graduating as a Juris Doctor or J.D., in which case they are generally based upon class rank or grade point average.\nMany institutions confer three levels of Latin honors, as follows:\n\nA rarely used distinction, \"\", \"with very great honor\", is an intermediary honor between the \"magna\" and the \"summa\" honors. It is sometimes used when the \"summa\" honor is reserved only for students with perfect academic records.\n\nA further rarely used distinction is that of \"Egregia Cum Laude\" which means \"with outstanding honor\" and is typically reserved for either students achieving summa cum laude honors in a particularly difficult subject area or recipients of a non-standard Bachelor's degree \n\nFor undergraduate degrees, Latin honors are used in only a few countries such as the United States, Israel, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines and Canada. Most countries use a different scheme, such as the British undergraduate degree classification (usually used in Commonwealth countries) which is more widely used with varying criteria and nomenclature depending on country, including Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Colombia, Georgia, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe and many other countries. Malta shows the Latin honors on the degree certificates, but the UK model is shown on the transcript.\n\nIn Austria, the only Latin honor in use is \"sub auspiciis Praesidentis rei publicae\" (\"under the auspices of the president of the republic\") for doctoral degrees. Candidates must have consistently excellent grades throughout high school and university, making it very difficult to attain: only about 20 out of a total of 2,500 doctoral graduates per year (i.e. 0.8%) achieve a \"sub auspiciis\" degree.\n\nIn Belgium, the university degree awarded is limited to:\n\n\nIn Brazil, the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA—Aeronautical Institute of Technology) awards the \"cum laude\" honor for graduates with every individual grade above 8.5 (out of 10.0), the \"magna cum laude\" honor for graduates with average grade above 8.5 and more than 50% of individual grades above 9.5, and the \"summa cum laude\" honor for graduates with average grade above 9.5. As of 2009, only 22 graduates have received the \"summa cum laude\" honor at ITA. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro awards the \"cum laude\" honor for graduates with average grade from 8.0 to 8.9, the \"magna cum laude\" honor for graduates with average grade from 9.0 to 9.4, and the \"summa cum laude\" honor for graduates with average grade from 9.5 to 10.0. The Federal University of Ceará awards the \"magna cum laude\" honor for undergraduates who have never failed a course, achieved an average grade from 8.5 (out of 10.0) and have received a fellowship of both \"Academic Extension\" and \"Teaching Initiation\".\n\nIn Estonia, up until 2010 both \"summa cum laude\" and \"cum laude\" were used. \"Summa cum laude\" was awarded only for very exceptional work. Since 1 September 2010, only \"cum laude\" is used. It is awarded to bachelors, masters and integrated studies graduates. Occasionally the word \"kiitusega\", which means \"with praise\", is substituted for the usual \"cum laude\". To receive \"cum laude\" one must achieve 4.60 GPA (out of 5) and receive the highest grade (A - 5.00) for the thesis or the final examination.\n\nThe Finnish Matriculation Examinations at the end of lukio uses the grades of:\n\"improbatur\" (I, failing; \"not accepted\"), \"approbatur\" (A; \"accepted\") \"lubenter approbatur\" (B; \"willingly accepted\"), \"cum laude approbatur\" (C; \"accepted with praise\"), \"magna cum laude approbatur\" (M; \"accepted with great praise\"), \"eximia cum laude approbatur\" (E; \"accepted with excellent praise\") and \"laudatur\" (L; \"praised\"). They are roughly equivalent to Finnish school grades ranging from 4 to 10. Some Finnish universities, when grading master's theses and doctoral dissertations, use the same scale with the additional grade of \"non sine laude approbatur\" (N; \"accepted not without praise\") between \"lubenter\" and \"cum laude\"; technical universities use a numerical scale (1-5) instead.\nIn France, usually the French honors \"très honorable avec félicitations du jury\", \"très honorable\" and \"honorable\" are used. However some Grandes Écoles, like the Institut d'études politiques de Paris, HEC Paris, use the Latin and English titles \"\"summa cum laude\" / \"graduated with highest honors\" for the top 2% and \"cum laude\" / \"graduated with honors\"\" for the next 5% of a year. Since 2016, honorifics ceased to be use for the completion of a PhD.\n\nIn Germany, the range of degrees is: \"rite\" (\"duly\" conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), \"cum laude\" (with honors), \"magna cum laude\" (with great honors), and \"summa cum laude\" (with highest honors). These degrees are mostly used when a doctorate is conferred, not for diplomas, bachelor's or master's degrees, for which numerical grades between 1.0 (\"very good\") and 4.0 (\"pass\"), and 5.0 (\"fail\"), are given.\n\nIn Hungary, the range of degrees — similar to the German system — is: \"rite\" (\"duly\" conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), \"cum laude\" (with honors), \"summa cum laude\" (with highest honors). These degrees are used in university diplomas and in certain fields of sciences (medical, legal and a very few others) only. The grades of degrees are dependent on the received average points from final exams and from average points from the university studies.\n\nIn Italy, the \"cum laude\" notation (\"con lode\" being the equivalent in Italian) is used as an increasing level of the highest grade for both exams (30/30) and degrees (110/110), in all its levels; sometimes passing an exam cum laude (30 e lode) has only an honorific meaning, but sometimes it influences the average grade and can be useful to the student so honored.\nIn Italy \"110 e lode\" (at institutions using a 110-point system) is the highest rank that can be achieved during the academic studies, although many years ago there were some other notations (that were given only to those who had attained the \"lode\"). These include : \"bacio e abbraccio accademico\" (\"academic kiss and embrace\") \"menzione d'onore\" (\"honor mention\") and \"dignità di stampa\" (\"dignity of printing\"), and were given based on various University-specific requirements, but without a legal value.\n\nIn Malta, for Bachelor Honours degrees \"Summa Cum Laude\" refers to First Class Honours, \"Magna Cum Laude\" refers to Second Class Honours (Upper Division), \"Cum Laude\" refers to Second Class Honours (Lower Division) whilst \"Bene Probatus\" refers to Third Class Honours. Professional degrees lasting longer than the standard 3 years such as the 5 year Bachelor of Pharmacy are awarded \"Egregia Cum Laude\". Postgraduate Diplomas and Master’s degrees may be awarded as Pass with Distinction (Summa Cum Laude), Pass with Merit (Magna Cum Laude) or Pass (Bene Probatus).\n\nIn the Netherlands, both for bachelor's and master's programs, only one class of honors is used: \"cum laude\" (with honor). Typically it is reserved to mark exceptional achievement. It depends on an absolute minimal grade point average. Sometimes it is lost, despite a high average mark, when the student gets a mark of 6 or lower for one of the many exams (on a scale of 1–10, where 10 is the highest). Generally, less than 2% receive the \"cum laude\" distinction. It is also possible to receive a PhD degree \"cum laude\", although this honor is even rarer than for master's graduates. In view of the difficulty and subjectivity of determining this, some universities and fields of study very seldom award doctorates \"cum laude\". At Dutch University Colleges, \"cum laude\", \"magna cum laude\" and, exceptionally, \"summa cum laude\" may be used.\n\nIn the Philippines, Junior High School Students under the new K-12 Curriculum an honor system using Filipino translations of the Latin original. Students who achieve a final grade average of 90-94 are awarded the title \"May Karangalan\" (\"cum laude\" in Latin or \"with honors\") and will receive a bronze medal with the DepEd seal.Those who have a final grade average of 95-97 receive the title of \"May Mataas na Karangalan\" (\"magna cum laude\" or \"with high honors\") and a silver medal with the same seal. Students with a final grade average of 98-100 shall be awarded the title of \"May Pinakamataas na Karangalan\" (\"summa cum laude\" or \"with highest honors\") and a gold medal with the same specification.\n\nIn Russia, the honor system is based on the grade point averages. At least 4.75 out of 5.0 points are required for the cum laude degree (\"с отличием\" (\"s otlichiem\") in Russian or \"with excellence\"). The graduate has to receive a perfect grade on all final examinations. Usually less than 2% of all graduating students accomplish this (depending on the university and year). In military schools, a \"red diploma\" may be accompanied by a gold medal (\"summa cum laude\") for outstanding performance. Russian high schools also award a gold medal to the student who achieves a perfect score in all final examinations and in all other subjects not requiring a final exam. A silver medal is awarded to high school students who have one or two grades of 4 (\"хорошо\" in Russian or \"good\", being second highest grade) on their final exams or other subjects as listed in the high school diploma (\"attestat o (polnom) srednem obrazovanii\").\n\nIn Singapore, the Latin honors, \"cum laude\", \"magna cum laude\" and \"summa cum laude\" are used by Singapore Management University. Graduates from Singapore Management University have to achieve GPAs of 3.4, 3.6 and 3.8 out of 4.0 respectively and without any exceptions, in order to qualify for the Latin honors.\n\nIn Spain, the Latin honors \"cum laude\" is used for PhD degrees only, and is awarded after a secret vote of the jury members, using envelopes that must be opened in a separate session, and requiring unanimity. Around 82% PhD candidates received \"cum laude\" in 2016.\n\nIn Switzerland, the degrees \"rite\", \"cum laude\", \"magna cum laude\", \"insigni cum laude\" and \"summa cum laude\" are used, but the exact GPA corresponding to each varies by institution.\n\nIn the UK the Latin \"cum laude\" is used in Latin versions of honors degrees by a few universities (e.g. University of Edinburgh) to denote a Bachelor with Honours degree, but the further classification is stated as in English, e.g. \"Primi Ordinis\" for First Class etc.\n\nIn Ukraine, the university education honor system is based on by-law # 161 (02.06.1993) of The Ministry of Education of Ukraine (3.12.3.5). In order for a student to graduate a university with a diploma with honors (\"cum laude\"), students have to receive mark \"5\" (excellent) at least on 75% of courses, receive mark 4 (good) at max 25% of courses, and pass the state exams only with mark \"5\" (excellent). Also, students are expected to have participated in research projects with visible results.\n\nIn 1869, Harvard College became the first college in the United States to award final honors to its graduates. From 1872 to 1879, \"cum laude\" and \"summa cum laude\" were the two Latin honors awarded to graduates. Beginning in 1880, \"magna cum laude\" was also awarded:\n\nIn his 1895 history of Amherst College, college historian William Seymour Tyler traced Amherst's system of Latin honors to 1881, and attributed it to Amherst College President Julius Hawley Seelye:\n\n\n"}

She coached dancers such as Martine Van Hamel, Kevin McKenzie, Natalia Makarova and Gelsey Kirkland. She developed a ballet technique based on anatomy. She stressed moving from a neutral spinal and pelvic alignment with weight evenly distributed throughout each foot. She amassed a large following of both ballet and modern dancers. Eventually she split her class into two, one for modern dancers and one for ballet dancers. Choreographers such as William Forsythe and Ohad Naharin attended her class.\n\nBlack was born in Rhode Island in 1930, and moved to New York City at the age of 16 to study dance. She danced with Cleveland Civic Ballet for a season and then moved to London where she danced with the London Theatre Ballet and Ballet Rambert. In London she studied with Audry de Vos. After two years in the UK, she returned to New York and danced with American Ballet Theatre for a year. At the invitation of Alicia Alonso, she danced with National Ballet of Cuba for a year before returning to New York City to join the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. There she worked with Antony Tudor who later invited her to teach at Juilliard.\n\nAfter working with Tudor for 7 years, Black returned to London. She spent three years reworking her own technique. She spent multiple hours a day in front of a mirror developing her theory of physical alignment that became the foundation for her teaching. To Black alignment is central to ballet technique and artistry. Moving from a natural alignment allows for freedom from tension and clarity of line and movement quality.\n\nBlack retired in 1995. On May 11, 2015, Black died in her East Hampton, New York home from, according to Black's friend Gary Chryst, congestive heart failure.\n\nIn October 2016, seventeen dancers remembered legendary teacher Maggie Black in Ballet Review Fall edition -- \" Maggie Black ( 1930- 2015)\" by Joseph Carmine \n"}

Mitchell Scholarship is a fellowship awarded annually by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance funding graduate study in Ireland. Although relatively young—the first class of scholars began their studies in 2000—the Mitchell Scholarship has quickly established itself as one of the most selective fellowships in the United States. The scholarship is often considered one of the three primary and most competitive international fellowships for American students, alongside the Rhodes Scholarship and Marshall Scholarship. Each year, approximately 350 young Americans apply for the 12 scholarships.\n\nThe George J. Mitchell Scholarship is organized under the auspices of the US-Ireland Alliance, a non-profit non-partisan organization based in Arlington, VA. The program began in 1998, created by US-Ireland Alliance president Trina Vargo with early support from the Irish and British Governments. Over the last decade, the program has been largely funded by the United States Department of State, with additional support from the Northern Ireland Government, Becton Dickinson, and Cross Atlantic Capital Partners. In 2010, the Irish Parliament passed legislation whereby it will match any contributions, up to 20 million euros, to an endowment for the Scholarship program. A Mitchell Scholarship award includes tuition, housing, airfare, a cash stipend, and other benefits such as a travel bursary to encourage travel both in and outside Ireland and Northern Ireland. In recent years, Mitchell Scholars have used their travel bursary to explore countries as diverse as Oman, Cambodia, Senegal and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Mitchell Scholars Program, named to honor former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell's pivotal contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process, is designed to introduce and connect future American leaders to the island of Ireland and recognize and foster intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to community and public service.\n\nAlumni of the Mitchell Scholarship program have pursued careers in consulting, law, academia, politics, and journalism. Notable alumni include Arsalan Suleman, the acting U.S. Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation; Matt Haney, president of the San Francisco Board of Education; Ty McCormick, the Africa editor of Foreign Policy magazine; and Jimmy Soni, the former managing editor of the Huffington Post.\n\nMitchell Scholars are placed at universities in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including Trinity College, Dublin, University College Cork, University of Limerick, National University of Ireland, Galway, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, University College Dublin, Dublin City University, University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of State attempted to eliminate funding for the program but with the support of several members of the United States Congress; university presidents and professors; the public, in the form of a petition; and the Irish and Northern Ireland Governments, the decision was reversed for fiscal year 2013.\n\n\n"}

The Institute's collection of over 25,000 library postcards, library ephemera, commemorative and souvenir china, medals, miniatures, and stereographs, is housed in the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal. Since 1956, The Molesworth Institute has been defined by vocational shenanigans, invented histories, and a refusal to accept definition. It was founded by Francis A. T. Johns and Norman D. Stevens, Director Emeritus. Katie Herzog was appointed Director in April, 2011, and the Institute is currently based in the Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Herzog represented the Molesworth Institute at the first Cycling for Libraries \"unconference\" from Copenhagen to Berlin. \n\nSince the first article, \"The Molesworth Institute\", appeared in the \"ALA Bulletin\" (57:756-7, 1963), over 50 articles describing the results of specialized research carried out by the staff of the Institute have appeared in all of the major American professional library journals, as well as in library journals in Brazil, Italy, Russia, and Sweden. Its most recent article, \"The First Fully Electronic Library\", appears in the January 2006 issue of \"College & Research Libraries\" and variant versions have been published in France, Italy, and Sweden. In addition to the research staff, there are now 88 Fellows of the Molesworth Institute who assist in the furtherance of the organization's work.

The robot's development began with the launch of Project Nao in 2004. On 15 August 2007, Nao replaced Sony's robot dog Aibo as the robot used in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL), an international robot soccer competition. The Nao was used in RoboCup 2008 and 2009, and the NaoV3R was chosen as the platform for the SPL at RoboCup 2010.\n\nSeveral versions of the robot have been released since 2008. The Nao Academics Edition was developed for universities and laboratories for research and education purposes. It was released to institutions in 2008, and was made publicly available by 2011. Various upgrades to the Nao platform have since been released, including the 2011 Nao Next Gen and the 2014 Nao Evolution.\n\nNao robots have been used for research and education purposes in numerous academic institutions worldwide. As of 2015, over 5,000 Nao units are in use in more than 50 countries.\n\nAldebaran Robotics was established in 2005 by Bruno Maisonnier, who had previously begun developing the robot under \"Project Nao\" in 2004. Six prototypes of Nao were designed between 2005 and 2007. In March 2008, the first production version of the robot, the Nao RoboCup Edition, was released to the contestants of that year's RoboCup. The Nao Academics Edition was released to universities, educational institutions and research laboratories in late 2008.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Nao made global headlines with a synchronized dance routine at the Shanghai Expo in China. In October 2010, the University of Tokyo purchased 30 Nao robots for their Nakamura Lab, with hopes of developing the robots into active laboratory assistants. In December 2010, a Nao robot was demonstrated doing a stand-up comedy routine, and a new version of the robot was released, featuring sculpted arms and improved motors. In May 2011, Aldebaran announced that it would release Nao's controlling source code to the public as open source software. In June 2011, Aldebaran raised US$13 million in a round of venture funding led by Intel Capital. In 2013, Aldebaran was acquired by Japan's SoftBank Mobile for US$100 million.\n\nIn December 2011, Aldebaran released the Nao Next Gen, featuring hardware and software enhancements such as high density cameras, improved robustness, anti-collision systems and a faster walking speed. The Nao Evolution, featuring enhanced durability, improved multilingual speech synthesis, improved shape and facial detection and recognition using new algorithms, and improved sound source location using four directional microphones, was released in June 2014.\n\nAldeberan Robotics was acquired by SoftBank Group in 2015 and rebranded as SoftBank Robotics.\n\nSince 2011, over 200 academic institutions worldwide have made use of the robot, including the University of Hertfordshire and their Bold Hearts RoboCup Team, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, the University of Tokyo, the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, University of South Wales and Montana State University. In 2012, donated Nao robots were used to teach autistic children in a UK school; some of the children found the childlike, expressive robots more relatable than human beings. In a broader context, Nao robots have been used by numerous British schools to introduce children to robots and the robotics industry.\n\nBy the end of 2014, over 5,000 Nao robots were in use with educational and research institutions in 70 countries. In 2015, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group began trialling Nao robots for customer service use in its Japanese bank branches. In July 2015, Nao robots were shown to demonstrate a basic form of self-awareness in a philosophical experiment at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, in which three robots were set up, muting two of them; they were then told that two of them had been given a \"dumbing pill\", and asked to figure out which of them hadn't. After initially replying he didn't know, the non-muted robot was able to figure out he hadn't been given the dumbing pill after hearing the sound of his own voice. In September 2015, the French Institute of Health and Medical Research used Nao robots to test a system of robotic \"autobiographical memory\" designed to help train International Space Station crews and assist elderly patients.\n\nNao is available as a research robot for schools, colleges and universities to teach programming and conduct research into human-robot interactions.\n\nIn August 2018, RobotLAB released an online learning platform for schools that enhance the use of NAO for STEM, Coding and Engineering.\n\nThe various versions of the Nao robotics platform feature either 14, 21 or 25 degrees of freedom (DoF). A specialised model with 21 DoF and no actuated hands was created for the Robocup competition. All Nao Academics versions feature an inertial measurement unit with accelerometer, gyrometer and four ultrasonic sensors that provide Nao with stability and positioning within space. The legged versions included eight force-sensing resistors and two bumpers. The most recent version of the robot, the 2014 Nao Evolution, features stronger metallic joints, improved grip and an enhanced sound source location system that utilises four directional microphones.\n\nThe Nao robot is controlled by a specialised Linux-based operating system, dubbed NAOqi. The OS powers the robot's multimedia system, which includes four microphones (for voice recognition and sound localization), two speakers (for multilingual text-to-speech synthesis) and two HD cameras (for computer vision, including facial and shape recognition). The robot also comes with a software suite that includes a graphical programming tool dubbed Choregraphe, a simulation software package and a software developer's kit. Nao is furthermore compatible with the Microsoft Robotics Studio, Cyberbotics Webots, and the Gostai URBI Studio.\n\nIn August 2018, RobotLAB released Engage! K12.

From 1990 to 2010, there were five female presidents of this organization. Women music educators \"outnumber men two-to-one\" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction. More men tend to be hired for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities. According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a \"glass ceiling\" for women in music education careers, as there is \"stigma\" associated with women in leadership positions and \"men outnumber women as administrators.\"\n\n\nThe association annually bestow the Stand \"for\" Music Award.

New chaplains were to be required to have a \"Certificate IV in Youth Work, Pastoral Care or an equivalent qualification\", while previously no formal qualifications were required. The changes also offered schools the option to employ, instead of \"a religious support worker\" (chaplain), a \"secular student well-being officer\", following concerns over the appropriateness of having a religious worker in a public school. Previously schools were only able to hire a secular welfare worker under the programme if they could demonstrate that their efforts to find an ordained chaplain had failed. On 27 September 2013 there were 2,339 chaplains and 512 student welfare workers employed under NSCP.\n\nIn May 2014, the Abbott Government removed the provision to fund secular student well-being officers, meaning all chaplains had to be affiliated with a religion. In the 2014 federal budget, the government increased the funds for NSCP to $243.8 million over a four-year period. Following the invalidation of NSCP by the High Court in June 2014, the Government redesigned NSCP, with funding now being delivered via states and territories rather than directly to schools. The new NSCP did not involve any other changes to policy. Agreements for the new NSCP were reached with all state and territory governments by 17 November 2014.\n\nIn the High Court case of \"Williams v The Commonwealth of Australia & Ors [2012] HCA 23\" (also known as the \"School chaplains case\") the executive prerogative and spending under was challenged. The Court handed down its ruling in June 2012, that the Commonwealth's funding agreement for NSCP was invalid.\n\nA second High Court challenge, against the amended programme, was mounted by the 2012 litigant and was heard by the Court in May 2014. The High Court handed down its ruling on 19 June 2014. The focus of this case was whether the federal government has the power to fund the NSCP directly through local organisations. This second challenge also succeeded so that over $154 million in funding hitherto paid to a local organisation in Queensland became a debt. \n\nHowever, the federal government responded by waiving that debt and making a commitment to circumvent the High Court ruling and continue with the budgeted $243 million spending on NSCP. \n\nWhile the NSCP is formally not religion-specific, the chaplains employed under the programme are disproportionately Christian. In 2011, one study stated that 96.5% of the chaplains employed under the programme were Christian, while only 64% of Australians identified as Christian (based on the 2006 census). By contrast, 0.01% of the chaplains were secular, whereas 19% of Australians identified as having no religion. Buddhism, the second largest religion, is followed by 2% of Australians, but only 0.03% of the school chaplains. Islam was followed by 1.7% of Australians, but only 0.9% of school chaplains. Judaism is the only religion which had a roughly proportionate representation, with 0.45% of the Australian population following the religion, and 0.5% of school chaplains. \n\nIt was announced in May 2014 that the provision to allow secular welfare workers under NSCP would be removed, changing the definition of chaplain to someone ordained, commissioned or endorsed by a recognised religious institution. From December 2014, the 623 schools who were then hiring a secular welfare worker had to either hire a chaplain instead or go without either.\n\nNSCP has been controversial since it was announced by John Howard in 2006. The NSCP is most commonly opposed on the grounds that chaplains are under-qualified to deal with vulnerable young people, that it is not appropriate to have a religious worker in a public school, and that the money spent on the programme is better needed elsewhere, such as to help children with disabilities. A July 2011 report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman recommended changes in guidelines after it was found that some chaplains provided one-on-one counselling when not qualified to do so. Complaints have also been made that chaplains have used their position to recruit children to Christianity in breach of government guidelines. The number of complaints specifically regarding proselytising was 34 in 2011, 5 in 2012 and 1 in 2013. Complaints have also been made that chaplains have handed out literature stating homosexuality is wrong, that condoms promote promiscuity and are not effective for use as a contraceptive. Overall complaints about any aspect of the chaplaincy programme that were made to the relevant department was 93 in 2011, 51 in 2012 and 34 in 2013. Of the 85 between 2012 and 2013, 60% could not be substantiated. An online petition opposing the 2014 funding increase for the NSCP was signed by over 180,000 people.\n\nIn 2010 whilst she was Prime Minister, Julia Gillard voiced her support for the NSCP. In 2011 Peter Garrett publicly stated his support for the programme, though in a 2014 book review he stated \"the line between chaplains acting to support students in the provision of general pastoral care and proselytising was too easily crossed\". Other politicians supporting the programme include Senator Eric Abetz.\n\nThe Australian Psychological Society has repeatedly criticised the NSCP. The director of the Black Dog Institute has expressed concern at the funding of chaplaincy over programmes backed by scientific evidence. Associate Professor Andrea Reupert, director of Monash University's mental health in schools project described a chaplain's comments to a student suffering from an eating disorder that she was \"hungering for the word of the Lord\" as inappropriate and appalling. The programme is also opposed by the Australian Education Union, and the New South Wales Teachers Federation.\n\nBoth the NSW Catholic Education Commission and the Anglican Education Commission do not have a position on chaplains in NSW government schools.\n\n"}

The organization also includes a network of 300-plus emissaries who are currently serving in positions of spiritual and educational leadership across the globe in North America, South America, Central America, Australia, and New Zealand.\nOTS has initiatied numerous programs in the realm of women's leadership and empowerment, leadership training, Jewish outreach, and social action, which have received both national and international acclaim for their groundbreaking nature. OTS has stated that its primary guiding principle is to ensure the accessibility of Judaism to each and every Jew--particularly addressing populations which had been previously marginalized, disenfranchised or alienated. \n\nOTS's programs for women have opened doors in the realm of Jewish Orthodox female scholarship and leadership that had previously been shut to the entire female population. OTS started the first school to teach post-high school women Talmud on a high level. OTS’s women’s college features the largest women’s beit midrash [study hall] in Jewish history. The college has produced female leaders of Jewish communities worldwide, including the first female to officially serve as the director of a rabbinical court.\n\nOTS's women's college developed a program specifically for women with special needs. The curriculum allows participants to acquire both learning and vocational skills, build independence and improve self-esteem, while expanding their love of Torah, Israel, and the Jewish people. The program had proven so successful that in 2017, a parallel program was established for young men. \n\nAnother OTS program enables religious women to serve in the Israeli army: where previously these women were forced to choose between service to their country and living an observant lifestyle, now they are inducted as a group and strengthened by intense study before, during and after their service.\n\nOTS also opened the first school in the world to train women and certify them as advocates in the Rabbinical Courts. Only because of OTS’s appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court did women win the legal right to practice in the Courts –an arena which was, previously open only to men. The school then opened a Legal Aid Center and Hotline for Israeli women who are agunot (The agunah is a woman literally “chained” to a dead or abusive marriage whose husband refuses to grant her a Jewish writ of divorce) and are in need of free advice and legal representation in matters pertaining to the process of obtaining a religious divorce.\n\nOhr Torah Stone’s Rabbinical Seminary prepares rabbis to be both fluent in secular learning as well as the Talmud. The curriculum is one which is immersed in contemporary concerns as well as Jewish law and legal texts. At the same time, the OTS Educators Institute comprehensively trains educators to teach Judaic Studies in both Orthodox and non-Orthodox state and community schools across Israel and the Diaspora.\n\nAn additional OTS yeshiva is geared towards young men both with and without previous yeshiva backgrounds from North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia.\n\nHundreds of OTS-trained teachers and spiritual leaders have served in communities spanning the globe. \n\nMany of the OTS graduates have joined the ranks of OTS trained Jewish Cultural Facilitators who provide formal and informal Jewish education for Israelis of all ages and backgrounds. This initiative works in conjunction with Israeli Community Centers. Media coverage has reported that these facilitators actively promote Jewish values, national unity, and heritage awareness in a non-coercive environment.\n\nOTS has established 6 modern Orthodox high schools within the Jerusalem and Gush Etzion regions. All of these high schools offer official matriculation and have been awarded recognition of excellence from the Israeli Ministry of Education.\n\nEach year, OTS sends spiritual and educational leaders to serve as emissaries in Jewish communities all over the world. These emissaries are active in synagogues, campuses and schools, and Jewish communities across the globe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24390", "title": "Paradox", "text": "Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.\n\nSome logical paradoxes are known to be invalid arguments but are still valuable in promoting critical thinking.\n\nSome paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is Russell's paradox, which questions whether a \"list of all lists that do not contain themselves\" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or predicates were flawed. Others, such as Curry's paradox, are not yet resolved.\n\nExamples outside logic include the ship of Theseus from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, M.C. Escher featured perspective-based paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.\n\nIn common usage, the word \"paradox\" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. ironic or unexpected, such as \"the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking\".\n\nCommon themes in paradoxes include self-reference, infinite regress, circular definitions, and confusion between different levels of abstraction.\n\nPatrick Hughes outlines three laws of the paradox:\n\nOther paradoxes involve false statements (\"'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary\", a simple paradox) or half-truths and the resulting biased assumptions. This form is common in howlers.\n\nFor example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road. The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed. The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency surgery. Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, \"I can't operate on this boy. He's my son.\"\n\nThe apparent paradox is caused by a hasty generalization, for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true. The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.\n\nParadoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or language, and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality. Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to logicians and philosophers. \"This sentence is false\" is an example of the well-known liar paradox: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. Russell's paradox, which shows that the notion of \"the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves\" leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.\n\nThought-experiments can also yield interesting paradoxes. The grandfather paradox, for example, would arise if a time-traveler were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the butterfly effect, or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.\n\nOften a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise. In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.\n\nW. V. Quine (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:\n\nA fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.\n\nA taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Heraclitus, Bhartrhari, Meister Eckhart, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and G.K. Chesterton, among many others. Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the \"Philosophical Fragments\" that\nBut one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow. But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall. This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.\n\nA paradoxical reaction to a drug is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a sedative or sedated by a stimulant. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a benzodiazepine.\n\n\n"}

Since its creation in November 2006 the SCQF Partnership, which is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity, has aimed to: ensure that, where appropriate, all assessed learning and qualifications are included within the Framework and extend the recognition of informal and non-formal learning; fully develop and promote the Framework as a lifelong learning tool; and develop relationships with other frameworks internationally.\n\nIts members are the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education; College Development Network; the Scottish Qualifications Authority; and Universities Scotland. \n\nScottish higher education institutions had long used the \"SCOTCAT\" (\"Scottish Credit Accumulation and Transfer\") system for equating courses from different institutions. \"SCOTCAT\" had three levels. Level 1 was equivalent to University 1st Year, an HNC or a Certificate of Higher Education (Cert HE). Level 2 was equivalent to University 2nd Year, an HND or a Diploma of Higher Education. Level 3 was equivalent to Years 3 and 4 at a Scottish University, and generally these credits lead to a Special or Honours Degree.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Scottish Qualifications Authority by the merger of the Scottish Examinations Board and SCOTVEC, efforts were made to unite the different levels of vocational and academic qualifications. The aim was to make it easier for employers and education institutions to understand the level to which a person had been educated. A secondary aim was to remove prejudice against vocational and non-traditional qualifications.\n\nFollowing from these two efforts, all the education and training providers in Scotland agreed to create a common framework for all qualifications, both current and historical. This led to the development of a 12-level framework with courses, units, modules and clusters being placed at a specific level with a credit weighting.\n\nChanges have been made to Higher Education level courses to prepare the Scottish system for the Bologna process.\n\nThe Framework has 12 levels.\n\n"}

There were two separate multi-round competitions every year: for higher education (universities) and general education (starting from 7th to 10th/11th grade). Both competitions had several rounds, and winners from lower rounds would go to the next round. Not only individual members, but teams were awarded too. The main difference between two Olympiads was that the school one had separate threads for every grade, while the university one was for all students.\n\nBoth Olympiads had the same format of the contests. Students would come in teams representing their location, e.g. schools or republics. Each contest could have 2-3 parts. For instance, the Republican round of University Olympiads on physics could have three parts: theory, lab and computer modeling. All students were given the same set of problems to solve. They would work on solutions strictly individually - no teamwork was allowed - and then they were scored by judges. Team scores were simply sum of individual member scores. Earlier rounds could take just one round, while the later rounds could span for a week having several parts.\n\nContests were conducted on many subject of Soviet school curriculum such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and others. These Olympiads had several levels based on Soviet Union's administrative structure. These were: School, District (\"Raion\"), City, Regional (\"Oblast\"), Republican and All-Union contests. These competitions were organized separate for every school grade. Depending on the subject and geographical region the highest round of the Olympiads varied from the All-Union level in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry to the Regional level in some other disciplines.\n\nIn addition, at certain time Moscow carried out joint \"Olympiads in Linguistics and Mathematics\" (Олимпиада по языкознанию и математике). After each such Olympiad its problems were printed in the \"Science and Life\" (\"Наука и Жизнь\") popular science magazine. There were numerous other Olympiads in Moscow including interdisciplinary \"Lomonosov tour\".\n\nBesides, there were correspondence Olympiads, in particular, Olympiads carried out by some newspapers, journals and universities. One of the important correspondence Olympiads was organized by the Kvant magazine. Its winners were admitted to the Republican round of the All-Union Physics and Mathematics Olympiads.\n\nAlso, there were team contests organized for schools to compete for District, City or Regional honors. There also was a \"Physics fight\" contest organized by the Moscow State University. In maths, there were contests organized for cities to compete for Republican and All-Union honors.\n\nEvery school was supposed to have a school round competition. Judges were from subject teachers. The winners from this round could compete in the next round, representing their schools. Each grade could send 3-4 students to the next round. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the school year.\n\nThis round was for schools of the administrative division called \"Raion\" (district), a district of a larger city or of an oblast. Area rounds were organized by RaiONOs (Russian abbreviation for \"District Department of People's Education\"). Participants would come in teams, but both teams and individual members were recognized and awarded. The winners form teams representing their areas, consisting of 3-4 students from every grade. Usually, area rounds on each subjects took place in different days, so one student could participate in competitions on several subjects. This round was usually conducted in the first half of the school year.\n\nThis round was for students of the big cities, which had several areas (Raions). The winners from the previous round could participate. City round was organized by GorONO, i.e., City Department of People's Education. Again, the winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their city. This round's contests on different subjects were conducted on the same day, so a student could compete only in one subject. Depending on a demographic situation, in some places this round was skipped. This round was usually conducted in the first half of the school year.\n\nThis round was for students of the whole region (oblast). The winners from the previous round could participate. Regional round was organized by OblONO, i.e. regional council of education. Again, the winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their region (Oblast). They were joined by the winners of the Kvant magazine competition and of the republican and All-Union olympiads of the previous year. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year.\n\nThis round was a major round, since it recognized the best students of the 15 Republics of the Soviet Union, which are now Independent Countries. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Republican round was organized by Republican Ministries of Education. The winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their republic. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year. In Russia the competition was conducted separately in four zones and was known as the zonal round. Moscow, Leningrad, a few specialized mathematical schools, and the schools of the transportation ministry system did not compete at the republican level and sent their teams directly to the All-Union round.\n\nThis round was a final round for Soviet students. It recognized the best students of the Soviet Union in each subject for every grade. In America, it would be on a national level. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. This round was organized by Soviet Ministry of Education. This round was usually conducted at the end of the school year.\n\nThe winners were awarded with the diplomas. Material prizes were minor and usually included scientific books that were otherwise difficult to obtain.\n\nVladimir Drinfeld who was later awarded a 1990 Fields medal for the development of quantum groups is considered by many as the most outstanding \"mathematical sportsman\" in the history of the All-Union Mathematical Olympiads.\nHis first scientific publication was based on a generalization of an Olympic problem.\nMany other winners of the Mathematical Olympiad became outstanding mathematicians and physicists. Yuri Matiyasevich who solved the 10th Hilbert problem in 1970 was the absolute winner of the 1964 Olympiad.\nGrisha Perelman also had an exceptional Olympic record.\n\nContests were conducted on several subject of Soviet higher education curriculum such as Math, Physics, Programming. These Olympiads had several rounds. The rounds were formed following Soviet Union's administrative structure. So, there were University, Republican and All-Union rounds. There was one contest for all students regardless of their year in the university.\n\nEvery university was supposed to have its own competition. Judges were from faculty staff. The winners from this round could compete in the next round, representing their university. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the school year.\n\nThis round was a major round, since it recognized the best university students in each of the republics. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Teams had up to a dozen students each. Republican round was organized by Republican Ministries of Education. The winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their republic. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year.\n\nThis round was a final round for Soviet university students. It recognized the best students of the Soviet Union in each subject. In America, it would be on a national level. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Teams had 4-5 members. This round was organized by Soviet Ministry of Education. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the next school year.\n\nThe winners were awarded with diplomas and minor material prizes in some cases.\n\nAn interesting experiment was olympiads in linguistics and mathematics, at which students were challenged to solve problems in both seemingly non-related domains. It was argued that problems in linguistics often require logical reasoning akin to that required in mathematics. After the olympiads, the problems (and solutions) were published in the \"Science and Life\" popular science journal.\n\n\n"}

Hubert Pailissen, SMA, in early 1949, said; \"In this country, scarcely 15 percent of the school-going youth are girls. The people now begin to realize that more must be done in favour of this much–neglected part of the human race, and the chiefs, conscious of their duty towards their subjects, asked us to establish schools for girls in their respective villages…. But to obtain results, it is necessary that the direction of girls' schools should be in the hands of \"'Sisters of a Teaching Order\"' with the necessary experience in the latest development of pedagogic methods.\"\n\nHence, on 18 October 1947, the first St. Louis Sisters arrived in the country. They were to continue the running of an already-established elementary school, the St. Bernadette School, now popularly called \"'Roman Girls\"'. True to character, the St. Louis Sisters, who never do things by the halves, decided to establish a new secondary school on the same compound.\n\nIn 1952, St. Louis Secondary was opened, with an initial group of 12 girls. Only some out of this group survived to join the second group of 1953 to make 42. By December 1957, when the surviving group wrote their \"O\" Level Examination, they numbered 11.\n\nMost of the salaries of the Sisters, funds raised, and Diocesan contributions went into developing the compound and acquiring necessary inputs.\n\nThe church wanted the Apostolate of Education to develop the essential task of forming strong and enlightened Christians, capable of exercising much influence in social and political affairs. Perhaps, there is no branch that needed more attention than female education.\n\nLong before \"Girl child\" education became a popular slogan, the Catholic Church and St. Louis understood the depth of its importance. That is why the St. Louis Sisters and the Church always adopted an holistic approach to education.\n\nDespite staffing and financial difficulties, the student population continued to grow. It was clear that further accommodation had to be provided. Through the kindness of Nana Osei Agyemang Prempeh II (the then Asantehene of blessed memory), the requisite site was given, and funds were provided by both the Diocese and the Sisters.\n\nSucceeding reports of inspectors testified to the excellence of teaching given by the Sisters. These reports paid tribute to the school’s \"\"air of efficiency\" and its \"very good organization and discipline\"\". It was upon these commendations that the Ministry of Education, in 1960, wished the Sisters would open a Training College on the site on which St. Louis Secondary School now stands. That same year, 1960, a change-over took place, and St. Louis Secondary School moved to its present site. The foundation stone was laid by the late Otumfuo Osei Agyemang Prempeh II, Asantehene, on 25 March 1960 (the feast of Annunciation) and was blessed by Rt. Rev. Andrew van den Bronk (SMA), then Bishop of Kumasi.\n\nIn the same year, the Sixth Form Arts class began with five students. In 1964, the Administration Block was built and dedicated appropriately to the \"Annunciation\" (for we have \"good news\" to tell). More buildings were put up to meet the school's expanding needs. In 1964, the Sixth Form Science stream was started. Past students will recall the butterfly collection with Sister Elizabeth (Mary Roch) and Sr. Philomena McGuinness, (Mary Iosagan), the delightful training in Music and Singing that left such a rich tradition, as well as the insightful Drama performance. There was also the planting of shrubs, shade trees, and general landscaping with Sr. Aideen. Today, the school has many more buildings, including a library complex.\n\nTo attend the shortage of missionary priests and nuns, the students formed a strong lay apostolate to go to the outlying compounds to teach Catechism, prepare candidates for Baptism, and visit lapsed Christians to re-awaken their faith. Students also got an opportunity to broaden their outlook by visiting neighbouring countries.\n\nIn the early 1970s the school began admitting boys into Sixth Form. This continued until the early 1980s when the program ended due to the problem of control. \n\nThe school maintains an ongoing alliance with the Opoku Ware Senior High School, popularly called \"AkataSlopsa\".\n\n\n"}

Several prestige dialects have developed around the major urban centers of Skopje, Bitola, Veles and Prilep.\n\nIt was only in the 1940s, however, that the Macedonian language was able to be implemented, after being formally declared the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The rapid pace at which the standardization process took place was in part owing to an already existing interdialect (see Spoken Macedonian). The standard language is phonologically and morphologically based on the central Western Macedonian dialects (in particular, the Prilep-Bitola and Skopje-Veles dialect) with its lexicon influenced by all Macedonian dialects.\n\nEducated speakers will usually use, or aim to use, the formal standard in public settings and in most forms of written language. Probably the best exemplars of this type of speech, though not always the case, are actors, teachers and writers. A high degree of social prestige and respect is assigned to those who correctly use the standard language in the appropriate situations. In extremely rare examples, some speakers will use the formal code exclusively in everyday conversational speech.\n\nWhile acquisition of the formal code constitutes a significant part of elementary education, during which children are taught the relationship between their local dialect and the target code, the formal literary language. Most educated speakers switch to the colloquial register of the standard language, Spoken Macedonian, when communicating in less formal circumstances, but tend to aim for more formal usage in circumstances where educated speakers are present or as a sort of \"interdialect\" in the case where the company is not exclusively local.\n"}

She was previously owned and operated by the Tall Ships Youth Trust (TSYT). She was primarily designed to provide young people with the opportunity to undertake voyages as character-building exercises, rather than pure sail-training. She was also used for adult voyages and holidays, which helped subsidise the operation of the ship.\n\nIn the late 1990s the two schooners (\"Malcolm Miller\" and \"Sir Winston Churchill\") then owned by the Tall Ships Youth Trust (then called the Sail Training Association (STA)) were showing their age and becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. The hulls for the two new brigs (\"Stavros S Niarchos\" and her sister ship, \"Prince William\") were obtained half-completed from another project in Germany. These were transported to Appledore Ship Yards in Devon, where they were modified to the TSYT's requirements, and fitted out. She was completed in January 2000. The rig was designed by Michael Willoughby, who wrote a few comments on the overall design of the brigs.\n\nFollowing completion of sea trials she was handed over to the STA at Avonmouth Docks. She sailed for her maiden voyage, a training voyage for permanent and volunteer crew, on 13 February 2000. She arrived in Weymouth, UK three days later.\n\nDuring that trip she encountered a south westerly gale as she came round Land's End. She achieved an indicated speed through the water of under lower tops'ls and fore topmast stays'l alone.\n\nIn January 2006 \"Stavros S Niarchos\" rescued the two women crew from a vessel taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing race. The rescue was made in heavy weather, with the assistance of a USCG Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. In late 2006 TSYT Captain Darren Naggs was awarded the Thomas Gray Silver Medal of the Marine Society, for exemplary seamanship during the rescue.\n\n\"Stavros S Niarchos\" is a brig, that is a two masted vessel with square sails on both masts. She carries five yards on each mast (moving up: Course, Lower Topsail, Upper Topsail, Topgallant and Royal), and a total of 18 sails. In good conditions she has managed speeds of just over .\n\"Stavros S Niarchos\" (and her sister ship, \"Prince William\") normally sail with a crew of up to 67 people. The crew consists of 6 permanent salaried crew, 11 to 13 volunteer crew and up to 48 voyage crew. The voyage crewmembers, those paying to sail on the ship, are divided into three watches (Red, White and Blue) of 16. Each of these watches has a Watch Leader from the volunteer crew. The remaining crew are assigned as follows:\n\nPermanent crew:\n\nVolunteer crew:\n\nOn youth voyages the two Youth Mentors (YMs) are responsible for the various entertainment activities and competitions as well helping with any problems young people aboard may have. They are usually professionally qualified teachers or youth workers.\n\nThe 2 or 3 deckhands act as assistants to the bosun and as such are mostly concerned with the cleaning and maintenance of the ship.\n\nIn November 2011, the Tall Ships Youth Trust announced plans to sell \"Stavros S Niarchos\", its last remaining tall ship, to focus on smaller vessels. Much of this is due to the high cost of running a vessel of such size due to pilotage charges and mooring fees for a vessel over 400 tonnes. This has become a contentious issue with the trust and its supporters where some see this as the abandonment of the tall ships for yachts within the trust. For others this is a return to the days of \"Sir Winston Churchill\" and \"Malcolm Miller\" which as smaller vessels didn't incur these charges and perhaps had better sailing and penetration and operation within UK sailing ports and waters. Although the schooners were smaller, some say they ran a much better programme and fulfilled the mandate of the former Sail Training Association, before it became TSYT.\n\nThe ship will continue in operation until a buyer is found, which the Trust expects to take several years based on their experience of selling \"Prince William\".\n\nThe ship was sold at auction on 30 September 2017 by C.W. Kellock & Co. Ltd., a London-based ship broker. It is no longer part of the Tall Ships Youth Trust fleet. On 16 October 2017, the ship's AIS broadcast name changed to \"Sunset\".\n"}

The study mama phenomenon began in 2000, after the Singapore Government relaxed its immigration policies to attract more foreigners. Most of the study mamas are from mainland China.\n\nThe Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore possesses records that suggest that there are at least 7,800 study mamas of various nationalities, with two-thirds of the 6,800 study mamas in Singapore in July 2005 coming from China. Of these 6,800 study mamas, only 1,000 have been issued work permits. Most working study mamas are employed in the service sector.\n\nIn an article in \"People's Daily\", it is estimated that peidu mamas require RMB¥1 million (approx S$217,000) of living and education expenses for their child to receive education from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 in Singapore. \nThe Singapore Government allowed them to come to Singapore, primarily to accompany their children during their studies here. Peidu mamas are only allowed to obtain work permits after staying in Singapore for a year and are permitted to work in certain service sectors only.\n\nThe government places restriction on the employment of study mamas, arguing that their primary purpose of stay here is to take care of their children. Hence they should not be working, especially not as hostesses in bars or pubs at night. They are not allowed to work at food stalls, but can work in other services industries if given permits.\n\nIn October 2004, the daughter of a study mama, Huang Na went missing and was subsequently found murdered.\n\nIn June 2006, a female Chinese national who owned a massage parlour, which allegedly provided sex services to clients, was stabbed to death in Ang Mo Kio. This drew public and media attention to vice-related activities at some of these massage parlours. In early July 2006, the government conducted a crackdown on illegal employment at the parlours and imposed stricter regulation on their operations. This led some peidu mamas to hold a protest outside the Chinese Embassy, despite the prohibition of such gatherings in Singapore.\n"}

Its world premiere was at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women. The film grew out of an initiative by the FAWE, The Forum for African Women Educationalists, with additional support from the Rockefeller Foundation and UNICEF.\n\nThe film's purpose was to address, as Robertson puts it, \"the elephant in the room\" about girls in school and allow for discussion of attitudes about the effect of education on African girls and their societies. It is currently used for training within the Peace Corps who, in statements, have described the film as \"rich in its learning opportunities as well as being beautifully filmed.\"\n\n\"\"A film about men and women, about marriage... families... having babies, about tradition, and the modern world... about who goes to school in Africa... and why girls are missing.\" - Official tag-line.\"\n\nEvery year, girls in African schools \"go missing,\" from school classrooms. This film analyzes the stories of five schoolgirls and examines the causes and consequences of the high dropout rates among girls. The stories are told directly by Malawian and Guinean girls and their families.\nAlso presented is a group of elders from a Malinké village conversing about the issue.\n\n\"These Girls Are Missing\" was initially commissioned by FAWE, The Forum for African Women Educationalists, and premiered at the United Nations’ 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing. Because of its wide range of intended audiences, the film is available in seven languages: English, French, Malinké, Susu, Poular, Ki-Swahili and Chichewa.\n\nSince its release, the film has been distributed widely by the Ministries of Education in both Guinea and Malawi, and used in focus groups and workshops promoting girls’ education. FAWE also distributed the film unto associate members in Ministries of Education in Zanzibar, Angola, Cameroon, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Seychelles, Botswana, São Tomé e Principe, Mozambique, Uganda and Ghana.\n\nThe film has also screened at Cinema du Reel, Paris; CIES (Comparative and International Education Society) Conference, Buffalo, NY; Marymount Manhattan College, NY; and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University. It has also been screened for the U.S. State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development, Inter-American Development Bank, World Council for Comparative Education Societies and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe filmmakers also produced a shorter version of the film called The Girls Know It, released in 1997. It is hosted, on screen, by The Honorable Aicha Bah, Minister of Education in Guinea. The film is shorter, at 47 minutes and was released in 1997. It is available in seven languages as well. This 47-minute cut is available in the same seven languages as the 60-minute film.\n\nUNICEF, USAID, and the Peace Corps have made extensive use of \"These Girls Are Missing\" as a training and education tool.\n\nThe film received the Cine Golden Eagle under the Documentary Feature category and a Silver Plaque as part of the 31st annual Chicago International Film Festival.\n\nMarch, 1998 \"Moving Pictures Bulletin\" reviewed the film as analyzing and contrasting situations \"represent[ing] a new generation who may finally break the cycle of girls in Africa forced to miss out on their education.\"\n\n\n"}
