The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either visible spectrum photographs, images taken at non-visible wavelengths and displayed in false color, video footage, animations, artist’s conceptions, or micrographs that relate to space or cosmology. Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995. This initiative has received support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries.\n\nWhen APOD began it received only 14 page views on its first day.

It is located on King Alexander Boulevard, close to the Faculty of Law and adjacent to the Faculties of Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Architecture. Serves the educational and scientific needs of students, academics, and scientists. \"Library Day\" is the 24 of May, a day commemorating Slavic educators St. Cyril and Methodius.\nAt the founding of the Library, the collection contained 57,254 publications consisting of monographs and serials. Today, the library contains roughly 1,700,000 publications.\n\nThe library holdings include seminal works from all scientific fields, a large collection of local and foreign encyclopedias, bibliographies, dictionaries, professional and scientific journals, university publications, textbooks, and a significant collection of doctoral dissertations. The library also includes a collection of rare objects where manuscripts, old printed books, old magazines and newspapers, archival collections, as well as a collection of maps, doctoral, master's and specialist works are housed. In particular in the library's manuscript collection, there are several invaluable Cyrillic and oriental books.\n\nThe University Library, one of the largest research libraries in the Balkans serving the educational and research needs of its academic population, originates from the library of the Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia. Established in 1838, the Lyceum was considered the best school in Serbia at the time and had a library that was used by its professors and students as well as by students of the Belgrade Higher School. Its funds were made up of gifts from local and foreign donors, and a sample copy of the Principality of Serbia. According to the provisions for establishing the Lyceum, the librarian had to be one of its teachers, the first of which was Dr. Janko Šafarik (1814–1876), philologist and professor of history. The Library in 1850 had 927 volumes.\n\nBelgrade Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia was converted into the Belgrade Higher School by the law of 24 September 1863. The school's library kept only professional publications, while others publications were handed over to the National Library. When in 1905 the Belgrade Higher School became the University library, the library was disbanded. The funds, according to scientific fields, were divided by the appropriate faculty seminars. The most valuable part of the collection went to the library of Serbian seminars. Soon it was realized that the university required a general scientific library, but the outbreak of World War I delayed its establishment. Part of this fund were received after establishing the University Library.\nAfter the war, because of the great suffering of Serbian libraries, from abroad books began to arrive in large numbers to the address of the University Library, although she was only established until January 1921. Since the proposal for a decision of the Faculty of Philosophy, adopted by the University Senate, came from prof. Pavle Popović, and he was appointed head of the \"Commission for the establishment of the University Library\". Shortly thereafter, in May 1921, prof. Uros Džonić was appointed trustee of the University Library, whom was temporarily given an office at the Faculty of Philosophy.\n\nOn the initiative of Serbian delegates in Washington, Dr. Slavko Grujić, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who had already built a series of libraries in the world, has agreed to approve $100,000 as a gift to the Serbian government to build and equip a library in Belgrade. After World War I, Belgrade was one of three \"front-line\" cities, badly damaged in the war, which were given a Carnegie library, the other two being Reims in France (which received a city library) and Leuven in Belgium (which received a university library). Belgrade's university library is the only Carnegie library in Central and Eastern Europe. Professor Slobodan Jovanović, former Rector of the University, managed personal commitment to the material means increase by government loans, in order to build a larger library, to meet the needs of the University. City of Belgrade has donated land, and the project was done by university professors, architects Dragutin Đordjević and Nikola Nestorović. So is built first and then the only building in Serbia, purpose-built for the library.\n\nThe library in a new building was officially opened on St. Cyril and Methodius, 24 May 1926. Professor Uros Džonić remained at the position of the Administrator to the beginning of the Second World War. In this work he was assisted by a committee whose president was prof. Dr. Pavle Popović. The main task of this institution was that \"as an independent university institution helps cultivate the science and in the capacity of research libraries serve not only students and faculty of Belgrade University, but also to all those involved in science.\" During World War II, under German occupation, the library did not work with the audience, and part of the building was occupied by the German army. Through the efforts of the staff of the library, its collections are still preserved. After liberation, the trustee is set to be Milica Prodanović, former librarian of the University Library. To celebrate the centenary of the birth of Svetozar Marković in 1946, this institution received its present name of the University Library \"Svetozar Markovic\".\nIn the period after the Second World War began the application of modern methods in the organization and processing of funds. A public professional directory was formed, in collaboration with the National Library of Serbia made a rule book for cataloging by the Association of Librarians of Serbia, which marked the beginning of equalization processing of library materials in the library of Serbia. Contacts were established with university and national libraries in the country and abroad. It also embarked on an aggressive work sharing and interlibrary loan publications. A service for information was formed and cooperation with the universities, seminaries, institutes and other libraries of the University of Belgrade was expanded.\n\nDepartment for Scientific Information was transformed in 2008 into the Department of scientific information and education. This section traces the development of the system of scientific information and communication, browsing databases from all scientific fields. The main activity of the department is information literacy, particularly undergraduate and graduate students, preparing materials for different types of education tailored to specific user groups, work on continuous professional development, professional organization of librarians of university libraries in Serbia, academic libraries as well as library research institutes and institutions. The Department prepares informants, guides and other informational materials about the library, preparing informational materials for the library website; engaged in the research and analysis within the field of information science, in accordance with the requirements and needs of universities and other users; collaborating on the development of library and information systems and scientific and technological information on universities in Serbia and in the system of coordinated procurement publications in print and electronic form; developing international cooperation.\n\nThe Library has developed an educational program that organizes and implements department for scientific information and education, and library specialists from other departments. As a parent institution organizes special workshops for librarians, faculty, and research institutions. Particular attention is paid to the education of young researchers at master's and doctoral studies. Education is organized in the library, as well as abroad, at universities and institutes, members of the University of Belgrade, but also in universities and research institutions throughout Serbia. Thanks to this, the number of downloaded articles from electronic services available through CoBSON-a (\"Serbian Library Consortium for Coordinated Acquisition\") each year is increasing, and the number of examined and partially downloaded e-books. Educational programs are varied and adapted to the learners.\n\nThe library organizes lectures by prominent international scholars and professionals dedicated to the scientific community of Serbia and librarians academic library network. Organized by the Library, in collaboration with other institutions of the University of Belgrade, has been held for more than 20 of these lectures via video link or live, with speakers from the EU, the US and the region.\n\nDepartment of Scientific Information and education by 2002 trained individual users, but has since started an organized training users in the form of group training such as presentations, lectures, interactive workshops and so on. The first group training were within the TEMPUS project, the target population consisted of academic librarians in the organization of the \"Community of Libraries of the University of Serbia\". Within the Community over the years have been organized various lectures and workshops on the themes established by the interest and needs of the user, and from 2014 to maintain accredited course \"Information Literacy in Libraries: commercial and non-commercial electronic information sources,\" in accordance with the Regulations of the Ministry of culture and Information of the Republic of Serbia that contribute to the evaluation of the librarian, and thus the improvement of the profession. The establishment CoBSON one of the most important activities of the department were numerous presentations and lectures are held at most colleges and institutes of the University of Belgrade as well as institutions throughout the country.\n\nMost of the presentations and lectures are available on the website of the University Library.\n\nLibGuides is a new type of multimedia, interactive web guide to all scientific fields. What was formerly called the reference links are now in a much clearer, more organized, meaningful and attractive way to achieve this library guides.\n\nIt is a web service that enables authorized users, librarians, without prior knowledge of web design to successfully and easily create, organize and update Web pages. The main objective of this is to provide in one place access to reliable electronic sources – commercial and those in open access. For each scientific discipline, in addition to texts, images, video recordings, are available and useful links to associations, conferences and other current information. LibGuides uses about 50,000 librarians in over 3,700 libraries worldwide. Created about 300,000 guides. Also, this guide allows you to download already existing guides from all over the community and work together more librarians in making guides.\n\nThe tendency in the development of modern librarianship is that the prospective user of a library in the country, at the same time become a user of all public libraries in the world. Thanks to interlibrary loan, which inevitably must follow the latest trends of the modern information society that relies increasingly on electronic forms of communication, greatly shortens the time required to obtain accurate and adequate information, bringing a sense of physical distance and the presence of the sources of information and users.\n\nThe purpose of local interlibrary loan identified primarily in meeting the demands and needs of the user – library, both for information and for their sources in different fields of science, culture and art. In addition, it is necessary to understand the needs and structure of the user to be in line with the dynamics of providing information, which again must be the result of more efficient activities of the department that deals with interlibrary loans. Changes in the expectations, requirements and user type affected the interlibrary loan in the University Library \"Svetozar Marković\", which represents the connection between classical or physical and digital lending, reflecting both the dual nature of the modern library.\n\nThe University Library \"Svetozar Marković\" in Belgrade can be searched by publication of an electronic catalog (OPAC).OPAS is an acronym of English words Online Public Access Catalog. OPAC at the library is used since 1989 along with card catalogs. Since 1998 card catalog is no longer updated, but new data is entered only in the electronic catalog. The loan was automated. It is available 24 hours a day via the Internet.\n\nThere are three types of search an electronic catalog: basic, intermediate and advanced.\n\nAuthor catalog of books from the fund of the University Library \"Svetozar Marković\" is divided into:\n\n\nSpecial catalogs are:\n\n\nUniversity library in their funds has over 30 separate libraries (legacies), which are stored as separate entities. They are very different in size and importance, but they are a great value, both in terms of content, as well as testimony about the characters to whom they belonged.\nAmong these libraries that have a special value are: \"Library of Joca Vujić\", one of the richest libraries of the Serbian national and cultural history and literature, which contains mostly books from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as very valuable manuscripts, documents and letters. Donated in 1932. \"Library of Gideon Dunđerski\" is in fact a library of famous Serbian collector of old books, bibliophile, Petar Stojadinovic from Novi Sad. These are mostly from the history and literature of the Serbian people. The library is significant to the study of Serbian national and cultural history. Donated in 1929. \"Library of Miroslav Premru\" obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1927. Contains old and rare books, sources for the history and literature of the Renaissance and the Reformation. \"Library of Dimitrije Mirtinović\", who lived and died in London, contains literature in philosophy, ethnology, anthropology, and Oriental art. The library was bequeathed to the University Library in 1956 and received \"Isidora Sekulic Library\" that contains books on literature and literary criticism, as well as manuscripts. The legacy consists of paintings, furniture and personal belongings. Memorial room is located in the reading room of the Department of rarities.\n\n\n\n"}

He was known primarily as a teacher whose students have included many prominent opera singers, but he also had a career as a singer himself both on the concert stage and in opera and musical theatre.\n\nFerro was born in New York as Daniel Eisen to a Jewish-American family. His father was Joseph Eisen, born in the province of Galicia, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his mother was Pauline Greenberg Eisen, born in Holyoke, Massachusetts to a father from New York and a mother from the Russian Empire, now southern Ukraine. He graduated from the Juilliard School of Music (in 1948) and from Columbia University. A Fulbright scholarship enabled him to pursue further vocal studies in Austria at the Salzburg Mozarteum and in Italy at the Accademia Chigiana and the Accademia Santa Cecilia. Early in his career he changed his surname from Eisen, the German word for iron, to Ferro, the Italian word for iron.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Ferro was member of the Graz Opera Company in Austria where his appearances included \"Mathis der Maler\" (Truchsess von Waldburg) and \"Parsifal\" (Titurel). He also appeared on European concert stages and toured with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. When Ferro returned to the United States in 1956, he took up an appointment as Associate Professor in the voice department at Butler University in Indiana. The 1960s found him in back in New York City, teaching at Hunter College and later at the Manhattan School of Music where he became chairman of the voice department. During that time, he also performed in both musical theatre and opera, including leading roles in musicals with St. John Terrell's Company and other summer stock theatres, a revival of \"The Saint of Bleecker Street\" in New York City, and concert performances of \"Werther\" in Carnegie Hall and \"William Tell\" at Lincoln Center.\n\nIn 1972, Ferro joined the faculty of the Juilliard School, a post he held until his retirement as \"vocal faculty emeritus\" in 2006, after which he continued to give master classes there. However, his voice teaching extended far beyond Juilliard, both through his private voice studio in New York, and his master classes at many of the world's conservatories, including the Conservatoire de musique, Montréal, Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Royal College of Music, Stockholm, Manhattan School of Music, and the Accademia Chigiana, where he was once a student. In France, he taught at the Opéra de Paris, Paris Conservatory, and Fondation Royaumont; in 1988, he was made an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government for his services to music. The many prominent opera singers who studied with Ferro include Evelyn Lear, Thomas Stewart, Kathleen Battle, Alan Titus, Rosalind Elias, Patricia Brooks, Ruth Welting, Youngok Shin, and Richard Stilwell.\n\nIn 1995, Ferro founded the Daniel Ferro Vocal Program, which takes place each summer in Greve in Chianti, Italy. The program includes master classes and private voice lessons for young singers, as well as public performances in the Castello di Verrazzano and the town's piazza and churches.

{"id": "551132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=551132", "title": "Diploma mill", "text": "Diploma mill\n\nA diploma mill (also known as a degree mill) is a company or organization that claims to be a higher education institution but provides illegitimate academic degrees and diplomas for a fee. These degrees may claim to give credit for relevant life experience, but should not be confused with legitimate prior learning assessment programs. They may also claim to evaluate work history or require submission of a thesis or dissertation for evaluation to give an appearance of authenticity. Diploma mills are frequently supported by accreditation mills, set up for the purpose of providing an appearance of authenticity. The term may also be used pejoratively to describe an accredited institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate. An individual may or may not be aware that the degree they have obtained is not wholly legitimate. In either case, legal issues can arise if the qualification is used in résumés.\n\nThe term \"diploma mill\" originally denotes an institution providing diplomas on an intensive and profit-making basis, like a factory. More broadly, it describes any institution that offers qualifications which are not accredited nor based on proper academic assessment.\n\nWhile the terms \"degree mill\" and \"diploma mill\" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn. A \"degree mill\" issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate, while a \"diploma mill\" issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities.\n\nAcademic diplomas may be legitimately awarded without any study as a recognition of authority or experience. When given extraordinarily, such degrees are called honorary degrees or \"honoris causa\" degrees. Also, in some universities, holders of a lower degree (such as a bachelor's degree) may be routinely awarded honorary higher degrees (such as a master's degree) without study.\n\nThe term \"diploma mill\" may also be used pejoratively to describe a legitimate institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate, such as for-profit schools.\n\nRelated practices are direct document forgery of certificates and corrupt buying of degrees from otherwise legitimate universities, although neither require a separate \"mill\".\n\nDiploma mills share a number of features that differentiate them from respected institutions, although some legitimate institutions may exhibit some of the same characteristics.\n\nThe most notable feature of diploma mills is that they lack accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. (Note, however, that not all unaccredited institutions of higher learning are diploma mills). Diploma mills therefore employ various tactics in an attempt to appear more legitimate to potential students.\n\nSome diploma mills claim accreditation by an accreditation mill while referring to themselves as being \"fully accredited\". Accreditation mills based in the United States may model their websites after real accrediting agencies overseen by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Another typical ploy is for mills to claim to be internationally recognized by organizations such as UNESCO. UNESCO has no authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies, and has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.\n\nSome diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating unrecognized accrediting bodies as well. These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, and previous learning, and may even require the submission of a dissertation or thesis in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy.\n\nAs diploma mills are typically licensed to do business, it is common practice within the industry to misrepresent their business license as indicating government approval of the institution. Promotional materials may use words denoting a legal status such as \"licensed\", \"state authorized\", or \"state-approved\" to suggest an equivalence to accreditation.\n\nSome advertise other indicators of authenticity that are not relevant to academic credentials. For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are \"attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed notary\". In reality notarization only certifies that the document was signed by the person named.\n\nDiploma mills are frequently named to sound confusingly similar to those of prestigious accredited academic institutions. Despite the fact that trademark law is intended to prevent this situation, diploma mills continue to employ various methods to avoid legal recourse. Several diploma mills have adopted British-sounding names, similar but not identical to the names of legitimate universities, apparently to take advantage of the United Kingdom's reputation for educational quality in other parts of the world. Some examples of British-sounding names used by diploma mills are \"Shaftesbury University\", \"University of Dunham\", \"Redding University\", and \"Suffield University\".\n\nThe school's website may well not have an .edu domain, or other country-specific equivalent, since registration of such names is typically restricted. However, enforcement has sometimes been less restrictive, and an .edu domain cannot be taken as verification of school quality or reputation. Some diploma mills use an .ac top-level domain name, which resembles genuine second-level academic domain names like ac.uk but is in fact the ccTLD for Ascension Island. To prevent misuse of their names in this way, some legitimate academic institutions have registered .ac domains.\n\nCompared to legitimate institutions, diploma mills tend to have drastically lowered academic requirements, if any at all. Depending on the institution, students may be required to purchase textbooks, take tests, and submit homework, but degrees are commonly conferred after little or no study.\n\nInstead of \"hard sciences\", where competence is easier to verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often esoteric and may be based on a pseudoscience like astrology or naturopathy. Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult.\n\nDegree mills typically offer little or no interaction with professors. Even if comments and corrections to coursework are given, they may have no bearing on the degree which is awarded. In other cases professors may serve only to write compliments to the student that can be given as references.\n\nSince diploma mills provide little in the way of teaching, there is usually no need for teaching facilities. The school tends to have no library, personnel, publications or research. In short, very little that is tangible can be found about the institution. If teaching is offered, the professors may themselves hold advanced degrees from the diploma mill itself or from other unaccredited institutions. They may also sport legitimate qualifications that are unrelated to the subject they teach.\n\nDoctoral theses and dissertations from the institution will not be available from University Microfilms International, a national repository, or even the institution's own library, if it has one. The address given by the bogus institution is often a postal box, mail forwarding service or suite number. There are legitimate distance learning institutions with limited facilities, however, but legitimate universities make their authority clear. For academics, publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals are important for establishing scientific credentials. However, in diploma mills, the research is either absent, fake or purely self-published without any external review. This may be unfortunately hard to spot, since fake journals also exist. Faculty pages with bios and research may even be stolen from legitimate universities.\n\nBuyers often use the diplomas to claim academic credentials for use in securing employment. For example, a schoolteacher might buy a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to superintendent. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months from the time of enrollment, and back-dating is possible. Academic credit may be offered for \"life experience,\" a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution. This should not be confused with legitimate programs offering recognition of prior learning, which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results.\n\nTuition and fees are charged on a per-degree basis rather than by term or by course. Diploma mills are often advertised using e-mail spam or other questionable methods. Legitimate institutions use traditional advertising and high school recruitment. Prospective students are encouraged to \"enroll now\" before tuition or fees are increased. They may be told that they qualify for a fellowship, scholarship or grant, or offered deals to sign up for multiple degrees at the same time. Promotional literature might contain grammatical and spelling errors, words in Latin, extravagant or pretentious language, and sample diplomas. The school's website may look amateurish or unprofessionally made.\n\nDegrees and diplomas issued by diploma mills have been used to obtain employment, raises, or clients. Even if issuing or receiving a diploma mill qualification is legal, passing it off as an accredited one for personal gain is a crime in many jurisdictions. In some cases the diploma mill may itself be guilty of an offense, if it knew or ought to have known that the qualifications it issues are used for fraudulent purposes. Diploma mills could also be guilty of fraud if they mislead customers into believing that the qualifications they issue are accredited or recognized, or make false claims that they will lead to career advancement, and accept money on the basis of these claims.\n\nSimilar to tax havens, diploma mills frequently employ jurisdiction shopping, operating in another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or prosecution is unlikely. Splitting the business across jurisdictions can be a way to avoid authorities. A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.\n\nAuthor John Bear, a distance learning and diploma mills expert, has written that fake degrees are risky for buyers and consumers:\n\nIn Australia, it is a criminal offence to call an institution a university, or issue university degrees, without authorisation through an act of federal or state parliaments.\n\nUnder the Higher Education Support Act 2003, corporations wishing to use the term \"university\" require approval from the relevant government minister, the Minister for Education ().\n\nThe corporate regulator Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) places strict controls on corporations wishing to use the term \"university\" and if the applicant does not intend to provide education services the name must not imply a connection with an existing university.\n\nThe Corporations Regulations 2001 lists the 39 academic organisations permitted to use the title \"university\".\n\nThe use of higher education terms (such as \"degree\") is protected in state legislation, e.g. Higher Education (Qld) Act 2003.\n\nAccording to the laws on higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina the terms \"university\", \"faculty\", \"academy\" and \"university of applied sciences\" can be used only by accredited educational institutions. Accreditation is independently assessed by the Agency for Development of Higher Education and Quality Assurance and formally conferred by the Ministry of Education and Science for each canton, entity or district. Only these institutions are allowed to award academic degrees and diplomas.\n\nIllegal use of academic titles or academic degrees and \"non-accredited diplomas\" may lead to prosecution, conviction, fines or even imprisonment.\n\nIn Canada all universities and colleges are under the direct supervision of the provincial and territorial governments, and there are no accreditation authorities, so the problem of degree mills is relatively rare. For example, in Ontario the \"Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000\" regulates degree-granting authority. Any institution that wishes to offer a degree or use the term \"university\" must be authorized to do so under an Act of the Legislature or by the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.\n\nA list of recognized Canadian higher education institutions is available on CICIC website.\n\nMost, but not all, universities and colleges in the People's Republic of China are public institutions. The Ministry of Education, which has legal authority to regulate college enrollment and degree awarding, publishes a yearly list of qualified higher-education institutions. Institutions not on the list cannot admit students or award degrees.\n\nAlso, no institution may call itself a \"university\" or \"college\" without approval by a provincial-level education department. Any institution, public or private, which wishes to name itself after a geographic region larger than a province (e.g. \"South China ... University\") must go through the Ministry of Education. A new regulation forbids any new university or college from being named \"national\", \"of China\" or similar names.\n\n, China has 210 diploma mills.\n\nMost universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are self-governing, but financed by the state. However, some schools, like Tvind's teacher college, provide education which is only accredited outside Denmark.\n\nAll universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are state institutions or foundations, and vocational universities are municipal organs. There are no private higher educational institutions and no legal mechanism to found or accredit any. Universities are explicitly defined in the Universities Act. Other than universities proper, technical universities (known in Finland as AMK, ammattikorkeakoulu), officially called \"Universities of Applied Sciences\" in English, can be established with permission from the cabinet. The degrees are protected by law. The list of AMKs can be viewed from the Ministry of Education website.\n\nFor purposes of professional qualification, the use of foreign degree qualifications is regulated: if the name of a degree can be confused with a Finnish degree that requires more academic credit, the confusion must be eliminated. Although diploma mills have not operated in Finland, countermeasures in university admissions have become necessary because of degrees from foreign diploma mills. Furthermore, there are no laws against conferring unaccredited degrees or degrees accredited abroad, as long as a Finnish degree or equivalent is not claimed.\n\nIn Germany, it is a criminal offense to call an institution a \"Universität\" (university) or \"Fachhochschule\", or to issue academic degrees, without authorization through an act of the respective state's Ministry of Education. It is also a misdemeanor to falsely claim a degree in Germany if it is not accredited, see \"\".\n\nSome corporate training programs in Germany use the English term \"corporate university\". Such use of the term is tolerated since it is widely understood that such programs are not actual universities. Similarly, \"Fachhochschulen\" frequently use the English term \"university of applied science\". Neither are permitted to use the German word \"Universität\".\n\nInstitutions of higher Tertiary education \"Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα (ΑΕΙ)\" (universities and technical universities) and \"Ανώτατα Τεχνολογικά Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα (ΑΤΕΙ)\" (technological educational institutes / universities of applied sciences) in Greece are fully self-managed public entities and are the only institutions that can issue university diplomas. Diplomas issued by foreign educational institutions are validated and assessed by the Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC).\n\nIt is illegal under Hong Kong laws chapter 320 \"Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance\" section 8 to call an organisation a \"university\" without approval from the Chief Executive in Council.\n\nUnder Hong Kong laws chapter 200 \"Crimes Ordinance\" section 73, anyone who knowingly uses false documents with the intention of inducing somebody to accept them as genuine is liable to 14 years' imprisonment. Section 76 assigns the same penalty for anyone who makes or possesses machines that create such false documents.\n\nThe University Grants Commission (UGC) states, in section 22 of the University Grants Commission Act of 1956:\nUGC has published a warning dated July 2012 against Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) about the unrecognized status of IIPM.\n\nLegitimate higher education qualifications in Ireland are placed on, or formally aligned, with the National Framework of Qualifications. This framework was established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act (1999). It is illegal under the Universities Act (1997) for any body offering higher education services to use the term \"university\" without the permission of the Minister for Education and Science. It is likewise illegal under the Institutes of Technologies Acts (1992–2006) to use the term \"institute of technology\" or \"regional technology college\" without permission.\n\nUnder Article 135 of the School Education Act, all universities and post-secondary education institutes in Japan require a government-issued licence from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Operating such an institute without a licence from MEXT can result in a fine of ¥100,000 for each offence committed. In addition, the National Institution for Academic Degrees and Quality Enhancement of Higher Education (NIAD-QE) has the sole authority to accredit all university and post-secondary qualifications in Japan, as per Article 104 of the School Education Act.\n\nThe \"Patent University\" was an example of a Japanese diploma mill which operated from 1964 until it was shut down in 1980, and which sold fraudulent doctorates for sums ranging between ¥300,000 and ¥5 million. In 2007, MEXT revealed that it had discovered 48 people with suspected falsified qualifications who were successfully hired to teach in 43 universities and post-secondary education institutes throughout Japan between 2004 and 2006.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Education Act 1996 protects the status of the terms \"university\", \"university college\" and \"branch campus\". Only institutions with this status may award academic degrees.\n\nThe Private Higher Education Institutions act also places restrictions on the creation and operation of any private higher education institution that conducts any course of study or training programme for which a certificate, diploma or degree is awarded.\nFurthermore, all legitimate higher education qualifications are placed on or formally affiliated with the Malaysian Qualifications Framework under the provisions of the Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007. Limited exemptions are however granted to organizations and institutions \"where the teaching is confined exclusively to the teaching of any religion\" or \"any place declared by the Minister by notification in the Gazette not to be an educational institution\" under the Education Act 1996.\n\nIn Mexico, Under the Education Act the official recognition of studies (RVOE) educational programs offered by private institutions may be granted by the federal education authority by state education authorities both. There are also public institutions of higher education, which are mandated to incorporate programs of these institutions according to its own rules. As of July 10, 2000, the Ministry applied for the granting of RVOE the guidelines established in the \"Secretarial Agreement No. 279 establishing the processes and procedures related to the recognition of official validity of studies The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) lists several institutions that are unaccredited in Mexico.\n\nIn August 2010, the Secretariat said 22 federal health officials were arrested after their medical and psychology licenses turned out to be fakes from a diploma mill according to the newspaper \"El Universal\". They included the technical director of the National Center for Blood Transfusions and the chief medical officer of the National Commission for Medical Arbitration, which rules on cases of malpractice.\n\nIn the Netherlands it is illegal for non-accredited, non-recognized institutes to bestow any legally protected academic title. The NVAO is the only agency allowed to accredit courses. Since the implementation of the Bologna process, Dutch universities have started to bestow the English titles MSc and PhD instead of their Dutch equivalents. These English versions of the title are not protected under Dutch law. A diploma mill may thus bestow someone with a PhD title without violating Dutch law, but the recipient will not be allowed to use the protected titles \"doctor\" or \"dr.\"\n\nPartnerships with foreign educational institutions are possible. This is called the \"U-bocht construction\". In this case, the curricula are neither accredited by NVAO nor recognized by the Dutch Department of Education. Graduates receive a foreign diploma issued by the educational institution which has a partnership with a Dutch educational institution. The status of such a diploma depends upon the laws and accreditation system of the country where the diploma is granted.\n\nDiplomas from accredited universities are accepted in the Netherlands since the Bologna protocol. Diploma's from non EU institutions must be screened and validated first before they are accepted for appointments requiring a validated starting level (e.g. entering a health profession).\n\nThe New Zealand Education Act prohibits use of the terms \"degree\" and \"university\" by institutions other than the country's eight accredited universities. In 2004 authorities announced their intention to take action against unaccredited schools using the words \"degree\" and \"university,\" including the University of Newlands, an unaccredited distance-learning provider based in the Wellington suburb of Newlands. Other unaccredited New Zealand institutions reported to be using the word \"university\" included the New Zealand University of Golf in Auckland, the online Tawa-Linden and Tauranga Universities of the Third Age, and the Southern University of New Zealand. Newlands owner Rochelle M. Forrester said she would consider removing the word \"university\" from the name of her institution in order to comply with the law.\n\nThe National University Commission (NUC) was formed in 1999 to clamp down on diploma mill activity in the country. A concentrated effort by the NUC has resulted in a significant drop in diploma mill activity in Nigeria. An International Higher Education article states, \"Attainment of the Nigerian vision of being one of the top 20 economies by 2020 will be compromised by the injection of such poor-quality graduates into the economy. Herein lies the distaste for and the \"raison d'être\" for the government's clampdown on degree mills.\"\n\nIn Nigeria, online degrees from unaccredited institutions are banned and should not be accepted by employers.\n\nAccreditation of universities and other institutions of higher education (\"Universitet\", \"Høyskole(Høgskole)\"), is governed by the state institution NOKUT, Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education. There have been cases where people submitting diplomas from a \"Diploma Mill\" to this agency for convalidation, have been prosecuted for fraud.\n\nThe government-established Higher Education Commission (HEC) is responsible for all matters related to the accreditation of universities in Pakistan. All recognized universities in Pakistan are listed on the HEC website. However, the\nAxact company, based in Karachi, was the subject of a 2015 investigation by the \"New York Times\", which found it was committing fraud in other countries, by granting fake degrees and diplomas.\n\nTitle IV (Crimes Against Public Interest), section V articles 174 and 175 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines criminalize the falsification of medical certificates, certificates of merit or service and the like. Article 174 imposes a penalty on anyone who produces such certificates and article 175 on anyone who knowingly procures and uses such a certificate. Despite this, news and magazine articles appear from time to time reporting businesses operating along Claro M. Recto Avenue in Manila which offer fake documents for sale.\n\nIn Portugal according to Base Law of Educative System from 1973 Lei n.º 5/73 () the diploma mill is impossible. To award higher studies degrees, all higher studies institutions require a governmental issued licence provided by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and published in the Government Journal (Diário da República) and communicate to the High Studies General Board (Direção Geral do Ensino Superior - DGES) all record of grades and degree awarded by students. Acting otherwise is punishable by law. Previously to 2007, in the process of opening a new institution or new curriculum to be lectured, it was required to provide the degree content by science branch and the list of PhD, MSc and BSc professors that lecture that specific course, thus getting a licence without expiration date, mandatory professors or contents revision date. This created a series of controversial scandals and severe lack quality in some private and public institutions as evidentiated by the 2007 state run inspection at the hands of , resulting in their compulsory closure and transfer of students to other institutions. Created by governmental rule to ensure the quality in higher studies along the Bologna Process implementation, this entity has a specific and rigorous agenda to control all public and private institutions of higher studies and its content. Its job is to perform inspections every 1, 2, 3 or 5 years about the academic crew scientific quality, current and new curriculum in all degrees, assure that these are up to date, and control the BSc, MSc and PhD available degrees in Portugal, by closure or approval of new courses as the Bologna Process demands.\n\nThe Romanian newspaper \"Gândul\" has reported that the Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University from Bucharest started 34 Master's degree curricula which have no legal ground. According to the rector of the university, Corina Dumitrescu, the law has a loophole, since it uses a continuous present for institutional evaluation, which is uncharacteristic of the Romanian language. She says that in her opinion institutional evaluation (required by law) may also happen after the curricula have been taught. The actual wording in Romanian is \"universitate acreditată supusă periodic evaluării instituţionale\", and Dumitrescu argues that \"care se supun\" means that an accredited institution can be evaluated \"today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow\" (and presumably, any time), not that it needs to have been evaluated in the past. For the study year 2010-2011, 16 Master's curricula from nine of its faculties are listed as accredited in Order no. 4630/2010 of the Department of Education.\n\nApart from the graduate level diploma mills, in Russia a significant number of leading institutions have \"degree mills\" within their departments (typically humanities and economics). According to the civic initiative Dissernet such institutions are providing the Russian elite (heads of universities, members of parliament and government officials) with degrees based on plagiarised and falsified Kandidat nauk (Ph.D Candidate) and Doktor nauk (full Ph.D) theses.\n\nIt is illegal to falsely claim a degree in South Korea if it is not accredited. In March 2006 prosecutors in Seoul were reported to have broken up a crime ring selling bogus music diplomas from Russia, which helped many land university jobs and seats in orchestras. People who falsely used these degrees were criminally charged.\n\nIn early 2007, Shin Jeong-ah (신정아) was criminally charged for forging and misusing a degree from Yale University. The case had a far-reaching impact as she was a professor at Dongguk University and also held a position at an art gallery known to have ties with economical and political figures.\n\nUntil 1999 only state universities could grant degrees, but amendments to the Universities Act now allow private institutions to be granted degree-awarding status by the University Grants Commission. Universities can also be established by an act of parliament.\n\nIn June 2007, the Swedish Minister for Employment, Sven-Otto Littorin, was discovered to have an MBA degree from Fairfax University. Though aware that claiming an MBA from this diploma mill would be illegal in many states in the US, Littorin tried to convince the Swedish media and people of the legitimacy of his qualification. He was eventually forced to remove the reference from his official CV, but he remained in office.\n\nQualifications, diplomas and titles earned from Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Zurich, EPFL), from cantonal (state-run) universities, from private universities recognized by state authorities, and from Fachhochschule-institutions (Universities of Applied Sciences run or recognized by official authorities, federal and cantonal) are protected. Accreditation is conferred by the Conference of University Rectors of Switzerland (CRUS) and the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (OAQ). Under Swiss law, it is a criminal offense, under unfair competition legislation, to profit by any unfounded academic or occupational qualifications. The private use of such a title, however, is legal. Thus, one can call oneself an LL.M., but one must not use the title when competing for clients.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, degrees may only be awarded by institutions that have degree-awarding powers recognised by the UK authorities (the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly). Some institutions do not have degree-awarding powers but provide complete courses leading to recognised UK degrees that are validated by institutions which have degree-awarding powers. The UK authorities recognise those institutions which have been granted degree-awarding powers by either a Royal charter, an Act of Parliament or the Privy Council. These degree-awarding institutions are known as \"recognised bodies.\" All UK universities and some higher education colleges are \"recognised bodies.\" If an institution is not a \"recognised body\" or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, it is likely to be a degree mill. It is an offence against section 214 of the Education Reform Act 1988 for any organisation to offer a degree qualification which could be taken to be that of a UK institution unless it is a \"recognised body.\" The UK Border Agency maintains a list of institutions licensed to sponsor migrant students so that overseas students can check that they are attending an appropriate institution, and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) maintain a directory of higher education providers regulated in England. Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) is an initiative sponsored by HEFCE which aims to prevent Higher Education fraud in the UK by maintaining a list of UK degree-awarding bodies, including name changes, mergers and antecedents since 1990, and where institutions that are claiming to be universities are known to be bogus, these are also listed.\n\nMedical diploma mills have operated, and have been blacklisted, in the United States for over 120 years. The country does not have a federal law that would unambiguously prohibit diploma mills, and the term \"university\" is not legally protected on a national level. The United States Department of Education lacks direct plenary authority to regulate schools and, consequently, the quality of an institution's degree. However, the Federal Trade Commission works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices including those in the field of education and alerts United States' consumers about diploma mills by delineating some tell-tale signs in its official web page. Under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities on the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education that they accredit. Some degree mills have taken advantage of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by representing themselves as seminaries, since in many jurisdictions religious institutions can legally offer degrees in religious subjects without government regulation.\n\nAlthough the DipScam operation in the 1980s led to a decline in diploma mill activity across the United States, the lack of further action by law enforcement, uneven state laws, and the rise of the Internet have combined to reverse many of the gains made in previous years. In 2005, the US Department of Education launched its \"Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs\" website to combat the spread of fraudulent degrees. A number of states have passed bills restricting the ability of organizations to award degrees without accreditation.\nJurisdictions that have restricted or made illegal the use of credentials from unaccredited schools include Oregon, Michigan, Maine, North Dakota, New Jersey, Washington, Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. Many other states are also considering restrictions on the use of degrees from unaccredited institutions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "293121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293121", "title": "Education in India", "text": "Education in India\n\nEducation in India is provided by the public sector as well as the private sector, with control and funding coming from three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children between the ages of 6 and 14. The ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.\n\nIndia has made progress in terms of increasing the primary education attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately three-quarters of the population in the 7–10 age group, by 2011. India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrollment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.\n\nIndian At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group. Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.\n\nAs per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 23 lakh students over 2002 total enrollment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrollment. While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system.While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12).\nSince 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day. States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.\n\nAlthough there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading.\n\nIn India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary. Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India.\n\nThe central and most state boards uniformly follow the \"10+2+3\" pattern of education. In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges, and then 3 years of graduation for a bachelor's degree. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.\n\nEducation Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system. A significant feature of India's secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society. Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing. A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.\n\nSchool boards set the curriculum, conduct board level exams mostly at 10th and 12th level to award the school diplomas. Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.\n\nThe Midday Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India designed to improve the nutritional status of school-age children nationwide, by suppling free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternative innovative education centres, \"Madarsa\" and \"Maqtabs\" supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is the largest such programme in the world.\n\nIn addition, NUEPA (National University of Educational Planning and Administration) and NCTE (National Council for Teacher Education) are responsible for the management of the education system and teacher accreditation.\n\nThe pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's knowledge, skills and behaviour. On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages and urban areas on the contrary. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.\nLKG and UKG stages prepare and help children emotionally, mentally, socially and physically to grasp knowledge easily in the later stages of school and college life.\n\nA systematic process of preschool education is followed in India to impart knowledge in the best possible way for better understanding of the young children. By following an easy and interesting curriculum, teachers strive hard to make the entire learning process enjoyable for the children.\n\nThe Indian government lays emphasis on primary education, also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old. Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions. 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country.\n\nHowever, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training. Figures released by the Indian government in 2011 show that there were 5,816,673 elementary school teachers in India. there were 2,127,000 secondary school teachers in India.\nEducation has also been made free for children for 6 to 14 years of age or up to class VIII under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009.\n\nThere have been several efforts to enhance quality made by the government. The District Education Revitalisation Programme (DERP) was launched in 1994 with an aim to universalise primary education in India by reforming and vitalising the existing primary education system. 85% of the DERP was funded by the central government and the remaining 15% was funded by the states. The DERP, which had opened 1.6 lakh new schools including 84,000 alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately 35 lakh children, was also supported by UNICEF and other international programmes. In January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.\n\nThis primary education scheme has also not shown a high Gross Enrollment Ratio of 93–95% for the last three years in some states. Significant improvement in staffing and enrollment of girls has also been made as a part of this scheme. The current scheme for universalisation of Education for All is the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan which is one of the largest education initiatives in the world. Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low.\n\n\"See also\": Gender inequality in India\n\nSecondary education covers children aged 12 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 crore children according to the 2001 Census of India. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \"+2\" stage. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.\n\nUGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as Engineering, Medical, and Business Administration.\n\nSecondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardized nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as \"board exams\"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11-12 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.\n\nMost schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different \"streams\"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.\n\nStudents taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers at different schools. \"Elective\" or optional subjects often include Computer Applications, Economics, Physical Education, Commerce, and Environmental Science.\n\nStudents taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a \"core stream\" in addition to English or the local language: Science (Mathematics/Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Commerce (Accounts, Business Studies, and Economics), or Humanities (any three of History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography depending on school). Students study Mathematics up to single-variable Calculus in grade 12.\n\nMajority of the students study in the government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14. A Education Ministry data, 65% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017). These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the centre government. Example of large centre government run school systems are Kendriya Vidyalaya in urban areas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya for the gifted students, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya for girls belonging to vulnerable SC/ST/OBC classes, Indian Army Public Schools run by the Indian Army for the children of soldiers.\n\nKendriya Vidyalaya project, was started for the employees of the central government of India, who are deployed throughout the country. The government started the \"Kendriya Vidyalaya\" project in 1965 to provide uniform education in institutions following the same syllabus at the same pace regardless of the location to which the employee's family has been transferred.\n\nThese are usually charitable trust run schools that receive partial funding from the government. Largest system of aided schools is run by D.A.V. College Managing Committee.\n\nAccording to current estimate, 29% of Indian children are privately educated. With more than 50% children enrolling in private schools in urban areas, the balance has already tilted towards private schooling in cities; and, even in rural areas, nearly 20% of the children in 2004-5 were enrolled in private schools.\nMost middle-class families send their children to private schools, which might be in their own city or at distant boarding schools such as Rajkumar College, Rajkot, the oldest private school in India. At such schools, the medium of education is often English, but Hindi and/or the state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject. Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains. Montessori education is also popular, due to Maria Montessori's stay in India during World War II. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in Chennai were Montessori.\n\nMany privately owned and managed schools carry the appellation \"Public\", such as the Delhi Public Schools, or Frank Anthony Public Schools. These are modelled after British public schools, which are a group of older, expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent schools in England.\n\nAccording to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a multiple of the unit cost of government schools. The reason being high aims and better vision. However, others have suggested that private schools fail to provide education to the poorest families, a selective being only a fifth of the schools and have in the past ignored Court orders for their regulation.\n\nIn their favour, it has been pointed out that private schools cover the entire curriculum and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs, general knowledge, sports, music and drama. The pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female. There is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive in-service training compared to 43.44% for government schools. The competition in the school market is intense, yet most schools make profit.\nHowever, the number of private schools in India is still low - the share of private institutions is 7% (with upper primary being 21% secondary 32% - \"source: fortress team research\"). Even the poorest often go to private schools despite the fact that government schools are free. A study found that 65% school-children in Hyderabad's slums attend private schools.\n\n, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed India as having 410 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist.\n\nHome-schooling is legal in India, though it is the less explored option. The Indian Government's stance on the issue is that parents are free to teach their children at home, if they wish to and have the means. The then HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has stated that despite the RTE Act of 2009, if someone decides not to send his/her children to school, the government would not interfere.\n\nStudent may opt for vocation education or the university education.\n\nIndia's All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) reported, in 2013, that there are more than 4,599 vocational institutions that offer degrees, diploma and post-diploma in architecture, engineering, hotel management, infrastructure, pharmacy, technology, town services and others. There were 17.4 lakh students enrolled in these schools. Total annual intake capacity for technical diplomas and degrees exceeded 34 lakh in 2012.\n\nAccording to the University Grants Commission (UGC) total enrollment in Science, Medicine, Agriculture and Engineering crossed 65 lakh in 2010. The number of women choosing engineering has more than doubled since 2001.\n\nAfter passing the Higher Secondary Examination (the Standard 12 examination), students may enrol in general degree programmes such as bachelor's degree (graduation) in arts, commerce or science, or professional degree programme such as engineering, law or medicine and become B. Sc., B. Com., and B. A. graduates. India's higher education system is the third largest in the world, after China and the United States. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission (India) (UGC), which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the centre and the state up to Post graduation and Doctorate (Ph.D). Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 12 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission.\n\n, India has 152 central universities, 316 state universities, and 191 private universities. Other institutions include 33,623 colleges, including 1,800 exclusive women's colleges, functioning under these universities and institutions, and 12,748 Institutions offering Diploma Courses. The emphasis in the tertiary level of education lies on science and technology. Indian educational institutions by 2004 consisted of a large number of technology institutes. Distance learning is also a feature of the Indian higher education system. The Government has launched Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan to provide strategic funding to State higher and technical institutions. A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it.\n\nSome institutions of India, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institute of Science and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) have been globally acclaimed for their standard of under-graduate education in engineering. Several other institutes of fundamental research such as the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) are also acclaimed for their standard of research in basic sciences and mathematics. However, India has failed to produce world class universities both in the private sector or the public sector.\n\nBesides top rated universities which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India is also home to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities. In this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation.\n\nThe Government of India is aware of the plight of higher education sector and has been trying to bring reforms, however, 15 bills are still awaiting discussion and approval in the Parliament. One of the most talked about bill is Foreign Universities Bill, which is supposed to facilitate entry of foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The bill is still under discussion and even if it gets passed, its feasibility and effectiveness is questionable as it misses the context, diversity and segment of international foreign institutions interested in India. One of the approaches to make internationalisation of Indian higher education effective is to develop a coherent and comprehensive policy which aims at infusing excellence, bringing institutional diversity and aids in capacity building.\n\nThree Indian universities were listed in the Times Higher Education list of the world's top 200 universities — Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, and Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2005 and 2006. Six Indian Institutes of Technology and the Birla Institute of Technology and Science—Pilani were listed among the top 20 science and technology schools in Asia by \"Asiaweek\". The Indian School of Business situated in Hyderabad was ranked number 12 in global MBA rankings by the \"Financial Times\" of London in 2010 while the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has been recognised as a global leader in medical research and treatment. The University of Mumbai was ranked 41 among the Top 50 Engineering Schools of the world by America's news broadcasting firm Business Insider in 2012 and was the only university in the list from the five emerging BRICS nations viz Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It was ranked at 62 in the QS BRICS University rankings for 2013 and was India's 3rd best Multi-Disciplinary University in the QS University ranking of Indian Universities after University of Calcutta and Delhi University. Loyola College, Chennai is one of the best ranked arts and science college in India with the UGC award of College of Excellence tag.\n\nFrom the first Five-year Plan onwards, India's emphasis was to develop a pool of scientifically inclined manpower. India's National Policy on Education (NPE) provisioned for an apex body for regulation and development of higher technical education, which came into being as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 1987 through an act of the Indian parliament. At the federal level, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, the National Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Information Technology are deemed of national importance.\n\nThe Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are among the nation's premier education facilities.\n\nCentral Universities such as Banaras Hindu University, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi University, Mumbai University, University of Calcutta, Jadavpur University etc. too are pioneers of technical education in the country.\n\nIn addition to above institutes, efforts towards the enhancement of technical education are supplemented by a number of recognised Professional Engineering Societies such as:\nthat conduct Engineering/Technical Examinations at different levels (Degree and diploma) for working professionals desirous of improving their technical qualifications.\n\nThe number of graduates coming out of technical colleges increased to over 7 lakh in 2011 from 5.5 lakh in FY 2010. However, according to one study, 75% of technical graduates and more than 85% of general graduates lack the skills needed in India's most demanding and high-growth global industries such as Information Technology. These high-tech global information technologies companies directly or indirectly employ about 23 lakh people, less than 1% of India's labour pool. India offers one of the largest pool of technically skilled graduates in the world. Given the sheer numbers of students seeking education in engineering, science and mathematics, India faces daunting challenges in scaling up capacity while maintaining quality.\n\nAt the school level, National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education. 14 lakh students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance learning. In 2012 Various state governments also introduced \"STATE OPEN SCHOOL\" to provide distance education.\n\nAt higher education level, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance learning. It has a cumulative enrollment of about 15 lakh, serviced through 53 regional centres and 1,400 study centres with 25,000 counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an authority of IGNOU is co-coordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119 institutions of correspondence courses in conventional universities. While distance education institutions have expanded at a very rapid rate, but most of these institutions need an up gradation in their standards and performance. There is a large proliferation of courses covered by distance mode without adequate infrastructure, both human and physical. There is a strong need to correct these imbalances.\n\nMassive open online course are made available for free by the HRD ministry and various educational institutes.\n\nExtracurricular activities include sports, arts, National Service Scheme, National Cadet Corps, The Bharat Scouts and Guides, etc.\n\nAccording to the Census of 2011, \"every person above the age of 7 years who can read and write with understanding in any language is said to be literate\". According to this criterion, the 2011 survey holds the National Literacy Rate to be 74.04%. The youth literacy rate, measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among males and 74.4% among females), while 86% of boys and 72% of girls are literate in the 10-19 age group.\n\nWithin the Indian states, Tripura has the highest literacy rate of 94.65% whereas Bihar averaged 61.8% literacy. The 2001 statistics indicated that the total number of 'absolute non-literates' in the country was 304 million. Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in Rajasthan, the state with the lowest female literacy rate in India, average female literacy rate is 52.66% and average male literacy rate is 80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%.\n\n, enrollment rates are 58% for pre-primary, 93% for primary, 69% for secondary, and 25% for tertiary education.\n\nDespite the high overall enrollment rate for primary education among rural children of age 10, half could not read at a basic level, over 60% were unable to do division, and half dropped out by the age of 14.\n\nIn 2009, two states in India, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, participated in the international PISA exams which is administered once every three years to 15-year-old's. Both states ranked at the bottom of the table, beating out only Kyrgyzstan in score, and falling 200 points (two standard deviations) below the average for OECD countries. While in the immediate aftermath there was a short-lived controversy over the quality of primary education in India, ultimately India decided to not participate in PISA for 2012, and again not to for 2015.\n\nWhile the quality of free, public education is in crisis, a majority of the urban poor have turned to private schools. In some urban cities, it is estimated as high as two-thirds of all students attend private institutions, many of which charge a modest US$2 per month.\n\nOfficially, the pupil to teacher ratio within the public school system for primary education is 35:1. However, teacher absenteeism in India is exorbitant, with 25% never showing up for work. The World Bank estimates the cost in salaries alone paid to such teachers who have never attended work is US $2 billion per year.\nA study on teachers by Kremer etc. found out that 25% of private sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers were absent during the survey. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 14.6% in Maharashtra to 41.9% in Jharkhand. Only 1 in nearly 3,000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence. The same study found \"only about half were teaching, during unannounced visits to a nationally representative sample of government primary schools in India.\"\n\nAs per Report of the Higher education in India, Issues Related to Expansion, Inclusiveness, Quality and Finance, the access to higher education measured in term of gross enrollment ratio increased from 0.7% in 1950/51 to 1.4% in 1960–61. By 2006/7 the GER increased to about 11%. Notably, by 2012, it had crossed 20% (as mentioned in an earlier section).\n\nAn optimistic estimate from 2008 was that only one in five job-seekers in India ever had any sort of vocational training.\nHowever it's expected to grow as the CBSE has brought changes in its education system which emphasises inclusion of certain number and types of vocational subjects in classes 9th and 11th. Although it's not mandatory for schools to go for it but a good number of schools have voluntarily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the change in their curriculum. \n\nSecular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan Empire.\n\nSammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the \"Sammanas\", were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the \"Kshatriya\", were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the \"Vaishya\", were taught their trade and the working class of the \"Shudras\" was generally deprived of educational advantages.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6711479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6711479", "title": "Focus phrase", "text": "Focus phrase\n\n\"Focus Phrase\" is a term traditionally used in cognitive-therapy and awareness-management discussions, and now in more general use to describe elicitor statements that evoke a desired refocusing of attention. Psychologically related terms are \"elicitor phrase\" or \"statement of intent\".\n\nThe psychological term \"Focus Phrase\" is now used by therapists and life coaches as a general term.\n\n\"Focus phrase\" is defined as \"a specially-constructed short sentence or phrase that states a person's inner intent to refocus his or her attention immediately in a new pre-ordained direction\".\n\nBased both on new research in cognitive science and on cognitive-shifting studies of ancient meditation techniques (see Jon Kabat-Zinn), focus phrases have been used as a meditative tool and therapy aid, and are being introduced as at-work attentive boosts. They are carefully designed by professionals to almost instantly redirect the mind's attention specifically toward worthwhile sensations, thoughts, images, and other mental experiences. Focus phrases are highly effective in evoking rapid shifts in mental content, quality of awareness, sensory perception, and general inner experience. Therefore, they are considered of high value in meditative methods, and even in creativity-boost techniques.\n\nAs explained by the founder of cognitive therapy, Aaron Beck, our chronic thoughtflows (stream of consciousness) tend to dominate our inner experience and stimulate our behavior and emotions. If we want to change our inner experience (for instance from a negative mood to a more positive mood) we need to take charge of the thoughts we are holding in our minds, and state our intent to shift into a preferable mood or quality of consciousness. \n\nThe theory of cognitive therapy teaches that the power of the spoken word in stating one's intent is primary for manifestation of one's intent. In ancient times, the Creation myth found in Genesis of the Old Testament relates that \"God said let there be light, and there was light.\" Perhaps \"Let there be light\" was the primary focus phrase for our universe. And throughout anthropology studies, a verbal statement of intent (a blessing; a curse) was considered a decisive act in manifesting that intent.\n\nIn corporate awareness-training, focus phrases are used not to change the outer world, but to rapidly shift inner attention, and thus alter personal experience and behavior. For instance, in order to shift rapidly from being lost in thought to present-moment alertness, the following core focus phrase drawn both from perceptual psychology and ancient Yoga meditative tradition is used: \"I feel the air flowing in and out of my nose.\" Immediately, as often explained by spiritual teacher Alan Watts in his numerous books, the words have the psychological power to turn your attention toward the actual breathing experience - which in turn awakens your awareness to sensory experience in the present moment.\n\nElicitor statements using this general 'focus phrase technology' for mental refocusing can be used to redirect attention toward a more positive mood (\"I let go of my worries, and feel peaceful inside\"), toward more creative states of mind (\"I am open to receive insight into my dilemma\"), toward interpersonal relating (\"I accept this person just as they are\"), or toward any other intent to improve one's experience and behavior.\n\nThe term Focus Phrase is recently becoming a more general-usage term found in daily communication, referring to any short sentence intended to help a person's performance or inner experience. There is also some negative discussion of the term. In the opposite direction, the term Focus Phrase has been studied academically as a part of a Semantics dissertation.\n\n"}

After a curacy at St Matthew’s Church, Bayswater he emigrated to India as a CMS missionary, eventually becoming Principal of \"St John’s College, Palamcottah\" and then Bishop of Tinnevelly in 1945.

{"id": "9177274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9177274", "title": "Governance in higher education", "text": "Governance in higher education\n\nGovernance in higher education is the means by which institutions for higher education (tertiary or post-secondary education) are formally organized and managed (though often there is a distinction between definitions of management and governance). Simply, university governance is the way in which universities are operated. Governing structures for higher education are highly differentiated throughout the world, but the different models nonetheless share a common heritage. Internationally, tertiary education includes private not-for-profit, private for-profit, and public institutions governed by differentiated structures of management.\n\nGovernance and management of post-secondary institutions becomes even more diverse with the differences in defining the relationships between higher and tertiary education (university education), postsecondary education, technical and vocational education, and community college models of education. The issues are complicated by current debates over collegial and shared forms of governance contrasted to corporate and business forms of institutional governance.\n\nThe concept of governance in postsecondary education predominantly refers to the internal structure, organization and management of autonomous institutions. The internal governance organization typically consists of a governing board (board of regents, board of directors), the university president (executive head, CEO) with a team of administrative chancellors and staff, faculty senates, academic deans, department chairs, and usually some form of organization for student representation. In the United States, state institution governing boards often emphasize the concept of citizen governance in recognizing that board members serve a civic role for the institution. Management structures themselves have become increasingly complex due to the increasing complexity of intraorganizational, interorganizational and governmental relationships. Whether college and university education, adult education, technical or vocational education, educational administration presents complex challenges at all levels of private and public education.\n\n\"Governance\" is defined by Kezar and Eckel as the macro-level of policy decision making. Kezar and Eckel suggest governance is a multi-level concept including several different bodies and processes with different decision-making functions. In this way, governance is sometimes defined at difference to the internal management of institutions. Throughout the world, many national, state and local governments have begun to establish coordinating and governing boards as both buffer and bridge to coordinate governance and institutional management.\nDue to the influences of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next to the concept of shared and participative governance a new form of governance has emerged. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate governance and the decline of the shared or consensual governance can be seen to be a result of the decline in academic participation, a growing tendency towards managerialism and the new environment where the universities are operating.\n\nUniversity governance varies between countries. McMaster notes the different cultures in universities and the traditional relationships between faculty and administration, characterizing historical transitions and suggesting that universities today are undergoing transitions in culture. Kezar and Eckel point out the substance of governance has changed during the last decades with more emphasis put on high stake issues and more incremental decisions made in a less collegial mode – the reasons for this stem from trends that have devalued the notion of participation and also from the external pressures for more accountability and demands for quicker decision-making (that sometimes is achieved through bureaucracy). McMaster discusses the same changes in university management resulting from the “huge amount of additional administrative work at all levels within the university, and the requirement for a wide range of specialist skills in areas such as marketing, HR management, management accounting, web development and instructional design” and the difficulties with the tensions that have resulted between collegial and corporate models of management.\n\nDearlove emphasises that, under the conditions of mass higher education, no university can avoid the need for some sort of bureaucratic management and organisation, though this does not mean that the importance of informal discipline and profession-based authority (internal governance of universities) can totally be ignored. Lapworth advocates what the author believes is a model of university governance with the positive aspects of corporate and collegial approaches. The issues in university governance discussed by these literatures are detailed by Coaldrake, Stedman, and Little (2003) through a comparative study of current trends in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with poignant insight into the different models of governance for the management of higher education. Critical of the currents of change toward “corporate governance,” the authors cite reference to literature that calls for “re-balancing” of university governance, maintaining that the re-balancing “would amount to a clarification of shared governance”. With changing roles in human resources and the external pressures for accountability affecting university relationships internally, McMaster provides insights by defining management styles in terms of nested partnership between faculty and administration, contiguous partnership, and segmented partnership. With debates over the recent trends, university organizations, governing associations, and numerous postsecondary institutions themselves have set forth policy statements on governance.\n\nWithin the US, governance varies greatly from university to university. Without any policy, various statements have been influential. \n\nThe American Association of University Professors (AAUP) was the first organization to formulate a statement on the governance of higher education based on principles of democratic values and participation (which, in this sense, correlates with the Yale Report of 1828, which has been referred to as the “first attempt at a formally stated philosophy of education” for universities, emphasizing at that time that Enlightenment curricula following the establishment of democratic constitutional governance should not be replaced with retrogression to religious curricula). The AAUP published its first \"Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities\" in 1920, “emphasizing the importance of faculty involvement in personnel decisions, selection of administrators, preparation of the budget, and determination of educational policies. Refinements to the statement were introduced in subsequent years, culminating in the 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities. The document does not provide for a “blueprint” for the governance of higher education. Nor was the purpose of the statement to provide principles for relations with industry and government (though it establishes direction on “the correction of existing weaknesses”). Rather, it aimed to establish a shared vision for the internal governance of institutions. Student involvement is not addressed in detail. The statement concerns general education policy and internal operations with an overview of the formal structures for organization and management. In process and structure, the meaning with the end result is an organizational philosophy for shared governance in higher education.\n\nFirst published in 1987, the National Education Association (NEA) statement on faculty governance in higher education is a straightforward point of view on their policy in support of shared governance. The policy maintains that faculty involvement in governance is critical. Providing research support, the organization states faculty should advise administration in developing curriculum and methods of instruction. Faculty is responsible for establishing degree requirements, takes primary responsibility in tenure appointments and the award of promotion and sabbatical. Addressing issues through collective bargaining, the statement believes “administration and the governing boards of colleges and universities should accept the faculty's recommendations”. The statement also maintains that faculty should be involved in salary decisions, evaluating administrators, and budgeting. The policy concludes with the assertion:\n\nThe policy statement references the AAUP's \"1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities.\" The basic principles evidently draw from the early AAUP statement on governance. Though the NEA makes no mention of students anywhere in the policy, the NEA like the AAUP does reflect the basic ideas and premise for the “responsibility primarily of the faculty to determine the appropriate curriculum and procedures of student instruction”. In this respect, the AAUP grants that considerations should be made for publicly supported institutions. Unlike the NEA, the AAUP elaborates more on the role of governing structures, including the role of the president to ensure \"sound academic practices\", as the NEA suggests faculty rights to appeal flawed and improper procedures. In summation, where the AAUP discusses the organizational structure for governance and management in more detail while touching on student involvement, the NEA statement differs by detailing primarily faculty rights and responsibilities in shared governance.\n\nFollowing on the 1987 publication of \"Policy Statement on Higher Education Faculty Governance\", in 1989 the NEA issued a \"Policy Statement on Higher Education Policy for Community College Governance.\" The NEA elaborates upon issues in support of shared governance for the management of community colleges, junior and technical colleges not addressed in their previous statement. The statement is based on the same principles, believing cooperative decision-making and collective bargaining in governance should be based on “collegial” relationships. Where statements from the NEA and the AAUP advocate the importance of faculty involvement in governance, the community college statement notes that many do not exercise the right when available and that faculty “at public institutions are not yet permitted to bargain collectively in many states”. The NEA then elaborates upon the need for faculty participation.\n\nAgain, the \"Policy Statement of Community College Governance\" correlates based upon the same underlying principles of the AAUP and NEA statement on faculty governance. The community college statement also elaborates upon structure and procedure not addressed in the previous statement, including the “ad hoc” and standing committees as discussed in the AAUP policy statement on governance. Where the AAUP statement discusses policy on students and their academic rights, with the community college statement the NEA does not address student involvement.\n\nIn 2002, the Higher Education Program and Policy Council of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) published a statement in support of the shared governance of institutions. The policy statement is a response to the fact that many governing boards have adopted the \"mantra of business”. The AFT iterates the purpose by which higher education achieves democratic organizational processes between administration and faculty, believing shared governance is under attack in six ways:\n\nAccordingly, six principles affirm standards of academic freedom, faculty participation in standards and curriculum, and faculty decisions on academic personnel as the AAUP first established principles of governance. The statement maintains that participation in shared governance should be extended, acknowledging that the way in which participation is expanded will vary from institution to institution; “but each group whose work contributes to the academic enterprise should be involved in a manner appropriate to institutional functions and responsibility”. The policy addresses unions and faculty senates, believing that they contribute to the maintenance of shared governance in institutions as well as the role of accrediting agencies to support management standards. In conclusion, the AFT emphasizes affirmation of the goals, objectives and purpose for shared governance in higher education.\n\nWith recent debates and trends in the governance of institutions of higher education in the United States, the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB) issued a statement on governance, most recently updated in 2010. The original statement was published with a correlating statement, “Governing in the Public Trust: External Influences on Colleges and Universities.” In the first statement on governance, the advisiory organization for institutional governance discusses facts and perceptions concerning governance, including specific facts related to institutional trends and perceptions that “internal governance arrangements have become so cumbersome that timely decisions are difficult to make”. The AGB statement then defines general principles upon which governing boards are to operate and the responsibilities of a governing board to the institution; the updated principles as of 2010 are below.\n\n\nWith their statement on governing bodies, the AGB then provides statement on governing in the public trust, iterating many of the same points concerning recent external pressures. The statement defines the historic role and rationale behind the principles of citizen governance upon which state institutional boards operate. Again, addressing the nature of external influences in university governance, the AGB defines specific principles in maintaining accountability and autonomy in the public trust, including\n\nIn conclusion, the statement asks for the reaffirmation of a commitment to citizen governance to maintain the balanced and independent governance of institutions.\n\nSponsored by the AAUP and the American Conference of Academic Deans, the 2001 Survey of Higher Education Governance is a study done by Gabriel Kaplan, a doctoral student at Harvard University interested in replicating research done by Committee T of the AAUP thirty years previously. The findings of the report detail the method with summary of the present state of shared governance. The findings include the state of the locus of authority and reforms as well as the analysis of the challenges facing Liberal Arts Colleges with the pressures of the current economic climate. The preliminary results contain the raw data on the landscape of governance in higher education from a population of 1303 4-year institutions in the United States, with data compiled from both administrative structures and the faculty. The survey did not include participation from any population of students.\n\nSince the 1819 U.S. Supreme Court case \"Dartmouth College v. Woodward\" before the Yale Report of 1828 (where the former was catalyst from the later, each of which upheld the separation of church and state) private universities in the United States generally maintain remarkable autonomy from local, state, and federal government. Questions might be raised over the role of shared governance in private education. In \"Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education\", Quinn and Moore (2005) support values of shared governance in Jesuit Universities. Quinn notes the way in which Catholic colleges and universities adopted principles of shared governance throughout the 1960s. Moore begins by noting that the concept of shared governance is often viewed as inefficient in the corporate world. The author believes that shared governance is not a cumbersome system of management, but necessary given the organizational dynamics and complexities of university systems.\n\nBy contrast to corporate trends, the author maintains that the corporate “one-size-fits-all” system could not effectively suit institutional needs. From which, the perspective then affirms the AAUP tradition of shared governance as a sound system of organization and management in higher education, “essential to the long term interests of colleges and universities if they wish to remain competitive and academically credible”. The way in which shared governance is realized in Catholic colleges and universities does vary from institution to institution. In Jesuit institutions, when serving the role of a board member an individual of the formal order provides guidance on the philosophy of Jesuit education while facilitating “the mutuality so essential for shared governance before the law and in reality,” respecting Catholic traditions with a democratic spirit of institutional governance.\n\nIn October 2003, the Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (AVCC), the council of Australia’s university presidents, put forward a “Chancellors and AVCC statement on university governance.\" Given national and institutional debates over the governance of tertiary education, the statement acknowledges the opportunities with developments in management and governing structures. The statement notes the role of the “business model” that has been advanced alongside the traditional models of governance in Australia. With reference to additional “third models” in introducing a discussion of the existing frameworks for the governance of tertiary education, the statement defines the legal autonomy of institutions and independence from external stakeholders. Acknowledging the diversity of governing structures and believing a balance is necessary between internal and external forces, the organization maintains: “No single way to achieve an effective governance arrangement” is possible. In recognizing the differences in institutional structures and frames of reference, the statement offers operational good practices as generic principles and recommendations, also identifying national protocols for the success of Australian higher education.\n\nThe recommendations address practices by which internal governing structures operate and how they can improve institutional governance for the Commonwealth of Australia. External relations, the role of faculty and students in governance are not approached except inasmuch as institutional board members should be appointed with their selection based on contributions “to the effective working of the governing body by having needed skills, knowledge and experience, an appreciation of the values of a university and its core activities of teaching and research, its independence and academic freedom and the capacity to appreciate the university’s external community needs from that university”. The committee defines the responsibilities of university governance, including legal obligations and legislative requirements for the internal governing boards of Australian institutions. Accordingly, governing bodies “should make available a programme of induction and professional development . . . to ensure that all members are aware of the nature of their duties and responsibilities”. The report concludes with protocol for annual reports, including report of risk management and additional steps to ensure good governance.\n\nThe Pan-African Institute of University Governance is a project set up by the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie and by the Association of Commonwealth universities, in support of the Ministry of the higher education of Cameroon. It was launched during the World Conference on the Higher education of the UNESCO which was held in Paris from 5 to 8 July 2009, by the Rector of the AUF, Mr Bernard Cerquiglini, and the General Secretary of the ACU Mr John Tarrant.\n\nBased physically at the Yaounde - Cameroon, it is about a unique structure of support which aims at improving all the practices which contribute to the smooth running of higher education in Africa. Its vocation is to accompany the modernization of the governance of higher education thanks to the implementation of expertise, the modules of training, seminars and workshops and especially specific tools of management, analysis and evaluation. It spreads his actions on the whole domain of governance (academic, administrative, financial, social, numerical and of the research) and has a function of observatory of higher education in Africa.\n\nAt this effect, the Institute founds its methods of work on its role of observatory of higher education, on its expertise in evaluation of mechanisms of functioning and decision-making in establishments, and thus on its capacity of analysis of the modes and tools of management of higher education.\n\nThe Institute’s action is founded around five major challenges:\n\nThe activities of the Institute in 2009–2010 are articulate around three types of actions:\n\nThe Institute works in partnership with stakeholders and international institutions to accompany initiatives and realize actions which can contribute to the improvement of the functioning of higher education and more widely education in Africa.\n\nThe philosophy of this Institute expands dialogue and shared experience between African university leaders on issues related to university governance. Methods will step out from the classical models of cooperation in which the \"expertise\" of the North are transmitted to “addressee” and “consignee” of the South, leading to the principals and attitudes of copy-write. African Universities can only develop if they succeed in inventing their own policies and procedures, all by taking into consideration international standards.\n\nTo assist universities in the accomplishment of their missions in an efficient and modern way, the Pan-African Institute of University Governance shall make use of the relationship it has with partners such as the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) and the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU).\n\nThe AUF-ACU partnership consists of two joined visions. Rounding on common objectives and shared missions, Anglophones, Francophones, Lusophones and Arabic-speakers will better enrich discussions on how to develop higher educational system. This illustrates the importance taken by cultural diversity in the World today, being an essential basis for development inside more harmonized globalization which takes into account each person’s identity and values. Therefore, our approach is that of the exchange of experience and good practices likely to be widespread within the framework of our institutions that most frequently lack real communication.\n\nAbout governance : Two approaches shall enable us to tackle the problems of higher education institutions’ governance in Africa. The first one is current. It consists of rationalizing, valorizing and modernizing both the university foundations and their various systems of functioning. It supposes to put on better the whole university structure : better management, transparency in the decision-making and the participation of all actors in the decision-making. The second approach of governance fundamentally questions the efficiency of the systems of functioning of universities, too much centered on the hierarchical authority of the State, and on that of the university and academic administration, whether it is to define the financing, programs, the qualifications and even the courses of training. The governance of higher education will succeed only if it allows creating a common space of meeting between the actors : political, socioeconomic, students, teaching and civil society.\nWeb site : www.ipagu.org\n\nSouth Africa faces issues related to the governance of their tertiary system of higher education that correlate with international trends. Hall and Symes (2005) discuss the state of South African higher education in the first decade of the country’s constitutional democracy at a time when the country has faced not only democratic transition but also the end of Apartheid racial segregation. With the South African transition to democracy in 1994, the national government and institutions of postsecondary learning envisioned the cooperative governance of higher education. For a developing country that faced “massive social exclusion” for the better part of a century – only to be challenged in the 1970s and 1980s – traditional models for governance in higher education, European and North American models of institutional autonomy are not entirely applicable to the South African context. The authors discuss the need for government “steering,” an idea originally envisioned in South Africa with the democratic transition, based upon a cooperative framework as a “conditional autonomy.” The goals and objectives for cooperative governance were thus established with the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) in 1994, detailed in its 1996 report.\n\nThe South African National Commission on Higher Education was meant to serve as a “buffer mechanism” between government and institutions to establish a system by which “autonomous higher education institutions would work in a range of partnerships with government and other stakeholders,” from the involvement of state supervision and consultation. Within the initial years of the democratic transition and the end of the Apartheid, Hall and Symes (2005) note that the national government assumed a much stronger regulatory and bureaucratic control of South African postsecondary institutions than what had been originally expected. From the appointments to the National Commission on Higher Education, the 1997 Higher Education Act, and the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education, the national government has assumed direct command of curriculum, funding and regulation over institutions with “weak or non-existent traditions of academic freedom”.\n\nWhere the 1997 Higher Education Act and ministerial appointments provided the framework by which the national government could assert control over postsecondary institutions, the 2001 Education Amendment Act and white paper expressed the government’s motivations to take a strong position of power in the governance of South African higher education. Whereby, the “period from the 1997 White Paper to the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education has seen a systematic tightening of state control and the erosion of both the procedural and substantive autonomy of individual institutions”. Furthermore, Hall and Symes note that while the ten universities reserved for white students during the apartheid maintained substantial autonomy, other institutions such as technical schools and “branches of the racially defined government bureaucracy,” continued to be governed by tight government intervention. The authors do not reject the need for government “steering,” and cooperative governance with the national government for the developing country. Nonetheless, where the concept of conditional autonomy remained vague with its vision in 1996, the authors suggest that given the direction the government and NCHE have taken, there need be a rethinking of the relationship between institutions and the newly established democratic government.\n\nInstitutions of tertiary higher education in Europe have been under reform, following the common goals and objectives to develop new models for institutional governance. Sporn, writing for EDUCAUSE, discusses the restructuring of higher education with “notions of new public management\", which the author correlates to neoliberal economic models. The author directly relates these currents in the management of European higher education with the influence of U.S. models for approaching change in higher education. The European countries of Norway and Sweden are provided as additional examples of the new managerialism in tertiary education. In both Norway and Sweden, each have emphasized restructuring based on in vogue international trends with different approaches to reform that are characterized as common to continental Europe. New organizational forms for governance and leadership with the diversification of higher education have emphasized maintaining institutional autonomy, harmonizing institutional standards, and expanding higher education with goals related to the neoliberal market model of education. Stressing quality of learning and leadership within higher education, restructuring by way of the key catchphrases such as accountability, changing management in Europe also includes providing for human resource goals such as staff development.\n\nSignificant among these changes is the establishment of governing and coordinating boards with decision-making structures for collaboration in external and internal governance of higher education (as done in many states within the United States). Believing that there will be either a convergence or divergence between a strong administrative managerialism and faculty involvement in governance throughout Europe, the UK and U.S., the example of the system in Austria illustrates the potential for innovative approaches that grant autonomy to institutions with restructuring through an external board. In conclusion, Sporn believes the new governing structures provide stronger leadership and management, but that institutions \"should pay close attention to the role of faculty and shared governance.\"\n\nChanges in the United Kingdom’s system of higher education are given as examples of neoliberal economic models. Increased managerialism with economic privatization and minimizing internal governing structures are common themes in the restructuring of UK higher education, which entails the “erosion of the power of unions and professionals and the increased importance of managers and nonexecutive, nonelected directors. In general, the new managerialism in Europe involves four different trends:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Between the years 1863 and 1892, ten grammar schools were opened under the auspices of the Act. The first of these was Ipswich Grammar School, which opened in 1863.\nThe Grammar Schools Act was the fourth bill of the first parliament of Queensland. Along with the \"Primary Schools Act (Qld)\" 1860, it aimed to bring Queensland under one general and comprehensive education system without prejudice.\n\nIn the early years of Australian education, denominational schools (particularly Anglican schools) had a large influence. These schools were criticised over a number of decades for proliferating a social divide, and providing poor and biased education. By the time of the first parliament of Queensland in 1860, there was a general feeling that any system of education established in Queensland should be free of denominationalism.\n\nThe Act received little opposition in either House of Parliament – revealing its popularity. It found the approval of the public in general, and even amongst sections of the Anglican community. The Act marked a departure from the education systems in place in Victoria and New South Wales, where schools were generally tied up with respective religious bodies or (in the case of schools such as Sydney Grammar School) being provided massive, ineffective endowments, with little effort required from the community.\nThe main points of the Act are summarised below. Basically, the Act allowed for the establishment of a grammar school in any town where £1000 could be raised locally. The Queensland Government then matched that figure. The Schools were to be administered by a seven-member Board of Trustees, of which four members were appointed by the Governor. The Act also made provision for public scholarships for students to attend university in Britain or the southern states of Australia.\n\nThe act was repealed in 1975 and replaced with the Grammar Schools Act 1975.\n\nThere were ten grammar schools opened under the Act – eight of which remain open today. In chronological order, they were:\n\n\nWhen it opened in 1881, Rockhampton Grammar School was co-educational. Only four years later, the Board of Trustees decided to exclude females from the School, leading to the construction of Rockhampton Girls Grammar School. The latter opened on 11 March 1892 – one day after the official opening of Ipswich Girls Grammar School. (Females were readmitted to Rockhampton Grammar School in 1977 after a 92-year absence).\n\nIn 1936, hit hard by the effects of the Great Depression, the Maryborough Grammar School and Maryborough Girls Grammar School were forced to close. They were subsequently taken over by the Department of Education, Queensland Government, and renamed the Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Boys and Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Girls. In 1974, these schools merged to become the Maryborough State High School.\n\nThe main aspects of the Act were as follows:\n\n\n"}

The film features an ensemble cast including Jürgen Prochnow, Michael Paré, Elisabeth Moss, Patrick Muldoon, Clint Howard, and Brendan Fletcher. The film also addresses the issue of school bullying.\n\nThe last day of school contains many problems for both teachers and students of Riverside High School, and there are multiple storylines about this.\n\nThe principal, Harold Lewis, must discipline English teacher William Pratt, who has let his professional frustrations get the better of him, while guidance counselor Vanessa Jones attempts to get through to student drug dealer Wex Presley, who is ruining her students.\n\nMeanwhile, Principal Lewis' daughter, Karen, is having trouble with her boyfriend, Tommy Bruno, outcast Dara McDermott craves drugs, a pregnant girl named Robin Walters argues with her boyfriend, Kevin Rhodes about her future options; and bully Ricky Herman begins to recognize the consequences of his actions.\n\nUnbeknownst to these people, two bullied students and best friends Daniel Lynne and Barry Shultz are about to shoot up the school as an act of revenge against their tormentors. Barry, however, is having second thoughts, while the seething Daniel prepares to unleash his rage. Daniel decides to attack his high school on the last day, insisting that he does not care if he lives or dies, tired of constant harshness and abuse from his uncaring father, Artie and from bullies at school; Ricky amongst them. On the last day, Daniel carries out his plan, aided by Dara who spontaneously joins him. Daniel confronts three of his past tormentors: Paul, Ricky, and Jeff and kills them. Kevin is shot and killed when he and Robin come into the line of fire, much to Daniel's regret while Robin is spared. Meanwhile, Dara walks into her English class and kills Mr. Pratt, and Karen, who had been a rival for the attentions of Tommy. Dara is then subdued by bully Donny Pritzee and is turned over to the police. Barry walks away from the school, having bailed out on the plan, believing there are other responses to the abuse he and Daniel suffered in the past. A lone gunshot then rings out as Daniel commits suicide.\n\nAs the film ends, a reporter informs the public of the school shooting, revealing that Daniel committed suicide, and the camera turns away from the TV to show Barry's and Daniel's shocked parents watching.

{"id": "11083126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11083126", "title": "Jungian archetypes", "text": "Jungian archetypes\n\nIn Jungian psychology, archetypes are highly developed elements of the collective unconscious. The existence of archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by using story, art, myths, religions, or dreams. Carl Jung understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from the collective unconscious and are the psychic counterpart of instinct. They are inherited potentials which are actualized when they enter consciousness as images or manifest in behavior on interaction with the outside world. They are autonomous and hidden forms which are transformed once they enter consciousness and are given particular expression by individuals and their cultures.\n\nIn theory, Jungian archetypes refer to unclear underlying forms or the \"archetypes-as-such\" from which emerge images and motifs such as the mother, the child, the trickster, and the flood among others. History, culture and personal context shape these manifest representations thereby giving them their specific content. These images and motifs are more precisely called \"archetypal images\". However it is common for the term \"archetype\" to be used interchangeably to refer to both \"archetypes-as-such\" and \"archetypal images\".\n\nJung rejected the \"tabula rasa\" theory of human psychological development, believing instead that evolutionary pressures have individual predestinations manifested in archetypes. Jung first used the term \"primordial images\" to refer to what he would later term \"archetypes\". Jung's idea of archetypes was based on Immanuel Kant's categories, Plato's Ideas, and Arthur Schopenhauer's prototypes. For Jung, \"the archetype is the introspectively recognizable form of \"a priori\" psychic orderedness\". \"These images must be thought of as lacking in solid content, hence as unconscious. They only acquire solidity, influence, and eventual consciousness in the encounter with empirical facts.\"\n\nThe archetypes form a dynamic substratum common to all humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his own experience of life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events. Thus, while archetypes themselves may be conceived as a relative few innate nebulous forms, from these may arise innumerable images, symbols and patterns of behavior. While the emerging images and forms are apprehended consciously, the archetypes which inform them are elementary structures which are unconscious and impossible to apprehend.\n\nJung was fond of comparing the form of the archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given \"a priori\". The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.\n\nThe intuition that there was more to the psyche than individual experience possibly began in Jung's childhood. The very first dream he could remember was that of an underground phallic god. Later in life his research on psychotic patients in Burgholzli Hospital and his own self-analysis later supported his early intuition about the existence of universal psychic structures that underlie all human experience and behavior. Jung first referred to these as \"primordial images\" – a term he borrowed from Jacob Burckhardt. Later in 1917 Jung called them \"dominants of the collective unconscious.\"\n\nIt was not until 1919 that he first used the term \"archetypes\" in an essay titled \"Instinct and the Unconscious\". The first element in Greek `arche' signifies 'beginning, origin, cause, primal source principle', but it also signifies 'position of a leader, supreme rule and government' (in other words a kind of 'dominant'): the second element 'type' means 'blow and what is produced by a blow, the imprint of a coin ...form, image, prototype, model, order, and norm', ...in the figurative, modern sense, 'pattern underlying form, primordial form'.\n\nIn later years Jung revised and broadened the concept of archetypes even further, conceiving of them as psycho-physical patterns existing in the universe, given specific expression by human consciousness and culture. Jung proposed that the archetype had a dual nature: it exists both in the psyche and in the world at large. He called this non-psychic aspect of the archetype the \"psychoid\" archetype.\n\nJung drew an analogy between the psyche and light on the electromagnetic spectrum. The center of the visible light spectrum (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, which grades into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red end of the spectrum corresponds to the influence of biological instinct, which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet. Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of inorganic matter as well.\n\nThe archetype was not merely a psychic entity, but more fundamentally, a bridge to matter in general. Jung used the term \"unus mundus\" to describe the unitary reality which he believed underlay all manifest phenomena. He conceived archetypes to be the mediators of the \"unus mundus\", organizing not only ideas in the psyche, but also the fundamental principles of matter and energy in the physical world.\n\nIt was this psychoid aspect of the archetype that so impressed Nobel laureate physicist Wolfgang Pauli. Embracing Jung's concept, Pauli believed that the archetype provided a link between physical events and the mind of the scientist who studied them. In doing so he echoed the position adopted by German astronomer Johannes Kepler. Thus the archetypes that ordered our perceptions and ideas are themselves the product of an objective order that transcends both the human mind and the external world.\n\nJung described archetypal events: birth, death, separation from parents, initiation, marriage, the union of opposites; archetypal figures: great mother, father, child, devil, god, wise old man, wise old woman, the trickster, the hero; and archetypal motifs: the apocalypse, the deluge, the creation. Although the number of archetypes is limitless, there are a few particularly notable, recurring archetypal images, \"the chief among them being\" (according to Jung) \"the \"shadow\", the \"wise old man\", the \"child\", the \"mother\" ... and her counterpart, the \"maiden\", and lastly the \"anima\" in man and the \"animus\" in woman\". Alternatively he would speak of \"the emergence of certain definite archetypes ... the shadow, the animal, the wise old man, the anima, the animus, the mother, the child\".\n\nThe Self designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole.\n\nThe shadow is a representation of the personal unconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held by the conscious personality. Thus, the shadow often represents one's dark side, those aspects of oneself that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which one does not identify.\n\nThe anima archetype appears in men and is his primordial image of woman. It represents the man's sexual expectation of women, but also is a symbol of a man's possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies. The animus archetype is the analogous image of the masculine that occurs in women.\n\nAny attempt to give an exhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.\n\nPopular and new-age uses have often condensed the concept of archetypes into an enumeration of archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess, the wise man and so on. Such enumeration falls short of apprehending the fluid core concept. Strictly speaking, archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess and the wise man are not archetypes, but archetypal images which have crystallized out of the \"archetypes-as-such\": as Jung put it, \"definite mythological images of motifs ... are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited\", as opposed to their deeper, instinctual sources – \"the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images'\".\n\nHowever, the precise relationships between images such as, for example, \"the fish\" and its archetype were not adequately explained by Jung. Here the image of the fish is not strictly speaking an archetype. The \"archetype of the fish\" points to the ubiquitous existence of an innate \"fish archetype\" which gives rise to the fish image. In clarifying the contentious statement that fish archetypes are universal, Anthony Stevens explains that the \"archetype-as-such\" is at once an innate predisposition to form such an image and a preparation to encounter and respond appropriately to the creature \"per se\". This would explain the existence of snake and spider phobias, for example, in people living in urban environments where they have never encountered either creature.\n\nThe confusion about the essential quality of archetypes can partly be attributed to Jung's own evolving ideas about them in his writings and his interchangeable use of the term \"archetype\" and \"primordial image\". Jung was also intent on retaining the raw and vital quality of archetypes as spontaneous outpourings of the unconscious and not to give their specific individual and cultural expressions a dry, rigorous, intellectually formulated meaning.\n\nArchetypes seek actualization within the context of an individual's environment and determine the degree of individuation. Jung also used the terms \"evocation\" and \"constellation\" to explain the process of actualization. Thus for example, the mother archetype is actualized in the mind of the child by the evoking of innate anticipations of the maternal archetype when the child is in the proximity of a maternal figure who corresponds closely enough to its archetypal template. This mother archetype is built into the personal unconscious of the child as a mother \"complex\". Complexes are functional units of the personal unconscious, in the same way that archetypes are units for the collective unconscious.\n\nArchetypes are innate universal pre-conscious psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. The archetypes are components of the collective unconscious and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. Archetypes hold control of the human life cycle.\n\nAs we mature the archetypal plan unfolds through a programmed sequence which Jung called the stages of life. Each stage of life is mediated through a new set of archetypal imperatives which seek fulfillment in action. These may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.\n\n\"The archetype is a tendency to form such representations of a motif – representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern ... They are indeed an instinctive \"trend\"\". Thus, \"the archetype of initiation is strongly activated to provide a meaningful transition ... with a 'rite of passage' from one stage of life to the next\": such stages may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.\n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss was an advocate of structuralism in anthropology. In his approach to the structure and meaning of myth, Levi-Strauss concluded that present phenomena are transformations of earlier structures or infrastructures: 'the structure of primitive thoughts is present in our minds'.\n\nThe concept of \"social instincts\" proposed by Charles Darwin, the \"faculties\" of Henri Bergson and the isomorphs of gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Kohler are also arguably related to archetypes.\n\nIn his work in psycholinguistics, Noam Chomsky describes an unvarying pattern of language acquisition in children and termed it the language acquisition device. He refers to 'universals' and a distinction is drawn between 'formal' and 'substantive' universals similar to that between archetype as such (structure) and archetypal image.\n\nJean Piaget writes of 'schemata' which are innate and underpin perceptuo-motor activity and the acquisition of knowledge, and are able to draw the perceived environment into their orbit. They resemble archetypes by virtue of their innateness, their activity and their need for environmental correspondence.\n\nIn \"Biological theory and the concept of archetypes\", Michael Fordham considered that innate release mechanisms in animals may be applicable to humans, especially in infancy. The stimuli which produce instinctive behaviour are selected from a wide field by an innate perceptual system and the behaviour is 'released'. Fordham drew a parallel between some of Lorenz's ethological observations on the hierarchical behaviour of wolves and the functioning of archetypes in infancy.\n\nStevens (1982) suggests that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology shows us that each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour is taking place in the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.\n\nStevens suggests that DNA itself can be inspected for the location and transmission of archetypes. As they are co-terminous with natural life they should be expected wherever life is found. He suggests that DNA is the replicable archetype of the species.\n\nStein points out that all the various terms used to delineate the messengers – 'templates, genes, enzymes, hormones, catalysts, pheromones, social hormones' – are concepts similar to archetypes. He mentions archetypal figures which represent messengers such as Hermes, Prometheus or Christ. Continuing to base his arguments on a consideration of biological defence systems he says that it must operate in a whole range of specific circumstances, its agents must be able to go everywhere, the distribution of the agents must not upset the somatic status quo, and, in predisposed persons, the agents will attack the self.\n\nMelanie Klein: Melanie Klein's idea of unconscious phantasy is closely related to Jung's archetype, as both are composed of image and affect and are \"a priori\" patternings of psyche whose contents are built from experience.\nJacques Lacan: Lacan went beyond the proposition that the unconscious is a structure that lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns the contents of the Imaginary in the same way that archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. If we take the example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them. Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.\n\nWilfred Bion: According to Bion, thoughts precede a thinking capacity. Thoughts in a small infant are indistinguishable from sensory data or unorganised emotion. Bion uses the term proto-thoughts for these early phenomena. Because of their connection to sensory data, proto-thoughts are concrete and self-contained (thoughts-in-themselves), not yet capable of symbolic representations or object relations. The thoughts then function as preconceptions – predisposing psychosomatic entities similar to archetypes. Support for this connection comes from the Kleinian analyst Money-Kyrle's observation that Bion's notion of preconceptions is the direct descendant of Plato's Ideas.\n\nSigmund Freud: In the Introductory \"Lectures on Psychoanalysis\" (1916-1917) Freud wrote: \"There can be no doubt that the source [of the fantasies] lie in the instincts; but it still has to be explained why the same fantasies with the same content are created on every occasion. I am prepared with an answer that I know will seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a phylogenetic endowment\". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that \"like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child\".\n\nRobert Langs: More recently, adaptive psychotherapist and psychoanalyst Robert Langs has used archetypal theory as a way of understanding the functioning of what he calls the \"deep unconscious system\". Langs' use of archetypes particularly pertains to issues associated with death anxiety, which Langs takes to be the root of psychic conflict. Like Jung, Langs thinks of archetypes as species-wide, deep unconscious factors.\n\nRossi (1977) suggests that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, and that of the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.\n\nHenry (1977) alluded to Maclean's model of the tripartite brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older part of the brain and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion is that there was a time when emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There is an obvious parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.\n\nArchetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works, and therefore, that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or concretized in recurring images, symbols, or patterns which may include motifs such as the quest or the heavenly ascent, recognizable character types such as the trickster or the hero, symbols such as the apple or snake, or images such as crucifixion (as in King Kong, or Bride of Frankenstein) are all already laden with meaning when employed in a particular work.\n\nArchetypal psychology was developed by James Hillman in the second half of the 20th century. Hillman trained at the Jung Institute and was its Director after graduation. Archetypal psychology is in the Jungian tradition and most directly related to analytical psychology and psychodynamic theory, yet departs radically. Archetypal psychology relativizes and deliteralizes the ego and focuses on the psyche, or soul, itself and the \"archai\", the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, \"the fundamental fantasies that animate all life\". Archetypal psychology is a polytheistic psychology, in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and myths, gods, goddesses, demigods, mortals and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. The ego is but one psychological fantasy within an assemblage of fantasies.\n\nThe main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical Greek, Renaissance, and Romantic ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers, alchemists, and psychologists include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the psyche – the soul.\nMany archetypes have been used in treatment of psychological illnesses. Jung's first research was done with schizophrenics. A current example is teaching young men or boys archetypes through using picture books to help with the development. In addition nurses treat patients through the use of archetypes. Archetype therapy offers a wide range of uses if applied correctly, and it is still being expanded in Jungian schools today. With the list of archetypes being endless the healing possibilities are vast.\n\nArchetypal pedagogy was developed by Clifford Mayes. Mayes' work also aims at promoting what he calls archetypal reflectivity in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with psychodynamic issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their pedagogical practices. More recently the Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI), based on Jung's theories of both archetypes and personality types, has been used for pedagogical applications (not unlike the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator).\n\nArchetypes abound in contemporary films and literature as they have in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the collective unconscious that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.\n\nA contemporary definition is given by O'Brien (2017) as follows: \"Archetypes are universal organizing themes or patterns that appear regardless of space, time, or person. Appearing in all existential realms and at all levels of systematic recursion, they are organized as themes in the unus mundus, which Jung (1970 Vol. 14. Mysterium coniunctionis. (1970), p. 505) described as “the potential world outside of time,” and are detectable through synchronicities\".\n\nContemporary cinema is a rich source of archetypal images, most commonly evidenced for instance in the hero archetype: the one who saves the day and is young and naive, like Luke Skywalker in \"Star Wars\", or older and cynical, like Rick Blaine in \"Casablanca\". The mentor archetype is a common character in all types of films. They can appear and disappear as needed, usually helping the hero in the beginning, and then letting them do the hard part on their own. The mentor helps train, prepare, encourage and guide the hero. They are obvious in some films: Mr. Miyagi in \"The Karate Kid\", Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Jiminy Cricket in \"Pinocchio\", Obi-Wan, and later Yoda in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\n\nThe Shadow, one's darker side, often associated with the villain of numerous films and books, but can be internal as in \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". The shapeshifter is the person who misleads the hero or who changes frequently and can be depicted quite literally e.g. The T-1000 robot in \"Terminator II\". The Trickster creates disruptions of the status quo, maybe childlike and help us see the absurdity in situations, provide comic relief; e.g. Yoda in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Bugs Bunny and Brer Rabbit. The Child often innocent; could be someone childlike who needs protecting but may be imbued with special powers (e.g. E.T.). The Bad Father – often seen as a dictator type, or evil and cruel (e.g. Darth Vader in \"Star Wars\"). The Bad Mother (e.g. \"Mommie Dearest\"), along with evil stepmothers and wicked witches. The Bad Child; e.g., \"The Bad Seed\", \"The Omen\".\n\nJungian archetypes are heavily integrated into the personalities of the characters in the \"Persona\" series of games. In \"Persona 3\" and \"Persona 4\", the characters with whom you form relationships, (in the game called \"Social Links\") which are each based on a particular archetype. They are formally differentiated by different tarot arcana, however the primary basis of the game's characterization originates from archetypes.\n\nIn marketing, an archetype is a genre to a brand, based upon symbolism. The idea behind using brand archetypes in marketing is to anchor the brand against an icon already embedded within the conscience and subconscious of humanity. In the minds of both the brand owner and the public, aligning with a brand archetype makes the brand easier to identify. Twelve archetypes have been proposed for use with branding: Sage, Innocent, Explorer, Ruler, Creator, Caregiver, Magician, Hero, Outlaw, Lover, Jester, and Regular Guy/Girl.\n\nJung's staunchest critics have accused him of either mystical or metaphysical essentialism. Since archetypes are defined so vaguely and since archetypal images have been observed by many Jungians in a wide and essentially infinite variety of everyday phenomena, they are neither generalizable nor specific in a way that may be researched or demarcated with any kind of rigor. Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains of knowledge that seek to understand complex systems in an integrated manner.\n\nFeminist critiques have focused on aspects of archetypal theory that are seen as being reductionistic and providing a stereotyped view of femininity and masculinity.\n\nAnother criticism of archetypes is that seeing myths as universals tends to abstract them from the history of their actual creation, and their cultural context. Some modern critics state that archetypes reduce cultural expressions to generic decontextualized concepts, stripped bare of their unique cultural context, reducing a complex reality into something \"simple and easy to grasp\". Other critics respond that archetypes do nothing more than to solidify the cultural prejudices of the myths interpreter – namely modern Westerners. Modern scholarship with its emphasis on power and politics have seen archetypes as a colonial device to level the specifics of individual cultures and their stories in the service of grand abstraction.\n\nOthers have accused him of a romanticised and prejudicial promotion of 'primitivism' through the medium of archetypal theory. Archetypal theory has been posited as being scientifically unfalsifiable and even questioned as to being a suitable domain of psychological and scientific enquiry. Jung mentions the demarcation between experimental and descriptive psychological study, seeing archetypal psychology as rooted by necessity in the latter camp, grounded as it was (to a degree) in clinical case-work.\n\nBecause Jung's viewpoint was essentially subjectivist, he displayed a somewhat Neo-Kantian perspective of a skepticism for knowing things in themselves and a preference of inner experience over empirical data. This skepticism opened Jung up to the charge of countering materialism with another kind of reductionism, one that reduces everything to subjective psychological explanation and wooly quasi-mystical assertions.\n\nPost-Jungian criticism seeks to contextualise, expand and modify Jung's original discourse on archetypes. Michael Fordham is critical of tendencies to relate imagery produced by patients to historical parallels only, e.g. from alchemy, mythology or folklore. A patient who produces archetypal material with striking alchemical parallels runs the risk of becoming more divorced than before from his setting in contemporary life.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10970082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10970082", "title": "Learning disability", "text": "Learning disability\n\nLearning disability is a classification that includes several areas of functioning in which a person has difficulty learning in a typical manner, usually caused by an unknown factor or factors. Given the \"difficulty learning in a typical manner\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \"learning difference\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the UK, the term \"learning disability\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \"learning difficulties\".\n\nWhile \"learning disability\", \"learning disorder\" and \"learning difficulty\" are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (psychologist, pediatrician, etc.). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term \"learning disorder\" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills. Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), mathematics (dyscalculia) and writing (dysgraphia).\n\nThe unknown factor is the disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive and process information. This disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability. People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.\n\nIndividuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. Depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions, and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success. Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex. Current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports. Teachers, parents, and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners. School psychologists and other qualified professionals quite often help design the intervention and coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents.\nRepresentatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD). The NJCLD used the term 'learning disability' to indicate a discrepancy between a child’s apparent capacity to learn and his or her level of achievement. Several difficulties existed, however, with the NJCLD standard of defining learning disability. One such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability. This conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction, such as those with cerebral palsy, did not experience disabilities in learning. On the other hand, those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment, planning, and instruction. The NJCLD notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions, however, the two should not be directly linked together or confused.\nIn the 1980s, NJCLD, therefore, defined the term learning disability as: a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to Central Nervous System Dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g. sensory impairment, intellectual disability, social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g. cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, psychogenic factors) it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences.\n\nThe 2002 LD Roundtable produced the following definition:Concept of LD: Strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities (SLD). This evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies. The central concept of SLD involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual. SLD are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes. SLD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due primarily to other conditions, such as intellectual disability, behavioral disturbance, lack of opportunities to learn, or primary sensory deficits.The issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy. The term \"learning disability\" does not exist in DSM-IV, but it has been added to the DSM-5. The DSM-5 does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading, mathematics, or written expression. Instead, it is a single diagnosis criterion describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the terms learning disability and learning disorder (LD) refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to speak, listen, read, write, spell, reason, organize information, and do math. People with learning disabilities generally have intelligence that is average or higher.\n\nThe Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973, effective May 1977, guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities, especially in the cases of education and work, such being in schools, colleges and university settings.\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, formerly known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, is a United States federal law that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. It addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21. Considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.\n\nIn Canada, the first association in support of children with learning disabilities was founded in 1962 by a group of concerned parents. Originally called the Association for Children with Learning Disabilities, the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada – LDAC was created to provide awareness and services for individuals with learning disabilities, their families, at work, and the community. Since education is largely the responsibility of each province and territory in Canada, provinces and territories have jurisdiction over the education of individuals with learning disabilities, which allows the development of policies and support programs that reflect the unique multicultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic conditions of its area.\n\nIn the UK, terms such as specific learning difficulty (SpLD), developmental dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder and dyscalculia are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the United States as \"learning disabilities\". In the UK, the term \"learning disability\" refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized cognitive impairment. \"The Lancet\" defines 'learning disability' as a \"significant general impairment in intellectual functioning acquired during childhood\", and states that roughly one in 50 British adults have one.\n\nIn Japan, acknowledgement and support for students with learning disabilities has been a fairly recent development, and has improved drastically in the last decade. The first definition for learning disability was coined in 1999, and in 2001, the Enrichment Project for the Support System for Students with Learning Disabilities was established. Since then, there have been significant efforts to screen children for learning disabilities, provide follow-up support, and provide networking between schools and specialists.\n\nThe effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes: individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well. Neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers. Researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions, but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label. It has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations. Emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors. It seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers; national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential (as evidenced by test scores and learning behaviors). It has been said that there is a strong connection between children with a learning disability and their educational performance.\n\nMany studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and self-esteem. These studies have shown that an individual‘s self-esteem is indeed affected by his or her awareness of their learning disability. Students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not, regardless of their actual academic achievement. However, studies have also shown that several other factors can influence self-esteem. Skills in non-academic areas, such as athletics and arts, improve self-esteem. Also, a positive perception of one’s physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of self-esteem. Another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity. This demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals, which increases their self-esteem.\n\nThe causes for learning disabilities are not well understood, and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability. However, some causes of neurological impairments include:\n\nLearning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term \"disorder\" rather than \"disability\").\n\nAlthough the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers. Recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured IQ and achievement is a clear indicator of LD. Furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are also low) appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest).\n\nMuch current research has focused on a treatment-oriented diagnostic process known as response to intervention (RTI). Researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students, placing those students who are having difficulty into research-based early intervention programs, rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria. Their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress. Those who respond will not require further intervention. Those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction (often called \"Tier 1 instruction\") and a more intensive intervention (often called \"Tier 2\" intervention) are considered \"non-responders.\" These students can then be referred for further assistance through special education, in which case they are often identified with a learning disability. Some models of RTI include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability.\n\nA primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance. This may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may, in turn, result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services. In the United States, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act permitted states and school districts to use RTI as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities. RTI is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in Florida.\n\nThe process does not take into account children's individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can inform design instruction. By not taking into account specific cognitive processes, RTI fails to inform educators about a students' relative strengths and weaknesses Second, RTI by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention. Third, it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability. Lastly, RTI is considered a regular education initiative and is not driven by psychologists, reading specialists, or special educators.\n\nDemographers in the United State report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the United States over the past two decades. This information is vital because it has been and will continue to affect both students and how educators approach teaching methods. Various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is English. It is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in English language learners (ELL) differs. In the United States, there has been a growing need to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide effective school psychological services, specifically for those professionals who work with immigrant populations.\n\nCurrently, there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing English language learners (ELL) with specific learning disabilities (SLD). This is a problem since many students will fall through the cracks as educators are unable to clearly assess if a student’s delay is due to a language barrier or true learning disability. With an unclear diagnosis, many students will suffer because they will not be provided with the tools they need to succeed in the public education school system. For example, in many occasions teachers have suggested retention or have taken no action at all when they lack experience working with English language learners. Students were commonly pushed toward testing, based on an assumption that their poor academic performance or behavioral difficulties indicated a need for special education. Linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ELLs' growth in language and academically. When ELLs are referred for a psychoeducational assessment, it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process, from poor quality educational services, from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders, attention problems, and learning disabilities. Additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is unaware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the U.S dealing could be potentially dealing with. These factors that include acculturation, fear and/or worry of deportation, separation from social supports such as parents, language barriers, disruptions in learning experiences, stigmatization, economic challenge, and risk factors associated with poverty. In the United States, there are no set policies mandating that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist, nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families. Many school districts do not have the proper personnel that is able to communicate with this population.\n\nA well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool. Also, an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples, observations, interviews, and rating scales as well as curriculum-based measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments. A compilation of these tests is used to assess whether an ELL student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors. It is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools. Also, many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ELL students.\n\nMany normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains: reading, including word recognition, fluency, and comprehension; mathematics, including computation and problem solving; and written expression, including handwriting, spelling and composition.\n\nThe most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ IV), Wechsler Individual Achievement Test II (WIAT II), the Wide Range Achievement Test III (WRAT III), and the Stanford Achievement Test–10th edition. These tests include measures of many academic domains that are reliable in identifying areas of difficulty.\n\nIn the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits. Assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include Gray's Diagnostic Reading Tests–2nd edition (GDRT II) and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Assessment. Assessments that measure reading subskills include the Gray Oral Reading Test IV – Fourth Edition (GORT IV), Gray Silent Reading Test, Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP), Tests of Oral Reading and Comprehension Skills (TORCS), Test of Reading Comprehension 3 (TORC-3), Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), and the Test of Reading Fluency. A more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.\n\nThe purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioral issues or language delays. These contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students' behaviors and compares them to standardized norms.\n\nHowever, caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia, especially as people with Down's syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardized tests to take account of special needs.\n\nLearning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.\n\nLearning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning: input, integration, storage, and output. Many learning disabilities are a compilation of a few types of abnormalities occurring at the same time, as well as with social difficulties and emotional or behavioral disorders. \n\nDeficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities. It is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties. This is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities. In the UK, the term \"dual diagnosis\" is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.\n\nReading disorder is the most common learning disability. Of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70–80% have deficits in reading. The term \"Developmental Dyslexia\" is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one. A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, word decoding, reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension. Before the term \"dyslexia\" came to prominence, this learning disability used to be known as \"word blindness.\"\n\nCommon indicators of reading disability include difficulty with phonemic awareness—the ability to break up words into their component sounds, and difficulty with matching letter combinations to specific sounds (sound-symbol correspondence).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR criteria for a disorder of written expression is writing skills (as measured by a standardized test or functional assessment) that fall substantially below those expected based on the individual's chronological age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate education, (Criterion A). This difficulty must also cause significant impairment to academic achievement and tasks that require composition of written text (Criterion B), and if a sensory deficit is present, the difficulties with writing skills must exceed those typically associated with the sensory deficit, (Criterion C).\n\nIndividuals with a diagnosis of a disorder of written expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization, multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor penmanship. A disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis. If poor handwriting is due to an impairment in the individuals' motor coordination, a diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder should be considered.\n\nBy a number of organizations, the term \"dysgraphia\" has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression.\n\nSometimes called dyscalculia, a math disability involves difficulties such as learning math concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), difficulty memorizing math facts, difficulty organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page. Dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor \"number sense\".\n\n\nInterventions include:\nSternberg has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports. Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important—yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities.\n\nSchools in the United States have a legal obligation to new arrivals to the country, including undocumented students. The landmark Supreme Court ruling Plyler v. Doe (1982) grants all children, no matter their legal status, the right to a free education. This ruling suggests that as a country we acknowledge that we have a population of students with specific needs that differ from those of native speakers. Additionally specifically in regards to ELL's the supreme court ruling Lau v. Nichols (1974) stated that equal treatment in school did not mean equal educational opportunity. Thus if a school teaches a lesson in a language that students do not understand then they are effectively worthless.This ruling is also supported by English language development services provided in schools, but unfortunately, these rulings do not require the individuals that teach and provide services to have any specific training nor is licensing different from a typical teacher or services provider.\n\nLearning disability theory is founded in the medical model of disability, in that disability is perceived as an individual deficit that is biological in origin. Researchers working within a social model of disability assert that there are social or structural causes of disability or the assignation of the label of disability, and even that disability is entirely socially constructed. Since the turn of the 19th century, education in the United States has been geared toward producing citizens who can effectively contribute to a capitalistic society, with a cultural premium on efficiency and science. More agrarian cultures, for example, do not even use learning ability as a measure of adult adequacy, whereas the diagnosis of learning disabilities is prevalent in Western capitalistic societies because of the high value placed on speed, literacy, and numeracy in both the labor force and school system. In the bigger picture, these points demonstrate how the label of disability is socially constructed and represents a lack of fit between Western conceptions of educational institutions and proper students.\n\nThere are three patterns that are well known in regards to mainstream students and minority labels in the United States:\nIn the present day, it has been reported that white districts have more children from minority backgrounds enrolled in special education than they do majority students. “It was also suggested that districts with a higher percentage of minority faculty had fewer minority students placed in special education suggesting that 'minority students are treated differently in predominantly white districts than in predominantly minority districts'\".\n\nEducators have only recently started to look into the effects of culture on learning disabilities. If a teacher ignores a student’s culturally diverse background, the student will suffer in the class. “The cultural repertoires of students from cultural learning disorder backgrounds have an impact on their learning, school progress, and behavior in the classroom”. These students may then act out and not excel in the classroom and will, therefore, be misdiagnosed: “Overall, the data indicates that there is a persistent concern regarding the misdiagnosis and inappropriate placement of students from diverse backgrounds in special education classes since the 1975”.\n\nOne of the clearest indications of the social roots of learning disabilities is the disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low socioeconomic status (SES). While some attribute the disproportionate identification of racial/ethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding, others have argued that racial/ethnic minorities are overidentified because of their lower status. Similarities were noted between the behaviors of “brain-injured” and lower class students as early as the 1960s. The distinction between race/ethnicity and SES is important to the extent that these considerations contribute to the provision of services to children in need.\nWhile many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time, or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of African American students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower SES, while the disproportionate identification of Latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability. Although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously. For instance, if high SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high SES Whites, and low SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low SES Whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low SES. Summarily, because the risk of identification for White students who have low SES is similar to that of Black students who have low SES, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low SES youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities. It remains to be determined why lower SES youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.\n\nPeople with an IQ lower than 70 are usually characterized as having an intellectual disability and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities because their difficulty in learning are considered to be related directly to their overall low intelligence.\n\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities. An individual with ADHD may struggle with learning, but he or she can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD. A person can have ADHD but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having ADHD. The conditions can co-occur.\n\nPeople diagnosed with ADHD sometimes have impaired learning. Some of the struggles people with ADHD have might include lack of motivation, high levels of anxiety, and the inability to process information. There are studies that suggest people with ADHD generally have a positive attitude toward academics and, with developed study skills, can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities. Also, using alternate sources of gathering information, such as websites, study groups, and learning centers, can help a person with ADHD be academically successful.\n\nSome research is beginning to make a case for ADHD being included in the definition of LDs since it is being shown to have a strong effect on \"executive functions\" required for learning. This has not as yet affected any official definitions. Though, historically, ADHD was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning. Scientific research continues to explore the traits, struggles, and learning styles of those with ADHD.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56969383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56969383", "title": "Mishti Sharma", "text": "Mishti Sharma\n\nMishti Sharma is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", played by Scarlet Vas. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 April 2017. The character was introduced alongside an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family, who consist of Indian-Australians. The show's producer Jason Herbison thought their inclusion was important to better reflect Australian society. Actress Sharon Johal who plays Mishti's sister Dipi Rebecchi originally auditioned for the role of Mishti. When writers changed the characters age they hired Vas to play her instead. Vas made her final appearance as Mishti on 19 October 2018.\n\nMishti is characterised as having a strong passion for physical fitness and is family oriented. She often plays the role of peacemaker in her family when they argue. Vas has described Mishti as a \"harsh\" character who is \"righteous about staying within the law.\" When Mishti arrives in Erinsborough she is keen to start a new life, suggesting she has a troubled past. She forms a business partnership with Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) and opens a gym called The Shed. But viewers soon learn that Mishti is an ex-police officer who left the force following the death of her boyfriend Zander. Mishti's storylines have mainly focused on her relationship with Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano) and their many dramas. She also features in a pregnancy and miscarriage story. The character returns to the police force and begins investigating her neighbours who she believes are embroiled in the murder of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor). Reaction to Mishti has been positive and Claire Crick from \"Soaplife\" branded her and Leo a \"power couple\".\n\nThe character and casting details were announced on 27 March. Mishti is Dipi Rebecchi's (Sharon Johal) sister. She arrives in Erinsborough with Dipi's husband Shane Rebecchi (Nicholas Coghlan), an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family. The new Rebecchis are an Indian-Australian family. The show's producer Jason Herbison stated that \"we felt it was important that our new extended Rebecchi family reflect the cultural diversity of the community and our audience.\" Network Ten's Head of Drama, Rick Maier added that \"the new Rebecchi clan make for a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood, bringing fun, warmth and intrigue.\"\n\nVas was given the part a couple of days after she graduated from university, which she stated \"was a dream come true\". Vas found her first day on-set \"nerve-wracking\" but quickly settled into the role. Johal initially auditioned for the role after she received a call from the casting team. Mishti was originally supposed to be older, but casting directors decided to look for a younger actress following changes to the character's age. Producers still liked Johal's work and cast her as the much older Dipi instead. Mishti made her first appearance on 18 April 2017.\n\nThe show's official website have stated that Mishti is keen on physical fitness training and enthusiastic about starting a new life in Erinsborough. But she often appears sad because of her past experiences which are initially kept secret from viewers. Mishti is very family oriented and close to her sister Dipi. She has a history of being in the police force and therefore is keen to uphold the law. Vas has described Mishti as a \"harsh\" character who is \"righteous about staying within the law.\" She is also \"kind, warm-hearted and sweet\" despite her career. Vas also believes Mishti \"certainly knows what she wants and how to get it.\"\n\nVas has said that Mishti's \"smarts are like her super powers, she's very savvy.\" She uses this in her approach to solving crimes. She behaves in a very moral and righteous manner. Vas said that when another character tries to bribe Mishti, it is a mistake because she is \"Mrs Morals\". In her approach to police work Mishti has proven to be a nosey neighbour. She wants to solve all the crimes in the show. Vas said viewers has obviously picked up on this trait as Mishti has to know everything in an investigation.\n\nMishti arrives in Erinsborough to see her brother-in-law Shane. Coghlan, who plays Shane has explained that Mishti helps him when he considers moving to the area. The actor also described Mishti as \"a dear friend\" to Shane and said the two characters \"share some pretty serious confidences.\" Mishti comes to Erinsborough wanting a fresh start. However, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy thought she had a dark secret, noting \"there's also an air of sadness about her.\" One of Mishti's early roles in her family's story was trying to unite the bickering clan. A series of arguments had left the family angry at one another. Mishti realises she needs to solve the family feud following Dipi's refusal to celebrate their annual Hindi ritual Rakhi. Mishti takes drastic action by handcuffing everyone together and forcing them to speak.\n\nMishti then decides to set-up a business in Erinsborough. She asks fellow fitness enthusiast Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to be her business partner in running a gym. He is hesitant but Mishti goes ahead and buys The Shed. Aaron later agrees to Mishti's plan and they open for business. Vas told a reporter from \"Inside Soap\" that Mishti \"freaks out\" when Aaron first changes his mind. She has to figure out what she can get out of the partnership. The pair eventually bond and become good friends whilst training together. Vas explained that Mishti is \"obsessed with fitness\" and Aaron's equal passion for it brings them together. Vas was happy with the on-screen friendship because it is \"cute\". Wilson was also happy with the pairing because it offered his character stability. In another storyline Mishti returns to working as a police officer. When Shane gets drunk and starts threatening Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) and vandalising his garden, she is forced to arrest him. Vas told an \"Inside Soap\" reporter that \"if Mishti didn't do her job properly it would be very obvious to her superiors.\" Dipi is angry with Mishti who believes she should have protected her family. But Vas explained that Mishti's role in the Erinsborough is to protect the public and Shane was being drunk and disorderly in public. The actress added that it is a moment when \"she is a cop, not a sister.\"\n\nIn Mishti's early month's on-screen it became clear that she was hiding a secret. Mishti does begin to reveal certain aspects of her past to Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Vas told Alison James from \"Soaplife\" that she begins to confide in him after he earns her trust. Later Mishti and Shane discuss her secret in private which gives the impression they are having an affair. Vas explained that \"whatever Mishti’s secret is, it’s complicated and it has the potential to cause problems within the family.\" She added that Mishti definitely wants Shane to keep her secret from other characters in the show. In addition \"Neighbours\" wanted to keep viewers guessing at what her secret could be. Mishti and Leo later argue when she discovers that he has been sabotaging his half-sister Amy Williams' (Zoe Cramond) relationship with Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou). Their row esculates when Mishti is distracted and backs her car into Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns) and runs him over. The scenes were written into the episode to bring back \"painful memories\" for Mishti involving a past car accident.\n\nSince her inception Mishti shared many of her scenes with Leo, from which producers began developing a romantic relationship. Initially their bond takes a while to form. After befriending each other Mishti's reluctance to discuss her past causes problems. Vas told James from \"Soaplife\" that \"Mishti starts dropping her guard and she begins to confide in him.\" Leo, a character who had previously been portrayed as ruthless, began showing a caring side towards Mishti. Writers would continue to have the duo stuck contemplating a relationship but ultimately remain friends. Producers finally decided to unite the pair in September 2017. When Amy wants Leo to sell his share of the Robinsons hotel she concocts a plan to get him and Mishti together. She assumes that Mishti will be able to convince Leo to sell. Mishti is unaware of Amy's true intentions and thinks she is matchmaking. Leo is furious when he finds out Amy's deceit and presumes Mishti is part of the scam. But Mishti later convinces him of her innocence and they decide to begin a relationship. Their romance faces early issues when Leo kisses Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane) and Mishti witnesses the moment. Courtney is engaged to Leo's father, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and he wants to see if she will be unfaithful. Mishti later forgives Leo when he explains he wanted to ensure Courtney was committed to his father and not after money.\n\nMore problems followed focusing on the issue of trust. Mishti becomes secretive over her rogue investigation into the death of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor). She lies about her whereabouts. But Mishti installed a tracking app on his telephone device, as a kind gesture to follow each other. Leo uses the app to track down Mishti and discovers she is lying. This caused Leo to believe he can no longer trust Mishti and they nearly break-up. Another issue arises when Leo's friend Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) gets drunks and kisses Leo. The moment is witnessed by Dipi who informs Mishti, leading her to believe they were seeing each other. Mishti is forced to re-assume her role as peacemaker when Dipi and Leo begin arguing. Dipi believes that Leo has ill-advised her husband Shane over a business deal. She accusess him of plotting to secure a free urine powered generator Shane has invented. This is not true and Mishti is left with the task of solving their rift. They continue to bicker and fall into a swimming pool at a family barbecue.\n\nIn March 2018, \"Neighbours\" confirmed a new pregnancy story featuring Mishti and Leo. Leo is hurt at the Robinson Heights development site. A slab of broken concrete falls on top of him and leaves him trapped. Mishti is called out to the incident and is shocked to find Leo. Vas told Ellis (\"Inside Soap\") that Mishti is worried and can only reassure her boyfriend. But he is taken to hospital and recovers. The events lead Mishti to reveal her pregnancy. Vas explained that Mishti and Leo's relationship is still new, so she is unsure of how he will react. They had not thought about having children so are unsure about keeping it. But their families discover their news and are excited. The actress added \"she and Leo aren't even sure they want to have the baby yet - but they're forced to go along with the family's celebrations.\" But Vas told Sally Brockway from \"Soaplife\" that Dipi's advice and support actually helps Mishti accept her pregnancy. Dipi's encouragement about being a mother makes Mishti \"feel like she can do it because Dipi is an amazing mum to her three children.\" Mishti's next problem is telling Leo's father Paul as she fears his disapproval. To her surprise he is supportive. Vas added that Mishti thinks everything will be okay once Paul accepts the news. But she warned of many \"twists and turns\" for her relationship with Leo. It was later announced that Mishti would lose her unborn child in a miscarriage story. Mishti and Leo argue about his new role at Lassiters hotel and she experiences pains. When she is taken to hospital she is told that she has suffered a miscarriage. A reporter from \"Soaplife\" revealed that Mishti's loss would \"utterly devastated\" but ultimately bring Mishti and Leo closer together. Their resilience is short-lived when Mishti's friend Monique Hughes (Madeleine Vizard) visits and ruins their relationship. She was a colleague at the police academy Mishti and Zander attended. Monique discovers that Lassiter's has sold alcohol to a minor and blackmails him for money in exchange for her silence.\n\nWriters planned a revenge porn story for Mishti which began in June 2018. Rory O'Connor from the \"Daily Express\" reported that the story would leave a \"trail of devastation\" for the character. When Mishti attends a night out drinking with her friends she decides to have casual sex with Dilhan Ozdil (Kyle Hazebroek). She takes Dilhan back to her home and is unaware he intends to rob her. Vas told Maddison Hockey from \"TV Week\" that Mishti's reasons for her care-free behaviour is due to her need to move on from her miscarriage. She is initially \"hesitant\" but her friend Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly) convinces her to have fun. Following their encounter Dilhan sneaks out of the bedroom to steal money, but Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) disturbs him. Mishti is shocked and left questioning her bevahiour but decides that she must track Dilhan down to arrest him. Then Mishti receives text messages revealing that he recorded them having sex and will upload it online if she does not drop the charges.\n\nMishti ignores his threats and enlists the help of Aaron to retrieve the footage from Dilhan, which is unsuccessful and it is shared online. Mishti is left humiliated and feels ashamed when a stranger recognises her and makes a lewd remark. Mishti feels more positive when Dilhan is arrested but his family secure his bail and he is released. Vas told from Hockey that Mishti wants to move on but Dilhan receiving bail hinders that. She explained that Mishti \"just feels defeated, she's very angry with the whole situation.\" Leo becomes concerned and decides to try and trick Dilhan into breaking his bail conditions. He tries to cause a fight but when Dilhan goads him, Leo ends up punching Ned Willis (Ben Hall) instead. Dilhan continues to harass Mishti and sends her a series of threatening text messages. She worries her friends because of her reluctance to report the abuse. He threatens to visit her home and Mishti hears an intruder in her garden. Mishti is alarmed and recklessly withdraws her gun and fires a warning shot out of the door, which jeopardises her police career.\n\nOn 8 October 2018, Daniel Kilkelly of \"Digital Spy\" confirmed that the character would be departing the serial the following week. Mishti decides to leave Erinsborough to join her fiancé Pavan Nahal (Akkshey Caplash) in Sydney. Mishti's exit scenes aired on 19 October. The following day, Vas posted a message about her departure on Instagram saying she \"loved portraying every minute\" of Mishti. She added, \" to all the amazing viewers during my time on @neighbours.. To all my Mishti fans, your love and support means the world to me and I can't wait for you all to come with me on my journey in the next stage of my career...\"\n\nMishti comes to Harold's Café in Erinsborough to talk to Shane Rebecchi about whether his brother Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) can help them. Mishti then tells Shane that she might have found a way to solve their problem. Shane later tells Mishti that he is thinking of moving to Erinsborough, as he and his wife Dipi need a fresh start. She asks Shane if he has told Toadie everything, but he says he is planning to. Mishti stays at the Erinsborough Backpackers and flirts with Leo. They agree that neither of them want a serious relationship. Mishti surprises Dipi when she and her daughters finally arrive in Erinsborough. Mishti helps an injured Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) when a ute crashes into the backpackers hostel. She continues to stay involved in the investigation and drives Tyler to the city, so he can question T-Bone (Des Flanagan). When Tyler assaults T-Bone, Mishti reports him to the police and it emerges that she is a former police officer. Shane admits to Dipi that Mishti gave him a loan, as he lost a lot of money trying to get his solar-powered lawnmower to work. Mishti also reveals that she followed Shane to Erinsborough to help out and get away from her old life.\n\nMishti befriends Aaron and they buy a local gym together. While arguing with Leo, Mishti gets into her car and reverses into Tyler. She briefly goes into shock, while Tyler is left with severe bruising. Mishti reveals to Leo that she was once engaged to a fellow police officer named Zander, who was run down and killed during an RBT patrol, and the driver responsible escaped justice. Shane later tells Dipi that shortly after Zander's death, he found Mishti smashing up the house and threatening to get justice for Zander. He stopped her from leaving with her service weapon, and she decided to quit the force. Mishti tells Dipi that the accident with Tyler reminded her of Zander. She starts a relationship with Leo. She finds Leo with Courtney and suspects he was cheating on her and runs off. Leo finds her and assures her that he was only trying to find out if Courtney was truly committed to her relationship with his dad, Paul. She is suspicious in the whereabouts of Gary and his mother Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) on the night of Hamish's death and investigates. Impressing the sergeant she is then offered to return to a job in the police force and accepts. Mishti tells Aaron that she will no longer be working with him at The Shed. Mishti investigates Paul's interference with hotel records, but is ordered to stop. She arrests Shane following a drunken public disturbance on Ramsay Street and puts him in a cell to sober up. Dipi is angry with Mishti arresting her own family, but she later forgives her sister.\n\nWhile on duty, Mishti receives a radio call indicating that an accident occurred at the Robinson Heights housing development site. Mishti arrives to find Leo being treated by paramedics after being crushed by a concrete slab. After Leo is given the all clear, Mishti tells him she is pregnant. Kirsha hears about Mishti's pregnancy and tells her family. Mishti experiences pains and miscarries her baby. She and Leo agree that it was too soon to start a family and move on. Mishti's former colleague Monique Hughes (Madeleine Vizard) visits and they reminisce about their time working with Zander. Monique discovers that Lassiters have illegally sold alcohol to Xanthe and she tries to blackmail Leo in exchange for her silence. This causes Leo to hire a private investigator and he discovers that Monique and Zander had been involved with illegal gangs. Leo informs Mishti who is devastated that her boyfriend, best friend and ex-fiancé have all lied to her. She realises she can no longer trust anyone and ends her relationship with Leo. Mishti has a one-night stand with Dilhan Ozdil and he steals money from her purse. Dilhan threatens to upload footage of them having sex to the internet if she does not drop the theft charges. Aaron helps Mishti retrieve the footage and she arrests Dilhan. He is granted bail and makes the footage public. Mishti delivers a talk at Erinsborough High about the emotional impact of revenge porn. She tries to move on, but Dilhan starts sending her abusive text messages. \n\nWhen she is home alone Dilhan's texts make her feel unsafe. Chloe creeps into Mishti's back garden to check-up on her, Mishti withdraws her gun and discharges a warning shot. Mishti is overcome with guilt and reports herself to the police, who decide not to take any legal action and request that she retakes her weapon training. Mishti sells her half of The Shed to Paul. After an unsuccessful date with Rob Carson (Christopher Farrell), Mishti joins an arranged marriage website, where she meets Sydney dentist Pavan Nahal. After opening up about their pasts, Mishti and Pavan become engaged. Mishti agrees to help Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) search for Monique and contacts her. Monique has Dilhan beaten up, before meeting with Mishti. Monique realises she is being set up and Mishti arrests her. At the station, Mishti learns that she is compromised an investigation and is suspended. Pavan calls of the engagement when he learns about the sex tape and Mishti accuses Dipi of telling him about it. Dipi later intervenes and speaks to Pavan. She learns that Monique sent the video, and that he was angry that Mishti did not tell him about it. Pavan comes to see Mishti and they reconcile. When he receives a job offer in Sydney, Mishti decides to leave Erinsborough to be with him. Dipi organises a farewell party for her before she departs.\n\nDi Hollingsworth from \"What's on TV\" branded Mishti a \"stunningly beautiful and superfit\" character. She added \"it's been clear from the off she’s hiding something.\" Claire Crick from \"Soaplife\" said \"Leo Tanaka and Mishti Sharma are certainly something of a power couple. Not only are they both massively successful in their beloved jobs, but they also make a beautiful pairing to boot.\" Another branded her \"mysterious Mishti Sharma\". Sasha Morris from the \"Daily Star\" has called the character a \"brunette bombshell\" and \"peacemaker\", adding \"Mishti cemented her position as Neighbours' latest hottie.\" Responding to the viewers incorrect theories Mishti is Dipi's secret daughter, Morris said \"that would be the mother of all plot twists.\" Helen Daly from the \"Daily Express\" named her \"the new cop on the block\", \"mysterious new character\" and said she was \"like every police officer that's come before her\" for mistrusting Paul. Upon learning Mishti's secret past, a \"Liverpool Echo\" writer stated \"they're the stuff on which soaps are so often built, so it should come as no surprise to learn than Mishti has one – and it's a whopper, too.\"\n\n"}

He is the founder and artistic director of NDM Dance Productions and Studios, a Bollywood dance company based in Artesia, CA.\n\nBorn in Agra, India, in a Punjabi family, Mahajan and his family immigrated to the United States in the 1960s. Mahajan began formal dance training at age 17, and graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a bachelor's degree in Sociology and Dance in 2002.\n\nThe work of Nakul Dev Mahajan has been influenced by classical indian dances and Western dance styles (hip-hop, Latin and jazz). As a result of his efforts to teach and promote the Bollywood dance style, Mahajan has been called \"Hollywood’s Favorite Bollywood Choreographer\" and an \"Ambassador of Bollywood Dance\". Mahajan appeared as a guest star (dancer) in season 3, episode 6 (\"Diwali\") of \"The Office\" (TV sitcom), led a Bollywood Dance instructional session prior to the 81st Academy Awards (2009), and choreographed a flash mob style Bollywood scene for an episode of Fuller House (TV series) (2016).\nSonia Singh (author) and Mahajan co-authored the script for \"One Man Bollywood Show\", a 2009 stage production performed by Mahajan. In 2011, Mahajan was the recipient of the University of California, Riverside \"Outstanding Young Alumnus Award\".\n\nIn 2003, Mahajan founded \"NDM Bollywood Dance Productions and Studios\", the first Bollywood dance school in the U.S.; the school has since served over 3000 students. In 2015, 430 students and 20 members of the school's dance troupe performed \"Bollywood Travels\" (the annual student recital) for a total of 2700 audience members. Mahajan serves as a guest instructor in the faculty of the Broadway Dance Center.\n\nNakul Dev Mahajan's choreography introduced the Bollywood Dance style to the stage of \"So You Think You Can Dance\" (reality TV show) in Season 4. Katee Shean and Joshua Allen's performance of Mahajan's routine for Season 4 was in YouTube's \"Most Viewed\" list for one week, and was included in BuzzFeed's 2014 \"25 Best 'So You Think You Can Dance' Routines of all Time\" listing. In subsequent seasons of the show, Bollywood performances were included regularly (see summary table, below).\n\nMahajan choreographed the \"group dance\" performance of \"Nagada, Nagada\" from Jab We Met in So You Think You Can Dance Canada (season 1).\n\nMahajan coached team India at the Superstars of Dance on the NBC Network and choreographed six remaining crews at the 2009 ABDCrews (season 4).\n\nA 2012 diagnosis of Stage 2 testicular cancer and subsequent chemotherapy treatment interrupted Mahajan's career.\n\nIn 2014, Mahajan choreographed a section of Paula Abdul's performance in \"Check Yourself\", a breast cancer PSA (public service announcement) production by Avon Products.

{"id": "10417456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10417456", "title": "Orality", "text": "Orality\n\nOrality is thought and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population. The study of orality is closely allied to the study of oral tradition. \n\nThe term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. \n\nWalter J. Ong’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and the basic orality of language is permanent. \n\nIn his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; \"secondary orality\" is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a newscaster reading a news report on television.\n\nIn addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of dialogue as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker Plato.\n\nBefore writing became a way for many cultures before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then. In \"Orality and Literacy\" (2nd ed. ), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he draws on pioneering work by Milman Parry, Albert B. Lord, and Eric A. Havelock. Marshall McLuhan was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the written and printed word as a technology. In his work \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the history of communication – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to pictograms, to the phonetic alphabet, to typography, to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.\n\n'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures \"totally untouched by any knowledge of writing or print.\"\n\nAll sound is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.\n\nWriting is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the institutions that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using mnemonic tools.\n\nIn his studies of the Homeric Question, Milman Parry was able to show that the poetic metre found in the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" had been 'packaged' by oral Greek society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of oral traditions, and their various methods of managing information. Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by Frances Yates in her book \"The Art of Memory\".\n\n‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives. As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.\n\nBut the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use. For example, Eric Havelock observed in \"A Preface to Plato\" that after the ancient Greeks invented writing they adopted a scribal culture that lasted for generations. Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write. In other societies, such as ancient Egypt or medieval Europe, literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.\n\nMany cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.\n\nOral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely. Speech is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato's \"Phaedrus\". Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.\n\nThe Canadian communications scholar, Harold Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus \"preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page.\" Aristotle, Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as \"halfway between poetry and prose.\" Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions \"through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations.\"\n\nFurthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities. For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown. This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text. Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like \"the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems.\"\nMcLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of 'secondary orality' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like radio, telephones, and television. Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence. Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.\n\nIt has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written literature. While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.\n\nUnderstanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that \"many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness.\"\n\nDrawing on hundreds of studies from anthropology, linguistics and the study of oral tradition, Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the 'psychodynamics of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.\n\nTo retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.\n\nAnthropologist Marcel Jousse identifies a close linkage between rhythm and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions. This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.\n\nOral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the Douay-Rheims version of Genesis (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in \"italics\") has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:\n\nDemonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the New American Bible (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:\n\nOral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to poetry or song; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and \"there is nowhere outside the mind to store them.\"\n\nOng cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the United States with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the 'Fourth of July'.\n\nSpeech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. \"Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this \"\n\nBecause oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic information management. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue \"from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require.\"\n\nThis creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and \"are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors.\"\n\nOral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.\n\nLong after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through apprenticeship, observation and practice.\n\nBy contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.\n\n'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.\n\nProducts of \"the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes,\" the great works of oral literature from Homer to Beowulf, from the Mwindo epic to the Old Testament, are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among African praise singers) on the other.\n\nIn an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a \"close, empathetic, communal association\" with others who know.\n\nOng cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century England. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.\n\nAs a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together \"mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony\", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached. This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the jury system.\n\nOral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.\n\nWhile many examples exist, the classic example was reported by . Written records prepared by the British in Ghana in the early 1900s show that Ndewura Jakpa, the seventeenth century founder of the state of the Gonja people, had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created. Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.\n\nIn oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by Alexander Luria, a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of Uzbekistan and Kirghizia in 1931–2 documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.\n\n\n\n"}

Davis\n\nPosey Oliver \"P.O\" Davis (1890–1973), was an American educator and administrator, as well as a pioneering agricultural editor and broadcaster.\n\nHe perhaps is best remembered as the longest serving director of the Alabama Extension Service (now known as the Alabama Cooperative Extension System) and for helping Alabama agriculture through a critical period of development.\n\nDavis also emerged as a national leader of and advocate for farming and Cooperative Extension work in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nDavis was born in a rural hamlet known as Skinhead near Athens, Alabama, on Aug. 15, 1890, to Richard Scoggins Davis and the former Mildred Elizabeth Barker. In a family genealogy written several years before his death, Davis recalled Skinhead as the place where his \"depleted family settled after being blasted out of McMinn County, Tennessee, by the hell of the Civil War.\" \n\nDavis also recalled that while this tiny community lacked intellectual and cultural sophistication, it was a place where \"people go to church, treat their neighbors right, tend to their own business and still believe God is for the living and the dead.\"\n\nAfter working for a while as a public school teacher from 1909 to 1912, Davis enrolled at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University), located in Auburn, Alabama, where he graduated in 1916. From 1916-17, he worked as a horticulturist for the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, leaving to take a job as an agriculturist with Southern Railway. He also worked briefly as an assistant boys club agent.\n\nHe married the former Mildred Kilburn, of Florence, in 1918.\n\nDavis worked briefly for Progressive Farmer before returning to API in 1920 to serve as an agricultural editor for the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and the Alabama Extension Service.\n\nShortly after assuming his new role as editor, Davis, however reluctantly, became one of the South's radio pioneers.\n\nHis involvement in this emerging medium followed after Birmingham News publisher Victor Hanson offered API $2,500 to establish a radio station to provide educational information to farmers and other API audiences. Recalling the incident more than 40 years later to then-Auburn University president Ralph Brown Draughon, Davis viewed the donation as practically meaningless, because it scarcely was enough to purchase the equipment to broadcast the signal, let alone to operate the station on a daily basis. Another limiting factor was the scarce number of radio receivers available in Alabama at the time.\n\nUnfortunately for Davis, the API administration, as well as his immediate supervisor, then-Alabama Extension Director Luther Duncan, fearing the bad publicity that would follow if they refused the donation, saw things differently. Davis, as the institution's editor and publicist, was assigned the task of securing funds and personnel to operate the new station.\n\nIt marked the beginning of a long, and as Davis recounted late in life, largely frustrating, association with this new medium. Simply acquiring an engineer who knew anything about radio was challenging enough.\n\nAs Davis recalled, WMAV was installed on the evening of February 22, 1923. By then, the Extension Service already had spent far beyond the initial $2,500 donation.\n\n\"We pecked and struggled as best we could with the equipment that was almost obsolete by the time it was installed,\" he recalled.\n\nAfter acquiring entirely new equipment, Davis moved the facility to Comer Hall and acquired new call letters: WAPI, which are still carried by the station today. Davis also was instrumental in working with agents to organize radio listening parties for audiences throughout the state — a practice that would foreshadow videoconferencing techniques common today.\n\nAfter repeated unsuccessful attempts to affiliate with a national network — NBC or CBS — Davis decided to move the station to Birmingham after securing a pledge from city officials to provide half of the annual operating costs, totaling approximately $20,000.\n\nAs an additional cost-cutting measure, Davis also negotiated an arrangement with the University of Alabama and Alabama College at Montevallo (now University of Montevallo) to operate the station in partnership with API.\n\nThe arrangement with Birmingham and the other two institutions worked reasonably well, Davis recalls, until the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, after which the cash-strapped city was forced to renege on the deal. This critical disruption in income forced Davis to lease the station — a \"long and painful effort,\" as he recalled.\n\nEven so, Davis did not find the effort entirely unsatisfying. WAPI not only provided the three institutions with a broadcast presence but also ensured a \"nice annual return on their investments\" from about 1922 to 1961.\n\n\"Some day, I hope a competent historian will dig up all of the facts and write much more in detail than I have about WAPI — a comprehensive history,\" Davis stated in the Draughon letter. \"I believe that it would be a story well worth writing and reading if done accurately and intelligently.\"\n\nAll the while Davis served as WAPI general manager, he also carried on his duties as editor of the Extension Service and the Experiment Station. He is distinguished for building one of the nation's leading public communications programs of his era. His work as an Extension agricultural editor served as a model for Extension programs in other states for reaching farmers and other audiences through print and broadcast media. In an era when agriculture comprised a major pillar of the U.S. economy, many of Davis' staff people were in hot demand among farm-related publications, agencies and businesses.\n\nDavis was also considered a tireless Extension worker. Records show that in 1925, he traveled almost 14,000 miles by train and more than 3,300 miles by car to carry out his work.\n\nPeople who worked with Davis recall that he never overcame his editing proclivities even after he became Extension director, frequently correcting grammatical and syntactical lapses in reports and other documents.\n\nFrom 1933-36, he also wore two other professional hats, serving Alabama Extension as executive secretary and registrar.\n\nFollowing predecessor Luther Duncan's ascension to the API presidency in 1937, Davis was appointed director of the Alabama Extension Service, going on to become the longest tenured director in Alabama Extension history.\n\nDavis was considered an idealist and one who was far less politically motivated than Duncan. The cerebral Davis also was criticized for not identifying closely enough with farmers — he \"didn't have enough dirt on his shoes\" to connect with the state's farmers, as one employee recounted years later.\n\nIn the view of many, though, he was an extrovert, also blessed with considerable communicative and organizational skills — attributes which, coupled with a deep devotion to the Cooperative Extension mission, more than compensated for any shortcomings.\n\nAs a result of his effective Extension leadership during the late Depression and through the war years, Davis emerged as a national agricultural leader and spokesman, which enabled him to influence the course of federal legislation throughout the Roosevelt years — in the view of some, a critical asset in an era when the federal government exerted an especially strong influence on farm policy.\n\nDavis also was highly regarded as a public speaker, traveling throughout the South and through much of the nation sharing his views on the future of agriculture and Extension's evolving educational mission.\n\nLike many American educators of his era, Davis firmly believed in the transformative power of scientific progress, frequently expressing effusive pride in the role Cooperative Extension had played as a change agent in mechanizing Southern farming and rendering it more efficient and profitable.\n\n\"Together, we're engaged in the finest type of education anywhere and by any people,\" said Davis, in an address to the Association of County Commissioners and Probate Judges in Mobile, Alabama, in 1956. \"In brief, it is scientific and technical information for sound and practical people where they live and work.\"\n\nHe often expressed exasperation with southern farmers who failed to heed the Cooperative Extension message, even describing the South as \"a land of neglected opportunities\" where producers were \"not taking advantage of opportunities, little and big, around them and among them.\"\n\"With chagrin, I have known of southern families having to call on charity or upon government for food,\" said Davis, writing in 1938. \"To me, this is unthinkable except, of course, [in] emergency cases.\"\n\n\"Every farmer, either landlord or tenant, can have one or more fresh food products almost any day of the year, except after occasional hard freezes. These, plus canned and dried products — also meat, milk and eggs, which can be produced at home — make a good diet, and plenty of it.\"\n\nDavis was determined to step up efforts to reach farmers and their families who, for whatever reason, were not heeding the Cooperative Extension message. In an article published in the Extension Review, he stressed that Extension workers must do a \"bigger and better job of teaching and inspiring more people into action.\"\n\nIt was not enough merely to limit the Extension message to the small handful of farmers willing to become \"Extension disciples,\" Davis stressed. Instead, he envisioned and implemented a strategy that would reach all rural people with the \"very best teaching methods at our disposal and the employment of the very best Extension workers.\"\n\nDavis undertook a major technological overhaul of Alabama Extension field offices, providing each county office with \"an addressing machine so that both big and little mailing lists can be used for effective contact through the mails.\" Outlying offices also were provided with film-strip and stereopticon machines \"so that each county worker may combine vision with sound in presenting facts at meetings.\"\n\nDavis also expanded Alabama Extension's presence in both print and broadcast media. He developed close working relationships with Alabama weekly and daily newspapers and with farm home publications. Extension educational broadcasts were aired six days a week on most broadcast outlets in Alabama.\n\nIn addition, Davis oversaw the launching of \"This Month in Rural Alabama,\" an 8-page tabloid that ran as an insert in 97 Alabama weekly newspapers. With a publishing run of 100,000 weekly copies, it became the most widely circulated publication in Alabama.\n\nDavis respected the role science had played in the rapid advancement of southern agriculture, but his faith in scientific achievement and progress was qualified. From his own experience working with farmers, he knew that stunning technological advances often brought new and even more complicated challenges. One notable example was the huge improvements in cotton yields that farmers, working closely with Extension agents, had made in spite of the persistent presence of the boll weevil — an achievement that, in turn, led to a cotton surplus and the \"attending headaches and difficulties now so prevalent.\"\n\nThe farm surpluses associated with improved cotton farming methods concerned Davis — so, for that matter, did the region's excessive reliance on the crop.\n\nLargely because of this, Davis was an early and vocal proponent of farm diversification.\n\n\"It is plain to me that cotton, upon which we are relying very largely for money income, must have help,\" wrote Davis in 1937. \"It is also plain that livestock and poultry are cotton's best helpers.\" \n\nA lifelong Democrat who maintained a cordial working relationship with the Roosevelt Administration, Davis nonetheless feared the long-term social and cultural effects of industrialization — effects already reflected in the growing number of Americans who were working for employers rather than for themselves.\n\n\"So, individual freedom as our ancestor knew it is largely gone because one who works for another is not exactly free in the sense that one is who finances his business and works for himself,\" Davis stated late in his Extension career.\n\nHe believed that farmers, along with small storekeepers and small businessmen, were essential to preserving freedom in America, because they were \"part capitalist and part worker.\" \n\nThis Jeffersonian passion for farmers and small businessmen sentiment largely account for his intense interest in and sympathy for the Farm Bureau concept.\n\nWithout the cohesiveness Farm Bureaus around the country provided, farmers would be unable to withstand the onslaught of bigness in the form of both big government and big business, Davis believed.\n\nDavis's goal of building up Extension to reach as many rural Alabamians as possible was not without its critics. These critics included Gov. James E. \"Big Jim\" Folsom, who maintained that this zeal for Extension work often came at the expense of other agencies.\n\nAs ex-officio chairman of the API Board of Trustees, Folsom, working closely with his ally, Gould Beech, an API trustee, filed charges at a trustees meeting February 21, 1947, claiming that Alabama agriculture had suffered a relative decline in farm income, partly because of Davis' mismanagement of Extension.\n\nFolsom also alleged that Extension failed to cooperate with other state and federal farm agencies and that it controlled the Alabama Farm Bureau, even choosing the president and delegates to Farm Bureau conventions. The governor also maintained that Extension was too politically engaged and had even used its weight to defeat an income tax amendment.\n\nDavis was eventually cleared by the trustees, who also passed a resolution commending him for his work.\n\nFor a time in the 1940s, there was a tug of war between Davis and Elbert H. Norton, state school superintendent, to succeed Luther Duncan, the API president, who had died unexpectedly in 1947.\n\nDavis retired in 1959 and was succeeded by E. T. York. He spent the last few years of his life compiling a family genealogy of the Davis family and serving on several professional and charitable boards. He also served as president of the Alabama Writers Council from 1962-63.\n\nAmong his honors, he was voted \"Man of the Year\" in Agriculture by Progressive Farmer magazine and awarded a medal and certificate from the American Farm Bureau in 1945 for distinguished service to American agriculture. He was also listed Who's Who in America for 1952-53.\n"}
{"id": "22684460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22684460", "title": "Peer education", "text": "Peer education\n\nPeer education is an approach to health promotion, in which community members are supported to promote health-enhancing change among their peers. Peer education is the teaching or sharing of health information, values and behavior in educating others who may share similar social backgrounds or life experiences.\n\nRather than health professionals educating members of the public, the idea behind peer education is that ordinary lay people are in the best position to encourage healthy behaviour to each other.\n\nPeer education has become very popular in the broad field of HIV prevention. It is a mainstay of HIV prevention in many developing countries, among groups including young people, sex workers, men who have unprotected sex with men, or people who use intravenous drugs.\n\nPeer education is also associated with efforts to prevent tobacco, alcohol and other drug use among young people. Peer educators can be effective role models for young adolescents by promoting healthy behavior, helping to create and reinforce social norms that support safer behaviors, and also serve as an accessible and approachable health education resource both inside and outside the classroom.\n\nPeer education is useful in promoting healthy eating, food safety and physical activity amongst marginalized populations. Peer education is also favorably used in medical education.\n\nA peer education programme is usually initiated by health or community professionals, who recruit members of the \"target\" community to serve as peer educators. The recruited peer educators are trained in relevant health information and communication skills. Armed with these skills, the peer educators then engage their peers in conversations about the issue of concern, seeking to promote health-enhancing knowledge and skills. The intention is that familiar people, giving locally-relevant and meaningful suggestions, in appropriate local language and taking account of the local context, will be most likely to be able to promote health-enhancing behaviour change.\n\nThere is a great variety in the support provided to peer educators. Sometimes they are unpaid volunteers, sometimes they are given a small honorarium, sometimes they receive a reasonable salary. The peer educators may be supported by regular meetings and training, or expected to continue their work without formal supports.\n\nA variety of theories are offered regarding the question of how peer education is supposed to achieve positive results.\n\n(1). Positive results of a Peer Educator are achieved through educating individuals to enhance their understanding about diseases, alcohol and drug abuse etc. and effectively communicate what they've learned to other at-risk peers in their community. The goal is to educate and reach as many people to limit the spread of disease and to learn how to overcome drug and alcohol abuse etc.\n\nThe popular opinion leader theory suggests a parallel between peer education and the marketing of commercial products. Peer educators are seen as \"opinion leaders\"—respected and admired by other members of the community. These opinion leaders espouse a certain lifestyle (such as safer sex, or not smoking, etc.)—and their peers wish to emulate them.\n\nCampbell argues that what peer education ought to do is to promote the kind of critical consciousness theorised by Paulo Freire This means that peers use the peer education process to critically discuss their circumstances, especially the social factors impacting upon their health. Becoming critically aware of these forces is the first step to tackling them. So, for instance, if local norms regarding sexuality and gender put people's health at risk, this approach argues that peers should critically discuss those norms, so that they can then collectively seek to establish new more health-enhancing norms.\n\nBased on the work of Bandura and colleagues, social learning theory claims that modelling is an important component of the learning process. In the most basic sense, people observe behaviour taking place and then go on to adopt similar behaviour. Participants require the opportunity to practice modelled behavior and positive reinforcement if it is to be adopted successfully.\n\nBased on the work of Sutherland and Cressy, differential association theory has been applied to the study of crime. Rather than the result of biological or psychological disorders, crime is a learned behaviour. This learning happens in social situations by associating with those who can teach the necessary skills and techniques needed. Through this theory it can be understood that peers can be very influential for both positive and negative behaviours. Young people can learn both good and bad habits from each other. In differential association theory the mere association with others provides a learning opportunity. If social learning theory is essentially psychological, differential association theory is essentially sociological.\n\nSarbin argues that peer educators will adapt to the role expectations of a tutor and behave appropriately. Furthermore, through adopting a role, individuals develop a deeper understanding and commitment to it. The potential is that Peer educators can develop a stronger commitment and a greater appreciation of the relevance of the health topic. Role theory is also based on the premise that communication can be blocked by differences in culture between the teacher and learner. Peer educators who have a similar set of experiences and culture are therefore likely to be more effective in promoting learning.\n\nDeveloped by Rogers and Shoemaker, the communication of innovations theory explains how innovations come to be adopted by communities and what factors influence the rate of adoption. These factors include the characteristics of those who adopt the innovation, the nature of the social system, the characteristics of the innovation and the characteristics of change agents. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that all innovations follow a similar pattern of adoption, with one group of people—the \"innovators\"—taking it up immediately. Then there are \"early adopters\", the \"early majority\", the \"late majority\" and finally the \"laggards\", including some who never adopt the innovation. In this theory key people influence the opinion leaders within a community. Change agents can be viewed as health professionals while opinion leaders correlate with peer educators. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that effective communication occurs when the source and receiver are \"homophilous\", that is, are similar in certain attributes. These include beliefs, values, education and social status. This would suggest that peers communicate better than those who are unequal or different.\n\nPeer educators are seen as credible sources of information. This has been shown to be particularly effective amongst the youth population. Peers and peer education are an important influence and approach in changing health behaviours.\n\nOne of the beliefs of peer education is that it is cost effective. Peer education has been identified as a more economical way to deliver health training.\nA team of peer educators can extend health promotion outreach and be more accessible than paid health professionals. Peer educators help to bridge many of the gaps in service that occur through fear and suspicion of official health care providers, and to facilitate effective communication with community members and professional provider. Engaging youth peer educators helps professionals to extend their outreach of programs and services to ensure their efforts are impactful.\n\nPeer education is empowering from both the standpoint of the peer educator and the individual receiving service. Peer education has been operative in encouraging knowledge, attitudes and intention to change behavior in AIDS prevention. Furthermore, nondirective peer support has been identified as the best way to motivate individuals in the preparation, action, or maintenance stages of readiness to change. Researchers have acknowledged that trained peer tutors were more effective than the untrained peers in influencing positive health outcomes. Peer education offers the educators the opportunity to benefit from taking on meaningful roles. Peer educators can act as enthusiastic advocates for the program and have a sense of purpose in their community outreach efforts.\n\nPeer education is sustainable. This has been found to be an important issue for community-based health promotion interventions to make a difference over time. A grassroots initiative involving volunteers means that the health issue is reaching the target audience continuously with less of a threat of financial cutbacks impacting on their work. Research findings support the use of volunteer peer educators as a feasible and effective healthcare delivery strategy and as having promising indicators of sustainability over time. Sustainability through the engagement of peer educators can strengthen the social environment so that it is supportive of healthy behaviors.\n\nDespite its popularity, the evidence about peer education is mixed, and there is no consensus on whether it works or how it works. Researchers have questioned the validity of the assumption that peer education influences behavior.\n\nOne important line of inquiry suggests that peer education may work in some contexts but not in others.\nA study comparing peer education among sex workers in India and South Africa found that the more successful Indian group benefited from a supportive social and political context, and a more effective community development ethos, rather than the biomedical focus of the South African intervention.\n\nA key issue concerns what a peer is and who defines this. In some instances age is a central factor but in other contexts, commonalities such as status may be more relevant. Caution has been noted regarding selection of peer educators. Some argue that there can be a stigma held against peer educators who have faced adversities in their own lives, particularly by mainstream health service organizations and professionals. Alternatively, peers educators would need to have high status within their social group to be effective. Researchers have argued that peer educators sometimes receive inadequate training, which limits their ability to educate their peers effectively and further state that peer selection and training is very important.\n\nAn important analysis on the development of many peer education projects is that it is led by adult constructions of adolescence and adolescent health behaviour. A central question should therefore be whose agenda is being served by using peer education projects which manipulate and exploit the social worlds of young people?\n\n"}

{"id": "4099615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4099615", "title": "Programmed learning", "text": "Programmed learning\n\nProgrammed learning (or programmed instruction) is a research-based system which helps learners work successfully. The method is guided by research done by a variety of applied psychologists and educators.\n\nThe learning material is in a kind of textbook or teaching machine or computer. The medium presents the material in a logical and tested sequence. The text is in small steps or larger chunks. After each step, learners are given a question to test their comprehension. Then immediately the correct answer is shown. This means the learner at all stages makes responses, and is given immediate knowledge of results.\n\nAnticipating programmed learning, Edward L. Thorndike wrote in 1912:\nThorndike, however, did nothing with his idea. The first such system was devised by Sidney L. Pressey in 1926. \"The first... [teaching machine] was developed by Sidney L. Pressey... While originally developed as a self-scoring machine... [it] demonstrated its ability to actually teach.\"\n\nIn World War II, with largely conscript armies, there was great emphasis on training. What was learnt influenced education and training after the war. One of the main methods was the use of film as a group training method. Research on the effectiveness of training films was done extensively. In one account, Lumsdaine comments that research on films went on \"from about 1918 to the present\" (meaning 1962).\n\nA few conclusions stood out from the research. First, films were great at giving overviews of a situation or an operation. However, they were less successful at getting over the details. Some general features of film (and, later, television) stand out. One is that a film goes at its own pace. Another is that no specific responses or activities are required from the viewer. A third is that the audience is varied, sometimes hugely varied. This gives clues to ways of improving instructional films.\n\nIn a 1946 experiment at Yale University, questions for students were put between segments of a film on the heart and circulation, with correct answers given after students had responded (knowledge of results). This added significantly to the amount learnt from the film. Lumsdaine commented that showing the version with questions and answers was as effective as showing the film twice, and faster.\n\nThe connections between this experiment and those of Pressey were obvious. Active responses by learners and helpful feedback on the activities were now seen as critical elements in any successful system of learning. Pressey's work had been half forgotten, but it was now recognised as significant.\n\nIf so much research had already been done on learning from films, what exactly did programmed learning add? The short answer is \"stimulus control\", by which is broadly meant the teaching material itself. Also, in programmed learning, a complete system was proposed which included these stages:\n\nA helpful discussion of the different programming techniques was given by Klaus.\n\nAlthough there were three or four other systems proposed, we discuss here the two best-known methods.\n\nOne was by Norman Crowder, a psychologist with the U.S. Air Force. He had been asked to investigate the training of aircraft maintenance men. Crowder's system was to set multiple choice questions in the text, and provide feedback for each of the alternatives. Examples of this method show that the alternatives offered in questions were chosen to cover mistakes which students were likely to make. Crowder's system, which he called \"intrinsic programming\", was better known as \"branching programming\" on account of its multiple-choice alternatives.\n\nMuch better known was the other style of programmed learning, as proposed by the behaviourist B.F. Skinner. Skinner made some very effective criticisms of traditional teaching methods. His scheme of programmed instruction was to present the material as part of a \"schedule of reinforcement\" in typical behaviourist manner. The programmed text of Skinner's theory of behaviorism is the most complete example of his ideas in action. Skinner's system was generally called \"linear programming\" because its activities were placed in otherwise continuous text. Skinner was a wonderful publicist for his own ideas, as can be seen from this passage:\n\nBoth methods were originally presented in machines, and both were later presented in book form. Both systems were to an extent student centered. They were ways of teaching individual learners who worked at their own pace. Both systems (in different ways) used knowledge of results to promote learning. In both systems the content was pre-tested to identify problems and iron them out. Both systems emphasised clear learning objectives. Progress in learning was measured by pre- and post-tests of equivalent difficulty. Many practical tests showed the effectiveness of these methods.\n\nMany of these ideas were picked up and used in other educational fields, such as open learning (see the Open University) and computer-assisted learning.\n\nProgrammed learning ideas influenced the Children's Television Workshop, which did the R&D for \"Sesame Street\". The use of developmental testing was absolutely characteristic of programmed learning. The division of the individual programs into small chunks is also a feature of programmed learning.\n\nEven more is this true of \"Blue's Clues\". Unlike \"Sesame Street\", which tested a third of its episodes, the \"Blue's Clues\" research team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two and six in preschool environments such as Head Start programs, public schools, and private day care centers. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis. Their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout New York City with over 100 children aged from three to seven, showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing.\n\nThe terms \"programmed learning\" and \"programmed training\" were interchangeable, because the principles and methods were almost identical. If the target audience was industrial or military, researchers used the term programmed training, because training budgets supported the work. But in schools and colleges, the work was often described as programmed learning.\n\nMany accounts used either or both terms according to which interest was paying for the work. Sometimes researchers used both terms as explicit alternatives. Some surveys standardised on using just one of the terms.\n\nPerhaps the only distinction was the way the \"terminal behaviours\" (the final test demonstrating what the learner had learnt) were arrived at. In training, the goals were decided by a process called task analysis, or critical incident technique. This was based on the key activities which a trained person should be able to do. In educational work, deciding on the terminal test was not so securely grounded. One school of thought, probably the majority, decided to turn the rather vague statements of educational aims into full-fledged behavioural statements of the kind \"At the end of this program, students should be able to do the following...\". A pamphlet by Robert Mager was influential because it showed how to do this. This worked well with some subject matters, but had its limitations. In general, educators have reservations as to how far a list of behaviours captures what they are trying to teach. Subjects differ greatly in their basic aims, but where programmed learning suited a topic, most field trials gave positive results.\n\n\"Daily Oral Language\" and the \"Saxon method\", a math programme, are specific implementations of programmed instruction which have an emphasis on repetition.\n\nWell-known books using programmed learning include the Lisp/Scheme text \"The Little Schemer\", \"Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess\", and \"Laplace Transform Solution Of Differential Equations: A Programmed Text\", by Robert D. Strum and John R. Ward of the Naval Postgraduate School. Several available foreign language reading textbooks also use programmed learning. \n\nRecently, the application of programmed instruction principles was applied to training in computer programs.\n\n"}
{"id": "2498524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2498524", "title": "Ruth Behar", "text": "Ruth Behar\n\nRuth Behar (born 1956) is a Cuban-American anthropologist and writer. Her work includes academic studies, as well as poetry, memoir, and literary fiction. As an anthropologist, she has argued for the open adoption and acknowledgement of the subjective nature of research and participant-observers.\n\nBehar was born in Havana, Cuba in 1956 to a Jewish-Cuban family of Sephardic Turkish, and Ashkenazi Polish and Russian ancestry. She was four when her family immigrated to the US following Fidel Castro's gaining power in the revolution of 1959. More than 94% of Cuban Jews left the country at that time., together with many others of the middle and upper classes. Behar attended local schools and studied as an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, receiving her B.A. in 1977. She studied cultural anthropology at Princeton University, earning her doctorate in 1983.\n\nShe travels regularly to Cuba and Mexico to study aspects of culture, as well as to investigate her family's roots in Jewish Cuba. She has specialized in studying the lives of women in developing societies. Since 1991 her research and writing have largely focused on her native country, Cuba, which she left at the age of four; her parents had family that had been there since the 1920s. Her research on the dwindling Jewish community in Cuba is also the focus of her film, \"Adio Kerida\" (2002). It featured camera work and editing by her son Gabriel Frye-Behar.\n\nBehar is a professor at the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Her literary work is featured in the Michigan State University's Michigan Writers Series. A writer of anthropology, essays, poetry and fiction, Behar focuses on issues related to women and feminism.\n\nHer personal life experiences as a Jewish Cuban-American woman are frequently an important part of her writing. Her dissertation (1983), based on her first fieldwork in northern Spain, became the basis for her first book.\n\nHer second book, \"Translated Woman\" (1993), was based on ten years of fieldwork in a rural town in Mexico. Her book, \"The Vulnerable Observer: Anthropology That Breaks Your Heart,\" examines the role that the personal can play in ethnographic writing and generated controversy. Jewish Cuba is the topic of her book, \"An Island Called Home: Returning to Jewish Cuba\" (2007), as well as her latest book, \"Traveling Heavy: A Memoir in between Journeys\" (2013).\n\n\"Lucky Broken Girl\" (2017) is multicultural coming-of-age novel for young adults, based on the author's childhood in the 1960s.\nRuthie Mizrahi and her family recently emigrated from Castro's Cuba to New York City. Just when she's finally beginning to gain confidence in her mastery of English –and enjoying her reign as her neighborhood's hopscotch queen – a horrific car accident leaves her in a body cast and confined to her bed for a long recovery. As Ruthie's world shrinks because of her inability to move, her powers of observation and her heart grow larger and she comes to understand how fragile life is, how vulnerable we all are as human beings, and how friends, neighbors, and the power of the arts can sweeten even the worst of times. Writing for Cuba Counterpoints, Julie Schwietert Collazo writes, \"Behar, without fail, always seems to be writing with the goal of honoring her own history, experiences, and feelings, without ever denying or excluding those of others, and in Lucky Broken Girl the achievement of this goal is evident on every page.\"\n\n\"Traveling Heavy\" (2013) is a memoir about her Cuban-American family, descended from both Askenazi and Sephardic Jews in Cuba, as well as the strangers who ease her journey in life. Her probings about her complicated Jewish Cuban ancestry and family's immigration to America explore issues about identity and belonging. Kirkus Reviews described her book as \"A heartfelt witness to the changing political and emotional landscape of the Cuban-American experience.\" Behar studies the revitalization of Cuban Jewish life as an anthropologist, but her personal journey back to the island she left as a little girl is the heart of this \"memoir I snuck in, between journeys.\"\n\n\"An Island Called Home\" (2007) was written in Behar's quest for a better understanding of Jewish Cuba and particularly her family's roots. She noted, \"I knew the stories of the Jews in Cuba, but it was all about looking at them as a community\". Traveling the island, Behar becomes the confidante to a host of Jewish strangers, building connections for further anthropological research. Conducting one-on-one interviews, combined with black-and-white photography, she builds readers an image of the diasporic thread connecting Cuban Jews to one another.\n\nBeginning with Jewish immigrants of the 1920s, who fled unrest in Turkey, Russia and Poland, she moves on to stories of later immigrants, Polish and German Jews who fled to Cuba in the 1930s and 1940s in order to escape persecution and the concentration camps of the Nazis. In Cuba immigrants opened mom-and-pop shops, peddled, and gradually adopted Spanish while still speaking Yiddish, settling into Latino life in La Habana Vieja. In the early part of the century, many Jewish immigrants worked in the Cuban garment industry. More than 94% left during and after the 1959 revolution. As her family was among those who left Cuba, Behar intertwines her personal thoughts and feelings with her professional, analytical observations of the current society.\n\n\"The Vulnerable Observer\" recounts Behar's passage to integrating subjective aspects into her anthropological studies. Suffering her grandfather's death while on a field trip to Spain to study funeral practices, she decided the ethnographer could never be fully detached, and needed to become a \"vulnerable observer\". She argues that the ethnographic fieldworker should identify and work though, his or her own emotional involvement with the subject under study. She strongly critiques conventional ideas of objectivity. She suggested that the ideal of a \"scientific,\" distanced, impersonal mode of presenting materials was incomplete. Other anthropologists, including Claude Levi-Strauss, Georges Devereux, and Clifford Geertz, had also suggested that the researcher had to claim being part of the process more openly. Behar's six personal essays in \"The Vulnerable Observer\" are examples of her subjective approach.\n\nBehar's grandparents emigrated to Cuba from Russia, Poland and Turkey during the 1920s. In 1962 they fled Cuba to escape Castro's communism. At the age of nine, Behar suffered a broken leg from the crash of her family's car. She was immobilized for a year. The experience and recovery period led her to the recognition that \"the body is a homeland\" of stored memory and pain.\n\nIn 1985, Behar was working in Mexico when she befriended an Indian witch working as a street peddler. Townspeople said the witch, Esperanza Hernandez, had used black magic to blind her ex-husband after he regularly beat her and then left her for his mistress. Behar's portrayal of Esperanza's story in \"Translated Woman\" suggests she alienated her own mother, inspiring Behar to portray Esperanza as a feminist heroine. Esperanza claims she found redemption in a spiritualist cult constructed around Pancho Villa. She blamed pent-up rage about her husband and life as the reason for the deaths in infancy of the first six of her 12 children. Esperanza's rage led her to beat up her husband's lover, throw her son out of the house, beat a daughter for refusing to support her, and disown another son for having an affair with an uncle's ex-mistress because she considered it to be incestuous. Behar reflects on her own life and begins to think that her Latina-gringa conflicts result from a feeling of loss after having tried to model herself according to the American Dream, thus losing some sense of her Cuban Jewish family's past in that island nation. Esperanza's odyssey examines physical borders, margins and separations. \"Translated Woman\" contributes to the feminist argument that studying women in anthropology has been undervalued due to traditional academic prejudices that view women-centered analysis as too personally biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although this payment is entirely voluntary, some school boards use terms such as \"Fees\", \"School Levy\" or \"Parental Contribution\" to coerce payment from parents. The Ministry of Education direction from its 1998-25 Fees Circular to school Boards advises that terms to imply that payment of the sum is compulsory should not be used, particularly \"fee\" or \"levy\". Instead, the term \"School Donation\" is suggested.\n\nState and state-integrated schools can charge Activity Fees for items above and beyond the curriculum, but payment of the donation is voluntary.\n\nIn state-integrated schools, there is a compulsory fee called \"Attendance Dues\". Schools have to report their attendance dues to the Ministry of Education, where any changes to the dues are monitored. Attendance dues are payable for upkeep of the school land and buildings, which unlike in state schools are privately owned by proprietors, such as the Catholic Church in the case of a Catholic school. While school donations are voluntary like in state schools, parents/guardians are contractually and legally required to pay attendance dues, and proprietors can take action against parents or even cancel the enrolment of the child over unpaid attendance dues.\n\nSection 3 of the Education Act 1989 states the following:\nThe act defines an international student as anyone who is not a New Zealand citizen or the holder of a New Zealand residence class visa. By virtue of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australian citizens and residents are automatically awarded a residence class visa on entry into New Zealand, so are not classified as international students. There are additional circumstances in which students are not classified as international students, such as children of refugees and foreign diplomats in New Zealand.\n\nThis means as long as the student is a domestic student, parents and/or legal guardians do not have to pay for things such as;\n\nOn 26 March 2017, the NZ Herald reported that the Ministry of Education was set to remind schools that they can’t enforce bring your own devices on parents. Ministry of Education deputy secretary Katrina Casey was quoted as saying:\n\n″Compulsory BYOD policies breached provisions in the Education Act guaranteeing a \"free education\" at state and partnership schools for all children from age 5 to 19.″\n\n″We will be reminding all schools that boards of trustees can ask, but can't compel, families to bring their own digital devices because schools can't deny a child's access to learning if their parents can't provide them one. In these cases, boards need to provide access to a school device. No child's learning should ever be disadvantaged by a lack of access to technology.″\nThe Government provides funding for teacher salaries, operational grants and supplementary grants to pay for the running of state and state-integrated schools and the delivery of the curriculum, so schools may only charge parents for things that fall outside of the curriculum.\n\nSchools can ask for, but not \"insist on\", payment of fees for activities that fall outside the curriculum or have a \"take home component\", at the beginning of the year. Schools can not make payment in advance a condition of enrolment and must ensure that learning is not impacted through non-payment for any reason, as Section 3 of the Education Act guarantees free enrolment.\n\nThe Ministry suggests that;\n\nNotably the Ministry of Education (1998-25) advises that it is inappropriate for activity fees to cover student workbooks (textbooks that students write in) and photocopying. Activity fees are a 'goods and service' so attract GST. The operation of activity fees is described in cases below.\n\nIf an Outdoor Education Camp is part of the curriculum of a particular course at school, then the school may not charge for it. However they can charge for food and transport to the camp.\n\nIf parents are unable or unwilling to pay for a school camp that is not part of the curriculum, or for food and transport to one that is, then the school should provide activities that will be an \"appropriate alternative\" for the children who do not go to the camp.\n\nSchools may charge for materials in classes such as woodwork and design when the student is able to take the finished project home. But the school should not force students to take the project home just so they can be charged for it. If a high cost project is being planned a lower cost alternative should also be provided.\n\nSchools cannot charge for photocopying except in exceptional cases. In most cases the teacher handing out photocopied materials is an integral part of the delivery of the Curriculum. Schools cannot charge for textbooks or workbooks unless the student is allowed to keep the book.\n\nIf the school is being funded by the Ministry or some other institution to provide these programmes then it cannot charge students to attend. A school may charge for unfunded programmes but it cannot compel parents to enrol their students in them.\n\nSpecial Education Programmes are usually funded through the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme, Specialist Education Services, or the Special Education Grant so schools can not charge for these programmes.\n\nSchools are funded by the Ministry to provide these courses. Unless there is a \"take home component\" of the course, students cannot be charged for STAR courses.\n\nThe Reading Recovery Programme is part of the curriculum and there can be no charge for it.\n\nSecondary schools collect fees on behalf of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) for the cost of administering the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), the main secondary school qualification in New Zealand. The fee is $76.70 per year, although it can be reduced to $20 for those with a Community Services Card (this includes all beneficiaries) or have three or more children completing NCEA, and must be paid by 1 September, otherwise the fee increases to $126.70, with no financial assistance possible, and must be paid to NZQA directly.\n\nBecause NCEA is part of the Year 11 to 13 curriculum, it is free for students to study for and sit the exams. However, any qualification gained will not be awarded until the fees are paid.\n\nOn 27 February 2016 the New Zealand Herald reported that Auckland Grammar School and Cornwall Park District School requested a payment from parents to participate in the ballot for out-of-zone places.\n\nThis resulted in the Ministry of Education issuing an Auckland-wide \"critical reminder\" to remind principals that they are not allowed to charge for participation in the ballots.\n\nThe reminder stated \"Administering a ballot for out-of-zone students is considered part of the normal activity of school staff\"\n\nKatrina Casey, of the Ministry of Education, also stated that: \n\"We have written to Auckland Grammar School and Cornwall Park District School to explain no payment connected with enrolment could be sought from parents and that schools cannot charge a ballot application fee, or make a fee a condition of enrolment,\".\n\nMany schools request a school donation. It is voluntary, tax-deductible for parents, and does not attract GST. Schools state that the school donation is needed to bridge the gap between the costs of delivering quality learning over and above what the Government funds.\n\nSchools typically use the funding to top-up the Operational Grant. Funds are tagged for items attractive to parents - e.g. additional teachers/small class sizes, ICT, or other learning resources, but as they are counted as income for operational matters in reality donations are indistinguishable from other operational grant expenditure, including any staff funded by the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe Government provides a higher Operations Grant for low decile schools because the decile represents the school community's socio-economic rank. As they get less Government funding, and because parents have more ability to pay, high decile schools typically request a larger donation.\n\nOn 10 May 2013, the NZ Herald reported that in 2012 parents raised \"more than $357 million a year in donations and fundraising to support the \"free\" schooling system.\"\n\nWellington College, a decile 10 school, charges $720 per student and $250 for each sibling each year for \"extras\" such as sports gear and computers, and the headmaster Roger Moses has admitted that it is powerless to act against the quarter of parents who refused to pay. Auckland Grammar deputy headmaster Wayne Moore said only 65 per cent of parents paid and his school would introduce a $250 \"compulsory fee\" in 2008 for technology subjects. The Rector of Palmerston North Boys' High School (decile 9), Tim O'Connor said that:\n\n\"We have parents who simply don't pay, believing that we have a totally free education system, which is generally supported by what the ministry tells parents.\"\n\nand that his school was considering hiring a full-time commercial manager to raise the extra $1.5 million a year it needed to operate.\n\nIn 2007 Feilding High School allegedly named students in school assembly, sent students home and restricted access to classes, because their parents had not paid subject fees. The Ministry of Education said in a media release that:\n\n... a school has the right to pursue the payment of legitimate charges. It has access to the same debt recovery processes as any other organisation. Parents are required to pay any legitimate charges that have been agreed with the school in the same manner that they are required to pay their power and phone bills.\n\nHowever, Mr Matheson also said that a school cannot use students as a lever in debt recovery. A school has no right to restrict access to classes, or send students home, or to shame students as a device to force their parents to pay. The issue of the claimed debt is between the school and parents.\n\nBecause school attendance is compulsory for students it is unethical for a school to use its relationship with students in this manner.\n\nFailure to ensure the well-being of all students at the school could result in the ministry using its statutory powers to intervene in the operation of the school board. The ministry has the power to appoint a specialist adviser to the board, or a limited statutory manager to manage student well-being, or a commissioner to run the school.\nSchool Trustees Association head Ray Newport says fewer parents have been paying the donation in recent years. At some schools the percentage is as low as 20% and even at the highest-decile schools, many parents opt out.\n\nSchool Boards cannot withhold school reports or leaving certificates until the Activity Fees, School Donation or any other charges have been paid as the National Education Guidelines state that:\nEach Board, through the principal and staff, will be required to...report on student progress\nSchools must also obey Section 5 of the Official Information Act 1982\nThe question whether any official information is to be made available, where that question arises under this Act, shall be determined, except where this Act otherwise expressly requires, in accordance with the purposes of this Act and the principle that the information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it.\nAnd Section 6, Principle 6(1) of the Privacy Act 1993\nWhere an agency holds personal information in such a way that it can readily be retrieved, the individual concerned shall be entitled...to have access to that information.\n\nOn 29 May 2013, the NZ Herald reported that Avondale College would not allow a student who had not made a donation to attend the school ball.\n\non 2 June 2013, the NZ Herald also reported that Macleans College added surcharges to ball and graduation dinner tickets, sports, drama and dance activities, and fees for Cambridge International exams if a student had not made a donation. The NZ Herald also stated that Macleans College was being investigated and according to the Ministry of Education the practice was unlawful.\n\nMinistry of Education spokeswoman Katrina Casey said that:\nshe would seek assurances from Macleans College that:\n- Any unlawful charging of fees will cease.\n- Students will not have privileges withheld because of non-payment of donations.\n- There will be no coercion to pay donations\nPrincipal Byron Bentley was quoted as saying: \"We beg to differ that these charges are unlawful - we had our lawyers look at this years ago\".\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Seek.co.nz reported that:\n\nIn 2010, Karamu High School in Hastings was reprimanded after advising a parent that her daughter could not buy a ball ticket or order a school-leaver's jersey until donation money was paid. The threat was withdrawn after the ministry became involved.\nAs School Donations are voluntary contributions, schools do not have to pay GST on the money they collect. New Zealand tax residents can claim 33.33 percent of the donation back through the Inland Revenue Department, by filing a \"Tax credit claim form\" (IR 526) with the donation receipt attached after the end of the tax year (i.e. 31 March) in which the donation was made.\n\nSchools that withhold items or activities that are fully funded by the school donation, such as the school magazine, are threatening the tax status of their School Donations. The Ministry states that this action...\n\n...implies that the school donation is not a voluntary donation at all but, at least in part, is a payment for goods and services. This may mean that all school parents would be unable to claim an income tax rebate on their \"donation\" and the board would have to pay GST on all the money it collected by way of school \"donations\". Furthermore, withholding an item can have other consequences eg if the student ID card is used as a swipe card to enable students to borrow library books, to withhold the card from students whose parents have not paid the school donation would have the effect of denying the student a privilege that is available to other students. (It is also worth remembering that the library building has been provided by Government and most of the books will have been purchased with operational funding.)\n\nOn 20 January 2008, \"The Sunday Star-Times\" printed an article entitled \"Cash-strapped schools call in heavies to collect donations\" by Catherine Woulfe.\n\nThe article claims that debt collector Baycorp says that it has contacted \"a handful\" of parents on behalf of state schools to pay school donations. It further claims that community law advisory group YouthLaw has received calls from parents who have been chased by debt collectors because they have chosen not to pay school donations.\n\nSecondary Principals' Association head Arthur Graves, principal of Greymouth High School says he would never use a debt collector to chase school fees, but knows of others doing so.\n\nMinister of Education, Chris Carter said coercing parents to pay donations was illegal and\n\n\"I would not tolerate any New Zealand school breaking the law. I would certainly intervene if parents approached me and I would urge them to do so... Parents are to email or telephone my office if a school has done that\".\nThe article also claims that YouthLaw has heard from students whose families have not paid the donation who have been banned from school balls or trips, or not given the leaving certificates needed for entry into university or other tertiary institutions.\n\nOn 14 February 2009, \"The New Zealand Herald\" ran an article entitled \"Parents asked to dig even deeper\" \nwhich was based on the results of a survey of Secondary schools in its distribution area. The results for a selection of Auckland secondary schools are as follows:\n\nIn addition to the above, the results of a 2012 web search for \"school donation\" shows that primary school donations are lower, and the link to the decile socio-economic rating means the donation requested is higher in high decile schools:\nSchool deciles listed from www.tki.org.nz and www.parliament.govt.nz.\n\n"}
{"id": "65828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65828", "title": "Smithsonian Institution", "text": "Smithsonian Institution\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution ( ), established on August 10, 1846 \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\" is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. The institution is named after its founding donor, British scientist James Smithson. Originally organized as the \"United States National Museum,\" that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967.\n\nTermed \"the nation's attic\" \nfor its eclectic holdings of 154 million items, the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. Additional facilities are located in Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York City, Pittsburgh, Texas, Virginia, and Panama. More than 200 institutions and museums in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates.\n\nThe Institution's thirty million annual visitors are admitted without charge. Its annual budget is around $1.2 billion with two-thirds coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the Institution's endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue. Institution publications include \"Smithsonian\" and \"Air & Space\" magazines.\n\nThe British scientist James Smithson (1765–1829) left most of his wealth to his nephew Henry James Hungerford. When Hungerford died childless in 1835, the estate passed \"to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase & diffusion of knowledge among men\", in accordance with Smithson's will. Congress officially accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation, and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1, 1836. The American diplomat Richard Rush was dispatched to England by President Andrew Jackson to collect the bequest. Rush returned in August 1838 with 105 sacks containing 104,960 gold sovereigns (about $500,000 at the time, which is ).\n\nOnce the money was in hand, eight years of Congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret Smithson's rather vague mandate \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\" Unfortunately, the money was invested by the US Treasury in bonds issued by the state of Arkansas which soon defaulted. After heated debate, Massachusetts Representative (and ex-President) John Quincy Adams persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest and, despite designs on the money for other purposes, convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning. Finally, on August 10, 1846, President James K. Polk signed the legislation that established the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of the United States, to be administered by a Board of Regents and a Secretary of the Smithsonian.\n\nThough the Smithsonian's first Secretary, Joseph Henry, wanted the Institution to be a center for scientific research, it also became the depository for various Washington and U.S. government collections. The United States Exploring Expedition by the U.S. Navy circumnavigated the globe between 1838 and 1842. The voyage amassed thousands of animal specimens, an herbarium of 50,000 plant specimens, and diverse shells and minerals, tropical birds, jars of seawater, and ethnographic artifacts from the South Pacific Ocean. These specimens and artifacts became part of the Smithsonian collections, as did those collected by several military and civilian surveys of the American West, including the Mexican Boundary Survey and Pacific Railroad Surveys, which assembled many Native American artifacts and natural history specimens.\n\nIn 1846, the regents developed a plan for weather observation; in 1847, money was appropriated for meteorological research. The Institution became a magnet for young scientists from 1857 to 1866, who formed a group called the Megatherium Club. The Smithsonian played a critical role as the U.S. partner institution in early bilateral scientific exchanges with the Academy of Sciences of Cuba.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution Building (\"the Castle\") began construction in 1849. Designed by architect James Renwick Jr., its interiors were completed by general contractor Gilbert Cameron. The building opened in 1855.\n\nThe Smithsonian's first expansion came with construction of the Arts and Industries Building in 1881. Congress had promised to build a new structure for the museum if the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition generated enough income. It did, and the building was designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze, based on original plans developed by Major General Montgomery C. Meigs of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It opened in 1881.\n\nThe National Zoological Park opened in 1889 to accommodate the Smithsonian's Department of Living Animals. The park was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History opened in June 1911 to similarly accommodate the Smithsonian's United States National Museum, which had previously been housed in the Castle and then the Arts and Industries Building. This structure was designed by the D.C. architectural firm of Hornblower & Marshall.\n\nWhen Detroit philanthropist Charles Lang Freer donated his private collection to the Smithsonian and funds to build the museum to hold it (which was named the Freer Gallery), it was among the Smithsonian's first major donations from a private individual. The gallery opened in 1923. \n\nMore than 40 years would pass before the next museum, the Museum of History and Technology (renamed the National Museum of American History in 1980), opened in 1964. It was designed by the world-renowned firm of McKim, Mead & White. The Anacostia Community Museum, an \"experimental store-front\" museum created at the initiative of Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, opened in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in 1967. That same year, the Smithsonian signed an agreement to take over the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration (now the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum). The National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum opened in the Old Patent Office Building (built in 1867) on October 7, 1968. The reuse of an older building continued with the opening of the Renwick Gallery in 1972 in the 1874 Renwick-designed art gallery originally built by local philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran to house the Corcoran Gallery of Art. \n\nThe first new museum building to open since the National Museum of Natural History was the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, which opened in 1974. The National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian's largest in terms of floor space, opened in June 1976. \n\nEleven years later, the National Museum of African Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened in a new, joint, underground museum between the Freer Gallery and the Smithsonian Castle. Reuse of another old building came in 1993 with the opening of the National Postal Museum in the 1904 former City Post Office building, a few city blocks from the Mall.\n\nIn 2004, the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of the American Indian in a new building near the United States Capitol. Twelve years later almost to the day, in 2016, the latest museum opened: the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in a new building near the Washington Monument.\n\nIn 2011, the Smithsonian undertook its first-ever capital fundraising campaign. The $1.5 billion effort raised $1 billion at the three-year mark. Smithsonian officials made the campaign public in October 2014 in an effort to raise the remaining $500 million. More than 60,000 individuals and organizations donated money to the campaign by the time it went public. This included 192 gifts of at least $1 million. Members of the boards of directors of various Smithsonian museums donated $372 million. The Smithsonian said that funds raised will go toward completion of the National Museum of African American History and Culture building, and renovations of the National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of American History, and the Renwick Gallery. A smaller amount of funds will go to educational initiatives and digitization of collections. As of September 2017, the Smithsonian claimed to have raised $1.79 billion, with 3 months left in the formal campaign calendar. \n\nSeparately from the major capital campaign, the Smithsonian has begun fundraising through Kickstarter. An example is a campaign to fund the preservation and maintenance of the ruby slippers from the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nNineteen museums and galleries, as well as the National Zoological Park, comprise the Smithsonian museums. Eleven are on the National Mall, the park that runs between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Other museums are located elsewhere in Washington, D.C., with two more in New York City and one in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThe Smithsonian has close ties with 168 other museums in 39 states, Panama, and Puerto Rico. These museums are known as Smithsonian Affiliated museums. Collections of artifacts are given to these museums in the form of long-term loans. The Smithsonian also has a large number of traveling exhibitions, operated through the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES). In 2008, 58 of these traveling exhibitions went to 510 venues across the country.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution announced in January 2015 that it is in talks to build its first permanent overseas exhibition space within London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nSmithsonian collections include 156 million artworks, artifacts, and specimens. The National Museum of Natural History houses 145 million of these specimens and artifacts. The Collections Search Center has 9.9 million digital records available online. The Smithsonian Institution Libraries hold 2 million library volumes. Smithsonian Archives hold 156,830 cubic feet of archival material.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution has many categories of displays that can be visited at the museums. In 1912, First Lady Helen Herron Taft donated her inauguration gown to the museum to begin the First Ladies' Gown display, one of the Smithsonian's most popular exhibits. The museum displays treasures such as the Star-Spangled Banner, the stove pipe hat that was worn by President Lincoln, the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard Of Oz\", and the original Teddy Bear that was named after President Theodore Roosevelt. In 2016, the Smithsonian's Air & Space museum curators restored the large model \"Enterprise\" from the original \"\" TV series.\n\nThe following is a list of Smithsonian research centers, with their affiliated museum in parentheses:\n\n\nAlso of note is the Smithsonian Museum Support Center (MSC), located in Silver Hill, Maryland (Suitland), which is the principal off-site conservation and collections facility for multiple Smithsonian museums, primarily the National Museum of Natural History. The MSC was dedicated in May 1983. The MSC covers of land, with over of space, making it one of the largest set of structures in the Smithsonian. It has over of cabinets, and more than 31 million objects.\n\nIn 1997, the Smithsonian Latino Center was created as a way to recognize Latinos across the Smithsonian Institution. The primary purpose of the center is to place Latino contributions to the arts, history, science, and national culture across the Smithsonian's museums and research centers.\n\nThe center is a division of the Smithsonian Institution. As of May 2016, the center is run by an executive director, Eduardo Díaz.\n\nAt the time of its creation, the Smithsonian Institution had other entities dedicated to other minority groups: National Museum of the American Indian, Freer-Sackler Gallery for Asian Arts and Culture, African Art Museum, and the National Museum of African-American Heritage and Culture.\n\nThe opening of the center was prompted, in part, by the publishing of a report called \"Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian and U.S. Latinos\".\n\nAccording to documents obtained by \"The Washington Post\", when former Latino Center executive director Pilar O'Leary first took the job, the center faced employees who had \"serious performance issues\". No performance plans existed for the staff and unfulfilled financial obligations to sponsors existed. The website's quality was poor, and the center did not have a public affairs manager, a programs director, adequate human resources support, or cohesive mission statement.\n\nAfter difficult times in the first few years, the center improved. According to the Smithsonian, the center \"support[s] scholarly research, exhibitions, public and educational programs, web-based content and virtual platforms, and collections and archives. [It] also manage[s] leadership and professional development programs for Latino youth, emerging scholars and museum professionals.\" Today, the website features a high-tech virtual museum.\n\nThe Smithsonian Latino Center's Young Ambassadors Program (YAP) is a program within the Latino Center that reaches out to Latino high school students with the goal of encouraging them to become leaders in arts, sciences, and the humanities.\n\nStudents selected for the program travel to Washington, D.C. for an \"enrichment seminar\" that lasts approximately five days. Afterwards, students return to their communities to serve in a paid, one-month internship.\n\nPilar O'Leary launched the program when she served as executive director of the Smithsonian Latino Center. According to the Latino Center, O'Leary told the press in 2007: \"Our goal is to help our Young Ambassadors become the next generation of leaders in the arts and culture fields. This program encourages students to be proud of their roots and learn more about their cultural heritage to inspire them to educate the public in their own communities about how Latinos are enriching America's cultural fabric.\"\n\nThe Institution publishes \"Smithsonian\" magazine monthly and \"Air & Space\" magazine bimonthly. \n\"Smithsonian\" was the result of Secretary of the Smithsonian S. Dillon Ripley asking the retired editor of \"Life\" magazine Edward K. Thompson to produce a magazine \"about things in which the Smithsonian Institution is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.\" Another Secretary of the Smithsonian, Walter Boyne, founded \"Air & Space.\"\n\nSmithsonian Books is a trade publisher. Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press is an academic publisher.\n\nThe Smithsonian makes a number of awards to acknowledge and support meritorious work. \n\nThe Smithsonian Institution was established as a trust instrumentality by act of Congress. More than two-thirds of the Smithsonian's workforce of some 6,300 persons are employees of the federal government. The Smithsonian Office of Protection Services oversees security at the Smithsonian facilities and enforces laws and regulations for National Capital Parks together with the United States Park Police.\n\nThe President's 2011 budget proposed just under $800 million in support for the Smithsonian, slightly increased from previous years. Institution exhibits are free of charge, though in 2010 the Deficit Commission recommended admission fees.\n\nAs approved by Congress on August 10, 1846, the legislation that created the Smithsonian Institution called for the creation of a Board of Regents to govern and administer the organization. This 17-member board meets at least four times a year and includes as \"ex officio\" members the Chief Justice of the United States and the Vice President of the United States. The nominal head of the Institution is the Chancellor, an office which has traditionally been held by the Chief Justice. In September 2007, the board created the position of Chair of the Board of Regents, a position currently held by John W. McCarter of Illinois.\n\nOther members of the Board of Regents are three members of the U.S. House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House; three members of the Senate, appointed by the President \"pro tempore\" of the Senate; and nine citizen members, nominated by the board and approved by the Congress in a joint resolution signed by the President of the United States. Regents who are senators or representatives serve for the duration of their elected terms, while citizen Regents serve a maximum of two six-year terms. Regents are compensated on a part-time basis.\n\nThe chief executive officer (CEO) of the Smithsonian is the Secretary, who is appointed by the Board of Regents. The Secretary also serves as secretary to the Board of Regents, but is not a voting member of that body. The Secretary of the Smithsonian has the privilege of the floor at the United States Senate. There have been 12 Secretaries. On September 18, 2013, Secretary G. Wayne Clough announced he would retire in October 2014. The Smithsonian Board of Regents said it has asked regent John McCarter, Jr. to lead a search committee. The search committee will consist of other regents and representatives from Smithsonian museums and centers.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, the Smithsonian Board of Directors selected Dr. David Skorton, a physician and president of Cornell University as the 13th Secretary of the Smithsonian. Skorton took the reins of the institution on 1 July 2015.\n\nIn 1995, controversy arose over the exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum with the display of the \"Enola Gay\", the Superfortress used by the United States to drop the first atomic bomb used in World War II. The American Legion and Air Force Association believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war. The Smithsonian changed the exhibit, displaying the aircraft only with associated technical data and without discussion of its historic role in the war.\n\nIn 2003, a National Museum of Natural History exhibit, Subhankar Banerjee's \"Seasons of Life and Land\", featuring photographs of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, was censored and moved to the basement by Smithsonian officials because they feared that its subject matter was too politically controversial.\n\nIn November 2007, \"The Washington Post\" reported internal criticism has been raised regarding the institution's handling of the exhibit on the Arctic. According to documents and e-mails, the exhibit and its associated presentation were edited at high levels to add \"scientific uncertainty\" regarding the nature and impact of global warming on the Arctic. Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Cristián Samper was interviewed by the \"Post\", and claimed the exhibit was edited because it contained conclusions that went beyond what could be proven by contemporary climatology. The Smithsonian is now a participant in the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution provides access to its image collections for educational, scholarly, and nonprofit uses. Commercial uses are generally restricted unless permission is obtained. Smithsonian images fall into different copyright categories; some are protected by copyright, many are subject to license agreements or other contractual conditions, and some fall into the public domain, such as those prepared by Smithsonian employees as part of their official duties. The Smithsonian's terms of use for its digital content, including images, are set forth on the Smithsonian Web site.\n\nIn April 2006, the institution entered into an agreement of \"first refusal\" rights for its vast silent and public domain film archives with Showtime Networks, mainly for use on the Smithsonian Channel, a network created from this deal. Critics contend this agreement effectively gives Showtime control over the film archives, as it requires filmmakers to obtain permission from the network to use extensive amounts of film footage from the Smithsonian archives.\n\nThe Smithsonian contends independent producers continue to have unchanged access to the institution and its collections as they had prior to the agreement. The process to gain access to film at the Smithsonian remains the same. Since January 2006, independent producers have made more than 500 requests to film in the museums and collections or to use archival footage and photos.\n\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of Internet in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, word and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years.\n\nManaging submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them.\n\nIt is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get assignments and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given feedback on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a system (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions.\n\nIn call-for-paper or academic conferences, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6–15 pages, which is peer reviewed by members of the conference's program committee and/or external reviewers chosen by them.\n\nMost competitions and contests held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the nominations and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.\n\nStudent bodies in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or semester basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above.\n\nRegulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical–biotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper.\n\nHuman resource departments collect résumés and CVs as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their résumés either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on employment websites that help connect job seekers and employers.\n\nIn contemporary art, curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work.\n\nModels create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them.\n\nJournalists and writers (full-time as well as freelancers) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement.\n\nMost government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too.\n\nAs companies, agencies and institutes move towards electronic submissions, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards.\n\nOne example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan).\n\nEmail is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions. Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature.\n\nThe key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert reviewers or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes.\n\nCertain software vendors have begun developing submission management systems to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are web based and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.\n"}

Dolls vary in the form best suited to the stage of development of the child; from a simple sack or pillow doll for a baby, a knotted or handkerchief style for a teething child, a simple doll with bulky limbs and either short hair or a hat for a toddler. For an older more independent child who can change clothing and dress hair, 'formed' limbed dolls with the ability to sit are introduced with changeable clothing and often longer hair, Typically hair on a Waldorf doll is made of pure wool such as mohair or boucle, ply wool or cotton. facial feature details on a Waldorf doll vary with the maker, generally simple stitches, sometimes painted but features are always a simple suggestion and ideally neutral, so the child can imagine the personality and mood of the doll and if the doll is awake or asleep. Some Waldorf dolls have small suggestions of noses. Skin, eye and mouth colors vary with each doll, ideally to reflect the colouring of the child for a first doll.\n"}

The character made her first screen appearance on 14 November 2017. Roberts had auditioned for the roles of both Kat Chapman and Scarlett Snow prior to playing Willow. She auditioned successfully and attended screen testing with James Stewart who play's Willow's love interest Justin Morgan. Willow was originally going to be named Amber. She is characterised as a tough female who was raised in a broken home and has subsequently learned to look after herself. Roberts has said that she admires the character's strong personality. Willow is introduced into the show wearing leather, chains and riding a motorbike. This added to her image as a powerful female character.\n\nWriters quickly paired her with Justin and their relationship is marred by a feud with gang member Boyd Easton (Steve Le Marquand). His family kidnap Justin's daughter Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas), which ends the relationship. Producers introduced Willow's ex-boyfriend Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor) and they resume their relationship. A gambling addiction story was written for Willow and she ends up stealing, loaning money, scamming people and squatting. Roberts found the gambling story challenging and carried out extensive research to accurately portray the issue. The character has been well received by critics of the genre who analysed her strong personality and dramatic introduction into the series.\n\nPrior to securing the role of Willow, actress Sarah Roberts auditioned for both Kat Chapman and Scarlett Snow. Roberts recorded her first audition for the part while residing in Los Angeles. She flew up from Melbourne to Sydney for the on-set audition and had a chemistry reading with James Stewart, who plays Justin Morgan. Roberts did not think she had won the part, as it took a while for the producers to contact her. The character was originally supposed to be named Amber but this was later changed to Willow. Roberts remembered her first day playing Willow as \"awesome\", recalling dressing in leather, chains and transforming into character. Willow made her first on screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 November 2017.\n\nWillow is characterised as \"a tough, dynamic and powerful\" female and is surrounded by mostly male characters. Roberts made sure she was strong on set to \"do justice to her character\" in the male dominated scenes. She was raised by her father, a single parent, which made Willow learn how to look after herself early in life. Roberts has described Willow as a \"strong female character\", who is also independent, loyal and fierce. The actress said Willow would bring \"mischief and a bit of trouble\" to Summer Bay. Willow's introduction into \"Home and Away\" showcased her characteristion. Roberts said that Willow proves herself to be \"a tough cookie – she's a total firecracker\", as she rides into Summer Bay on a motorbike. She immediately makes herself known to Justin and accuses him of stealing $15,000. Roberts said that Willow validates her tough persona in the scenes where she attacks Justin, ties him up and locks him in his garage overnight. Roberts told Tamara Cullen from \"TV Week\" that Willow \"rode into town with a lot of power, she's definitely going to cause some mischief!\"\n\nRoberts told a journalist from \"New Idea\" that Willow was \"definitely a bad girl. But for all the right reasons. She has taken wrong turns and made decisions that some people would consider 'bad', but only to help the people that she loves.\" In another interview the actress described Willow as \"very sassy and fun. She's got attitude. I think she's a woman who knows what she wants and won't stop until she gets it, but is also fiercely loyal and will do anything for the people she loves.\" Roberts liked her character's \"really strong\" and \"feisty\" side and believed the character would stop at nothing to get what she wants. Willow had a difficult life and upbringing, as a result she \"put a guard up\" not allowing others to emotionally connect with her. Willow has a \"tougher\" wardrobe than that of a traditional feminine one. This helped Roberts to get into character, with her explaining that \"I put on her costume and totally feel like her.\"\n\nWillow was introduced into the show as a new love interest for Justin Morgan. Her first story follows her getting into trouble with Boyd Easton (Steve Le Marquand) because she owes him money. He attacks Willow's father and pushes him down stairs. He then vandalises Justin's garage to serve as a warning to help Willow return the missing money. Justin tries to reason with Boyd and his biker gang but the meeting turns violent, leaving Justin bruised. He reports the incident to the police which gets Boyd arrested. Ash (George Mason) tries warn Justin to stay away from Willow, he fear for her safety and convinces Willow to move into the local caravan park. Claire Crick from \"Soaplife\" reported that Justin quickly assumes the role of Willow's \"knight in shining armour\". She added that despite Willow causing trouble for Justin, he cannot stop thinking about her. Stewart told Sarah Ellis from \"Inside Soap\" that \"Justin is becoming quite protective of Willow\" and his character \"is thrilled\" when he gets to spend time with her. Roberts and Stewart soon began a relationship off screen. Roberts believed their own romance made playing an on screen couple easy. She told Fiona Byrne from the \"Herald Sun\" that \"i did not even have to create any chemistry when I was on screen with Jimmy, it was all just there, it was not a job.\"\n\nOn screen their relationship burgeons when Justin helps Willow secure employment in Summer Bay. Willow competes against Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger) for a job at the gym. The gym's manager John Palmer (Shane Withington) asks Justin to make the decision about hiring staff. They equally impress him and both receive a job. Willow thanks Justin for his help and they soon end up having sex in her caravan. Their romance has a tumultuous start after Justin asks if their sexual encounter means they are in a relationship. Willow states that she wants a casual arrangement and throws him out. In later episodes the pair resume their romance. Justin's sister Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) soon disapproves of Willow and tells her that Justin is unhappy with a casual relationship. The pair clash and Willow is put off by Justin's over protective family. Producers soon introduced Willow's ex-boyfriend and old friend, Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor) into the show. Dean is a member of the show's fictional criminal gang The River Boys, which Willow also has connections with. Initially Justin does not realise that Willow used to be romantically involved with Dean.\n\nWriters continued to create trouble between the couple. She was unaware Justin has a daughter, Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas). When she comes to stay it shocks Willow, but she and Ava get on well. Justin does not let Willow stay over to avoid upsetting Ava. A \"Home and Away\" publicist told \"Soaplife's\" Crick that Justin is later forced to trust Willow and leave Ava in her care. But when Willow allows Ava to cook dinner, Justin is outraged at the sight of his daughter handling knifes and boiling water. He argues with Willow and their relationship is left \"fledging\". The story takes a sinister turn when Ava is kidnapped by Hazel Easton (Genevieve Lemon), who is Boyd's mother. They demand ransom money for Ava's safe return. The publicist told Crick that Willow blames herself because she caused their involvement in Boyd's vendetta. Willow cooperates with Boyd, hands over the cash and Ava is returned home safe. But a local police officer, Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin) shoots and kills Boyd. Ava's mother Nina Gilbert (Zoe Naylor) warns Willow that Justin cannot have access to Ava if he remains involved with her. Willow breaks-up with Justin and gets back with her ex-boyfriend Dean. Justin is confused and starts a fight with Dean. Roberts told a reporter from \"Inside Soap\" that her character is \"devastated\" about her break-up with Justin, but does not want him to lose Ava. She gets with Dean to ensure that Justin moves on. Dean pursues a relationship with Willow and Roberts believed Dean talked her character into it. She assessed \"I think Willow is better suited to Justin though. She came to Summer Bay to straighten her life out, and Justin was a perfect match for that reason.\"\n\nWriters planned a gambling addiction storyline for the character. Roberts found it challenging to portray because she had not experienced gambling addiction before. She carried out extensive research into the issue and spoke to gambling addicts to gain an insight into their lives. Roberts said that she used the new found knowledge to deliver a better story on screen. Willow's gambling problems began following her break-up with Justin. When Willow starts a relationship with Dean he loses his job at the garage. Willow struggles to pay both her and Dean's rent at the caravan park. Willow steals money from the till at the gym and her friend Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost) catches her. Jasmine takes pity on Willow and gives her a loan. But when Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) asks for more rent, Willow becomes desperate and gambles away her remaining funds. She then sells gym equipment to pay Jasmine back, which also leads to a confrontation with Jasmine. Roberts told a reporter from \"TV Week\" that Willow's gambling addiction is out of control. She explained that her character \"feels guilty and shameful, and is acting out in weird ways.\" Willow down plays her addiction but Dean refuses to accept her lies. Roberts said that \"Dean knows her so well and can usually help her when things go wrong, but this time, it seems she's in too deep.\"\n\nJasmine later learns that Willow has been gambling and tells her that she needs help to treat her addiction. Willow does not take kindly to Jasmine's interfering and slaps her across the face. Roberts said that Willow \"immediately goes on the defensive\" around Jasmine. She added that her character instantly regrets slapping Jasmine because she \"knows she's gone too far.\" The actress was nervous about filming the slap scene. A stunt coordinator taught Roberts and Frost how to make a fake slap without contact look authentic. Writers continued to make Willow down on her luck when she tells John the truth about her thefts from the gym. He is upset with her and fires her from her job. Willow is once again left without any money to pay her rent. Willow and Dean begin squatting in Colby's apartment and he borrows money from a loan shark but cannot pay it back. They decide to skim credit cards and tamper with the card machine inside the local restaurant Salt. When they exit the building, they knock Alf to the ground and leave him unconscious. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes their first victim of card skimming when money disappears from her account. The actress told Ellis (\"Inside Soap\") that Willow does not want to steal from \"decent people\", but feels that she has no choice. She also defended her character over Alf and Irene's misfortune, revealing Willow \"feels terrible\" and \"never meant to hurt anyone.\"\n\nWriters planned a break-up for Willow and Dean following her continuous problems. Dean confides in Justin about Willow's gambling and requests that he look after her. He then breaks-up with her leaving Justin free to help her. A \"Home and Away\" publicist revealed that Dean \"reluctantly\" ends the relationship and \"know's that Justin is the only person she will listen to.\" Justin struggles to help Willow overcome her addiction. She lashes out at Justin and blames him for her addiction, but Tori tells her that she ruined her own life. Roberts did not believe that Willow and Dean's relationship was good for her character. She branded it a \"whirlwind relationship\" that created a \"worrying future\". Despite this she noted that \"Home and Away\" viewers \"love\" the duo's \"history and unyielding friendship\".\n\nWillow's tough persona and dramatic entrance into the series have drawn critical analysis. Ali Cromarty from \"New Idea\" said \"If you saw Willow roll into Summer Bay last week, you'd be right to feel a little scared. The new Home And Away recruit is all leather and motorbikes while rocking a 'don't mess with me' attitude.\" Tamara Cullen from \"TV Week\" branded her the \"sexy, leather-clad Willow\" and a \"tough girl\" who \"made quite the impression on Justin.\" Another writer from \"TV Week\" branded Willow a \"bikie babe\". Imogen Groome from \"The Sun\" described Willow's debut in the show as \"dramatic scenes\" and predicted \"adrenaline-fuelled story lines\" between her and Justin. A writer for TVNZ said \"Justin and Willow’s chemistry on-screen was obvious from the start.\" Kerry Harvey from Stuff.co.nz branded her \"the feisty Willow\" and a reporter from the New Zealand radio station The Hits, similarly branded her the \"feisty biker girl Willow\". Claire Crick from \"Soaplife\" opined that \"Willow creates trouble wherever she goes\" and \"Willow isn't a stranger to danger and drama.\" Regarding Willow and Justin, she later questioned that \"surely this is one couple that's doomed from the start?\" Following her gambling addiction drama Crick said that \"her life's spiraling out of control\" and \"crumbling around her\". \"Inside Soap's\" Ellis said \"watch out fellas... there's a feisty new chick riding into Summer Bay this week and she plans on taking no prisoners.\" The editor of \"TV Soap\" magazine, Vesna Petropoulos branded Willow and Justin the \"Summer Bay sweethearts\". In the 2018 \"Digital Spy\" Reader Awards, Willow and Justin were nominated for \"Best Soap Couple\".\n\n"}
