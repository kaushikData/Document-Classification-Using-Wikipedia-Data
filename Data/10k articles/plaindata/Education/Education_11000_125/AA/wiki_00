It provides career, college preparation, and technical education to students from grades 7-12 and is a member of the Coalition of Essential Schools.\n\nThe six specialties of the school are music, visual arts, theatre arts, creative writing, math and science, and dance. The largest of these is math and science with an enrollment of around 100 students, with the other departments being smaller portions of the student body.\n\nThe school began in 1968 with a group of Birmingham arts community leaders, James Hatcher and Peggy Beddow Cook, who acquired funding from Governor Lurleen Wallace to support instructional programs based in community arts agencies after school. The Alabama Legislature formally created the school with a resolution in 1971. The school was located at Samford University, with the dance program being located at UAB, but moved to Birmingham–Southern College in 1974. While there it was consolidated into five arts programs and a core academic program, staffed in part by the Birmingham City Schools.\n\nThe school moved to its own temporary downtown Birmingham campus in 1976. At this time the private, non-profit Alabama School of Fine Arts Foundation was established to raise funding to build an all-new campus complex.\n\nA new law was approved by the Legislature in 1992 to provide for authorization for the school. The school moved into its new $10 million facility in the heart of Birmingham’s cultural district the following year. A theater was added to the campus in 1995, followed by a mathematics and science wing in 1996. A creative writing wing was added in 1999. The ASFA Foundation began a new capital campaign in 2006 to raise money for the construction of a new theatre complex. The fundraising took many years, with construction lasting 17 months and costing $8.5 million. The new 500-seat theater, named in honor of Dorothy Jemison Day, was opened on March 30, 2012 with an ASFA theatre department production of Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town\".\n\nThe ASFA theatre department was named as one of the nation's outstanding high school theatre programs by \"Stage Directions\" magazine in 2011.\n\nAdmission into the school is competitive. Prospective students must submit an application with test scores, transcripts, essays, and three letters of recommendation. Selected students then audition for their chosen department. For the arts departments, audition is through performance, portfolios, and interview. For the math and science department, audition is through interview and two rounds of testing.\n\nWith the school funded by the Alabama Legislature, in-state students pay no tuition. Students from outside the state are charged tuition.\n\n\n"}

Collins is an American cognitive scientist, Professor Emeritus of Learning Sciences at Northwestern University's School of Education and Social Policy. His research is recognized as having broad impact on the fields of cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and education.\n\nCollins is most well known in psychology for his foundational research on human semantic memory and cognition. Collins and colleagues, most notably M.R. Quillian and Elizabeth Loftus, developed the position that semantic knowledge is represented in stored category representations, linked together in a taxonomically organized processing hierarchy (see semantic networks). Support for their models came from a classic series of reaction-time experiments on human question answering.\n\nIn artificial intelligence, Collins is recognized for work on intelligent tutoring systems and plausible reasoning. With collaborator Jaime Carbonell, Collins produced the first documented example of an intelligent tutor system called SCHOLAR CAI (computer-assisted instruction). Knowledge in SCHOLAR was structured analogously to the then theorized organization of human semantic memory as to afford a variety of meaningful interactions with the system. Collins' extensive research program pioneered discourse analysis methods to study the strategies human tutors use to adapt their teaching to learners. In addition, Collins studied and developed a formal theory characterizing the variety of plausible inferences people use to ask questions about which their knowledge is incomplete. Importantly, Collins developed methods to embed lessons learned from such research into the SCHOLAR system, improving system usability and effectiveness. Subsequently, Collins developed WHY, an intelligent tutoring system that used the Socratic method for tutoring causal knowledge and reasoning. In conjunction with this project he developed a formal computational theory of Socratic tutoring, derived from analyses of inquiry teaching dialogues.\n\nAs a cognitive scientist and foundational member of the field of the learning sciences, Collins has influenced several strands of educational research and development. Building upon his work on intelligent tutoring systems, he has conducted numerous projects investigating the use of technology in schools and developing educational technologies for assessing and improving student learning. Collins has gradually shifted towards the situated cognition view of knowledge being embedded in the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. In response to conventional practices that often ignore the influence of culture and activity, Collins and colleagues have developed and studied cognitive apprenticeship as an effective alternative educational practice. In addition, Collins was among the first to advocate for and outline design-based research methodologies in education.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897503", "title": "Bruno Taut", "text": "Bruno Taut\n\nBruno Julius Florian Taut (4 May 1880 – 24 December 1938) was a prolific German architect, urban planner and author active during the Weimar period. He is known for his theoretical works as well as his designs and buildings.\n\nTaut was born in Königsberg in 1880. After secondary school, he studied at the Baugewerkschule. In the following years, Taut worked in the offices of various architects in Hamburg and Wiesbaden. In 1903 he was employed by Bruno Möhring in Berlin, where he acquainted himself with \"Jugendstil\" and new building methods combining steel with masonry. From 1904 to 1908, Taut worked in Stuttgart for Theodor Fischer and studied urban planning. He received his first commission through Fischer in 1906, which involved renovation of the village church in Unterriexingen.\n\nIn 1908, he returned to Berlin to study art history and construction at the \"Royal Technical Higher School of Charlottenburg\" (\"Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg\"), now Technical University of Berlin. A year later, he established the architecture firm Taut & Hoffmann with Franz Hoffmann.\n\nTaut's first large projects came in 1913. He became a committed follower of the Garden City movement, evidenced by his design for the Falkenberg Estate.\n\nTaut adopted the futuristic ideals and techniques of the avante-garde as seen in the prismatic dome of the Glass Pavilion, which he built for the association of the German glass industry for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne. His aim was to make a whole building out of glass instead of merely using glass as a surface or decorative material. He created glass-treaded metal staircases, a waterfall with underlighting, and colored walls of mosaic glass. His sketches for the publication \"Alpine Architecture\" (1917) are the work of an unabashed utopian visionary, and he is classified as a Modernist and, in particular, as an Expressionist. Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English.\n\nIn 1910 after training in Berlin, working for Theodor Fischer's firm in Stuttgart, and establishing his own firm in Berlin, the experienced architect Hermann Muthesius suggested that Taut visit England to learn the garden city philosophy. Muthesius also introduced him to some of the \"Deutscher Werkbund\" group of architects, including Walter Gropius. Taut had socialist sympathies, and before World War I this hindered his advancement.\n\nTaut's practical activity changed with World War I. He became a pacifist and so avoided military service. He began to write and sketch, less to escape from the brutalities of war than to present a positive utopia in opposition to this reality. Taut designed an immense circular garden city with a radius of about 7 km (4.3 mi) for three million inhabitants. The \"City Crown\" was to be in the very center. \"Mighty and inaccessible\", it would have been the culmination of a community and cultural center, a skyscraper-like, purpose-free \"crystal building\". \"The building contains nothing but one beautiful room which can be reached by either of two staircases to the right and to the left of the theatre and the little community center. How can I even begin to describe what it is only possible to construct!\", said Taut of the City Crown.\n\nTaut completed two housing projects in Magdeburg from 1912 through 1915, which were influenced directly by the humane functionalism and urban design solutions of the garden city philosophy. The reform estate, created for a housing trust, was built in 1912–15 in the southwest of Magdeburg. The estate consists of one-storey terrace houses and was the first project in which Taut used colour as a design principle. The construction of the estate was continued by Carl Krayl. Taut served as city architect in Magdeburg from 1921 to 1923. During his time a few residential developments were built, one of which was the Hermann Beims estate (1925–28) with 2,100 apartments. Taut designed the exhibition hall \"City and Countryside\" in 1921 with concrete trusses and a central skylight.\n\nA lifelong painter, Taut was distinguished from his European modernist contemporaries by his devotion to color. As in Magdeburg, he applied lively, clashing colors to his first major commission, the 1912 \"Gartenstadt Falkenberg\" housing estate in Berlin, which became known as the \"Paint Box Estates\". The 1914 Glass Pavilion, an illustration of the new possibilities of glass, was also brightly colored. The difference between Taut and his Modernist contemporaries was never more obvious than at the 1927 \"Weissenhofsiedlung\" housing exhibition in Stuttgart. In contrast to the pure-white entries from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, Taut's house (Number 19) was painted in primary colors. Le Corbusier is reported to have exclaimed, \"My God, Taut is colour-blind!\"\n\nIn 1924 Taut was made chief architect of GEHAG, a Berlin public housing cooperative, and was the main designer of several successful large residential developments (\"Gross-Siedlungen\") in Berlin, notably the 1925 \"Hufeisensiedlung\" (\"Horseshoe Estate\"), named for its configuration around a pond, and the 1926 Onkel Toms Hütte Development (\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\") in Zehlendorf, named for a local restaurant and set in a thick grove of trees. Both of these constructions became prominent examples of the use of colorful details in architecture.\n\nTaut worked for the city architect of Berlin, Martin Wagner, on some of Berlin's Modernist Housing Estates, now recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The designs featured controversial modern flat roofs; access to sunlight, air and gardens; and generous amenities like gas, electric light, and bathrooms. Political conservatives complained that these developments were too opulent for 'simple people'. The progressive Berlin mayor, Gustav Böss, defended them: \"We want to bring the lower levels of society higher.\"\n\nBetween 1924 and 1931, Taut's team completed more than 12,000 dwellings. In tribute to Taut, GEHAG incorporated an abstracted graphic of the Horseshoe Estate in its logo. This state housing association was sold by the Senate of Berlin in 1998; its legal successor is Deutsche Wohnen.\n\nBeing Jewish and a noted advocate of socialist political policies, Taut was compelled to look for opportunities to emigrate from Germany when the Nazis gained power. He was promised work in the USSR in 1932 and 1933, but was obliged to return to Germany in February 1933 to a hostile political environment.\n\nLater in the same year, Taut fled to Switzerland. Then with an invitation from Japanese architect Isaburo Ueno, he traveled to Japan via France, Greece, Turkey and Vladivostok, arriving in Tsuruga, Japan on May 3, 1933. Taut made his home in Takasaki, Gunma, where he produced three influential book-length appreciations of Japanese culture and architecture, comparing the historical simplicity of Japanese architecture with modernist discipline. For a period Taut worked as an industrial design teacher and his models of lamps and furniture sold at the Miratiss shop in Tokyo.\n\nTaut was noted for his appreciation of the stark, minimalist vein of Japanese architecture found at the Ise Shrine and at the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. He was the first to write extensively about the architectural features of Katsura Imperial Villa from a modernist perspective. Contrasting it with the elaborately decorated shrines of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu at Nikkō, Tochigi, he famously said that \"Japan's architectural arts could not rise higher than Katsura, nor sink lower than Nikko\". Taut's writing on the Japanese minimalist aesthetic found an appreciative audience in Japan and subsequently influenced the work of Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius.\n\nThe only still extant Taut-designed architectural work in Japan is the extension to the Hyuga Villa at Atami in Shizuoka. Built in 1936 on a site below the original villa owned by businessman Rihei Hyuga, and part modern and part traditional Japanese in style, the three rooms provided additional space for social events and views over nearby Sagami Bay.\n\nOffered a position as Professor of Architecture at the \"State Academy of Fine Arts\" in Istanbul (currently, Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts), Taut relocated to Turkey in 1936. In Ankara he joined other German wartime exiles, including Martin Wagner and Taut's associate Franz Hillinger, who arrived in 1938. Some of Taut's work was received unfavorably, however, and labelled as \"cubic\". In a letter to a Japanese friend he wrote, \"They gave me a great opportunity in that they gave me freedom for my craft. I will make a building which is not 'cubic'; they are calling all modernism cubic. For this building, I am thinking of using some Turkish motifs.\" He proceeded to design his own house in İstanbul's Ortaköy neighborhood, bridging the architectural traditions of his exile existence. His studio resembled that of the Einstein Tower in Potsdam, while the front view recalled a Japanese pagoda.\n\nAfter leaving Germany, Taut gradually moved away from modernism. A colleague remarked that, \"Like everyone who gets old, Taut is stuck with Renaissance principles and cannot find a way towards the new! I am very disappointed... It is a shame for such an avant-gardist.\"\n\nBefore his death in 1938, Taut wrote at least one more book and designed a number of educational buildings in Ankara and Trabzon under commissions from the Turkish Ministry of Education. The most significant of these buildings were the \"Faculty of Languages, History and Geography\" at Ankara University, \"Ankara Atatürk High School\" and \"Trabzon High School\". His last building project, the \"Cebeci School\", was left unfinished. Taut's final work, one month before his death, was the catafalque which was used for the official state funeral of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on 21 November 1938 in Ankara. It was a simple design, consisting of large wooden columns and a flag that covered the coffin.\n\nTaut died on 24 December 1938 and was laid to rest at the Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery in Istanbul as its first and only non-Muslim.\n\n\n"}

Display board may also be referred to as \"poster board\". Along with quad charts, display boards were an early form of fast communication developed by the National Weather Service of the United States Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nTraditional tri-fold display boards are single sheet corrugated boards divided into three panels by score marks. Typically, the two outside panels are half the width of the center panel. Generally placed on a table, they are more stable and able to stand while still giving a theater-like view. Header boards can be added to the top display board and an easel stand can be attached to the back. \n\nIn North America, display boards are often used by students in the public school system for science, social studies, and English projects. Outside the classroom, students use display boards to promote clubs, recognize athletics and display art projects. The purpose of the display board in that context is to catch the viewer's attention and explain what was performed and what was learned. \n\nOutside school, display boards are used for business trade shows, marketing, genealogy, life celebrations, arts and crafts, and memorials. \n\nScience fair display boards are required to follow published guidelines. Board contents include Project Title, Abstract, Question, Hypothesis, Background, Research, Materials, Procedure, Results, Conclusion and Future Directions. Such display boards usually contain images and figures in addition to text.\n\nAn interactive display board may be made by attaching an electronic multimedia device such as a tablet to a display board. Methods for attaching tablets to display boards include cutting a window into a display board and fixing a pocket behind the window to insert and hold the tablet, psching pins into the face of a display board with the tablet resting on the pins, attaching a lanyard to the tablet in order to hang it on the display board, or using dual sided adhesive tape to attach the tablet to the display board. Projex Boards manufactures a display board for tablets, with a pocket, easel and header board. The purpose of tablet display boards is to hold the tablet at eye level on the display board to facilitate better communication between audience and presenter. Some tablet interactive display boards have apertures for electrical cords in the form of openings at the bottom of the display board.\n"}

Official mandation of education began with the Elementary Education Act 1870 for England and Wales, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 for Scotland. Education policy has always been run separately for the component nations of the United Kingdom, and is now a devolved matter (by the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the Scotland Act 1998, and the Government of Wales Act 1998 - each as amended).\n\nAs there is no devolved government for England, the administration of education policy for the nation has been carried out by a number of different British central government departments since the 19th century. Key events in Education in England have been the Elementary Education Act 1870, the Education Act 1902, the Education Act 1944, and the Education Reform Act 1988.\n\nBefore the latter-part of the 19th century education was a private matter, and there was no governmental policy lead. Some education services were provided by the Church (dating back to a Papal proclamation in the 11th century).\n\nA Committee of the Privy Council was appointed in 1839 to supervise the distribution of certain Government grants in the education field. The members of the Committee were the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaries of State, the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. From 1857 a Vice President was appointed who took responsibility for policy, leading to the creation of the Education Office.\n\nWith the 1870 Act the Education Office was given the task to manage the national process and commission local school boards in boroughs and parishes where they were requested.\n\nThe Board of Education Act 1899 took effect in 1900, renaming the Education Office to the Board of Education was created which managed the national process and commissioned local school boards in boroughs and parishes where they were found to be needed.\n\nThe 1902 Act formalised the relationship between central government and education delivery by abolishing the 2568 school boards set up by the 1870 Act, and transferring their duties (and schools) to local government (borough and county councils) in a new guise as local education authorities.\n\nThe 1944 Act changed the system of education in England by forming the Tripartite System wherein secondary schools were mandated in one of four forms (Grammar, Comprehensive, Secondary Modern, and Secondary Technical schools), and renamed the Board of Education to the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe Department of Education and Science (DES) was created in 1964 as the merger of the Ministry of Education with that of the Ministry of Science following the Prime Minister Harold Wilson's focus on the \"white heat of technology\".\n\nThe 1988 Act brought in the concept of external validation of teacher performance and a support framework for teachers to use as the core of their syllabus, in the form of the National Curriculum.\n\nIn 1995 the DES was merged with the Benefits Agency and split off the Office of Science and Technology to become the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE).\n\nAfter the 2001 General Election, the DfEE and the Department for Social Security were combined and re-split into the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nIn 2007, when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, he split the education ministerial portfolio into two. The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) was formed with board responsibilities for children up to the age of 14, and for some aspects up to 19, taking on some social care responsibilities from the Department for Health. The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) took over responsibility for all higher and further education and science policy, taking on the Government Office for Science, which by then included the Office of Science and Technology that had split off from DES in 1994.\n\nIn 2009, DIUS was merged with parts of the Department of Trade and Industry to form the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), but with no change in the scope of its education policy remit.\n\nEducation policy in Northern Ireland is run by the Northern Ireland Department of Education.\n\nEducation policy in Scotland has always been run on its own lines. Since devolution it has transferred from the defunct Scottish Office to the Scottish Executive.\n\nEducation policy in Wales was run as with that of England until devolution in 1998. Since then it has been run under the Welsh Assembly Government.\n\n"}

She was a professor of health education at the Ohio State University in 1961, when she was selected to direct the School Health Education Study (1961–1969). Most health education curricula developed since have been based on the 10 conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study: community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse. The Study’s model curriculum became known as the School Health Curriculum Project (later renamed Growing Healthy)\n\nThe Study’s findings were also the major reason for President Nixon’s creation of the President's Committee on Health Education in 1971. When the National Center for Health Education (NCHE) was created in 1975 as a result of one of the recommendation of the Committee, Dr. Sliepcevich was one of the Center’s founders. She was one of the principal framers of the NCHE’s first major activity, the Health Education Role Delineation Project (1978–1981).\n\nFollowing the School Health Education Study, she joined the faculty of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC), where she was Professor in both the Department of Health Education and the School of Medicine, and team taught courses with David Duncan, Robert Gold, and Elaine Vitello.

FaceTime is available on supported iOS mobile devices and Macintosh computers that run and later. FaceTime supports any iOS device with a forward-facing camera and any Macintosh computer equipped with a FaceTime Camera. FaceTime Audio, an audio-only version, is available on any iOS device that supports iOS 7 or newer, and any Macintosh with a forward-facing camera running and later. FaceTime is included for free in iOS and in macOS from (10.7) onwards.\n\nApple bought the \"FaceTime\" name from FaceTime Communications, who changed their name to Actiance, Inc. Soon after, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced FaceTime on June 7, 2010, in conjunction with the iPhone 4 in a keynote speech at the 2010 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nApple bought the \"FaceTime\" name from FaceTime Communications, who changed their name to Actiance, Inc.\n\nApple CEO Steve Jobs announced FaceTime on June 7, 2010, in conjunction with the iPhone 4 in a keynote speech at the 2010 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nSupport for the fourth generation iPod Touch (the first model of iPod Touch equipped with cameras) was announced in conjunction with the device's release on September 8, 2010.\n\nFaceTime for was announced on October 20, 2010, at the \"Back to the Mac\" Media event on the Apple Campus.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, FaceTime support was announced for the newly introduced iPad 2, which gained forward- and rear-facing cameras.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, FaceTime left beta and was listed in the Mac App Store for US$0.99. Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge, however, a provision of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (2002) bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already-sold product without enduring \"onerous accounting measures\". , the US$0.99 beta is still available for download from Apple. FaceTime is included for free in macOS from (10.7) onwards and iOS.\n\nAT&T allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were tiered, but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans. They were brought before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for net neutrality violations.\n\nOn May 2011, it was found that FaceTime would work seamlessly over 3G on all iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch models that supported it. Even though FaceTime worked only over 3G at that time, it now supports 4G LTE calls on networks all over the world, availability being limited to operators' GSM plans.\n\nIn June 2018, Apple announced in the WWDC that FaceTime will support group video and audio calls with up to 32 people in iOS 12 and macOS Mojave.\n\nFaceTime works by establishing a connection between two supported devices. Most Apple devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs) introduced after 2011 support FaceTime. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 introduced high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.\n\nUnlike Mac OS X's iChat, FaceTime currently does not support group conferencing but support has been announced for iOS 12. The application is a one-on-one video chat—only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.\n\nIncoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call, but if they are opened, the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app. \n\nOn the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.\n\nUntil the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks (3G or LTE) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three megabytes of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more. Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.\n\nFaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service. A single email address can be registered to multiple devices and a call placed to that address rings all devices simultaneously.\n\nThe FaceTime protocol is based on numerous open industry standards although it is not interoperable with other videotelephony systems:\n\nUpon the launch of the iPhone 4, Jobs stated that Apple would immediately start working with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an \"open industry standard\". While the protocols are open standards, Apple's FaceTime service requires a client-side certificate.\n\nFaceTime calls are protected by end-to-end encryption so that only the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt this data.\n\nCompared to most SIP implementations, Facetime adds techniques that enhance performance at the cost of breaking interoperability: port multiplexing, SDP minimization and SDP compression.\n\nA new audio-only version of FaceTime, named FaceTime Audio, was announced during the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote speech on June 10, 2013, and released with iOS 7 on September 18, 2013. As an audio-only version of FaceTime, it effectively makes the protocol into a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), that competes with other mainstream providers in the field, including Skype (Microsoft).\n\nBased on the same AAC-LD audio protocol, the service provides high-quality audio. The iOS 7 betas limited FaceTime Audio to calls placed on a Wi-Fi network (the same original limitation of the video version of FaceTime), but the final release has removed that restriction to allow it to work over 3G and LTE data connections, as is the case with most carriers and plans with regard to FaceTime with video. Like the video version, FaceTime Audio is currently only available between Apple devices. The feature is not available to run on the iPod Touch 4th generation as the device does not support iOS 7 or later. FaceTime streaming over cellular data is unavailable for the iPhone 4 and the iPad 2.\n\n, FaceTime is not enabled on devices bought in the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, possibly due to regulations in these countries that restrict IP-based communications. In addition, on devices bought in China only FaceTime Audio is disabled, while FaceTime Video is available. Devices bought outside these countries support both video and audio versions of FaceTime. Although Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Kuwait originally disabled FaceTime on the iPhone 4, they later re-enabled the feature through a carrier update for existing phone owners, and made it pre-enabled on any newly purchased iPhone. In March 2018, FaceTime is available for iPhones in Saudi Arabia upon updating to iOS 11.3.\n\nAs of April 16, 2014, FaceTime ceased working on earlier versions of iOS which had previously supported it (iOS 4, 5 & 6). This was because the client-side certificate used to authenticate a genuine Apple device with FaceTime servers (amongst other uses) expired on that date. Apple chose not to release an update to this certificate for all devices for which a newer major iOS version (with a new, valid certificate) was available. Apple did release a minor update, to the certificate only, for all OS X versions which could run FaceTime, and also for earlier versions of iOS, but only for the small number of devices which could run FaceTime but which could not run a newer major version of iOS (4th generation iPod touch). The result of this policy was that almost all iOS users had to update the iOS version on their devices if they wished to continue using FaceTime. (This limitation applied even to users of jailbroken devices since, even with a legally jailbroken device, it would have been not only difficult but also illegal to extract and install Apple's new certificate, without Apple's permission, in order to work around this issue. )\n\nRoughly over 60,000 people search for FaceTime for Android on Google. Due to closed proprietorship of FaceTime, it is currently unavailable on other platforms including Android and Windows.\n"}

It was built between 1899 and 1902 as part of Lord Kitchener's wide-ranging educational reforms.\nNamed for General 'Chinese' Charles George Gordon of the British army, who was killed during the Mahdi uprising in 1885, it was officially opened on 8 November 1902 by Kitchener himself.\n\nThe first students which entered the school in 1903 were primary school students. In 1905 secondary education courses for assistant engineers and land surveyors were added and in 1906 a four-year course for training primary school teachers was started. By 1913 there were about 500 students in the college. In 1924 the college commenced Sharia, Engineering, Teachers' Training, Clerical Work, Accounting and Science vocational courses. Post-secondary education courses in Science, Arts, Engineering, Veterinary Science and Law were started in 1938. There were strong links between courses and Sudan government departments where it was anticipated students would work after graduation. At the beginning of 1945, all these schools were grouped together in a special arrangement with the University of London and secondary education was moved elsewhere. In 1948 there were 262 students at the college.\n\nIn 1951, the Gordon Memorial College was merged with the Kitchener School of Medicine (founded in 1924) and renamed University College Khartoum with the University of London setting the examinations and awarding the degrees. In 1956, the University College became the fully independent University of Khartoum. The University of Khartoum claims to be the oldest University in Sudan based on the founding of the Gordon Memorial College in 1902.\n\nThe college provided high class education to its students who were drawn from all backgrounds of Sudanese youth, enabling them to gain the sort of education previously only available in the great European universities.\n\nMany of the Sudan's Prime Ministers and generals, including Mohamed Ahmed Mahjoob, Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa, Babiker Awadalla and Ibrahim Abood Ahmed, studied there. Ismail al-Azhari, the first prime minister of Sudan, studied at the Gordon Memorial college but graduated from the American University of Beirut.

The registered educational charity, which was established on 25 July 1904 as the \"Imperial Society of Dance Teachers\", provides training and examinations in a range of dance styles and certified dance teacher courses. The ISTD is recognised by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Council for Dance Education and Training and is also a member of the British Dance Council. It hosts various competitions in many different formats including Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Classical Ballet and Tap Dance as well as contemporary styles like Disco Freestyle.\n\nThe ISTD is organised into two main faculty boards. Dancesport coordinates dance techniques that are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall. Theatre is concerned with stage and film performance. The Cecchetti Society is also part of the ISTD. It exists to preserve the Cecchetti method of classical ballet training. The ISTD is also represented on the committees of numerous other arts, dance and culture related organisations. \n\nThe Imperial Society of Dance Teachers was formed on 25 July 1904 at the Hotel Cecil in Covent Garden, London. Robert Morris Crompton was its first President. The first ISTD congress was held in 1906 and a congress has subsequently been held every year, with the exception of a brief period during the war years. Its in-house publication \"Dance Journal\" (now titled \"DANCE\") was first published in September 1907.\n\nIn 1924 the separate branches, which later became faculties, were formed, and in 1925 the society became the \"Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance\". In 1945, the ISTD became incorporated with Victor Silvester in the new role of Chairman.\n\nIn 1953 the Grand Council of the ISTD was formed. Notable persons from many areas of British society joined the council. It serves to improve communication with key people in British arts and society.\n\nThe ISTD is most noted for the use of medal tests, and the ISTD format has been used as a model for similar award systems by many other dance organisations. The idea of medal tests first came from another dance teaching organisation, but it was the ISTD, which first developed the widespread use of the medal test system throughout the UK and internationally.\n\nThe ISTD is a government recognised dance teaching organisation and examination board, which trains and certifies teachers to deliver its syllabus to students in both private and mainstream dance education. The ISTD offers syllabi in a range of dance styles, which are typically delivered in the form of medal tests or graded examinations. An accredited awarding body, the ISTD offers qualifications that can be submitted for credit on the National Qualifications Framework. The organisation structure of the ISTD is divided into three levels, the Administrative Council, Faculty Boards and Faculty Committees.\n\nThe Administrative Council is responsible for the overall governance of the ISTD and consists of executives and elected members, headed by ISTD Chair, Sue Passmore. The Council is the principal policy making body of the organisation and rules on recommendations made by the faculty boards and committees, which are represented on the Council. Key administrative duties are performed by executive members, the Finance, Audit & General Purposes Committee and the Nomination & Remuneration Committee. The Administrative Council also includes the Grand Council, a group of eminent dance professionals headed Life President, Dame Beryl Grey.\n\nThe work of the ISTD is divided into two main branches; the Dancesport Faculties Board, commonly known as the Ballroom Branch, and the Theatre Faculties Board, commonly known as the Theatre Branch. These two faculty boards coordinate the work of the faculty committees, which are grouped to reflect the similarities between them. For example, the Dancesport board consists of dance techniques which are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall setting, both socially and competitively, whereas the Theatre board, as the name suggests, consists of dance techniques which usually have a connection to stage or film.\nThe ISTD consists of eleven faculty committees, which are divided between the two Faculty Boards. Each faculty committee is responsible for the technical and artistic development of a specific dance technique within the ISTD. The work of a faculty committee includes the continued development of the syllabi for the relevant dance technique, the regulation and control of examinations and the organisation of lectures, teacher training courses, seminars and other events.\n\nThe ISTD is primarily a dance examination board, with teacher members delivering its syllabi to students in both private and mainstream education. The majority of people who study the ISTD syllabus are people pursuing dance as a leisure activity and the organisation provides a structured examinations system that caters for pupils from beginner to professional level. At the higher levels, ISTD teachers can provide training for people wishing to pursue dance as a profession, either as a performer or dance teacher. Typically, most subjects have a series of graded examinations. These progress from Primary and up through numbers Grades (Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.), with Vocational graded examinations at Intermediate, Advanced 1 and Advanced 2 levels. Some subjects have differing examination systems, some offering medal tests and other awards.\n\nThe grade system is especially adapted to different ages of pupils, and as a basis for dance as an activity in schools or other similar institutions. Grade Examinations may be taken in Classical Ballet (Cecchetti and Imperial methods), Modern Theatre, Tap, National Dance, Classical Greek, South Asian (Kathak and Bharatanatyam), Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Disco Freestyle and Classical Sequence. Grades 1-6 are accredited by Ofqual, but some Faculties have additional Grades prior to Grade 1, that is, Pre-Primary and Primary.\n\nClass Examinations may be taken in Classical Ballet (Cecchetti and Imperial methods), Classical Greek and Modern Theatre.\n\nMedal tests may be taken in Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Sequence, Disco Freestyle, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Country & Western, Classical Greek, Tap and National. The levels progress from Bronze to Silver, Gold, Gold Star and higher awards for Dancesport medals.\n\nThe Vocational Grades are accredited by Ofqual and include Intermediate Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced 1 and Advanced 2. These examinations form a cohesive bridge between the work covered in the Grades and the work of the professional examinations.\n\nDancers who have achieved a high level examination pass in an ISTD dance subject can progress into teacher training with the organisation. The teacher training is provided through approved dance centres and consists of both theory and practical examinations designed to demonstrate the candidates ability and knowledge to teach dance. People who successfully complete the training become registered teachers of the ISTD and may enter students for examinations in the dance subject for which they have qualified. Some ISTD teacher may progress to further their qualifications further and gain qualifications in other branches of the society. There are various professional examinations, depending on where candidates live.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The program was dedicated to the instilling of wonder in and pursuit of truth with underclassmen. It was led by three faculty: Dr. Dennis Quinn, Dr. John Senior, and Dr. Frank Nelick.\n\nIn the words of Dennis Quinn, the program sought to \"teach the Great Books, the classics, from the Greeks up through the Romans and through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance into the modern times.” In addition to studying the great books, the students also got together for poetry memorization, singing folk songs, formal waltzing lessons, and stargazing, an activity the founders thought to be one of the greatest sources of wonder.\n\nAfter numerous conversions on the part of students to Catholicism and the subsequent publishing of an article on the part of the Kansas City Times newspaper depicting a Darwinian evolution of a hippie gradually becoming Catholic monk, the university administration set up an investigation of the program to determine whether or not the three faculty were proselytizing. Ultimately, the program was disbanded following the investigations, despite the investigation group having issued a statement saying \"In the face of charges of religious indoctrination and proselytizing, the Committee has found no evidence that the professors of the program have engaged in such activities in the classroom.\"\n\nA number of Catholic leaders in America were formed in the program such as Bishop James Conley of the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska (who converted to Catholicism with Dr. Senior as his godfather), Archbishop Paul Coakley of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Dom Philip Anderson, abbot of Our Lady Of The Annunciation of Clear Creek Abbey.\n\nDr. Robert Carlson, one of the three founders of Wyoming Catholic College, its first academic dean, and the author of its philosophical vision statement, also is an alumnus of the program.\n\n"}

Born Thelma Oliver, she pursued a career in films and theater before in 1970 dedicating herself to empowering others through the practice of yoga.\n\nKhalsa was born Thelma Oliver in Los Angeles, California on May 6, 1939. Her father, Cappy Oliver played trumpet with Lionel Hampton's band and her mother tried her hand at roller skating, wrestling, and singing before settling down to raise five children. She studied dance at a school run by Jeni Le Gon before majoring in Drama and Theatre Arts at the University of California in Los Angeles UCLA.\n\nOliver dropped out of school in 1961 and went East to pursue her calling as a performer. Her off-Broadway stage debut was in The Blacks (play) by French dramatist Jean Genet, where she performed the role of Virtue along with Louis Gossett, Jr.. Oliver also performed in the musicals Fly Blackbird and Cindy, and the revue The Living Premise, where in 1963 she replaced Diana Sands for two months.\n\nOliver also took a number of film roles beginning with a part as a \"Negro woman\" in the hit South Pacific (1958 film). Her contribution to the 1961 swashbuckler Pirates of Tortuga is not credited. In Black Like Me (film), released in 1964, Oliver played the role of Georgie. She performed the role of \"Ortiz's girl\" in Sidney Lumet's The Pawnbroker. The cast included Rod Steiger, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Brock Peters, and Morgan Freeman. It was Oliver's pivotal scene with Rod Steiger near the film's end, that drew controversy at the time, when Oliver exposed her breasts. The film was among the first American movies to feature nudity during the Production Code, and was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. Although it was publicly announced to be a special exception, the controversy proved to be first of similar major challenges to the Code that ultimately led to its abandonment.\n\nThelma Oliver's biggest success as a performer came when she landed the role of \"Helene\" in the Broadway musical Sweet Charity with Gwen Verdon. Sweet Charity played at the Palace Theatre (New York City) from January 1966 to July 1967, 608 performances, garnering twelve Tony Award nominations, including an award for its choreography.\n\nWhile a 1966 Ebony Magazine profile mentions Oliver's study of \"yoga philosophy and breathing,\" yoga became her life's calling four years later when she met Yogi Bhajan. Yogi Bhajan renamed her \"Krishna Kaur\" - meaning Divine Princess. Under his direction, she became a yoga teacher with a special dispensation to serve the Black community. Krishna Kaur established a yoga community in the Watts, Los Angeles neighborhood with a live-in center, children's school, day care, twice weekly free kitchen and \"Sat Nam Street Players\" dedicated to bringing music and inspiration to the troubled streets of the ghetto.\n\nKrishna Kaur's radical spirit found full expression in her yoga mission. In her words: \"The revolution is really one of the mind. Blacks have got to realize where the power really is. The struggle is not on a physical level. It is on the level of the mind.\"\n\nKrishna Kaur's journey into Kundalini Yoga and the Sikh tradition of Yogi Bhajan took her to the spiritual capital of Amritsar and the \"Golden Temple\" or Harimandir Sahib in December 1970 and again thereafter. In August 1980 she made history when, through a combination of circumstances she became the first and only woman to have ever sung Sikh hymns within the strictly patriarchal precincts of the Golden Temple.\n\nIn the 1990s, Krishna Kaur played a central role in the founding of the International Black Yoga Teachers Association. She also started up Yoga for Youth, dedicated to serving young people in trouble with the U.S. criminal justice system. Krishna Kaur is currently the Chairman of the Board of Yoga for Youth.\n\nKnown for her musical talent, Krishna Kaur never gave up performing. In the 1970s, she toured and recorded with a group called \"Sat Nam West.\" In 2014, she released an album, One Creator.\n\n"}

She continued her training in Hawaii, where she studied Hawaiian dance, and then New York, where she studied modern dance and ballet.\n\nIn 1928, La Meri began performing professionally. In the 1930s, she invited Indian classical dancer, Ram Gopal, one of the early pioneers of dance of India in the west, who toured with her extensively. Until 1940, she toured and studied in areas such as Central and South America, Europe, North Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, Japan, Ceylan, and Hawaii. As she traveled, La Meri learned the native dances of the different areas she visited, studying with local dance masters. She went on to create her own dance works based on the steps and movement vocabularies she learned. She researched the dance styles of Latin America, Spain, Africa, and Asia extensively. This allowed her to bring authenticity to the stage in a way that rang true to the roots of each dance style. \nIn 1940, La Meri and Ruth St. Denis founded the \"School of Natya\", which is Hindu dance, in New York City. Through the school, La Meri formed \"The Five Natyas\", her first performing company. In 1945 she absorbed the school of Natya into Ethnologic Dance Center and the Ethnologic Dance Theater, which operated from 1942-1956. She also performed at the American Museum of Natural History\nand presented concert programs of young ethnic-dancers from across the globe. In 1944, she choreographed swan lake with the translation into Hindu dance movements. She did not change ballet's music and plot, but added a prologue and a danced fight between the princess and the Rothbart.\n\nLa Meri taught regularly at Jacob’s Pillow, gave lecture-demonstrations, and published a number of magazine articles and books, including \"The Gesture Language of Hindu Dance\" (1941) and \"Spanish Dancing\" (1948). The latter book is considered to be a definitive text on the subject of Spanish dance. Overall, La Meri’s extensive work in ethnic dance earned her the reputation of being one of the foremost experts in the ethnic-dance field. La Meri's work helped to inspire other choreographers to show respect for dances of cultures not their own, as well as educating the audience. Her thorough anthropological work embodied the values of each ethnicity she used in her choreography and highlighted the importance of integrity in the dance world.\n\nIn 1938 La Meri published a book \"Songs and Voyages,\" with 82 pages of poetry, now very rare. [Livorno -Arti Grafiche S. Belfort & C. 5 Dicembre 1938 - XVII, printed in Italy] According to the frontispiece, her poetry had appeared in American Poetry Magazine, Literary Digest, Braithwaite Anthology, L'Alouette, The Harp, The Dance Magazine, Independent Poetry Anthology, Lariat, Circle, Buccaneer, Contemporary Verse, Interludes, Gammadion, Texas Anthology, Bozart, American Anthology, Poetry Journal, Bright Scrawl, Unicorn, Home Magazine, Present Day Poets, Wandering Eros, more.\n\nShe received Capezio Dance Award in 1972.\n\nAu, Susan, and Jim Rutter.

{"id": "48758199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48758199", "title": "Octalysis", "text": "Octalysis\n\nThe Octalysis Framework is a human-centric gamification design framework that lays out the eight core drives for humans motivation developed by Yu-Kai Chou. The framework is based on the premise that systems are “function-focused”, designed to complete a task as quickly as possible, similar to a factory process assuming workers will complete their tasks in a timely manner because they are required to do so. However, human-focused design acknowledges that people, unlike machines in a system have feelings, insecurities, and reasons why they want or do not want to do certain things, and therefore, optimizes for their feelings, motivations, and engagement.\n\nThe framework lays out the structure for analyzing the driving forces behind human motivation. It is the process of applying the core behavior drives that motivate a user to complete a task efficiently through an interactive experience. The Octalysis framework is used in healthcare, fitness, education, training, company, and product design to increase user engagement, ROI and motivation.\nThe Octalysis framework suggests that if there are no core drives present, then there is no motivation and no behavior will happen. This is based on the premise that almost all games appeal to certain core drives within us and motivate us towards a variety of decisions and activities. The framework divides these motivations into eight core drives.\n\nThis Core Drive is in play when a person believes he or she is doing something greater than oneself or was “chosen” to take action. An example would be Wikipedia volunteers who maintain the page and contribute to the development of its content. Contributors do not receive any extrinsic reward, but they feel that their contribution will help to develop and protect human knowledge. The implementation of this drive can vastly differ, and is not limited to altruistic behavior. Some of the world's worst events and actions have happened with the belief of participating in something greater than oneself.\n\nDevelopment and accomplishment is our internal drive for making progress, developing skills, achieving mastery, and eventually overcoming challenges. The perception of the challenge is important. For example, a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful for a person. This is the drive that most PBLs: Points, Badges, and Leaderboards focus on.\n\nThis drive is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new things out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but also need to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn. This is why playing with Legos, playing Minecraft, and making art are intrinsically fun. When properly designed and integrated to empower users to be creative; they often become Evergreen Mechanics: a game designer no longer needs to continuously add content to keep the activity fresh and engaging. The brain simply entertains itself.\n\nThis drive refers to users feeling like they own or control something. When a person feels ownership over something, they innately want to increase and improve what they own. For example, the human desire to accumulate wealth and the overvaluing of objects within one's possession are the result of this drive. People might think their house is worth far more than the market is willing to pay for it, not because of any intrinsic property of the house but because they personally own it.\n\nThis drive incorporates all the social elements that motivate people, including: mentorship, social acceptance, companionship, and even competition and envy. When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to attain the same. Think about how we naturally draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to.\n\nScarcity and impatience is the core drive of wanting something simply because it is extremely rare, exclusive, or immediately unattainable. Many games have Appointment dynamics or torture breaks within them (come back in 2 hours to get your reward). The fact that people can’t get something right now motivates them to return to check the availability of the product.\n\nUnpredictability is the core drive of constantly being engaged because you don't know what is going to happen next. When something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks into high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary core drive behind gambling addictions, but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results.\n\nLoss and avoidance is the core drive that motivates us to avoid something negative from happening. On a small scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work or changing one's behavior. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting. Opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this core drive, because people feel if they didn't act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever. This is commonly known as fear of missing out and can often be seen in marketing promotions with limited time periods, or speculative investments where any delay may lead to missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nEverything we do is based on one or more of the eight core drives. If none of them is present, there is zero motivation and no action takes place. Additionally, each of these drives have different natures within them. Some make the user feel powerful, but do not create urgency. Others core drives create urgency, obsession, and even addiction, but make the user feel bad. Some are more short-term extrinsically focused, while some are more long-term intrinsically focused.\n\nAs a result, the 8 core drives are charted on an octagon not simply for aesthetic purposes, but because the placement determines the nature of the motivation.\n\nThe left side of the Octalysis chart is commonly associated with logic, analytical thought, and ownership. People are motivated by extrinsic elements such as rewards, money, goals, milestones, points, badges, recognition. However, once people obtain the goal or get used to it, they no longer take the desired behavior.\n\nThe right side of the Octalysis chart relies on intrinsic motivation: creativity, self-expression and social dynamics. You don't need a goal or reward to use your creativity, hangout with friends, or to feel the suspense of unpredictability. Balancing extrinsic and intrinsic core drives is an important task; research shows that extrinsic motivation impairs intrinsic motivation. Because once the companies stop offering the extrinsic motivator, user motivation will often plummet to a level much lower than when the extrinsic motivator was first introduced (the Over-justification Effect).\n\nKeep in mind that left brain and right brain references are not literal in terms of actual brain geography, but merely a symbolic differentiation between two distinct functions of the brain.\n\nWhite hat core drives make us feel powerful, fulfilled, and satisfied. On the Octalysis octagon they are represented on the top. It involves motivations that engage the user on expressing creativity and achievement through mastering of skills, resulting in a higher sense of accomplishments, meaning, and empowerment. While they make us feel powerful, fulfilled and satisfied, they don't attain much urgency (\"I am going to save the world, but I need a coffee first”).\n\nBlack hat core drives are located at the bottom of the Octalysis chart. Black Hat core drives make us feel obsessed, anxious and addicted. If you are always doing something because you don't know what will happen next, you are constantly in fear of losing something, or because you're struggling to attain things you can't have, the experience will often leave a bad taste in your mouth- even if you are consistently motivated to take these actions.\n\nThe white hat core drives are represented by the core drives at the top of the Octalysis diagram:\n\nThe black hat core drives are represented by the core drives at the Bottom of the Octalysis diagram:\n\nUsing the Octalysis framework, Magnum created a digital online game that resembles the Super Mario game. After playing the game, the player is returned to Magnum’s main site.\n\nmHealth has developed applications based on the Octalysis framework to assist people in self-care management and self-stress management. They are using framework to map how top rated stress management apps address the right brain drives and to provide motivation to increase adherence.\n\nSeveral companies have used or been inspired by the Octalysis Framework, including Accenture, LEGO and Trade Samurai. \n\n"}
{"id": "6357454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6357454", "title": "One-to-one computing", "text": "One-to-one computing\n\nIn the context of education, one-to-one computing (sometimes abbreviated as \"1:1\") refers to academic institutions, such as schools or colleges, that allow each enrolled student to use an electronic device in order to access the Internet, digital course materials, and digital textbooks. The concept has been actively explored and sporadically implemented since the late 1990s. One-to-one computing used to be contrasted with a policy of \"bring your own device\" (BYOD), which encourages or requires students to use their own laptops, smartphones or other electronic devices in class. The distinction between BYOD and school-issued devices became blurred when many schools started recommending devices for parents to buy (examples for both iPads and Chromebooks being used 1:1 in schools, but being paid for by parents exist, there may be similar evidence for other devices). The term 1:1 computing in education is now redefined to a situation where students have access to a device per individual that is used in the teaching as a tool for learning. \nHistorically, the programs have centered around the following devices:\nThe level of education will influence the type of adoption, through factors such as: user-readiness, budget, expected merits, and cost-benefits.\n\nThere seems to be consensus that 1:1 availability of devices improves their usefulness. Having to share devices reduces their educational efficacy because of the reduced intensity & length of the experience and the additional time spent on file-management, configuration management, device management and distribution.\n\nBefore cloud-computing the main benefits referred to access to devices. As cloud-computing progressed collaboration, cost reduction, going paperless, 21st century skills became more of a focus. Red research included 1:1 and collaboration in its key research findings.\nOne-to-one computing offers the benefits of equal access, standardization, easy upgrades, simple networking and the ability to monitor student progress and online behavior. For these reasons, one-to-one computing is a major part of education policy in many countries. These benefits also underlie the one-to-one model of One Laptop per Child (OLPC), a charity that aims to issue electronic devices to millions of children in the developing world. With the growth of the internet-connectivity the possibility to use cloud-computing to transfer the data and administration from the devices to cloud-computing has removed the necessity of much of the tech support from the teacher.\n\nThe ultimate academic benefits of one-to-one, if any, are unclear. They may not be the same for the different eras of 1:1.\n\nIn the Laptop Era the laptops were often used as add-ons to the established teaching. Their limited use reinforced the doubts about their educational value and whether the high maintenance costs were worth the investment. According to research published by Boston College, the educational value of 1:1 in the laptop era depended on the classroom teacher. Some schools have even phased out their one-to-one programs because there was no evidence of academic gains according to the 2007 article. (Though: Please note that the district noted in the article went for a 1:1 Chromebook initiative in April 2017 )\n\nOther studies have shown some progress in specific subjects, especially in writing scores, that are correlated with the use of school-issued laptops. The wide range of results for 1:1 programs means there is no consensus on their benefits or drawbacks.\n\nThe iPad Era saw increased uptake of iPads (and comparable tablets) in schools and consequently increased 1:1 programs in schools. More and more education specific applications and tools became available as increasing research about educational value and implementation methodologies of 1:1 programs were published.\n\nThe popularity was based on their touchscreens, good battery life and the availability of applications as well as their general brand-related image and comparative ease of use compared to Laptops/Desktops. \n\nThe Chromebook era had several major success-factors (several of which were often also used in iPad 1:1 schools). \nBecause 1:1 computing programs may have many goals, from improving educational outcomes to increasing equality, and are associated with such a wide range of teaching methods, it is also difficult to judge their overall success or value. One notable benefit that has been documented and researched is the potential for 1:1 computing initiatives to support the use of open educational resources (OER), available in digital form, for ubiquitous access by learners. \n\nDisadvantages of 1:1 are controversial, but there are general objections at increasing \"screen-time\" when the private lives of children also see significant screen-time. There may be psychological and / or physical disadvantages as there are with any technology, including the ones replaced (paper, paint, carrying more books).\n\nAddiction may be a problem (possibly more with touch-devices). There can also be objection against possible effect of exposure to radiation from the screens and WiFi. As stated under advantages there is no general consensus on the scientific evidence on efficacy. In a field as new as 1:1 with the technology used having undergone major changes it may take time for clear patterns to emerge and be agreed on.\n\nThe cost itself may be a disadvantage. Schools and districts in areas with low incomes and high rates of homelessness have argued that Chromebook programs compare positively to paper for homework return-rates.\n\nOne-to-one requires substantial institutional investment. In addition to the cost of purchasing devices, the Cost-of-Ownership is not insignificant and can include connectivity/WiFi, charging-facilities/caddys, implementation, training, software licensing, monitoring, security, upgrades and maintenance. Therefore, the overall cost–benefit ratio of a one-to-one model is not clear.\nAside from the technical costs the changing of the teaching itself is labour-intensive and may require professional development, licensing, re-writing materials, re-designing lesson plans. \nSeveral methodologies exist to make sure all stakeholders are involved and the adoption/implementation is done responsibly. \nOne example can be found at The Natpicks Schools 1:1 Program which has the \"Red\" Logo indicating it is a Project Red Signature District indicating they followed the Red methodology, as well as an Apple Distinguished District logo (competitors like Google and Microsoft have their own recognition programs). If one looks at the documents they increased their numbers of Chromebooks and have mature planning processes including cooperation with Boston College research.\n\nAs the cost of internet services and data charges fall WIFI speeds and accessibility has increased to the point that it is no longer a limiting factor for users of Chromebooks and other devices used for education.\n\nThe USA based Chromebook programs may have shown changes in the economics of 1:1 programs. Although 1:1 programs require better WiFi than previous programs, they use ChromeOS which automatically updates and patches in the background (lowering the maintenance costs). The purchasing prices of Chromebooks were substantially lower than competing devices. According to IDC research the maintenance costs were significantly lower. Since the batteries of Chromebooks easily last a full day, schools experimented with having students charge them at home and only keeping a replacement stock ready in school (for defective, forgotten and out-of-charge Chromebooks) reducing the need for charging equipment/trolleys. GAM (Google Accounts Management) did charge for licensing, but it could remove the necessity of other MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions and other security solutions at lower than Web-authentication level. Some schools also experimented with parents owning the devices (and paying for them). Having less costly equipment on site may also have saved in insurance and rooms may have become available for other purposes. 1:1 also enabled going paperless (i.e. publishers supplied cheaper digital versions of teaching materials) and reducing the cost on paper/printers used. No serious study is known of this, at this point. But individual schools have published costs and savings. The use of Google-Classroom software and G suite in general was instrumental in going paperless. It allowed electronic hand-in, grading and returning of projects to groups of students. Microsoft is trying to copy the classroom functionality in their O365 for education.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2016 Project Ceibal was the most successful 1:1 program in the world. It included the right to internet connectivity in school as well as at home besides the right to have a computer \"Since its implementation, every child who enters the public education system in any part of the country is given a computer for personal use with free Internet connection at school. In addition, Plan Ceibal provides programs, educational resources and teacher training courses that transform the ways of teaching and learning.\". The 2007 decree specified in it desired outcomes \"1.2.3. EXPECTED RESULTS: Have covered 100% of children of school age within a period of 3 years with an Internet connection in their Schools as in their homes.\" By 2009 all 300.000 students were equipped with hardware and all schools had WiFi. By 2013 use of Google-drive and apps were added to CREA and By 2015 95% of urban schools had fibre-optic connections. By 2016 Chromebooks were added to the available hardware. Since the original hardware was Fedora based Uruguay has held the top-spot of Linux uptake for years, according to statcounter.\n\n1:1 Programs in US schools have gained serious momentum somewhere around 2016/2017. In February 2017 edtechmagazine reported more than 50% of teachers reported using 1:1 computing. In March 2017 Futuresource reported Chromebooks had 58% market-share in US-Education. The success of Chromebooks in education was reported on by \"The New York Times\" in May 2017. Which explains the success \"This became Google’s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools, holding up early adopters as forward thinkers among their peers.\"\n\nIn June 2017 CMS-district was reported to be on a 150.000 Chromebooks 1:1 program.\nIt looks like 1:1 Chromebook programs have come become very popular on the basis of adoption and evangelizing by enthusiastic users in schools. The suburbs of Chicago are most often mentioned as influencers. Leyden in District 212 has on its main page Dr. Nick Polyak saying \"Over 2,000 educators from across the country have visited Leyden to learn about teaching and learning in the digital age.\" which clearly refers to its 1:1 program. The history of Leyden's 1:1 program is clearly told in the 2014 article \"How many administrators does it take to get a district to go one to one\". So there is evidence that successful schools indeed show others the way.\n\nThe original legitimization for 1:1 education may have been derived from research by the Red group (mainly financed by Intel) whose findings describe the potential of transforming education \"Our findings demonstrate that schools employing a 1:1 student-computer ratio and key implementation factors outperform other schools, and reveal significant opportunities for improving education return on investment (ROI) by transforming teaching and learning.\". The influence of the change in teaching is also stressed academically like in \"Chromebooks and the G Suite group of products, like Google Search, Gmail, and Google Docs, have rapidly expanded in American schools during the past 5 years. The impact of one-to-one Chromebook devices and the pervasive use of Google's software products in American education cannot be overstated.\"\nApple is also promoting its own 1:1 iPad programs and there are some signs of uptake of its \"classroom\" software and iPads for example in San Bernardino.\nOther countries where 1:1 programs are successful are Sweden, New Zealand (both mentioned in the NYTimes article mentioned above).\n\nNewberg Oregon: \"Newberg Public Schools is a 1:1 Technology district, meaning every student is assigned their own device (iPad or Chromebook). \"\n\nSioux Falls: \"The driving purpose of the 1:1 Student Technology Initiative is to increase student engagement, further involve students in active learning, and provide students with 21st Century skills such as communication, problem solving, and collaboration, along with content expertise.\"\n\nPassaic: Early adopter: \" the Passaic City Public Schools rolled out a 1:1 pilot at the Lincoln Middle school and Passaic High school. The district purchased 5,500 Samsung Chromebooks for 4,700 students and began sweeping, district-wide technology upgrades \"\n\nIowa City Schools: \"1:1 INITIATIVE COMING IN 2017, 2018 In Fall, 2017, the Iowa City Schools will be deploying a Chromebook 1:1 initiative in all high school grade levels (9th – 12th).

{"id": "3603144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3603144", "title": "Otakar Vávra", "text": "Otakar Vávra\n\nOtakar Vávra (28 February 1911 – 15 September 2011) was a Czech film director, screenwriter and pedagogue. He was born in Hradec Králové, Austria-Hungary, now part of the Czech Republic.\n\nVávra attended universities in Brno and Prague, where he studied architecture. During 1929–30, while still a student, he participated in the making of a handful of documentaries and wrote movie scripts. In 1931, he produced the experimental film \"Světlo proniká tmou\". The first movie he directed was 1937's \"Filosofská historie\", film based on a novel by Alois Jirásek.\n\nHis first feature film was 1938's \"Cech panen Kutnohorských\" (engl.: \"The Merry Wives\"), starring Zdeněk Štěpánek, Adina Mandlová and Zorka Janů. The film was praised by American critics for \"first-rate direction, a salty yarn and elaborate production effort\", even though it had undergone certain cuts because it was considered too \"ribald\" by American censors. Janů also played in Vávra's films \"Podvod s Rubensem\" and \"Pacientka Dr. Hegela\", both from 1940. Sister of Janů, Czech actress Lída Baarová starred in Vávra's films \"Panenství\" (1937), \"Maskovaná milenka\" (1939), \"Dívka v modrém\" (1939), and \"Turbína\" (1941).\n\nAfter the Communists seized power in 1948, Vávra adapted quickly to the new political climate and produced films praising the current regime and supporting the new, official interpretation of the past.\n\nIn the 1950s he produced the \"Hussite Trilogy\", one of his most famous works, consisting of \"Jan Hus\" (1954), \"Jan Žižka\" (1955) and \"Proti všem\" (\"Against All Odds\", 1957).\n\nWhen the government became more liberal in the 1960s, Vávra's cinema entered into his most prolific period, producing \"Zlatá reneta\" (1965), \"Romance pro křídlovku\" (1966), \"Kladivo na čarodějnice\" (1969), and later \"Komediant\" (1984). His 1967 film \"Romance for Bugle\" was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Silver Prize. \n\nIn the 1970's Vávra produced his \"War Trilogy\" consisting of semi-documentary movies \"Dny zrady\", \"Sokolovo\" and \"Osvobození Prahy\", all being heavily influenced by communist propaganda. The film \"Dny zrady\" (\"Days of Betrayal\", 1973) was entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Diploma. In 1979 he was a member of the jury at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nWhen the Communists fell from power in 1989, state subsidies for the film industry were dropped and Vávra's plans for an historical epic titled \"Evropa tančila valčík\" had to be scaled down.\n\nIn the 1950s, Otakar Vávra, together with a group of fellow Czech film directors, established the Film Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (Filmová Akademia muzických umění or FAMU), where he taught for over five decades. Among his students were several directors of the 1960s \"Czech New Wave\" of art films, including future Oscar-winner Miloš Forman (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Amadeus\").\n\nOtakar Vávra's decades-long career as a film director, from the 1930s through the 1990s, epitomized the tradition of middle-European filmmaking. This tradition ended in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II and ended in the Czech Republic after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Around that time, Vávra began his autobiography \"Podivný život režiséra\" (\"Strange Life of a Movie Director\"), which concluded with \"...and now I wait for the end. My end.\"\n\nOtakar Vávra is often called the \"father of Czech cinema\". In 2001, he was awarded the \"Czech Lion\" (\"Český lev\") for his lifelong contribution to Czech culture. In 2004, he received the presidential \"Medal of Merit\" (\"Medaile za zásluhy\").\n\nVávra's critics point to his willingness to accommodate the Communist regime. In a 2003 article (\"Playing the Villain\", \"The Globe and Mail\", May 15, 2003) about his documentary film, \"Hitler and I\" that he shot in Prague, David Cherniack described the following encounter with his former FAMU Head Professor:\n\nVávra's \"Krakatit\" (1948) is based on Karel Čapek's 1924 novel of the same name and contains a strong anti-war message. It centers around an inventor of explosives who tries to keep his invention hidden from those who want to use it to rule the world. The black-and-white original was followed by a 1980 color remake, \"Temné slunce\", which brings the storyline into the modern era. The later version is generally seen as one of Vávra's lesser efforts.\n\nOtakar Vávra's most acclaimed work is widely considered to be \"Romance pro křídlovku\" (1966). This black-and-white film is based on a poem by Czech lyrical poet František Hrubín and concerns an ill-fated summer romance between two young lovers of different backgrounds.\n\n"}
{"id": "269865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=269865", "title": "Outward Bound", "text": "Outward Bound\n\nOutward Bound (OB) is an international network of outdoor education schools that was founded in the United Kingdom by Kurt Hahn and Lawrence Holt in 1941. Today there are schools in 33 countries which are attended by more than 250,000 people each year. Outward Bound International is a non-profit membership and licensing organisation for the international network of Outward Bound schools. The Outward Bound Trust is an educational charity established in 1946 to operate the schools in the United Kingdom. Separate organizations operate the schools in each of the other countries in which Outward Bound operates.\n\nOutward Bound helped to shape the U.S. Peace Corps and numerous other outdoor adventure programs. Its aim is to foster the personal growth and social skills of participants by using challenging expeditions in the outdoors.\n\nThe first Outward Bound school was opened in Aberdovey, Wales in 1941 by Kurt Hahn and Lawrence Holt with the support of the Blue Funnel Line. Outward Bound grew out of Hahn's work in the development of the Gordonstoun school and what is now known as the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Outward Bound's founding mission was to improve the survival chances of young seamen after their ships were torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic.\n\nJames Martin Hogan served as warden for the first year of the school. This mission was established and then expanded by Capt. J. F. 'Freddy' Fuller who took over the leadership of the Aberdovey school in 1942 and served the Outward Bound movement as senior warden until 1971. Fuller had been seconded from the Blue Funnel Line following wartime experience during the Battle of the Atlantic of surviving two successive torpedo attacks and commanding an open lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for thirty-five days without losing a single member of the crew. \n\nAn educational charity, named The Outward Bound Trust, was established in 1946 to operate the school. A second school followed in England at Eskdale Green in 1950. The first Outward Bound program for females was conducted in 1951. During the next decade, several other schools opened around the United Kingdom. Outward Bound Australia was founded in 1956. A school in Lumut, Malaysia was opened in 1958. The first Outward Bound USA course was run in 1961 for the Peace Corps, which it helped to shape. Outward Bound New Zealand was founded in 1962 and Outward Bound Singapore was established in 1967. \n\nFrom the inception of Outward Bound, community service was an integral part of the program, especially in the areas of sea and mountain rescues and this remains an important part of the training for both staff and students. During the period 1941 to 1965 in the United Kingdom, the philosophy of the schools evolved from ‘character‐training’ to ‘personal growth’ and ‘self‐discovery’.\n\nOutward Bound International was founded in 2004 to license the use of the brand name 'Outward Bound' and to provide support for the international network of schools.\n\nThe name Outward Bound derives from a nautical expression that refers to the moment a ship leaves the harbor. This is signified by Outward Bound's use of the nautical flag, the Blue Peter (a white square inside a blue square). JF Fuller adapted the Outward Bound motto, \"To Serve, To Strive and not To Yield,\" from the poem \"Ulysses\" by Alfred Lord Tennyson:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">... Come, my friends.\nTis not too late to seek a newer world.\nThough much is taken, much abides; and though\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are --\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</poem>\n\nSince its founding in the middle of the last century, Outward Bound has encouraged individuals to test their physical and emotional limits in challenging outdoor adventure programs. The experiences are a means of building inner strength and a heightened awareness of human interdependence. Outward Bound operates more than 30 schools in various countries and reports serving over 250,000 students each year. The Compass Rose serves as the logo for almost all the schools around the world.\n\nOutward Bound courses follow a kind of recipe or formula, termed the \"Outward Bound Process Model\" which is well described by Walsh and Golins (1976) as:\n\n\nIn a typical class, participants are divided into small patrols (or groups) under the guidance of one or more instructors. The first few days, often at a base camp, are spent training for the outdoor education activities that the course will contain and in the philosophy of Outward Bound. After initial confidence-building challenges, the group heads off on an expedition. As the group develops the capacity to do so, the instructors ask the group to make its own decisions.\n\n\n"}

The term \"breakfast club\" is commonly used to describe such facilities in the United Kingdom.\n\nBreakfast clubs generally enhance both academic performance and behavior, especially for children whose parents might not otherwise be able to afford to provide them with regular meals. Breakfast provision is however less prevalent compared with school lunch, both in the UK and worldwide. As of 2013, only about half the school children in the UK have access to a breakfast club.\n\nAttendance of a breakfast club is not mandatory; many parents prefer to feed their children at home. The clubs are often run by schools, but can also be community run. Schools themselves are the most common location for breakfast clubs, but they can also be found in churches, community halls or even commercial premises. Breakfast clubs are sometimes open to children from more than one school.\n\nThe earliest known modern advocate for school dinners was Count Rumford in the late 18th century. School dinners became more widely available in the 19th and 20th century, though generally only lunch was provided. This began to change after the introduction of the Oslo breakfast in 1932, an uncooked meal of nutritional ingredients. Between the wars the \"Oslo breakfast\" became famous worldwide; claims were widely reported that it helped children fed on it grow several inches taller than they would otherwise. Similar initiatives were launched in several countries across the world. In the United States, a major step forward in the provision of breakfast for schoolchildren was the 1966 launch of the School Breakfast Program.\n\nIn the UK, breakfast clubs were introduced in the 1990s, driven not just by concern for children's nutrition but by parental demand for a supervised place to leave their children in the early morning. Changes in gender roles and more demanding workplaces meant an increasing number of women were no longer able to look after their children until the start of school. By 1999 there were over 700 breakfast clubs operating in the UK. After the lasting global inflation in the price of food that began in late 2006, there were increased efforts to set up new breakfast clubs, in part due to greater awareness of children who arrived at school suffering from hunger, a condition that reduced their ability to concentrate and sometimes led to disruptive behavior. A 2011 report by Kellogg's found that the number of breakfast clubs had increased to over 20,000, though also that several thousand had or were at risk of closure due to lack of funds.\nThe Conservative's 2017 election manifesto had included a promise to provide free school breakfasts to all primary school children, though by 2018 this had been abandoned. Yet a commitment remains for the government to provide £26 million extra funding for new and existing breakfast clubs. \n\nThere is no standard model for a breakfast club. Some are run by and physically located in schools. Others are run by community groups, businesses or churches, or by a combination of such actors working in partnership. Some clubs make a small charge for breakfast, providing them free only to those who qualify for free school meals. Other clubs provide free breakfasts for all children, to avoid those from poor families suffering from stigmatization. Guidance, funding and general support for running breakfast clubs in the UK is available from a number of sources, including from County Councils, the charity \"Magic Breakfast\", and the food companies Greggs and \"Kellog's\". Breakfast clubs typically stay open for between 45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, and close before the children's first morning lesson. Sometimes the clubs are staffed by volunteers, though sometimes there are paid caterers, and clubs in schools can be supervised by teachers or support staff.\n\nBreakfast clubs can be especially valuable for children whose parents are not able to afford to provide them with regular morning meals. They can provide both short- and long-term health benefits. Children who receive breakfast often perform better at learning, and can also be better behaved. Breakfast clubs can also improve the child's long-term health by providing a well balanced nutritious meal. Secondary benefits of breakfast clubs include improving attendance, helping to prevent disadvantaged children from experiencing social isolation, and helping with children who would otherwise not have adult supervision in the first hour or so before school. A significant majority of teachers hold the view that school breakfast clubs are beneficial in achieving educational goals.. For example, in a 2013 survey of 552 teachers, 387 (71%) said they believed breakfast clubs have a positive effect on pupil's concentration, but four teachers (0.7%) said it had a negative impact. Questioned about the impact on behavior, 325 (60.2%) were positive, while 11 (2%) said breakfast clubs have a negative effect. \n\nVarious studies in both the U.S and Europe, some dating back to the 20th century, found that breakfast provision at schools boost pupil's educational attainment. Older studies have been criticised for their methodology however. Some studies also found evidence of negative behaviour effects, and even that in certain circumstances a majority of children were unhappy with breakfast clubs: when either there was insufficient care given to ensure the clubs were stimulating enough to avoid boredom, or when access had been restricted just to poorer children, which could leave participants feeling picked on.\n\nA 2016 report, funded by the Education Endowment Foundation and the Department for Education, based on research by the National Children's Bureau and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, found that free school breakfast clubs can boost children's educational attainment by as much as two months. The study found the benefits arose not just from the eating of a nutritious breakfast, but from also from attending the club itself. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1886191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886191", "title": "Specialist degree", "text": "Specialist degree\n\nThe specialist degree is an academic degree conferred by a college or university. The degree is formatted differently worldwide and may be either a five year program or a doctoral level graduate program that occurs after a master's degree but before a doctoral degree.\n\nThe Specialist diploma () is a five-year higher-education diploma that was the only first higher-education diploma in the former Soviet Union (the Candidate of Sciences was the first graduate degree while the Doctor of Sciences was the highest academic credential) and continues to be offered throughout the USSR successor states in parallel with the new bachelor’s degree. In terms of the number of instructional hours it is typically, 35 to 42 classroom hours per week, 34 weeks of instruction plus 6 weeks of exams per academic year. Commonly referred to simply as \"Diplom\", the Soviet/Russian-style Specialist diploma is believed to have originated in the engineering education in the Russian Empire.\n\nIn the early 1990s the \"bakalavr\" and \"magistr\" were introduced in all countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States except Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. However, the specialist diploma (five years) is still conferred in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Tajikistan. The specialist diploma was discontinued in Ukraine in 2017.\n\nUnder Commonwealth of Independent States' education law, the specialist diploma requires a minimum of five years of study.\n\nBelow are some examples of specialist \"degrees\" in the CIS:\n\nIn the United States, the Specialist's degree is hierarchically above the Master's degree and below the Doctorate. It was invented by colleges and schools of education as an alternative to obtaining a doctorate, and focused on subjects pertinent to K-12 education - such as leadership and counseling, and educational psychology.\n\nDegrees commonly available include:\n\nThe American Specialist degree typically requires 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours beyond the Master's degree (60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours beyond the Baccalaureate) and can be completed in one to three academic years of continuous full-time or part-time enrolment. Depending on the particular program, practica and / or internship and / or practical field work may be required. Students admitted directly from the baccalaureate may earn a Master's degree in progression toward the Specialist's degree; or the institution may accept applications only from students who already hold a Master's degree.\n\nThe coursework for an Ed.S. or Sp.A. in Education program is approximately the same workload as a second Master's in terms of credits. But whereas coursework for the initial Master's degree is from the introductory and lower intermediate levels of graduate study (e.g. Levels 500 and 600 at institutions that use 100 - 900 level course numbering systems), work for the Specialist's degree will be in the intermediate and upper levels (e.g. 600, 700 and 800 level courses). According to the U.S. Department of Education's International Affairs Office's leaflet, entitled, \"Structure of the U.S. Education System: Intermediate Graduate Qualifications,\" (Feb 2008), the Ed.S., as a degree, is equivalent to the D.Min. or Psy.D. / D.Psy. This reflects the degree's origin as an alternate to professional doctorates.\n\nEd.S. programs lead to professional degrees in the application of advanced educational theory but do not typically place an emphasis on conducting original research such as in Ed.D. / D.Ed. or Ph.D. programs.\n\n\"School Psychology\" and \"Curriculum and Instruction\" are two of the most common areas where a specialist degree is found. In the field of school psychology, the degree is typically an Ed.S. or SSP. Despite being virtually identical in scope and function, the Ed.S. and SSP both exist within the field of school psychology because training programs can be offered within the departments of psychology or education. They simply designate the type of program from which the degree originated. As another alternative, some programs within psychology departments have begun offering a Psy.S. degree instead of an SSP.\n\nIn many fields outside of education, the \"postgraduate certificate\" fills the same need as a Specialist degree - but differs in being an academic \"certificate\" rather than an academic \"degree\". Postgraduate or graduate certificates typically require one-third to one-half the coursework of a Master's degree and an offered in a specific topical area, such as a Certificate in Historic Preservation.\n\nCertain graduate programs are \"de facto\" specialist degrees. In the field of Engineering, the Engineer's degree is a post-Master's degree, offered at a modest number of US universities (but including some prestigious ones such as Stanford and Caltech), which is relatively analogous to the Specialist degree. In French higher education, the \"Mastère Spécialisé\" is a degree designed essentially as a post-Master's degree, offered as a full-time, one-year program (although there are \"Executive\" versions of this degree, designed for working professionals, which take a little longer to complete). As such, this French degree also forms a close analogy to its US counterpart, although the \"Mastère Spécialisé\" is offered in a variety of fields such as business, informatics, and aeronautics.\n"}

The university was established as the College of Sharia (Islamic Law) in 1949 before being joined by new colleges and renamed as Umm Al-Qura by royal decree in 1981.\n\nUQU started primarily as an Islamic university offering degrees in Islamic Law and Arabic language studies. It now offers more courses in such diverse subjects as Technology Management, Business Management, Islamic Economics, Marketing, Engineering, Technology, Medicine, Education, Architecture, as well various Applied, Social and Engineering Sciences. In 2015, the UQU annual budget hovered around \"SR 3 billion\" (USD $801,399,900).\n\nIn 1949 King Abdulaziz Al Saud established the College of Sharia (Islamic Law) in Mecca, making it the first higher education institution in the country. It constituted the kernel of Umm Al-Qura University. It was followed by the establishment of the Teachers' College in 1952. This continued until 1959 when the College of Shari'a took the responsibility of teachers' preparation and became the College of Shari'a and Education. In 1962 the College of Education was established as an independent college.\n\nIn 1971 the Colleges of Shari'a and Education became part of King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah and constituted its branch in Mecca. However, The University of Umm Al-Qura was established in 1981 by the royal decree number 39 of 1981 and the colleges of Shari'a and Education were detached from King Abdul Aziz University and joined by new departments to form the new university.\n\nCurrently, it has student exchange programs with Purdue University, Tufts University, and King's College London.\n\nThe medium of instruction in most UQU academic programs is English, with exceptions like College of Sharia, College of Arabic Languages, College of Islamic Economics and Finance, as courses on Islamic studies and Arabic language are taught in Arabic. University offers degrees of Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy. The grading system is the standard 0 to 4.0 scale with classes of:\n\n- The Department of Aqeedah (Creed);\n- The Department of Media (later moved to the College of Social Sciences);\n- The Department of Qera'at (various readings of the Qur'an).\nThe College has four departments:\nDepartment of Da'wa and Usul-ud-Din;\nDepartment of Kitab and Sunna;\nDepartment of Aqidah (Creed);\nDepartment of Qera'at (various readings of the Qur'an).\nThe postgraduate studies in the specializations of the college started since it was supervised by the College of Shari`ah and Islamic Studies, before their separation is effected. In 1420 A.H, the deputy deanship of the College of Da'wa and Usul-ud-Din for postgraduate studies was established as it started to supervise the postgraduate studies in the college.\n\n\n1- The departments of chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics were transferred from the College of Education to the College of Applied and Engineering Sciences, which was established in 1402/1403 AH.\n2- The departments of geography and English language were transferred to the College of Social Sciences, which was established in 1404/1405 AH.\n\n\nDepartment of Geography;\nDepartment of English Language;\nDepartment of Social Work;\nDepartment of Information Science;\nDepartment of Islamic Media; and\nCenter of English Language.\n\n1.

Department of Computer Engineering.\n\nGraduates of these departments are offered the bachelor's degree. All academic programs offered by the College are ABET Accredited. Bachelor's degree Requirements: The bachelor's degree normally takes five years of full-time study (ten semesters), and each department requires successful fulfilment of a certain number of credit hours as follows:\n1- Department of Mechanical Engineering: (165) credit hours.\n2- Department of Civil Engineering: (165) credit hours.\n3- Department of Electronic Engineering: (160) credit hours.\n4- Department of Islamic Architecture: (169) credit hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll programs in all the engineering-related colleges were evaluated for \"Substantial-Equivalency\" recognition by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). They were found substantially equivalent to similar accredited programs in the USA and elsewhere.\n\nIn May 2014, all Business and Management degree programs offered by the College of Business (CoB) are formally declared Eligible for Accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The CoB is an academic member of AACSB International and EFMD Global.\n\nAs of Sept. 2015, all Medical, Dentistry, Nursing, and Pharmacy related academic programs are globally accredited by accrediting bodies in North America and/or European Union.\n\nIn addition to these global accreditations, all UQU academic programs are formally declared Eligible for Accreditation by the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment (NCAAA) of Saudi Arabia. These programs are in advanced stages of getting full accreditation by NCAAA.\n"}
